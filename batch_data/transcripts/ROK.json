Crandall - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President Analysts : Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities Jeffrey Sprague- Vertical Research Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley Operator : Thank you for holding, and welcome to Rockwell Automation's Quarterly Conference Call. I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)  At this time I would like to turn the call over to CFO, Ted Crandall. Please proceed, sir. Theodore D. Crandall: Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2014 earnings release conference call. I am filling in for Rondi today who unfortunately is a bit under the weather and unable to join us. Keith Nosbusch, our Chairman and CEO is here with me this morning.  Our agenda includes opening remarks by Keith that will include highlights of the company's performance in the first quarter and outlook for the full year. Then I will provide more detail on both of those and we\u2019ll take questions at the end of my remarks.  Our results were released this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website at www.rockwellautomation.com. Please note that both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is accessible at that website and will be available for replay for the next 30 days. Before we get started I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. And with that I will turn it over to Keith. Keith D. Nosbusch: Thanks, Ted and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call today. I hope everyone is enjoying winter. I know we\u2019re all having fun with the snow and a bit of cold here in the Midwest.  I will start with the highlights for the quarter, so please turn to Page four in the slide deck. We had a very good start to the year with 7% organic sales growth in the quarter. I will start with some color on the region and verticals. The U.S. led the way with 10% growth. Oil and gas and food and beverage were the strongest industries in the U.S. Canada sales were basically flat with mixed performance across the verticals. And EMEA enjoyed some momentum with 5% growth as they continue to find opportunities to grow and outperform the market. It was great to see Asia return to growth led by China. Latin America, our best growth region all of last year was a little soft due to difficult business climates in Argentina and Venezuela and weakness in mining across the region. However Brazil and Mexico continue to perform well as both grew double-digit.  Overall the picture for verticals is similar to what we said last quarter. Oil and gas and food and beverage were the strongest, automotive was pretty flat and mining and metals were the weakest. Here are a couple of other sales related metrics that I know you are always interested in. Process grew 8% in the quarter with the U.S leading the way. We are now including vMonitor in our numbers, so our full year growth expectation is closer to 10%.  Logix grew 6% in the quarter, the same as architecture and software as a whole. The Motion Control business within A&S experienced very strong growth reflecting continued success with OEM customers. We closed on two important acquisitions recently. vMonitor which brings wireless solutions for monitoring and controlling well head and upstream oil and gas applications; and Jacobs Automation which is a leader in intelligent track motion control technology for OEM machine builders. Both of these acquisitions bring intellectual capital and differentiated technology and we are excited to have them as part of our company.  So to finish with this slide. Profitability was very strong in the quarter with adjusted earnings per share growth of 20%. I'll let Ted provide more details of our earnings in his remarks.  I guess I want to mention one more thing before I leave the quarter. Control Magazine an industry leading publication exclusively dedicated to the global process automation market recently issued the results of this year\u2019s readers\u2019 choice survey. We had another very strong showing with 41 wins in control industry and product categories, the most of any process company. Of the six controlled discipline awards we won three with no other company winning more than one. This again reinforces the power of our differentiated multi-discipline logics control platform.  In the industry awards we won 28 out of 53, the second place supplier won only 14. These results along with the diversity of applications we continue to win, reflect the breadth of our capabilities and domain expertise in process. We continue to gain ground as a leading DCS supplier.  So let me give you our thoughts about fiscal 2014. From a macroeconomic perspective forecasts for GDP and industrial production are similar to what they were a quarter ago and call for increased growth as we proceed through the fiscal year. Global PMI has improved somewhat. And while most of our customers have not yet declared their CapEx plans our front log of opportunities is solid.  Given this macro perspective and our results for the first quarter we are raising the lower end of our guidance. We now expect fiscal 2014 organic sales growth of 3% to 6% and adjusted EPS guidance of $6 to $6.35. Ted will provide more details about sales and earnings guidance in his remarks.  Before I close I'd like to thank those of you who came to Houston to attend Automation Fair and our Investor Conference. We introduced integrated control and information which expands our served market and enables our customers realize their vision of a connected enterprise. We are confident that integrated control and information deepens our focus on innovation and domain expertise which enables us to provide attractive returns for our shareholders.  So to wrap it up, Q1 was a strong start to the year. We are executing very well across the globe and I want to thank our employees, suppliers and partners for their dedication and expertise in continually expanding the value we provide to our customers.  With that I'll turn it over to Ted. Theodore D. Crandall:  Thanks, Keith, good morning, everybody. My remarks will start with page five with our first quarter result summary. This was a good quarter with very healthy top line growth and strong earnings conversion.  Revenue in the quarter was $1.592 billion, that's up 7% compared to compared to the first quarter of last year. The net impact of currency fluctuations and acquisitions was negligible. So organic growth was also 7%. Segment operating earnings were $328 million, up 19% compared to $276 million in Q1 last year. General corporate net expense was $21.7 million compared to $18.5 million in Q1 last year. That's pretty close to the expected full year run rate. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 27.8%. That compares to an adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 last year of 26.6%.  Adjusted earnings per share was $1.47, up 20% compared to $1.23 a year ago. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 140.4 million. During the quarter we repurchased approximately 1 million shares at a cost of about $111 million. And at the end of Q1 there was $424 million remaining under our $1 million share repurchase authorization.  Moving to page six, this is the graphical version of total company results for the first quarter. As I noted on the prior slide the year-over-year increase in sales for Q1 was 7%, sales declined 7% sequentially, a pretty normal result for Q1. On the right side of the chart you can see the year-over-year increase in operating earnings. Operating margin in Q1 was 20.6% that\u2019s a 2.1 point increase compared to Q1 last year and primarily reflects volume leverage on the 7% organic sales growth and just a modest increase in spending year-over-year. It\u2019s not unusual for increases in our spending to start off a bit slower in the beginning of the year and we expect spend to increase as we proceed through the balance of the year.  Q1 operating earnings included $6 million of income related to a legal settlement in our Architecture and Software segment. This settlement increased operating margin in the quarter by four-tenths of a point. This was a follow on to the legal settlement income we talked about last quarter and we believe this is the final income we will recognize related to this matter. It's not displayed on the chart but our trailing fourth quarter return on invested capital was 31.4%.  Now let's turn to page seven which summarizes the Q1 results of the Architecture and Software segment. Looking at the left side of this chart sales increase 6% year-over-year, organic growth was also 6%. Sales decreased 3% sequentially. Operating margin for the quarter was 30.4%, up 2.5 points compared to Q1 last year. The A&S margin benefited from higher sales as-well-as the aforementioned legal settlement. For the segment the legal settlement increased operating margin by nine-tenths of a point.  The next page covers our Controlled Products and Solutions segment. Sales in the quarter were up 8% compared to last year. Currency effects reduced sales in this segment by one point. So organization growth was 9%. The Solutions and Services portion of this segment grew by 10% and the product portion by 7%. Sales declined 11% sequentially with products down 2% sequentially and solutions and services down 16%.  Book-to-bill for solutions and services was 1.1. We were pleased to see that above 1 but that's a little lower than normal for our first quarter. We did have a relatively strong growth in solutions and services sales but even with that we would have liked to have seen the book-to-bill more in the range of 1.15 to 1.2.  Operating margin in Controlled Products and Solutions was 13% compared to 11.2% in Q1 last year, that's up 1.8 points.  Turning to the next page, this provides a geographic breakdown of our sales in the quarter and Keith covered a lot of in his comments. I'll focus just a few comments on the far right column which displays organic growth. First I would reinforce a very strong performance in the U.S. with 10% growth.  As Keith mentioned it was another strong performance in EMEA with sales up 5%. Growth was stronger in emerging markets in EMEA and it was another good quarter for growth with OEM customers.  Asia Pacific was up 7% year-over-year also with strong results in emerging markets. China was up 21% and India returned to growth up to 13%, in both cases admittedly off easy comparisons.  In Latin America growth was 3%. As Keith mentioned we continued to see strength in Mexico and Brazil, both with double-digit growth in the quarter. But we experienced sales declines in the Andean region primarily related to mining. We had a large mining project that hit in Q1 last year so a difficult comparison. And sales declined year-over-year in Argentina due to import restrictions.  In Canada sales were down slightly compared to Q1 last year with growth in automotive and consumer more than offset by declines in mining and other heavy industries.  I'll turn now to page 10 the free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $179 million. That represents about 86% conversion on adjusted income. That's also a good start to the year.  Turning to the final slide, page 11 summarizes our current outlook for fiscal '14. As Keith mentioned we've increased the lower end of our sales and EPS guidance range. We continue to expect sales to be approximately $6.6 billion. We now expect organic growth to be between 3% and 6% compared to the previous range of 2% to 6%. At the low end and mid-point of sales guidance we now expect slightly higher organic sales partially offset by increased currency headwinds.  We believe that currency and acquisitions were about to offset for the full year but that net amount has gone from slightly positive in our previous guidance to now slightly negative. We continue to expect segment operating margins to be about 20%. The new adjusted EPS guidance range is $6 to $6.35. We now expect the full year adjusted tax rate to be between 26% to 27%. That's up from our previous guidance of 26%.  The new adjusted EPS guidance range reflects the benefit of our somewhat higher organic sales, offset by unfavorable currency effects, slightly higher incentive compensation expense and a little higher tax rate. We don't provide quarterly guidance but as it relates to the second quarter and particularly as it relates to margins I would remind you that our annual merit increases kick in on January 1st and we do expect to ramp investment spending. We also will not have a reoccurrence of legal settlement income, so we don't expect operating margin in Q2 to be as high as it was in Q1.  Last week there were significant currency movements, primarily in some emerging markets. The changes in those rates are not included in our new guidance and if those rates remain at current levels through the balance of the year that would create some additional currency headwind for us.  We continue to expect free-cash flow conversion to be about 100% of adjusted income subject primarily to acquisition opportunities we still expect to spend about $440 million on repurchases this year. However we're now projecting that full year average shares outstanding will be about 140 million. That's up less than 1 million shares from what we expected in November and due to a higher share price.  And finally we still expect general corporate net expense to be about $85 million for the full year. And with that I think we can move to Q&A. As we do so I would like to ask you that you limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up so that we can try to get to as many of you as possible today. Operator we can move to first question. Operator : Thank you sir. Our first question comes from Richard Eastman, Robert W. Baird. Please proceed. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yes, good morning. Just a question on the book-to-bill, you basically did flag the fact that it was maybe a little bit softer than you expected, still comfortably north of one. But I am curious if you can pinpoint any industries or perhaps geographies that you know maybe led just slightly less seasonal uptick and a book to bill. Theodore D. Crandall: Yeah Rick I think where we saw a little bit weaker was primarily in our motor control businesses and we think probably more than any other industry a slowdown in mining is responsible for that. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.:  Okay and then also just quick follow-up, the tone in the auto or transportation side of the business? Keith D. Nosbusch: With the automotives we would say that it\u2019s basically hit out flat but remember this is at a very high level of investment. And I think we are starting to see mixed results with obviously Europe a little lower, as Ted mentioned automotive was strong in Canada and auto will remain strong in Latin America and it will probably flatten in the U.S. and remain flat in the U.S. and Asia is how we see the automotive at this point in time. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.:  Okay, very good. Thank you. Theodore D. Crandall:  You are welcome Rick. Operator :  Next question, Scott Davis, Barclays. Please proceed. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital :  Good morning Keith and Ted. Theodore D. Crandall:  Good morning Scott. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital :  Couple of things, first I just wanted to get a little bit more color on China and India. I mean China has been a real rollercoaster. Is there any sense of stability there for you and any sense of increased predictability there going forward? Theodore D. Crandall: Okay well let me start with the second part of that. The answer is no, unpredictability. I think you know I think China is going through the natural evolution from high growth to a more stable type of growth and I think they are going to see cyclicality or I should say isolations around that growth trend line. And so I would say we don't believe we\u2019ll have more predictability and we\u2019ll continue to see fluctuations.  We certainly believe now that we\u2019re in a stable point in the China market and with the China economy but as you know they have a number of potential issues that continue to be concerning whether it be the credit availability or the shadow banking or the excess capacity with SOEs in some of the heavy industry. So they continue to work through those areas but I think we are at a stable part and exports appear to be reasonable at this point in time as well as investment in some of their consumer industries which is one of the areas that we\u2019re very focused on and the OEMs continue to perform well in China. Keith D. Nosbusch:  Hey Scott maybe what I would add is in both China and India our sales quarter to quarter tend to be a little more variable because of project content and in the case of India the underlying orders were not as strong as the growth and I don't think we would stay there. We think we have turned the corner yet. And in China our expectations for the full year is still high single digit so we\u2019re not getting overly excited about 21% quarter. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital :  Yeah it makes sense. Guys can we just talk quickly about oil and gas. And you know there is a lot of mixed feedback we\u2019re getting from companies you know, some notable big companies like Shell for example they cut CapEx recently. I mean are you seeing any slowdown in your front-log in that specific vertical? Theodore D. Crandall: No, our front-log has remained pretty stable. I think what we need to be watching for with respect to your comment is are we starting to see projects being slowed pushed out and at this point in time we have been seeing that with the exception of Canada where they\u2019re in the middle of some very large project rollouts and it\u2019s just not the availability to work the next stage of projects at this point. So we see a little bit of a low in the order rate in Canada and certainly that's related to the previous heavy investments that were going into the oil sands. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital : Okay that's very helpful. Thanks guys and good luck. Theodore D. Crandall: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from John Inch, Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank : Good morning everyone. Theodore D. Crandall: Good morning John. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank : Strength in the U.S. Keith and Ted do you have any sense may be if you could just give us a sense of how December played out and do you think there might have been any kind of the U.S. company say I don't want to use the term budget flush because I think that's a little too sensational but I think I've been spending maybe based on confidence just kind of what you are hearing from the channel what you saw in the United States to help drive the 10%? Theodore D. Crandall: Well quite frankly December was very strong for us. And as far as on a year-over-year comparison it was the strongest month in the entire quarter. And quite candidly that's a comment worldwide not just the U.S. But that would lend to believe that there was some, that there was end of the year spending that was going on and I think that was a piece of it. Plus I think it was just the continued belief in an improving the economy and a little more confidence in that, after I would say during the summer timeframe, I think it was a little weaker in that regard. And so the combination of the end of the year and greater confidence probably led to a little higher spending as we exited the calendar year. Keith D. Nosbusch: John that said I would also say though that January has been pretty much what we expected. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank : Right. okay, so that makes economic sense. Some of your industrial peers are perhaps making a little bit more of mountain out of a molehill in terms of this weather issue. You guys see any of this, obviously weather has been pretty austere right, throughout the Midwest, Northeast. Have you seen any sort of an impact with respect to may be your flow goods business or anything that you would perceptively call out that maybe could have offset some of this budget spending? Theodore D. Crandall: No, at this point we have not seen order pattern aberrations based upon a very, either miserable day in the Midwest or East Coast or wherever it\u2019s occurred in different phases. So I think that has been a minimal impact for us and I wouldn't call that any different than what we normally see during let's just say a milder winter. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank : Okay. And then just may be lastly. Keith could you characterize sort of the state of China with respect to competition because clearly you have Japanese competitors that could be perhaps taking advantage of the yen. I think it's clear that China is improving right for lots of automation players which have done exceptionally well and I just want to sort of fixed up a little bit to Scott\u2019s question could you may be comment towards your confidence or the sustainability of improvement maybe north of 20%, given the backup really of what could be some advanced competition from either local players, Japanese players that sort of things. Keith D. Nosbusch: You are absolutely right there is no question China is a place that we see the Japanese competition more than any other region in the world. And they continue to be a very strong competitor. We believe that the portfolio that we have and the focus that we have in particular on OEMs and consumer industries that we're able to compete very effectively.  I would say the other dimension of competitiveness or I should say competition is given that there is a slowing in particular some of the heavy industries, metals and cement in China, that those projects when they do come up are very, very competitive from a project and therefore solutions business.  So I think we're seeing increased competitiveness simply because there is fewer projects in the heavy industries and you know that\u2019s not unusual and we think we can continue to win our fair share of those. But the fact of the matter is there are just not as many and that\u2019s why I made a comment earlier about some of the overcapacity, particularly in the SOE. The one exception to that would be China will continue to invest in oil and gas and they are continuing to invest in offshore projects and they\u2019re just at the start of determining whether or not they can create a shale industry. There\u2019s been recent reports that indicates they have shale reserves greater than the U.S. and the real question is how difficult is it to get to and they don't have the technology but will western technology be able to help them untap that. And I think that\u2019s a wild card down the road but I think that\u2019s the other potential play that we see in China going forward to offset the other heavy industry comments I made. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank : And I am sorry, do you think you are positioned to capture that opportunity in oil and gas in China? Keith D. Nosbusch: I think if we look at what we\u2019re able to do in the U.S. in that space I think we have a good opportunity to compete effectively. Capture, I mean that\u2019s we\u2019ll see how it plays out. I think the bigger question is will China be able to tap that energy resource if they are I believe we will be able to compete effectively for projects just like we have in some of their offshore business and shale opportunities in the U.S. over the last couple of years. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank : Got it. Okay, thank you very much. Keith D. Nosbusch: You are welcome John. Operator :  Our next question is from Rich Kwas, Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities :  Hi good morning everyone. Just a few questions. Can you talk on auto, I know we\u2019re at a high level CapEx and your North American production is growth that we see slowing down but when you look at some of the investments being made by the transplant European base, Asian base transplants in Mexico and in other places, how much benefit do you get from that over the next couple of years? I know you\u2019re mix with the Detroit guys is pretty strong and very strong position there but how do you frame the opportunity with the other manufacturers over the next few years? Keith D. Nosbusch: Yes well Mexico is the place where we will see continued investment to your point. There has been number of plants announced by both Asian and European as well as continued expansion of U.S. so let\u2019s take the Asian transplants. I would say that\u2019s probably the most difficult market for us because many times they work with their same partners they have in Japan and those tend to be the Japanese control manufacturers. So we can win pieces of that business but the heavy investment, particularly via what comes in on some of the OEM lines tend to be more Japanese brand.  With respect to European competitors our toughest challenge there would be with BMW and Audi quite candidly. That will come in with Siemens equipment on but we can certainly compete for portions of the business even there, but also the other European transplants we have a much better opportunity to win those projects, and certainly we also believe with some of our expanding capabilities in power training now that we\u2019re in a better position to compete in that portion of the projects as well. Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities : Okay that\u2019s helpful. So it sounds like Daimler and BMW are potential and you already have a good position there but there is opportunity to grow if they grow there. Keith D. Nosbusch: Yes we do well with them in their transplants in the U.S. So Mexico is not that -- we think we can be consistent with our supporting capabilities in Mexico as we have demonstrated in their U.S. clients already. Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities : Okay, great. And then just two quick ones for Ted on Logix, I think 6% growth this quarter, is the outlook still on that high single digit growth rate for Logix in ' 14? And then the other piece of it is with the incremental being so strong this quarter it seems like the bias for the year that the incrementals are getting close to the 35, rather than 30 is that a fair statement? Theodore D. Crandall: Yes. So first on Logix, we would continue to expect for the full year that Logix would be somewhere above the average for Architecture and Software. So I would say higher single digits. In terms of the margins I think you are right on for the balance of the year. I mean we are not expecting, obviously the 20.6% is above our full year guidance for operating margin. Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities : All right. Okay, great. Thank you. Keith D. Nosbusch: Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Jeff Sprague, Vertical Research. Please proceed. Jeffrey Sprague- Vertical Research : Hi. My first question just goes a little bit just more around that question of incremental margins and kind of investment spending. Can you give us a sense of just order of magnitude there and then what it's point at and can it play a role on the top line in the 2014 or is it more a kind of setting at 2015 and beyond? Theodore D. Crandall: Yeah. So let me start at the back of that. I think clearly the investment spending that we put in place going forward now in the balance of the year will benefit us beyond 2014 and we should not expect to return in 2014. What we spend on is largely R&D and product development related, we have talked about in the past our focus on continuing to expand the Logix capabilities and also continued investment in our Intelligent Motor Control offering. In terms of ramp, I think what you should expect is the rate of growth in spending in the balance of the year is going to exceed our rate of growth in sales in the balance of the year. Keith D. Nosbusch: And I would also just add to that, that we also will have an increase in spending due to the acquisitions that we just recently completed but they would add in the same categories that Ted mentioned but that's another incremental increase from a year-over-year standpoint. Jeffrey Sprague- Vertical Research : Thank you for that. And then just I guess back to kind of the tone of business. Is there any change in kind of the nature of demand that you are seeing, you said there is a little bit of increased confidence to spend money but are we shifting from MRO or smaller projects to kind of greenfield or bigger expansions projects. Is there anything there to kind of spike up? Keith D. Nosbusch: Well that would depend on the region, Jeff. In the U.S., I would say we are not seeing large projects, the majority of the increases and front logs that we see at this time is continued small project and I will say expansion and productivity investments continued as opposed to what I would call greenfield. If you go to Europe certainly the strength that we had in the emerging markets, that is all greenfield with respect to, I will call it, mature Europe, there we are seeing some greenfield investment in oil and gas. It may not be -- it may not end up in Europe, but the engineering and procurement occurs in Europe and a lot of that is offshore activities in oil and gas. And as we see the continuing investments at OEMs in Europe and a lot of that gets exported back into the U.S. and Asia and Latin America and so OEMs right in Europe. And in Latin America we said that mining is down, but oil and gas continues to be strong in Latin America other than Mexico, the vast majority of that is greenfield investment. And in Mexico, a lot of it is just ongoing efforts to commoditize their existing equipment. Canada, I mentioned we did see the slowing in some of the major projects in oil and gas and mining in Canada. And I think that we had a very strong previous year in some of those heavy industry investments. And so there is a natural low before they can go forward. And then Asia certainly we're seeing continued greenfield in the Southeast Asia region and in oil and gas in China. We're not seeing much greenfield in metals. As I mentioned there\u2019s very few projects there same for cement. But we are seeing greenfield in consumer industries particularly food and beverage, significant growth in there and so that would be a picture for you Jeff by region. Jeffrey Sprague- Vertical Research : Thanks, Keith that was good around the world run down actually. Then just finally Ted can you give us a little bit of color and I'll move, the currency do stay where they are at all year along what kind of headwind are you looking at? Theodore D. Crandall: Yeah, so probably the three currencies that will make the most difference for us that were moving last week where Brazil, South Africa and Canada. If all of those stay where they are probably creates about a $20 million top line headwind. Jeffrey Sprague- Vertical Research : Okay. Thank you very much. Theodore D. Crandall: You are welcome. Operator : Next question Julian Mitchell, Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse : Hi, thank you. I just had a question on the December quarter on the operating margins. So I guess you and also your main European competitors both have very good margins in that fiscal Q1, they cited kind of software mix as a big boost. So I just wondered if that was true for you or if that was more just about fixed cost leverage because you had good organic growth? Theodore D. Crandall: Julian I think for us it's primarily about the organic growth and volume leverage. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse : Okay. There was nothing abnormal around mix in the quarter that you would call out? Theodore D. Crandall: No, I wouldn't say anything significant around mix. I mean obviously the margins are benefiting from that legal settlement that we talked about. Keith D. Nosbusch: We had good growth in solutions as we mentioned. So there really was to Ted\u2019s point no big mix difference here that created the margin expansion. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse : Great, and then my second question is just certainly it is little bit tiresome but circling back to kind of the U.S. automotive investment outlook, I just wanted to clarify what you had said earlier. I think you talked about U.S. being kind of flattish going forward. I just wondered if that was the status quo that you've had recently or if it's been pretty good and you expect it to flatten out from here? Theodore D. Crandall: Well it has been pretty good. I mean as we talked last year automotive was one of the key drivers of our performance in the U.S. So we're expecting it to flatten out, slow a little from a very high level. So I think that's just the natural evolution of project spending in that industry and but we're still looking for continued opportunities and projects in automotive in the U.S. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse : Great, thank you. Theodore D. Crandall: You're welcome. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Winoker, Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : Thanks and good morning Ted and Keith. Theodore D. Crandall: Good morning, Steve. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : So I just wanted to be clear on the whole end market growth acceleration and deceleration, you've got 7% for the quarter last year and you're still guiding 3% to 6% for the year. So you're obviously looking at deceleration through the rest of the year and can you just again clarify a little bit more where you're expecting the most deceleration or headwinds to come from for the rest of the year that we should be planning in? Theodore D. Crandall: Sure. Well we think at the end of the year the U.S. will definitely be down from 10% growth quite frankly. And we expect the U.S., Asia Pacific and Latin America to be slightly above the company average. And EMEA will be up for the year but below the company average but still we believe outperforming the market. And Canada will be slightly down year-over-year and that\u2019s basically how we come up with the 3% to 6% and I would say that basically my commentary taken it comments around the midpoint of our guidance range. Keith D. Nosbusch: Keith here, Steve. I think also look there is some normal variability in our quarter-to-quarter sales and as you will remember I think first half last year for us is a pretty easy comparison in our solutions and services businesses because we came into the year with the hole in the backlog. So we expected coming into this year that we\u2019re going to see better growth in the first half than the second half. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then you guys are up to what looks like an all-time high on cash, I guess $1.25 billion and you have done couple of acquisitions. Could you maybe talk Keith to the strategic value of those? And then second Keith and Ted both maybe some thoughts around capital deployment as you go forward. It\u2019s been very consistent for Rockwell over the years. I am just wondering how you are thinking about that as that cash builds. Keith D. Nosbusch:  Okay well let me talk about the acquisitions and we\u2019re very pleased with both of them and with vMonitor we think it\u2019s a great opportunity because it expands our technology and solutions, our reach and domain expertise in the oil and gas well head and really that gives us some differentiation with the integrated approach for the design in those systems and gives us additional capability in the production side, which is an area that we have been very strong and we can also continue to develop what\u2019s been called in the industry, a difficult oil field and this enables us to have a much broader solution for those requirements. So think of it as in the production side upstream and wellhead applications and those are quite frankly all over the world and we see a great opportunity in all geographies with that.  With respect to Jacobs, Jacobs is a -- Jacobs Automation has really unique technology that we believe will provide faster speed and greater flexibility for machine builders. So it fits right into the OEM initiative that we have and the focus that we have been growing OEM sales on a global basis and really we see this as a way for customers to increase their productivity, help them reduce their energy consumption and really help them with speed of changeovers and therefore productivity that these OEMs can offer the end customers.  So really a good fit with our motion capability and we\u2019ll continue to integrate that technology with our integrated architecture and that is a technology that will take some time to be absorbed in the OEM community but we think we have some good leading edge capabilities there. So that\u2019s a little commentary around the acquisition. I will let Ted comment on the other part of your question. Theodore D. Crandall:  So Steve as it relates to cash deployment I mean I think I would characterize it as steady as she goes. I mean our commitment remains to exhaust our free cash flow after acquisitions either in dividend or share repurchase and we did that pretty much last year and our plan is to do that this year and that\u2019s reflected in $440 million of repurchases I talked about earlier.  As it relates to the cash on the balance sheet we have talked about the issue there before of most of that cash being outside the U.S. and not having an easy way to repatriate without incurring significant tax liability. And I would say as it relates to that we have no plan to change that at the moment. Keith D. Nosbusch:  And just to reinforce the two comments is that the vMonitor acquisition the majority of that was made with cash outside the U.S. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : Okay, thanks guys. Keith D. Nosbusch:  Thank you. Operator :  Our next question is from Steve Tusa, JPMorgan. Please proceed. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan:  Hey good morning guys. Keith D. Nosbusch:  Good morning Steve. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan: Hey Ted great job filling in for Rondi. Doing a fantastic job. Theodore D. Crandall: Thank you. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan: On the oil and gas side I remember OTC last year I was talking to one of your guys and he talked about being offshore being a great growth driver for you guys and I think he said it was 50% of your -- I don't know whether he said it was 50% of your upstream oil and gas business. Could you maybe just provide some color on what the offshore market is as a percentage of your oil and gas sales? I know that you guys do a tremendous amount of high quality work on the BOP and stuff like that. So I am just curious as we kind of parse out Canada and stuff like that, this is getting a little more interesting, the percentage of business from offshore I guess is my key question? Theodore D. Crandall: Yeah. Steve. I don't have that number right now. I think instead of just giving out one that I couldn't support long-term, we will get back to you with that one. I want to make sure we look at the information and have something there that we have confidence in the number.  But certainly to your point we are very strong in the offshore both from a control as well as safety systems as the ICFT acquisition is very helpful there and we will have to pull together the make-up of our oil and gas business with respect to offshore and automobile as well and we will get back to you. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan: And I guess it\u2019s mostly upstream and a little bit of midstream, is that kind of how we should think about the oil and gas? Theodore D. Crandall: Yes, Steve. Absolutely right. When we talk about our process initiatives, what we are accounting there will be heavily weighted to upstream and midstream. So when we talk about motor control it would be across the board, upstream, midstream and downstream. Likewise safety systems would play across that entire continuum. But when we talk about our expansion in the oil and gas we are mainly talking about control and what we do with our solutions capability and the majority of that would be the production side. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan: And then one last question just on\u2026 Theodore D. Crandall: We monitor this exactly in to that production side. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan: Right. So then just on the margin maybe just kind of a little bit different way and try and kind of understand what you guys were saying. So for the second quarter I guess a 35% incremental year-over-year or 30% to 40% kind of gets you to that high 19% kind of 20% range, if you will. I mean is that I am just trying to understand how this investment kind phases in and impacts that number. I mean is that kind of a way good way to think about kind of the step down from first quarter to the second quarter? Theodore D. Crandall: Yeah, I think it is. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan: Okay. Theodore D. Crandall: Steve, what we expect is something in that 30% to 35% range in terms of conversion as compared to the 50% in Q1. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. We have time for one more question coming from Nigel Coe, Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Keith D. Nosbusch: Nigel, are you there? Operator : Mr. Cole, please proceed, sir. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Hello. Keith D. Nosbusch: Hi, Nigel. Theodore D. Crandall: Hi, Nigel. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Can you hear me? Keith D. Nosbusch: Yes, we can now. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Good, good. So I guess I will ask the question again. So I just want to ask this way because you will always see this tick down in margins from Q1 to Q2, just a ramp up in spend and I know also because of the normalization impact effect. But did you say Ted that operating income or operating margin is down Q-over-Q? Theodore D. Crandall: Margin. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Margin, okay. I thought that\u2019s what you said. And then just on the, I just wanted to pick up on the trend about the book-to-bill for the quarter you mentioned again that it sounds like mining and Canada are the two factors there. But then Ted you mentioned the encouraging front-log activity. So I am just wondering, I am just trying to reconcile the two comments and I am wondering are you seeing this pickup in RFP activity through, do you see a pick-up in RFP activity through the quarter and going forward. The front-log activity suggests a pick-up in book-to-bill activity go through the year? Theodore D. Crandall: Well I think we wanted to characterize the front-log as stable at this point, not growing, but still solid as we look forward. And we would expect that to be starting to convert at normal rates as we go through the remainder of the year. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Keith D. Nosbusch: I think Nigel, maybe what would help is I think I\u2019d say that our backlog and our front-log at this point is consistent with the guidance. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Right, okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then Ted you mentioned about the yen currencies and obviously we are watching these with interest. You had an $11 million headwind I believe this quarter from currencies. And I am wondering is the impact on operating income, is it fairly linear, for the 15% -- for the 20% up in margin on that FX movement, would that equate to the impact of earnings or there\u2019s some unusual margin impact from currency? Theodore D. Crandall: I would say as you would expect quarter-to-quarter it can be very variable. Over a longer period of time generally I would say the translation effect comes in on earnings, comes in pretty close to kind of our normal operating income percent. But in any quarter what drives variability tends to be re-measurement blockers or gains. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Okay, and was there any unusual impact last quarter from the currency moves? Theodore D. Crandall: No, nothing significant in Q1. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Okay, that\u2019s helpful, thanks very much. Keith D. Nosbusch: Thank you, Nigel. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to turn the call over to Ted Crandall for closing remarks. Theodore D. Crandall: Well, that concludes today\u2019s call. So thank you everybody for joining us and we will see you next quarter. Operator : Thank you, sir. Thank you for joining today\u2019s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

I need to remind everybody that today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. Later in the call, we will open up the lines for questions. (Operator Instructions) At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rondi Rohr-Dralle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rohr-Dralle, please go ahead. Rondi Rohr-Dralle: Great. Thanks, Frieda. Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2014 earnings release conference call. With me today are Keith Nosbusch, our Chairman and CEO, and Ted Crandall, our Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda includes the opening remarks by Keith that will include highlights on the company\u2019s performance in the second quarter and the first half, plus the outlook for the full year. And then Ted will provide more details on all of that. And then, of course, we\u2019ll take questions at the end of Ted\u2019s remarks Our results were released this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website, at www.rockwellautomation.com. Please note that both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is accessible at that website and will be available for replay for the next 30 days. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. So with that, I'll hand it over to Keith. Keith Nosbusch : Thanks, Rondi and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call today. I\u2019m sure you are all happy to be in the homestretch of earnings season. I\u2019ll start with some highlights. So please turn to page four in this slide deck. We had another strong sales quarter with 7% organic growth and growth in all regions for the first time in over a year. Let me provide some more color on organic growth by region. The US grew 8% in the quarter, oil and gas continues to be the strongest performing vertical. In addition, we are now starting to see increased activity in chemicals. Auto remains relatively flat at high levels and the consumer goods industries are showing healthy growth. OEM sales were also strong in the quarter. Canada sales were up slightly, but [technical difficulty] Rondi Rohr-Dralle: We are hearing some feedback or delay. So, I don't know, Frieda, can you do something to make that go away? Operator : Okay, is it okay now? Rondi Rohr-Dralle: I don't know, Keith, go ahead. Keith Nosbusch : We will start up again. Canada sales were up slightly but there is continued weakness in resource-based industries. EMEA had another good quarter with 4% growth led by emerging markets. Our OEM business remains solid across the region. China's sales increase of 14% was the strongest driver of Asia-Pacific, 10% growth. Latin America had a better quarter and better growth this quarter at 9%. Double-digit growth in Mexico and Brazil offset the sales decline in the rest of the region. Emerging markets in total grew 11% in the quarter. I've got a couple of other comments on the topline, process sales grew 3% in the quarter, but quarter\u2019s growth was stronger. For the first half, process sales grew 5% and we expect higher than 5% growth in the second half of the fiscal year. Logix grew 7% in the quarter with the highest growth in Asia-Pacific. In China, we're seeing good OEM adoption of our compact Logix controllers. Moving onto earnings, you often heard me talk about the quarterly variability of our earnings performance and the first two quarters this year clearly demonstrate that. It's more meaningful and more indicative of underlying trends to talk about our performance in the first half and we had a very good first half performance. On 7% organic sales growth we delivered over one point of segment operating margin improvement. Adjusted EPS grew 10% in spite of a significant headwind from a higher tax rate and cash flow was also very good in the first half with 92% free cash flow conversion on adjusted income. At the halfway point in the year, we are where we expected to be and are well-positioned as we entered the second half. Based on that, along with our expectations for continued stable market conditions, we are reaffirming sales and adjusted EPS guidance with a few tweaks. Compared to our previous guidance, organic growth will be a bit higher, offset by lower sales due to currency and acquisitions. And we're maintaining the adjusted EPS guidance range of $6 to $6.35 in spite of a higher tax rate. Ted will provide more color on the full-year and second half of the year in his remarks. I would like to take a moment to mention something that I\u2019m very proud of. We recently received the Ethisphere award for the sixth time, naming us \u201cOne of the World\u2019s Most Ethical Companies.\u201d This recognition reflects our commitment to integrity, responsibility and accountability, all of which drive value for employees, partners, customers and shareholders. Before I wrap up, I just want to remind you of the Integrated Control and Information opportunity that we talked about at our investor conference last November. Integrated Control and Information, or ICI, is the next wave of innovation in the evolution of the integrated architecture, intelligent motor control and Logix\u2019 multi-disciplined controls. It will provide the next generation of manufacturing and industrial productivity, thus, delivering business value to our customers across the entire automation investment lifecycle. ICI solutions enable the connected enterprise and makes manufacturing processes smart, productive and secure. We have the innovative technology, the smart people and the partners needed to deliver ICI and expand the value we provide to our customers and shareholders. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Ted. Ted? Ted D. Crandall: Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll start with chart number five \u2013 second quarter results summary. So another good quarter operationally with continued strong top line growth and pretty good underlying earnings conversion. There are a couple of unusual items impacting the year-over-year earnings comparison. I\u2019ll highlight those, as we move through the charts. Revenue in the quarter was $1,601 million, up 5% compared to the second quarter of last year. Organic growth was 7% and currency fluctuations reduced sales by approximately 2 points. Q2 last year is our easiest comparison quarter but even given that still very good organic growth performance, and as Keith mentioned, pretty broad-based geographically Segment operating earnings in the quarter and the current period were $302 million, up 6% compared to Q2 last year. I\u2019ll provide some additional color on operating earnings with our next chart. General corporate-net was $18.9 million in Q2 compared to $18.1 million in Q2 last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter was 27.9% that compares to an adjusted effective tax rate in the same period last year of 23.6%. In Q2, last year we benefited from a catch-up adjustment related to the extension of the US R&D tax credit. The benefit last year coupled with the absence of an R&D credit this year, increased the tax rate in Q2 by approximately 4 points accounting for pretty much of all the year over year increase. This is one of the unusual items I referred to. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.35 that compares to $1.33 in the same quarter last year, so up only about 2%. The higher tax rate reduced adjusted earnings per share by $0.08. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was 140.2 million. We repurchased approximately 900,000 shares in the second quarter at a cost of about $111 million. At the end of Q2 there was 314 million remaining under our $1 billion share repurchase authorization. Through the first half of the fiscal year, we\u2019ve repurchased 1.9 million shares for approximately $221 million, so on pace to hit the $440 million full-year repurchase expectation that we talked about on the previous earnings calls this year. Moving to chart six, this is the graphical version of total company results for the second quarter. On the left side the chart you can see the 5% year-over-year sales growth; as I mentioned, that was 7% organic growth. Sales increased 1% sequentially. On the right side of the chart you'll note the year-over-year increase in segment operating earnings, total segment operating margin in Q2 was 18.9%, up 20 basis points from the second quarter of last year. Last quarter, we said we intended to increase spending, spending was up about 4% sequentially and about 6% year-over-year, so pretty much in line with our organic growth. Incremental earnings conversion was 22%, lower than would be expected with 7% organic growth. That brings me to the second unusual item. Conversion margin in Q2 was impacted by a significant year-over-year increase in variable compensation expense. Due to last year benefited from a year-to-date adjustment that reduced variable compensation expense that was related to a change to our full-year guidance at this time last year. The lower than normal variable compensation last year is causing about an $8 million negative comparison to the current quarter. If you adjust for that, conversion margin would be about 32%, within our target range and pretty good given a more aggressive spending increase in Q2. While not on the chart, our trailing four-quarter return on invested capital was 30.6% at the end of the second quarter. If you\u2019ll turn to chart number seven, it summarizes the Q2 results of the Architecture & Software segment. Again, looking at the left side of this chart, sales reached $687 million, up 7% year-over-year as reported and up 9% organically. Sales were down in the segment 1% sequentially. Keith mentioned that Logix growth was 7%, a little below the segment average. Q2 was a very strong quarter for growth in our Motion Control business, and that\u2019s consistent with continued success with OEM customers. Operating margin for the quarter was 27.7%. That\u2019s up 1.1 points compared to Q2 last year. The 9% organic growth provided considerable volume leverage, which more than offset the effect of increased spending, a little unfavorable mix and the increased variable compensation expense. The next page, chart eight, covers our Control Products & Solutions segment. Compared to Q2 last year, sales were up 3% as reported and up 5% organically. Organic growth in both the Product business the Solutions & Service businesses was about 5%. Sales for the segment increased 2% sequentially, with the Product businesses and Solutions & Service businesses both up sequentially. Book-to-bill for the Solutions & Services businesses was 1.1 in Q2. On the right side of the chart, you\u2019ll note that operating earnings were slightly lower than Q2 last year and operating margin declined by 0.8 year-over-year. The benefit of higher sales was more than offset by increased spending, increased variable compensation expense and larger than normal negative currency effects in the quarter. The next chart is a geographic breakdown of our sales in the quarter. I think Keith covered this one well in his comments, so I will turn to chart number 10 which is free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $188 million, another strong quarter. Year-to-date conversion on adjusted income is about 92%, that's a very good result for the first half of the year and we continue to expect conversion of about 100% for the full year. Turning to the next chart, this provides an EPS walk from the first half of last year for the first half of this year. It was a very good first half. Keith mentioned the quarterly variability of our results, that variability is a consequence of many factors including, for example, the two unusual items I talked about that impacted results this quarter. Because of the quarterly variability, the first half maybe a better representation of our underlying performance than either quarter taken alone. Looking at the bridge, EPS was up 10% increasing from $2.56 to $2.82. That's on organic sales growth for the first half of 7%. The 10% increase in EPS is despite a pretty significant headwind from tax rate which you can see here is worth about $0.11. A small increase in general corporate-net expense was offset by lower share count. And segment earnings were up 12% with incremental margin of about 38%. And that takes us to the final slide, chart 12, which addresses our current outlook for fiscal year 2014. As Keith mentioned, we continue to expect sales to be about 6.6 billion. However, we now expect organic growth for the full year to be about a half-point higher across the range. 3.5% to 6.5% organic growth compared to the previous guidance of 3% to 6%. That change will offset about a half-a-point of negative impact related to our updated estimates of the full-year currency effects and a little lower sales from acquisitions. We continue to expect segment margin for the full year to be about 20%. We are reaffirming guidance for adjusted EPS in the range of $6 to $6.35. We now expect a tax rate for the full-year of approximately 27%, that's at the high-end of our previous guidance of 26% to 27%. We still expect to spend about $440 million on share repurchases this year. And finally, we continue to expect general corporate net expense to be about $85 million for the full year. I know you all are aware that we don't provide quarterly guidance, but perhaps the following notes on the second half will be helpful as you start to put together your models. We expect healthy sequential growth in the second half, but solutions and services growth will be heavily weighted to Q4. That's a typical pattern for our solutions and services businesses. And the year-over-year comparisons, for the second half, growth rates will moderate compared with the first half, because the comparisons get more difficult. That's particularly true in the solutions and services businesses and, especially, in Q3. As I\u2019ve said, we expect operating margin to be about 20% for the full year. Consistent with my comments on the pattern of second half sales growth, we would expect margin performance to also be weighted to Q4. Finally, we expect a lower tax rate in the second half due to the expected recognition of discrete tax benefits. It\u2019s difficult to know for sure how that will fall out by quarter, but we expect the discrete tax benefits will be primarily in Q4. And, with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Rondi, and we can begin Q&A. Rondi Rohr-Dralle: Okay. Ted, thanks. Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say we do have quite a few callers in the question queue today, and we do want to get to as many of you as possible. So if you could limit yourself to a question and a follow-up and then get back in the queue, if you\u2019ve got another topic that you want to talk about, so we\u2019d appreciate your cooperation. And, Frieda, let\u2019s take our first caller Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Please stand by for your first question. So your first question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Barclays. Please proceed. Scott Davis : Good morning, everybody. Keith Nosbusch : Good morning, Scott. Rondi Rohr-Dralle: Hey, Scott. Scott Davis : I wanted to get a sense \u2013 I mean; it sounds like your order book is good. If you look at your full year guidance, it implies the mid-point would be 5% core for the full year and you did 7 in the first half. So that would mean more like 3 in the second half. I mean, what leads you to that conservatism? Is there something that you\u2019re seeing that \u2013 I know your comps are tougher. I get it. But it shouldn\u2019t be to that extent, I wouldn\u2019t think, but maybe you can dig into that a little deeper? Keith Nosbusch : Well, I think the way you characterize it is exactly right, the percentages and the differences to the 5% number. We don't believe its conservative. The comps get much more difficult in the second half and certainly while the year-over-year will be lower, we still are going to see a significant sequential growth in both the third and fourth quarters. So we think its solid operating performance and nothing really happening in the markets themselves at this point in time. Scott Davis : Okay. So, okay, I guess we will see where that comes out to and then just to clarify in 2Q some of the one-time expenses you had the true up on variable comp and such like that, is there things you identify in the back half the year that will mute some of your operating leverage that we should think about? Keith Nosbusch : So I think in terms of sequential comparisons, improve margin in the back half of year is going to come primarily from volume leverage. Scott Davis : Okay. But I guess my question is, are you expecting a more normalized operating leverage, volume leverage, in the back half versus 2Q or you know, clearly it was muted due to the higher cost. Keith Nosbusch : Certainly compared to Q2 but if you look at the first half, our conversion margin was 38%. I mean that's pretty close to what we would expect in second half. Scott Davis : Okay. That's good color. Okay, I will pass it on. Thank you, guys. Keith Nosbusch : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from Nomura Securities. Please proceed. Keith Nosbusch : Good morning, Shannon. How are you? Shannon O'Callaghan: So just to clarify a little bit, just on this 2Q incrementals in the first place. So, I mean I get the point around some of these spending increase and the comp, but the A&S incrementals were really strong and it was mainly focused in CP&S, so was the comp issue more weighted to CP&S and you also mentioned an unusually large FX impact there, could you maybe just size the impact specifically between the segments? Keith Nosbusch : Yeah. So, on the $8 million year-over-year increase in the variable comp expense, which I want to remind you is really consequence of lower expense last year. About 60% of that is CP&S and the remainder A&S. So, because CP&S is our heavier more people intensive business, it bears a larger share of that. CP&S also had an unusually large earnings impact on the currency translation impact in the quarter and that's a consequence primarily of our exposure in CP&S, both more to emerging markets, so countries like Brazil, Argentina, South Africa where we\u2019re seeing some larger currency swings and also higher CPS exposure in Canada where we\u2019re seeing continued weakening of the Canadian dollar. Shannon O'Callaghan: And how big was that \u2013 that approximately the FX impact? Keith Nosbusch : The currency year-over-year was ballpark about half-a-point. Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay. And then, just on the chemical market, you mentioned you're starting to see some activity there. Can you just mention maybe where you're seeing that occur and also how Rockwell is playing into those projects? Keith Nosbusch : Yes. Well, we're seeing that as the down stream effects of the production expansions that have been going on, particularly in North America at this point. And we\u2019re seeing that as it flows into the chemical plants. You\u2019ve heard about the expansion of petrochemical. But now we\u2019re also seeing some of that \u2013 and this activity is really at the front-end coating and engineering studies that take place. But it\u2019s also in the specialty and fine chemical areas as well. And we think those are very good opportunities for Rockwell given that it\u2019s much more batch-oriented and, certainly, something that the integrated architecture and our safety capabilities have a great footprint to be able to be successful in. Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Keith Nosbusch : Thank you, Shannon. Operator : Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from John Inch from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. John Inch : Yeah. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Keith Nosbusch : Good morning, John. John Inch : Good morning. What was the dollar amount of the spending this quarter \u2013 the heightened spending this quarter versus last quarter or year-over-year? How does that split between A&S and the CP&S? Ted D. Crandall: So year-over-year spending increase was about $25 million. Sequentially, it was about $20 million. About half of the sequential increase was our normal merit increase that occurs January 1, and it\u2019s split roughly 50/50 between the segments. John Inch : And do you expect that cadence of spending, Ted, to continue for each of the next two quarters? Ted D. Crandall: No, I think the sequential ramps will be somewhat less then the next couple of quarters and I think what I would expect to see is about a 5% increase in spending year-over-year in the second half. John Inch : All right. What are you actually spending on and I'm assuming this is mostly people but could you flush out a little bit in terms of whether some of these investments and what kind of a payback do you expect on some of the spending? Keith Nosbusch : The areas are really in two primary categories. The first one would be development engineering and that would be around a number of the things that we discussed at the investor meeting particularly the integrated control and information opportunities that we've identified as our ability to expand our certain market. The second would be in customer facing resources sales resources. We are adding those in different regions and countries of the world where we see the best growth opportunities. And as far as the payback on these investments, as you know these investments take time to be able to generate the new products so this is not something that we will see in the remainder of this calendar year. The sales resources will start helping, although it starts helping next fiscal year, although depending on where they are, sometimes the ramp-up and whether they are newer experienced employees, can be from 12 to 24 months before they become fully productive. And our product \u2013 our project schedules tend to be 12 to 30 months, depending on the scope and what exactly that project is and then we would have a ramp-up of sales after that period of time. So it's really investments for the future and that's why I did mention the fact that we believe we do have these growth opportunities and we've been talking about adding the investment for a number of quarters here. And certainly in the second quarter we were able to bring a lot of people on board and certainly we look forward to the benefits of that down the road. John Inch : Yeah. No, I understand. Are you doing this in Asia or Europe or North America, or where's the emphasis? Keith Nosbusch : Well, the development resources would be in our development centers and the majority of those would be in the US but we also would be adding development people in the Czech Republic and Poland, and then Singapore and China would be the two major ones in Asia. When you look at the salespeople, we have been adding salespeople in some of the emerging Europe markets. We've been adding in Latin America and to some degree in the US given some of the strength that we've seen in this country and we believe the longer-term potential. John Inch : Yeah, okay. And then, just as a technical question, Ted, what if the R&D credit later this year is renewed? How does that work? Are you guys going to be able \u2013 are you going to go back and retroactively adjust your tax rates? Like you give us tax hit now, and people sort of assume it\u2019s just part of ops. And then is there some sort of big fourth quarter number because the risk is Wall Street is just going to think that\u2019s a one-time adjustment? Like how does this work in the past and maybe you could just talk us through the mechanics of that? Ted D. Crandall: Yeah. So if the R&D tax credit were renewed before the end of our fiscal year \u2013 and, remember, we\u2019re on a September fiscal year, not December. If it were renewed before the end of the fiscal year, then we would do a \u2013 and assuming it was renewed with retroactive application, we would do a catch-up adjustment for the full year. So that would be probably about 0.6, 0.7 point of lower tax rate for the year, if that happens. John Inch : Okay. Got it. Thanks very much. Keith Nosbusch : Thank you, John. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question comes from line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Joe Ritchie : Hello, everyone. Keith Nosbusch : Good morning. Joe Ritchie : So I understand the cadence on the CP&S organic growth for the remaining part of the year, as comps get tougher. But I was a little surprised by the growth this quarter of roughly 5% because you had easier comps, and then the book-to-bill on the Solutions side seemed to be pretty good both last quarter and this quarter. So just, perhaps, you can provide a little bit of color on the growth in that business specifically this quarter. Keith Nosbusch : Well, I think, the book-to-bill is not really a good current quarter substitute for the CP&S Solutions business. It tends to be six months to a longer period before those projects really will enter into a shippable state. And so we do have this lag between the orders and the project completion. The second part of it is project business is lumpy. And depending upon where you are in the cycle of the project where the customer is and if they are doing some acceptance testing or if there has to be a delay because their project is delayed, the project business just is one that is very difficult to predict with certainty as to which ones will make it in a quarter and which ones will either fall out into the next quarter or a longer period of time. So it\u2019s just a challenge from a forecasting standpoint, but book-to-bill is not the only indicator particularly you have to look at the aging of that book-to-bill as to when it is shippable in the future. Joe Ritchie : Okay, that's helpful, Keith. And I just had one follow-up question on the \u2013 I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. So earlier you talk about incremental margins for the second half of the year. I think you said 38% which was comparable to first half. If I'm doing the math correctly, to get to the midpoint of your guidance, it looks like the implied incrementals are closer to 25%. And so are -- you effectively feel confident in the higher end of year guidance for the full-year by expecting 38 for the second half of the year? Ted D. Crandall: Now Joe, I think you are doing the math incorrectly, but why don't you get with Rondi after the call. I think what you're going to see is the incrementals in the second half are in the high 30s. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Fair enough. Rondi Rohr-Dralle: So we do it on segment operating margins, so I don't know if that's the difference between the way you do it, but... Joe Ritchie : Yeah. No, I was doing it on the segment level as well. We can catch up after the call though. Rondi Rohr-Dralle: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please proceed. Steve Tusa : Hey, guys. Good morning. Keith Nosbusch : Good morning. Steve Tusa : Just a very helpful color on the sequencing in the second half, I guess the seasonality from 2Q to 3Q has been a bit all over the map. I think the 1.1 book-to-bill and to your comments, is kind of similar to 1.1 or 1.15 you\u2019ve done in the last couple of years, so nothing really stand out there. But I guess last year you were up 5% sequentially, second quarter to third quarter, is that kind of the right range to think about? As always I\u2019m asking, I know you don\u2019t give quarterly guidance, but you\u2019re trying to kind of baseline our models here, because there are \u2013 it's seems like there are some moving parts with the lumpiness. Keith Nosbusch : I think \u2013 well, without providing quarterly guidance I think I would say the 5% sequential increase last year was unusually large. Steve Tusa : Okay. Okay. So I guess the then year-over-year comp will be similar third quarter, fourth quarter, I guess, is that the right way to look at it? Or a little bit weaker in the third? Keith Nosbusch : Yeah, I suspect a little weaker in the third. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then you mentioned the margins, you guys did 20 bps of segment margin improvement this quarter. Is that the right kind of framework for the third quarter? Keith Nosbusch : Steve, I don\u2019t want to get that detailed in the quarterly numbers. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then one last question on the ForEx. Companies like 3M which are seeing similar kind of foreign exchange impact or seeing a lot of price go through in kind of a related way. So the ForEx change was pretty dramatic in Latin America, and your organic growth was very strong. Was there an unusual kind of pricing element in the 9% organic there or is it not kind of the same dynamics for you guys? Ted D. Crandall: No. I would say there is no unusual pricing item in the organic. Steve Tusa : Okay. All right. Thanks for the detail. I appreciate it. Keith Nosbusch : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Thanks for your question. The next question comes from the line of Steve Winoker from Sanford Bernstein. Steve Winoker : Thanks and good morning. Keith Nosbusch : Good morning. Rondi Rohr-Dralle: Good morning. Steve Winoker : Can you maybe comment on the incremental growth versus your prior expectations? I mean, it clearly sounds likes you\u2019re seeing acceleration and some momentum here. But where specifically and which segments and vertical and geographies, did you actually see the extra kind of -- are you comfortable with the extra 0.5% or is it just too widespread? Keith Nosbusch : Well, it would be pretty widespread. But, certainly, we\u2019ve seen strong organic growth in A&S. That\u2019s been the better performing segment with respect to the Product sales that we\u2019ve seen year-to-date. And then, certainly, I would say, the US has continued to perform probably a little bit stronger, and we don\u2019t see any reason for that to change. And it\u2019s really those two that told us we could offset the currency. And acquisition was a little stronger organic growth for the year. And that's basically how we came at what we call the tweak of the make up of the sales number which stayed the same. Steve Winoker : Okay. And on the process growth side, you mentioned up 5%, and I think going higher and it was, what, 8% last quarter and this has clearly been a two-pronged story in terms of both end markets and penetration. How are you viewing that opportunity, Keith, particularly you talked about the downstream opportunities, etcetera, but is that kind of -- where is the biggest opportunity there and you expected to stay in that range or sort of consistently go higher? Keith Nosbusch : Well, we do expect the second half process to be higher than the first half and the first half as you've said was 5%. So we are expecting it to go up and we see the best opportunity there continue to be in oil and gas. We will get a little bit of help with vMonitor acquisition that we talked about which is really focused at least at this point of its growth into the oil and gas industry. So it\u2019s a nice play into that space. But we are also at least in North America we are beginning to see some investment in the legacy pulp and paper applications. And so it\u2019s a very aged old installed base and we see that starting to have a little bit more of a pickup and we have a pretty good footprint there in our motor control and now with the process capabilities we can do the wet end of the paper plans as well. So \u2013 but really the strongest play is oil and gas and we got a couple of other opportunities that we believe will get us to that higher growth in the second half. Steve Winoker : Okay, great. I'll pass it on. Thanks. Keith Nosbusch : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Mark Douglass from Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Mark Douglass : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Keith Nosbusch : Good morning, Mark. Mark Douglass : Keith, can you talk some more about China? It's interesting how your growth has been so strong this half with the Pia mine, other indicators in China being weaker, whereas last year you had really \u2013 you have had declines in a \u2013 what seemed to be a better macro. Can you talk about squaring that circle and what's going on in China for you? Keith Nosbusch : Sure. Well, the first one, you've kind of touched upon and that is, we had a very weak first half last year and then obviously a much stronger second half, but which is why we're talking about the tough comparables, and China will be one of those tough comparables. But really, we're seeing continued growth for us into the consumer related industries. So auto continues, Food & Beverage, the \u2013 as they continue to build out and grow the middle class, they\u2019re taking \u2013 and the concerns they have over quality and safety of their food supplies. These are all areas that are very important to us. Oil and gas continues to be a good growth for us in China, and the OEM performance was probably the leader there. The OEM was very strong this quarter. And that\u2019s just some of the work that our team did there last year, as we \u2013 as quite candidly as we struggled in the first half. We\u2019ve really focused on a couple of areas where we thought the best opportunities were. And, particularly, as their infrastructure spending comes down and there is no spending in the metals, minimal spending in the cement industry now compared to historical, we had shepherd our resources into the areas where we could see the growth. And we added capabilities and put resources into OEMs and into the consumer products industries. And I think we\u2019re seeing the benefits of some of that activity now. Mark Douglass : Okay. Thank you. And then can you do a walk-around of what you\u2019re seeing in automotives around the globe as far as their investment spending? Keith Nosbusch : Sure. The spending in Europe continues to be very weak, and we don\u2019t see that changing dramatically, as time goes on here. The US spending continues to be relatively high. But we haven\u2019t seen it growing, but it\u2019s at a higher level. And we believe that the projects will continue, as time goes on. So that's been a very positive part of our US business, but we don't see the US spending increasing. Latin America, the strength has been Mexico and Brazil and there has been -- as you know a significant investment from the foreign car manufacturers into Mexico and we continue to see investment going on there. If we go to Asia, we don't do much in Japan, but certainly China is where all the action is in automotives. And there we see mainly the spending in the passenger car side and heavy with the joint ventures. And that's where we've been able to make most of the inroads. We do participate in the domestic market, the domestic car manufacturers, but they are not investing at the same levels and rates as the joint ventures are. So it\u2019s a little more weighted to the JV. So really we see the automotive industry as one that continues to provide opportunities for Rockwell. In particular, it\u2019s a very automation intensive industry and automation intensive for a lot of the A&S product portfolio. And then I only will finally comment that we also as we have mentioned activities that we work with FANUC on with powertrain. We see the powertrain as a longer-term growth opportunity in a space that we did not participate fully in all the applications and that will help us in the future. Mark Douglass : Great. Thank you. Keith Nosbusch : You're welcome. Thank you, Mark. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from MKM Partners. Please proceed. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi. Good morning, guys. Can you hear me? Keith Nosbusch : Yes, we can, Josh. Go ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski : Thanks. So maybe just a little more color on the cadence of business through the quarter, any impacts from weather, it seems like you guys aren\u2019t really calling that out as much. And then, any dispersion between larger project and more small \u2013 small ticket business, maybe outside of the bigger stuff in service and solutions, but maybe more in kind of the core automation? Keith Nosbusch : Sure. The \u2013 with respect to the quarter itself, it was a pretty typical quarter. March is always the strongest month for us and this March was. And I would say that nothing inconsistent in how the quarter flowed. If we talk about the project activity, we're not seeing any, I'll say, meaningful change in project delays or anything like that. So it seems like that continues to be at the pace that we have seen earlier. And then, secondly, your comment about the size of the projects, that would depend on where we are. I would say that the majority of the projects in North America are the smaller projects. We have not seen large ones at this point in time. So that means most of it is modernization as opposed to, I\u2019ll say, Greenfield capacity at this point. And my comments about pulp and paper fit right into that type of a scenario. If we go outside, in particular, emerging markets is where we see more of the Greenfield. And certainly there is the major project tend to be less resource-driven in China at the moment or, I should say, less metals in heavy industry \u2013 less metals, less cement and, certainly, tend to be more in the consumer space at this point in time. From a weather standpoint, we had a couple of days where our service engineers couldn\u2019t get to customers. But given all the other moving parts we had this quarter that was certainly not one to point out. It cost us a little bit but, certainly, not to the extent that the other two or three that Ted mentioned earlier in his comments. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got you. That\u2019s helpful. And then just a follow-up on the comment that you're not seeing a lot of Greenfield work in North America. Do get the sense that your customers are sitting back on their heels right now and watching? Or is that something that is maybe more of a next year dynamic and for the time being there's really not a lot of, I will call, a pent-up demand for Greenfield spending? Keith Nosbusch : In the US, I don't think we've seen a lot of Greenfield spending other than when the automotives came back from their downturns and I would say the automotives came back meaning that, when they do new lines and new models you can think of it as Greenfield because we basically re-do it. I think where we are starting to see some of the indications and why I mentioned chemicals is, I think we are starting to see the generation of new chemical plans and that's a broad spectrum, but I think it\u2019s really the downstream from the energy play that's been going on whether it be oil or gas. We are now seeing -- we will see more Greenfield or I should say just large projects as they move that down the process and stream. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got you. Thank you. Keith Nosbusch : You're welcome, Josh. Operator : Thank you for your questions. And next question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Keith Nosbusch : Good morning. Nigel Coe : We've covered a lot of ground, so just a couple of quick follow-ups, so Ted you gave some color on 3Q already, more color than someone who doesn\u2019t give quarterly guidance, yet, FX relative to what we saw in 3Q, does it look similar in 3Q, down about two points? Ted D. Crandall: I think right now I would expect FX earnings impact to be lower in Q3 than Q2. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's helpful. And then the 50 bps impact to CPF margins from FX. Is that because the \u2013 kind of the Brazil etcetera, carry higher margins or is there another reason, is there some sort of revenue cost this much closing that pinch? Ted D. Crandall: No. I mean I don\u2019t think it's higher margins in those countries, it's just \u2013 it's a consequence of the impact on the transactions in those countries in the currency depreciation as well as summary measurement losses on the balance sheet. Nigel Coe : Okay, great. And then just wanted to dig into, I think you mentioned some discrete tax items which probably hit in 4Q, Ted. Number one, were those in your guidance originally and since we're now looking at $0.27 tax rate for the year that implies 3Q is going to be higher than $0.27? Ted D. Crandall: The discrete items were largely in our original tax guidance at the beginning of the year. Nigel Coe : Okay. Ted D. Crandall: And it's hard to call exactly how those will fall out in the balance of the year, but I think they will be more weighted to Q2 which would suggest \u2013 I'm sorry, Q4. So if you think about an average in the second half of about 26%, I think we're going to be higher than that in Q3. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks Ted. Ted D. Crandall: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from line of Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Rich Kwas : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just a quick one for me. On the book-to-bill, the 1.1 \u2013 last quarter, it was 1.1 as well. And my impression was that you\u2019d expect some kind of tick-up here in Q1 versus Q1. So could you just give us some color on how that relates to expectations? And then if it was below expectation for the quarter, was there just \u2013 I know, Keith, you just said there wasn\u2019t really any project push-outs, but it is a lumpy business. But just what are you seeing that would have pushed that number to be flat sequentially? Ted D. Crandall: So, Rich, this is Ted. So I\u2019d say the 1.1 in Q1 was lower than what we would normally expect to see in Q1. 1.1 in Q2 is pretty much normal expectation for Q2, so no big surprise here. It came in pretty much the way we expected it to come in. Rich Kwas : Okay. So no real change versus what you were thinking going into the quarter? Ted D. Crandall: Correct. Rich Kwas : Okay. Thank you. Keith Nosbusch : Thank you, Rich. Rondi Rohr-Dralle: Okay. I think we\u2019ve got time for one last caller. Operator : Okay. The next question comes from line of Richard Eastman from Robert W Baird. Go ahead, please. Richard Eastman : Yeah. Keith, could you just talk to \u2013 as we look to the end of the fiscal year and you\u2019ve got your core \u2013 Rockwell has got their core revenue growth guidance on the board. When you look at how the two segments will play out relative to that guidance, it appears as though the Architecture & Software business will be towards the high end from a growth perspective. Maybe, core growth will be 6, 6.5% versus the CP&S business will be towards the lower end. And I\u2019m \u2013 I am just curious, from your perspective, is there a message in those growth rates relative to where we are in the cycle, or is spent, again, are getting this ICI theme? I mean, how do you view the growth rates in those two pieces of business relative to the cycle, global business cycle? Keith Nosbusch : Well, for the full-year A&S would be at the higher end to your point, probably around 7% and CP&S would be lower, probably around 4 to get you to that average that you talked about. We don't believe that that indicates anything from the cycle. I think what we are seeing is that the industries where we see the best growth is the US and certainly the US is a heavier A&S content then CP&S because of two reasons. One, the types of the industries that we support and then secondly, there is a very mature system integrated market here and many of our product go through the system integrators as opposed to through our solutions business in the US, particularly in the consumer products industry. And so we get solidly heavier product content in that. When we go outside the US, it\u2019s more our people have to supply the project work and so it\u2019s different in that regard, so. Richard Eastman : Okay, I understand. And then just one last question, on the OEMs side of the business and the OEM sales, has there been any shift in end markets or applications that's noticeable? I tend to think of the OEM business as being kind of packaging, food and bev oriented. There's been so much talk and investment into the robotics industry, the collaborative side, the smaller payload robots. Is there any shift in that business towards a compact logic or anything that suggests that that could be a growth driver going forward? Keith Nosbusch : Well, we certainly believe the OEMs would be a growth driver. And as I mentioned, our Motion business had a strong quarter and we had good OEM growth in China, in the US and parts of Europe. So \u2013 and part of that is because of compact Logix to your point. It allows us to have a better price point and sell the Architecture across to customer's complete portfolio of machines. But you have to think a little broader of the OEM space, if you will. Certainly, the most recognizable one is packaging and quite frankly, when you go to pack expo, that's what it is all about. It's around packaging machines and those are big displays whether it\u2019d be in Chicago or Las Vegas or Europe. But the other segments are very important. Tire is a very important segment. We do very well in that globally. We have process skewed OEMs that equipment comes into a processing plant. And many times, our controllers are what are on that equipment, including drives and instrumentation with our partner. So there are multiple segments. We have the heavy industries\u2019 activities, the energy, some of the compressor and turbine OEM. So it\u2019s much broader than just packaging. Material handling is a very important segment. And then to your point, robotics, and a lot of times we work on that with a lot of the end of the line packaging equipment as well as robotics into automotive. So we have like six segments in the OEM space that we focus on, and I would say we haven\u2019t seen any dramatic shift in those segments. Packaging has been very strong for the last couple of years. Tire has been very strong. And we\u2019ve been improving our ability to compete particularly in the process skid with our Process initiative. And then also some of our drive technology has opened up more opportunities in converting print and web, in particular, converting into home and personal care side is a very important segment for us as well. Richard Eastman : Okay. Very good. Thank you. Keith Nosbusch : Thank you, Rick. Rondi Rohr-Dralle: Okay. With that, we\u2019re going to wrap up today\u2019s call. So we just want to thank all of you for joining us. And, of course, I\u2019d be available to answer any more questions after the call. Thanks. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference call. At this time, you may disconnect, and thank you for joining.",

I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. Later in the call, we will open up the line for questions. (Operator Instructions) At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rondi Rohr-Dralle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rohr-Dralle. Please go ahead. Rondi Rohr-Dralle : Thank you Annette. Good morning everyone. Apologize for the delay at the beginning of this call. We had some technical difficulties. I believe they are resolved now and we can proceed. So thank you for your patience on that. Also thanks for joining us Rockwell Automation's Third Quarter Fiscal 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today are Keith Nosbusch, our Chairman and CEO and Ted Crandall our Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda includes opening remarks by Keith that include highlights of the Company's performance in the third quarter and year-to-date plus our outlook for the remainder of the year. And then Ted, as always will provide more details on all of that and we\u2019ll take questions at the end of Ted\u2019s remarks. Our results were released this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website, at www.rockwellautomation.com. Please note both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is accessible at that website and will be available for replay for the next 30-days. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. So with that, I'll hand it over to Keith. Keith D. Nosbusch: Thanks, Rondi. Good morning, everyone. I know it\u2019s been a busy earnings season for all you so I appreciate your time today. I hope you all get to enjoy some downtime later in August. The first portion of my remarks will cover the highlights for the quarter. So please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck. Sales and earnings came in as we expected this quarter. Organic sales grew 2% year-over-year. We experienced strong 7% growth in Architecture & Software but a difficult comparison in our Solutions & Services businesses led to a 2% sales decline in Control Products & Solutions. More importantly, we saw sequential growth in both segments and across all regions except EMEA which had a 1% sequential decline. This sequential growth reinforces our view of continued economic growth. Let me give you a little more color by region and by vertical. All of the growth rates I mentioned will be for year-over-year for organic growth. Sales growth in the U.S. remains solid at 5%. We continue to see broad-based industry performance with strength in oil and gas, particularly in shale. In Canada, sales were down 8% with a significant decline in Solutions & Services. We are still seeing weaknesses in resource-based industries; however, the product businesses grew nicely. In EMEA, sales growth of 1% was lower than growth in the first half, again, mostly due to the variability in our Solutions businesses. OEM sales remained healthy. Sales in Asia Pacific were flat because of the large sequential sales increase in last year's Q3. As expected, China sales were down 5% year-over-year, but up mid-teens sequentially. We're starting to see an increase in consumer packaged goods manufacturing investment in China, particularly in brewing and dairy. And as you know, consumer goods is a sweet spot for us. Latin America was flat year over year due to a very difficult comparison as the region grew 23% last year. Mexico sales were flat and Brazil sales were down this quarter, but we expect to see a return to double-digit year-over-year growth in both countries next quarter. Logix was up 7% in the quarter. We continue to see good adoption of our midrange controllers with OEMs. Before I end my comments on top line, let me share a couple of other data points. Our Motion Control business was up double digits in the quarter which is another indication of success with OEMs. Process grew 6% in the quarter. For the full year we now expect process growth to be in the mid single-digit. This is below our previous projection, primarily due to project timing. I'll just touch on earnings in the quarter, because Ted will cover the details. On 2% sales growth in the quarter we were pleased with both year-over-year and sequential operating margin expansion, and free cash flow in the quarter was very strong at 131% of net income. Looking at the year-to-date results on organic sales growth of 5%, we've expanded segment operating margin by 70 basis points. Adjusted EPS is up 6% for the year and would have been higher without the significant headwind from a higher tax rate. Delivering these results while still funding investment spending is a testament to the viability and solid execution of our growth and performance strategy. So onto the outlook. With three quarters behind us, we've narrowed the range of organic growth guidance to 4% to 6%. We continue to expect underlying market growth. On the revised sales growth, we've also narrowed the adjusted EPS range to $6.10 to $6.25. The midpoints of both ranges remain the same. Ted will go into more detail on guidance. Before handing it off to Ted, I would like to remind you that Automation Fair is in Anaheim this year, and we'll be holding our investor conference on Thursday, November 20, one week later than last year. Although Automation Fair is a customer event, it's a great opportunity for investors and analysts to deepen their understanding of Automation and learn more about our capabilities as well as those of our partners. This year, our focus will be on the connected enterprise, and how Integrated Control and Information, we also refer to this as ICI, can help our customers become smarter, more productive and more secure. ICI enables us to expand the value we provide to our customers, which results in superior returns for our shareholders. So please mark your calendars and we hope to see many of you there. In closing, I want to thank our employees and partners for their ongoing commitment to our Company's success and to our customers' success. I appreciate and I know our customers appreciate the passion, innovation and integrity and excellence that is evident in how we do business everyday. Here is Ted to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. Ted. Theodore D. Crandall: Thanks Keith. Good morning. I\u2019ll start with Chart 4, which is the third-quarter results summary. So a pretty straightforward quarter, slower growth, pretty much as we anticipated against what was our most difficult year-over-year comparison quarter. Earnings were also inline with our expectations. Revenue in the quarter was $1,650 million, up 2% compared to the third quarter of last year. Organic growth was also 2%. Segment operating earnings in the current period were $326 million, up 3% compared Q3 last year. General corporate net was $18.1 million in Q3 compared to $20.9 million in the same period last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 27.6% compared to an adjusted effective tax rate in the same period last year of 22%. In Q3 last year, we benefited from a large favorable discrete tax item. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.49 that compares to $1.54 in the same quarter last year. The higher tax rate reduced adjusted earnings per share by $0.11. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was 139.6 million. We repurchased approximately 1 million shares in the third quarter at a cost of about $122 million. At the end of Q3, there was $191 million remaining under our $1 billion share repurchase authorization from 2012 and the Board approved an additional 1 billion repurchase authorization on June 4. Through the first nine months of the fiscal year, we've repurchased 2.9 million shares for approximately $344 million, so we\u2019re running a little ahead of the pace to hit the $440 million full year repurchase expectation that we talked about on previous earnings calls. With only one quarter left in the fiscal year, it's likely that we will spend more than the $440 million that we previously projected. Moving to Chart 5. This is the graphical version of total Company results for the third quarter. As I mentioned, year-over-year sales growth was 2%, sales increased 3% sequentially that\u2019s a more typical Q2 to Q3 sequential increase. Last year the sequential increase form Q2 to Q3 was 7%, primarily driven by the Solutions & Service businesses that experienced an 11% sequential increase. Total segment operating margin in Q3 was 19.8%, up 20 basis points compared to last year a modest improvement that's in line with the 2% sales growth. Higher sales and favorable mix were partially offset by increased spending. While on the chart, our trailing four-quarter return on invested capital was 29.6 at the end of the third quarter. Now please turn to Chart 6 which summarizes the third quarter results of the Architecture & Software segment. Looking at the left side of this chart, sales reached $715 million up 7% year-over-year as reported and organically. Sales increased 4% sequentially, so we have seen continued strong revenue performance in the segment. Operating earnings increased 9% year-over-year and the segment operating margins for the quarter was 28.6% that\u2019s an increase of 50 basis points compared to Q3 last year. 7% organic growth provided considerable volume leverage, which more than offset the effect of increased spending. The next page, Chart 7, covers our Control Products & Solutions segment. Compared to Q3 last year, sales were down 2% as reported and organically. The Product businesses grew 2% year-over-year and Solutions & Service businesses declined by 4%. As I mentioned Q3 was a particularly difficult year-over-year comparison for the Solutions & Services businesses. Sales for the segment increased 2% sequentially, with the Product businesses and Solutions & Service businesses, both up about the same. Book-to-bill for Solutions & Service businesses 1.06 in Q3, on the right side of this chart, you will note that operating earnings were a little lower than last year and operating margin declined by 60 basis points year-over-year primarily due to the lower sales. The next chart is the geographic breakdown of our sales in the quarter and year-to-date. Keith covered the regional performance in the quarter, so I'll just make a couple of comments on the year-to-date results. It's been pretty well-balanced growth through the first nine months, with growth in every region with the exception of Canada. Canada is the region with the largest percentage of sales in Solutions & Services and the slow down in the oil sands that we've talked about on previous earnings calls has had a significant negative impact on the year-over-year performance. Clearly, the U.S. continued to be our best-performing region was 7% organic growth through the first nine months, EMEA is up 3% year-to-date. We continue to do well with OEM customers. Asia-Pacific is up 5% year-over-year through June with China up 8%. And Latin America is up 4% with Brazil and Mexico both up about 8% through the first nine months. Generally the year-to-date growth rates by region are pretty much what we\u2019re expecting to see for the full year. I\u2019ll turn that Chart 9, which is free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $274 million, another strong quarter. Year-to-date conversion on adjusted income is about a 106%. Given the year-to-date performance we will probably finish the year somewhat better than the previously projected conversion of about 100%. Turning to the next chart, this provides an EPS walk from the first nine months of last year to the same period this year. Looking at the bridge, adjusted EPS was up 6%, increasing from $4.09 to $4.32. That\u2019s on organic sales growth for the first nine months of 5%. The 6% adjusted EPS growth despite a pretty significant headwind from tax rate, which you can see here as worth about $0.22. Excluding the effect of the higher tax rate, the adjusted EPS growth would have been about a 11%. Segment earnings were up 9% with incremental margin of about 38% in the first nine months. And that takes us to the final slide, Chart 11, which addresses our current outlook for fiscal 2014. As Keith mentioned, we've narrowed our sales and earnings guidance but maintain the previous midpoints. We expect sales to be about $6.64 billion at the midpoint. We expect organic growth for the full year of about 4% to 6% you can think of that is plus or minus about $50 million around the midpoint. We expect the net impact of currency and acquisitions to reduce sales by about 50 basis points. We expect segment margin for the full year to be a little above 20%. We are projecting adjusted EPS in the range of $6.10 to $6.25. We now expect the adjusted tax rate for the full year to be closer to 27.5%. Previously, we expected to realize a discrete tax benefit in Q4 that we now believe we will not occur to next fiscal year. And finally, we expect general corporate net expense to be about $80 million for the full year that\u2019s about $5 million lower than our previous guidance. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rondi. Rondi Rohr-Dralle: Great. Thanks Ted. Before we start Q&A, I'd just like to ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow up and this will allow us to get to as many callers and questions as possible. So we appreciate your cooperation and Annette, let's take our first question. Operator : Thank you (Operator Instructions) Okay and the first question come from the line of John Inch from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead and ask your question. John G. Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Keith D. Nosbusch: Good morning John. Rondi Rohr-Dralle: Good morning John. John G. Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG : Good morning. What was the impact, if you could quantify it, please, of year-over-year and sequential spending in the quarter? And how does that sort of play out in the fourth quarter? Keith D. Nosbusch: Yes, so spending was up about $26 million year-over-year, which is about 6% and it was up about $6 million sequentially, which was about 1% sequential increase. And in the fourth quarter we do not expect any significant sequential increase. John G. Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG : And preliminarily, Keith and Ted, how are you thinking about sort of investment spending against the backdrop? And I admit, I realize you have comparison issues, but the macro isn't exactly rocking and rolling, no pun intended. So how are you thinking about sort of this investment spending, given that we're sort of one quarter away or less than one quarter away, from your fiscal year next year? Keith D. Nosbusch: Well as far as spending for next year, we haven't done any preparation yet for the annual plan at this point. But we certainly have put in additional incremental spending this past year. And we are very pleased with that. We put it in areas that are going to help us mid and long-term in both product development and in the R&D areas and then also in customer facing resources in different regions. So right now we are happy with that investment spending, you saw continued margin improvement in ANS where a lot of that spending has been put and we certainly feel that that will pay dividends down the road and we are pleased that we were able to start spending earlier this year than we have in the past year so very pleased with those investments and we expect them to pay off in the long run. John G. Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG : I guess what I'm trying to understand, Keith, is: The degree to which the spending was concurrent with, say, capacity or sales resourcing versus forward. In other words, the spending we've made this year, does that give you a lot more runway for next year? That\u2019s really all I am trying to understand. Keith D. Nosbusch: Well, if the runway means that we won't increase spending again, I think that will be dependent upon what we think the revenue performance will be next year. We certainly believe that our spending does not correlate directly to quarter-by-quarter of performance and as we've said our spending is really in anticipation of six to eight quarters out which is new product development time as well as new customer ramp-up time to full productivity. So we hope quite frankly we hope we can continue to increase spending next year in development and in customer facing resources and if the revenue projections continue to enable that, we certainly have more opportunities in our businesses to invest in. John G. Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG : That's fair. And then just as a follow-up, what is your frontlog telling you? And obviously, this earnings season has been characterized by pretty slow organic growth. How are you guys thinking about maybe the cycle and this notion perhaps the cycle has peaked for automation investment in terms of, say, North America, rest of world? Keith D. Nosbusch: Our frontlog has remained stable over the quarter, and and it's been at a good level throughout the year. So we did not see a meaningful change in the frontlog this past quarter. So we think it's still pretty viable and certainly is what we are viewing as why we are expecting higher year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. So it's our frontlog, we built our backlog last quarter. So we think those are both good indicators why we are able to continue to expect the high, I'm sorry not high, higher year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. John G. Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG : Thanks very much. Keith D. Nosbusch: You\u2019re welcome, John thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next line of question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead. Scott R. Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Thank you operator. Good morning guys. Keith D. Nosbusch: Good morning Scott. Scott R. Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : I'm trying to figure out a little bit of how much resource-related stuff, and mining, in particular, impacted your non-U.S. business, because the extent of deceleration was a little bit surprising outside of the U.S. And I'm just trying to understand, is there something broader than resource and mining, or is it just a fairly big impact from that? Keith D. Nosbusch: Sure. I think there's two things, Scott. Certainly mining, if you look at Latin America, and you look at South Africa in the EMEA region and in Australia, in our Asia-Pacific region Australia, China, and to some degree Canada quite frankly would also be impacted. That's one of the reasons why you've seen the decline year-over-year in our Solutions & Services business with a lot of it coming from really our motor control both medium voltage and motor control centers. So that's one area and I would say probably a significant part of the declined this quarter is because of those businesses in the mining industry. The second is just some project timing. And you know we\u2019ve talked about this all the time that it is hard to look at exactly how projects come in and go out on a quarter-by-quarter basis in a comparison year-over-year and quite frankly last year was a very, very strong shipment quarter and this year some projects slipped out and it was a little lighter in general. We knew it was going to be lighter which is why we mentioned that in the last quarter. But also at the end of the quarter a few things slipped into Q4. So its really those two dynamics that we are going on that we really think is what is behind the solutions and performance minus 4% in the quarter. Theodore D. Crandall: I think to your point Scott we view what you are referred to as deceleration of more as kind of a project timing issue than an underlying market conditions issue. We had some tailwind from project timing in the first half and we've got some headwinds now. Scott R. Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : That's really helpful. Guys, just \u2013 and I'm asking you to take how your crystal ball. I know it's hard in the businesses you're in, but Canada was a bit surprising. We talked about resource industries we know, but some lot of \u2013 of your peers have seen a snapback in Canada this quarter, and a better order book for next quarter. Do you have a sense of when that business flat lines out and starts to improve again, or at least, are we at a, what I'll call, a cycle low at this point? If sense of that. Keith D. Nosbusch: I mean given that its project Canada is a very heavily project oriented region for us. It's very hard to say exactly when we are at the bottom or not, but we do I mean specific to your question we do expect sequential growth in the low single-digits about 4% in Canada in our fourth quarter. So if that happens that sequential growth that we've seen this quarter. Scott R. Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Yes that would be a big deal. You go from a negative 8% to a positive 4%, I would imagine that has a\u2026 Keith D. Nosbusch: We saw this growth for up 4%. So we think we are in the rebound stage of the investments to your point Scott R. Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Okay. Keith D. Nosbusch: So Q3 this quarter we saw a little sequential growth and we think that bodes well for going forward in the resource industries. Scott R. Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Okay great thanks, I\u2019ll pass it on. Thanks guys. Keith D. Nosbusch: Thank you Scott. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next line of question comes from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed. Richard M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Hi, good morning everyone. Keith D. Nosbusch: Good morning Rich. Richard M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Two questions : On process \u2013 so you brought the full year down \u2013 full-year growth down. You referenced timing of projects. Where, geographically, are you seeing the biggest push-outs? I imagine there's \u2013 we covered Canada a bit, but if you could provide some more color on that? And then just, are there large projects, I assume that are going to help next year as well, and some of those projects that maybe thought were to hit this past quarter have been pushed out longer, or any additional color there, Keith, would be helpful. Thanks. Keith D. Nosbusch: Sure. Well I think where we've seen the biggest push outs have been in Asia Pacific in particular China, and then also in Latin America. Those would be the two regions that had the greatest effect. I don't think we are ready to talk about 2015 yet, but our frontlog in process in our solutions businesses doesn't indicate that we are going to see any significant change in the near-term. So, we are feeling optimistic about the solutions business going forward. Richard M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay, and then just broadly speaking about projects in general \u2013 so, some of the push out in terms of Q4, typically solutions is pretty important to Q4 results. What are you assuming in the guide in terms of just the ramp and recovery of stuff that may have been delayed this quarter? Is there anything unusual in terms of bigger than normal rebound on delivery of solutions? Keith D. Nosbusch: Yes, I would say what we are expecting is a pretty normal Q3 to Q4 ramp in solutions. And we are reasonably comfortable with what's in the guidance based on what's in backlog at the end of Q3. Richard M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay and I just the quick follow-up on I know 2015 it's early but on the tax rate, Ted you would talked about the discrete items affecting next year should we think of the tax rate being lower in next year preliminarily? Theodore D. Crandall: I mean I think we\u2019re talking about at this little bit in the past I think going forward kind of at these levels of income, something around 27% is probably a pretty reasonable tax rate to think about. Richard M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay. Thank you. Keith D. Nosbusch: Thank you, Rich. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next line of question comes from the line of us Steve Tusa of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. C. Stephen Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan : Hey, good morning. Keith D. Nosbusch: Good morning, Steve. C. Stephen Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan : Just a question on Latin America, you mentioned that you know expected to come back in this project timing I mean it sounds like it's kind of a debacle down there especially in Brazil. Now you guys have some consumer exposure and you\u2019re definitely a high-quality franchise in that market, but its macro just sounds pretty bad down there. What are you seeing that kind of gives you the optimism in the face of that? Theodore D. Crandall: Well, I would say right now our backlog in our solutions businesses. We feel good about the Q4 and I mentioned that we are expecting to see double digit year-over-year growth in both Mexico and Brazil in Q4 and in a lot of cases that will be because of the solutions backlog that we expect to ship in the fourth quarter. Now obviously if to your point there is a bigger, I'll just say external factor that creates more problems of particularly with the elections going on in Brazil, there's definitely some political/economic risk in Brazil as we walk up to the fall elections and I would say it's probably a little dicier than it would have been in a normal fourth quarter for us. So we are watching it. At this point in time we haven't seen anything that would deviate from \u2013 that would causes us to deviate from our current expectations, but we know what happens in political elections. C. Stephen Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan : Right. And then, obviously, beyond your control. And then, Ted, just on the margin in the fourth quarter, last year there was a pretty significant amount of noise. I mean, in architecture & software, your margin was up 200 basis points sequentially, but if you look back in the model, it really has a tendency to be flat to even down sequentially. I still don't know if that makes sense when you strip out all the noise from the fourth quarter of 2013, so maybe given these segments are kind of moving around a little bit in the fourth quarter, can you give us some sort of a high-level framework for how these two fit into that annual margin guidance for the fourth quarter? Theodore D. Crandall: Well, I think consistent with prior practice I'm probably not going to help a lot on a by segment look at margins in the fourth quarter, but what I would say is we are expecting and it\u2019s obviously can do the math it's applies to guidance a pretty significant step up sequentially and margin, which is largely a consequence of just significantly higher sales as we go from Q3 to Q4. C. Stephen Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan : All right. Okay, thanks. That's helpful. Thank you. Keith D. Nosbusch: Thank you, Steve. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse : Hi, thank you. Just a question around some of the order activities, I guess some of your peers have sounded pretty positive around process automation orders. Your sales on the last call sounded good about pulp and paper, and oil and gas, demand. So I realize that there's a kind of a pause between project placement and the execution of the project. But maybe give a sense of how much your process business was up in orders, and what the overall backlog did year-on-year? Keith D. Nosbusch: With process our orders were I think flat year-over-year in the quarter. And we did build process backlog in the quarter. So at this point, we feel that we will continue to see growth in our Q4 and certainly into the start of 2015 that we basically think of backlog as one to two quarters in our business and I would say we continue to feel that oil and gas will drive the big portion of our process business with continued interest in activity and quotation in the chemical side of the business and that's an area where we think we can continue to grow based upon our process control capabilities, our safety capabilities, and our motor control capabilities and we think that will create more opportunities and historically we've had in the chemical segments. So continued strength in oil and gas to your point of pulp and paper in the U.S., anyway investments are being made and our most difficult process areas will be that the mining and the metals will be the two most difficult segments going forward and we really don't see a significant improvement in either one of those in the short-term. Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse : Thanks. And then within the EMEA region, the organic growth dropped back a bit. You had sort of four quarters of 3% to 5% growth. Was the firm you saw just a comps issue? And I guess, was there any difference you saw between emerging EMEA and the trends in sort of Western and central Europe in terms of customer behavior? Keith D. Nosbusch: Well, it was probably another generally typical quarter with respect to the geography and we saw greater growth in the North and particular Germany and the U.K. and I would say in emerging some greater difficulty because of Russia. Russia was a difficult third quarter for us, obviously, everyone understands what's going on there. And South America \u2013 South Africa I\u2019m sorry continued to say a weak although the mining has been the mining strikes have been stopped and we are starting to see some activity, but that did not happen in the third quarter at all. So the emerging is split with growth in Eastern Europe and growth in the Middle East, but heavily influenced by the impact in Russia and South Africa to where actually emerging Europe was down slightly in Q3. So basically mature Europe carried the day in the quarter and as I said that was driven by strong performance in the north. Theodore D. Crandall: And you know, Julian I think though we've always said there are some normal variability in quarter-to-quarter results and I think the 1% this quarter in Europe would chalk up more to normal variability then we would to a significant change in underlying market conditions. Keith D. Nosbusch: Yes, I think we continue to believe there is a slow steady growth in particular in the mature our European countries and I think the economic data in our product business performance would support that. And then we got the variability that Ted mentioned. Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse : Great, thank you. Keith D. Nosbusch: You're welcome, Julian. Operator : Thank you. The next line of question comes from Richard Eastman of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Richard C. Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good morning. Keith D. Nosbusch: Good morning, Richard. Richard C. Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Keith, could you just give a perspective perhaps on your maybe two or three best-growing end markets in the quarter? I mean, for instance, how did auto hold up? And oil and gas was presumably your better market, but just two or three best markets? Keith D. Nosbusch: Yes, well, I would say that in the quarter the best markets were oil and gas to your point, food and beverage and tire, would be the three best markets. Richard C. Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And as your frontlog may or may not indicate, what does the auto and tire business look like as we trend through the fourth quarter and into early 2015? Are you fairly confident that we can maintain some growth there, whether it's low-single or mid-single-digit growth in that kind of transportation end market? Keith D. Nosbusch: Well, I think it will be low growth, because it's at a high level. So, we are not going to see a meaningful acceleration, but we are expecting overall global that will have a stable low single-digit growth in transportation as we go through Q4. Richard C. Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay and then, just one follow-up for Ted. When I do the incremental segment margins or incremental margins just in general, for the fourth quarter, they would appear to be pretty high. Seemingly, even at the midpoint, maybe above normal. And is that, again \u2013 is that driven by volume? Theodore D. Crandall: : Richard C. Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yes, okay. Theodore D. Crandall: And it is driven by volume and also on a sequential basis, just not a lot of spending increase as we go from Q3 to Q4. Richard C. Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, all right, limited spending. Okay, excellent. All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. And, the next question comes from of Mark Douglass of Longbow Research. Please go ahead. D. Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research LLC : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Keith D. Nosbusch: Good morning, Mark. D. Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research LLC : Keith, you mentioned that you're doing well with the OEMs in Europe. Does that imply that the OEM market is flat to down maybe in Europe? What's the market like right now, and what are your expectations for the market over the next few quarters? Keith D. Nosbusch: If I left that impression that would be incorrect. The OEM market is growing in Europe. We are continuing to drive conversions. The fact that our European market was slightly up was more driven by the Solutions & Services variability that happens in the quarter, but we continue to see product growth in Europe. It's one of the reasons I mentioned motion had a good quarter which reinforces that also safety had a good quarter and that is also associated with success at OEM. So if you look at some of the European statistics and the most relevant one would be the German DD&A Association they projected a plus 3% growth for calendar 2014. So we\u2019re still seeing growth in Europe in the OEM space and that's been quite frankly one of the highlights for us in Europe and the team there is doing a great job. D. Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research LLC : Well, I guess what I was highlighting is : How much are you outgrowing the OEM market itself? If it's 3%? Are you doing better than that as appose your \u2013 or total Europe. Keith D. Nosbusch: I think we\u2019re probably almost double the underlying market. D. Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research LLC : Okay. And then back on to process, are there challenges in executing your process initiative, or is it just happen to be the markets that you are exposed to versus the overall process automation space, because the process automation pace seems to be outpacing where your process growth is. Can you speak to that? Keith D. Nosbusch: Well I think what you may be seeing is more from an order standpoint and as appose to sales, but I don't think \u2013 right now I would not say we are having execution problems in executing our process initiative at all. That is not what I would put it on, we don't see any greater losses in our project, the win rates stays consistent, we continue to expand the footprint and our ability to address more applications and more industries, in particular there I'm referring to our growing capabilities in the chemical industry and of course we don't participate in the power generation distribution or refining and those tend to be our large projects and probably a little more market awareness because of the size of those of those projects, but we think we\u2019re doing just fine. Actually on a global basis in the process space and it continues to be our best growth opportunity so right now I would put it on timing and I would be the first to tell you when we believe it is not bad. D. Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research LLC : Okay, thank you Operator : Thank you for your questions. The next line of question comes from Jeremie Capron of CLSA Please go ahead. Jeremie Capron \u2013 CLSA: Hi. Good morning, everybody Keith D. Nosbusch: Good morning Jeremy Jeremie Capron \u2013 CLSA: A question on the Asia- Pacific region : You said business in China was down year-over-year. Yet we're seeing pretty solid growth from a number of automation companies that have a larger presence in the country. And when I look at your Asia-Pacific revenue this quarter, $221 million is flat year-over-year, but it's pretty much the same as two years ago, and it's still lower than three years ago. So I'm wondering, could you help us understand what's holding you back in that region, both in terms of the near-term dynamics and over that three-year period? Keith D. Nosbusch: Well I don't have the three-year numbers here, so I can't comment on that fact and that's something we\u2019ll follow-up with you on after the call, but with respect to the region, I would say our biggest challenge quite frankly has been India. And over the last couple of years we have seen significant reduction in our sales in India and that's probably been the biggest factor in the performance in the region. I think overall we continue to see growth opportunities in China, we are achieving growth in some of the mature markets, we've had good growth in Japan over that three year period and the only other one I would put in the category of India would be Australia and that\u2019s where its been challenging obviously some of the strength in the Australian dollar over the last two years, the impact in mining and some of the decline of the manufacturing sector in Australia would be the other area where we see the weakness. So if you take out Australia and India, we still believe that we've been growing in the region and that our position has not been compromised or is significantly different than our competitors. Theodore D. Crandall: Hey Jeremie this is Ted. The thing I would add and this strictly about China and strictly about the last year. We were down 5% in China, but we were up 16% sequentially in China in the quarter and year-to-date we\u2019re up 8%. The sequential comparison or the year-over-year comparison in Q3 in China down five that's against the quarter last year when our sequential growth from Q2 to Q3 last year was 40%. So we believe the 8% year-to-date growth is much more indicative of our underlying performance and frankly the underlying performance of the market than the third quarter. Keith D. Nosbusch: We don't think is much different than the competition in that regard either. Jeremie Capron \u2013 CLSA: Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you. And Ted, as we've gone through the share buybacks, so you're running a little ahead of the initial plan, and you've got a new authorization out there. Should we expect the buybacks to continue well into next year? Theodore D. Crandall: I think the expectation should be that we will continue to exhaust our free cash flow after acquisition spending on dividend and share repurchase. And so we will do that this year. We've may run a little but ahead of that depending on how cash flow comes in Q4 and depending on what we spend in Q4, but I think that's what your expectation should be going forward. Jeremie Capron \u2013 CLSA: All right. That's very clear. Thank you very much. Keith D. Nosbusch: Thank you. Rondi Rohr Dralle : We are at 8 :30 Central U.S. time here, but I think we\u2019ll keep going for a couple more questions because we got a late start. Okay. Operator : Thank you the next line of questions comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed. Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: Thanks for fitting me in and good morning Keith D. Nosbusch: Good morning Steve. Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: Ted, just on the backlog question, I guess backlog is normally about 20% or so of next 12-months' sales and for, I guess, CP&S is like 30%. And for one quarter out, that number, is it closer to 50%, because what I'm trying to get at here obviously is just your confidence level in not just the backlog piece of this, but the non-backlog piece that's allowing you to forecast the significant step-up next quarter? Theodore D. Crandall: Well Steve I think you know about roughly two thirds of our business is product sales where the backlog frankly isn't that important as a measure of performance in the next quarter. And a third of our business is Solutions & Services were with only one quarter to go the backlog is very important. So I would say on that third business, we have a pretty high level of confidence in our ability to deliver the sales and Solutions & Services. One the product side, I would say our confidence is less about backlog than it is about year-to-date performance in that business. The sales in order trends we saw as we came through Q3 and what we've heard from both our salespeople and our channel about expectations for Q4. Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: Okay, all right. That's helpful. And then on the incremental margin side, therefore, to get to that 40% to 50%, you mentioned it's mostly volume. Is there any risk? You mentioned the spending is up or flat sequentially. Does that mean also \u2013 sorry, year-on-year in Q4, is that about 5% or 6% again, or is that less year-on-year, the spending increase? Theodore D. Crandall: I would expect the year-over-year increase in Q4 to be closer to 3%. Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: 3%, right. Okay. And the risk factor there very low at this point? Theodore D. Crandall: Well I mean there are lot of factor that can influence the incremental margin, especially since it\u2019s a kind of second order measure, but I would say on the spending side I don\u2019t think there is a large risk of having a significant miss on spending. Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: Right. And pricing also? Theodore D. Crandall: In pricing also I don\u2019t think is, in terms of our assumption for the quarters I don\u2019t believe are risky. Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: Right so it's back to volume. Okay. And sorry, one other sort of larger question, again. Ted or actually Keith on this, we've talked a lot in the past at prior Automation Fairs about the question of increasing competition on the process side as you guys have gained share and grown and other folks are trying to get their acts together there to come back. It's been a little while now. Are you seeing any kind of advancement in some of your competitive space here that's having any kind of impact on growth rates for you? Keith D. Nosbusch: No I don\u2019t think we had \u2013 we seen any change, we continue to compete based upon what we would call the modern DCS, which is plant wide optimization that we offer, its huge differentiator and then in some cases again certain process controlled companies we have intelligent motor control and in some industries that combination between control and power is very important and it\u2019s a differentiator that we have. So we continue to be able to compete in both Brownfield as well as Greenfield applications, we certainly \u2013 it\u2019s a tough market to your point, but we can feel that we can continue to grow share as we proceed and have it be one of the factors that gives us the opportunity to drive revenue growth. Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: Okay, great. I'll pass it on, thanks. Keith D. Nosbusch: Thank you. Theodore D. Crandall: Okay. Rondi Rohr-Dralle: Thanks Steve. Annette, we are just going to take one last question here and then we\u2019ll wrap up the call after that. Okay? Operator : Okay. Thank you. The last question comes from the line Andrew Obin of Band of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed. Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks a lot for squeezing me in. Can you just give in terms of growth through the quarter, I understand the comps issue, but did the growth accelerate, orders growth accelerate through the quarter or stable and sort of decelerated? And specifically, if you could comment what you are seeing in the U.S.? Theodore D. Crandall: The quarter played out a little similar to Q3 and we did see acceleration as we went through the quarter in particular June was the strongest month in the quarter and we see that continue as we have gone into July at this point. Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks a lot. Theodore D. Crandall: You are welcome. Thank you. Rondi Rohr-Dralle: Okay. All right well. Yes sorry again for the delay at the start of this call. I appreciate your patience on that. We\u2019ll try to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen again and I\u2019m available obviously for calls after this. So thanks for joining us everyone. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s conference call. At this time, you may now disconnect. Thank you.",

Bernstein & Company, Inc. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Operator :  Thank you for holding and welcome to the Rockwell Automation's Quarterly Conference Call. I need to remind everyone that today's conference is being recorded. Later in the call, we will open up the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rondi Rohr-Dralle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rohr-Dralle. Please go ahead. Rondi Rohr-Dralle: Thanks Ian. Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's fourth quarter fiscal 2014 earnings release conference call. With me today are Keith Nosbusch, our Chairman and CEO and Ted Crandall our Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda includes opening remarks by Keith that include highlights on the company's performance in the fourth quarter and the full year and then some context around our outlook for fiscal 2015. Then Ted, will provide more details on the results as well as our sales and adjusted earnings per share guidance. As always we'll take questions at the end of Ted's remarks. We expect the call to take about an hour today. Our results were released this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website, at www.rockwellautomation.com. Please note both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is accessible at that website and will be available for replay for the next 30-days. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. So with that, I'll turn it over to Keith. Keith Nosbusch : Thanks Rondi, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll start with the highlights for the quarter and the full year, so please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck. Q4 results came in very close to the expectations we laid out on the July earnings call. Organic growth of over 4% in the quarter continued the pattern we saw most of the year, with product business growth exceeding growth in our solutions and services businesses. There was an unexpected currency headwind in the quarter due to the strengthening U.S. dollar. Profitability was strong in the quarter with over 22% segment operating margin. Q4 tends to be one of our better margin quarters and this was true for both segments this quarter. Adjusted earnings per share grew 15% and cash flow was good. So, very strong earnings performance and good sales growth in Q4. Ted will provide more details on the quarter, so I'll move to the full year. As we entered fiscal 2014, we told you to expect higher year-over-year growth rates in the first half of the year than in the second half and that is how the year played out. Fiscal 2014 sales by region were about as expected with the exception of stronger sales in the U.S. and weaker sales in Canada. Speaking to organic growth rates, the U.S. had a strong year with 7% growth and oil and gas was the best performing vertical. Canada was down 1% primarily due to weakness in resource based industries, the EMEA region grew 2% with 7% growth in emerging markets. Emerging markets represent about 20% of the EMEA region. Western Europe was mixed with the U.K. and Italy up, Germany flat and France down year-over-year. Asia Pacific came in as expected with 5% organic growth through the year. China grew 6% with food and beverage at the highest growth vertical, our OEM business continues to grow [technical difficulty] total sales in China. Although still in the early stages and we're starting to see the anticipated step up in manufacturing investment for consumer package goods. India grew 10% this year, albeit of easy comparison, but it appears that the weak industrial environment of the past few years has finally turned the corner. Latin America grew 6% for the year with strong sales in both Mexico and Brazil overcoming weakness in other parts of the region. Globally, we had another year of solid performance with OEMs. We continue to broaden our content on machines, which is reflected in strength in our motion and safety businesses this year. Here are a couple of other data points that are down the slide. Logic sales were up 7% this year. The compact logic portion is growing even faster than this with the highest growth rates in Asia Pacific. Process sales were up 4% for the year. This is below the growth rate we expected at the beginning of the year and certainly below where we need this business to be. Weakness in metals, and mining, and EMEA in Asia and the lack of business in Venezuela, turned out to be larger headwinds than we expected. Having said that, we continue to invest in our process capabilities, we are expanding our installed base of process control and continue to believe that processes are best growth opportunity. Let me just wrap up on the year before I move on to the outlook. Fiscal 2014 was another year of record sales and earnings for the company. For the second year in a row we expanded segment operating margin almost a point, while continuing to invest for growth. These results would not be possible without the efforts of our employees, partners and suppliers, and I want to thank them all for their ongoing commitment to our customers and their contributions to our success. Our strong track record of returning cash to shareholders continued in fiscal 2014 with over $800 million in dividends and share repurchases. That represents 87% of free cash flow for the year. As you probably saw, we raised a dividend last week which more than doubles our dividend per share in the last five years. During fiscal 2014, we also authorized an additional $1 billion in share repurchase. I'm proud to say, that during the last five years we've returned $2.8 billion of cash to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. I keep looking forward to a year when everything is stable and the outlook is very clear, but I guess that's just wishful thinking. Here is what we are seeing out there. We are in the world of greater geopolitical uncertainty, falling oil prices and a stronger U.S. dollar. The U.S. economy remains strong but recently some Western European countries have slowed and there is heightened uncertainty related to Russia, Ukraine and therefore the Middle East. In China, overcapacity, lack of liquidity, and underperforming loans are still weighing on economic growth, and Brazil is in a recession. Having said that from a global macroeconomic perspective, forecast for GDP and industrial production, call for continued moderate growth in 2015. Most manufacturing PMIs are still above 50, and the U.S. PMI has been above 55 since June. More specific to Rockwell and the automation market, the need for productivity and modernization, growing consumer demand in emerging markets and the connected enterprise are key drivers fueling continued market growth, and I believe we have the right strategy to capitalize on these opportunities. Taking all of these factors into consideration, we expect total company organic sales growth in the range of 2.5% to 6.5% in fiscal 2015.And we are initiating fiscal 2015 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.55 to $6.95. With another solid year in our sights, we continue to invest in innovative technology and domain expertise to expand the value we provide to customers while delivering superior returns to our shareowners. Before I end my remarks, I\u2019d like to give you a little preview of Automation Fair. For those of you who haven\u2019t been to an Automation Fair, we expect to host thousands of customers and partners from all over the world. It's a great opportunity for us to showcase our capability, provide technical training, and facilitate best practice sharing among our customers. It's taking place in Anaheim this year, and we will have an emphasis on the connected enterprise and how we are helping customers drive to the next level of productivity with our Integrated Control and Information portfolio. If you're coming to Anaheim next Thursday, you\u2019ll hear from John McDermott, our Head of Global Sales and Marketing, Terry Gebert, who leads our Global Systems & Solutions business, and from one of our process system integrator partners. Then we'll take you on a hosted tour of the show floor, after lunch we'll hold a webcast where Frank Kulaszewicz, Blake Moret, Ted, and I will talk more about our strategy and progress on the connected enterprise and Integrated Control and Information. We hope you'll take advantage of this opportunity and we look forward to seeing many of you there. So now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Ted. Ted? Ted Crandall : Thanks, Keith, and good morning, every one. You\u2019ll note that we\u2019ve made some changes to several of the slides. We hope you\u2019ll find the new formats more informative and helpful. I\u2019ll start with Page 4, fourth quarter key financial information. As Keith mentioned, organic growth, sales performance across the regions, and adjusted EPS were all pretty much as we expected and consistent with the mid-point of our guidance from July. Currency turned out to be a headwind. We didn't expect that at the beginning of the quarter. Sales in the quarter were $1,782 billion, an increase of 3.9% compared to Q4 last year. Organic sales growth was 4.4%, currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 70 basis points. Segment operating margin was very strong at 22.2%, that's up 130 basis points from Q4 last year. The year-over-year margin increase was primarily due to the higher sales partially offset by some increased spending. You might recall that in Q4 of 2013, margin included some significant income from legal settlements and some larger restructuring charges, in the year-over-year comparison if you net legal settlement income and restructuring charges, we faced about $9 million margin headwind in Q4 of 2014. General corporate net expense was $22.3 million in Q4, compared to $39.7 million a year ago. Last year, GCN expense included a $12 million charge related to legacy environmental matters. That item accounts for the largest share of the year-over-year difference. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.86, up $0.24 or 15% compared to last year. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were $138.5 million. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 27%, compared to 23.7% in Q4 last year. I\u2019ll provide more color on tax rate when I cover the full year results. Free cash flow for Q4 was $282 million, a little below Q4, 2013, but a very good result. Conversion on adjusted income was 110% in Q4. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares at a cost of $140 million, for the full year we repurchased a total of 4.1 million shares at a cost of $484 million. That was about 10% more than the $440 million we projected at the beginning of the year, and related to our strong cash flow performance. Our trailing four quarter return on invested capital was 30.1%, that's a little below last year but still about 30%, and we consider that to be a best-in-class result. Turning to Page 5, this is the full year version of the key financial information. Sales reached $6,624 billion for the full year, up 4.3%. Organic growth was 5.1%, currency translation reduced sales by almost one full point. Segment operating margin for the full year was 20.4%, up 90 basis points from last year. Earnings conversion was 42% for the year. We realized very good leverage on the higher sales that more than offset spending increases. Spending for the full year increased pretty much inline with the sales growth. Adjusted EPS was $6.17, up 8% compared to last year. And as Keith already mentioned, that represents another year of record sales in EPS for the company. Free cash flow for the full year was $922 million, which was 107% conversion on adjusted income. The next slide provides an adjusted EPS walk comparing the full year 2014, to 2013. I\u2019ll just hit a couple of items here. Lower general corporate net expense contributed $0.08 to the adjusted EPS improvement. For the full year GCN was $81 million, down from $97 million in 2013. GCN expense was unusually high in 2013, primarily due to the legacy environmental charges that we took in fourth quarter of 2013, that I mentioned previously. Moving to the far right side, you can see on the bridge that we picked up an additional $0.04 from reduced share count in 2014. And then coming back to tax rate, the increase adjusted effective tax rate in fiscal 2014 reduced the adjusted EPS by $0.30. The year-over-year increase in the rate is primarily due to significant net favorable discrete items realized in fiscal 2013, and a smaller amount of net unfavorable similar items realized in fiscal 2014. Excluding the effect of the higher tax rate, adjusted EPS would have increased by 13%. The next two slides present a graphical view of the sales and operating margin performance of each segment. I\u2019ll start with the architecture and software segment on Page 7. I'll cover Q4 and then the full year. On the left side of this chart, you can see that architecture and software segment sales reached $747 million in Q4, an increase of 4.6% compared to Q4 last year. Organic growth was 5.2%. Moving to the right side of the chart, on the 5.2% organic growth ANS margins increased by 60 basis points to 31.1%. A great quarter for the segment was strong conversion despite the headwind from the legal settlement income in Q4 of last year. For the full year, ANS sales were up 6.1% as reported, with 6.8% organic growth. We're very pleased to see that high rate of growth and almost profitable segment. Segment operating margin for the full year was 29.5%, up 120 basis points from 2013. Now, I'll turn to Page 8, a similar view for the Control Products & Solutions segment. In the fourth quarter, Control Products & Solutions segment sales increased by 3.3% year-over-year, as organic growth of 3.8%. Organic growth for products, sales and segment was 5.3% about the same as architecture and software, organic growth for solutions and services sales was 3%. The book-to-bill in Q4 per solutions and services was 0.84%. That's low. We expected something more in the range of 0.9% to 0.95%. You might remember we experienced the similar book-to-bill at the end of 2012. This past quarter was not quite as low as Q4 2012, but we ended fiscal 2014 with lower than expected backlog and that will have a negative impact on solutions and services sales in the first half of fiscal 2015. CP&S delivered very good operating margin in Q4 at 15.8%, that's up 180 basis points compared to last year. Q4 is generally the strongest margin quarter in this segment. The operating margin increase was quite strong leverage on higher sales and good productivity in the quarter. For the full year CP&S sales reached $3,778 billion up 3% year-over-year or 3.8% organic growth. Organic growth for product business sales and the segment was 4.7% for the full year and 3.2% for solutions and services. CP&S segment operating margins for the full year was 13.6%, an increase of 60 basis points compared to 2013. Page 9, provides a geographic breakdown of our sales and shows organic growth results for the quarter and for the full year. Keith provided a good deal of color on the full year results, I'll just speak to the quarter. U.S. growth in Q4 at 5% will continue to see a very healthy underlying market. In Q4 oil and gas and home and personal care verticals were the highest growth. Canada delivered a quarter of positive growth at 6%. The underlying market in Canada remains relatively weak. The results in Q4 are more about project timing and driven primarily by automotive and consumer. EMEA was down slightly in the quarter. The emerging countries in aggregate experienced some modest growth. For Western Europe was down about two points year-over-year. Two of the weaker verticals in the quarter were metals and water wastewater. In Asia Pacific sales were up 5% year-over-year in Q4. India was up over 20%. We are pleased to see India continue to demonstrate growth, admittedly off an easy comparison. China was up 1% year-over-year in Q4. Based on the amount of project business in China and last year's quarterly comparisons, I think the full year growth rate for 2014 of 6% is a better indicator of underlying market conditions and our performance. In Q4 in China the strongest verticals were consumer industries. In Latin America another good quarter with 12% growth once again led by Brazil and Mexico. Both countries had solid double-digit growth rates and that allowed for the 12% overall region growth despite a significant year-over-year decline in Venezuela. Best verticals in Latin America in Q4 were consumer industries. Organic growth in emerging markets was 8% led by Latin America. And that takes us to the fiscal 2015 guidance slide. Just to reinforce some of Keith's comments on the macro outlook, in 2015 we expect global GDP and IP growth to be similar to last year. With IP growth in North America lower than in 2014, but IP growth somewhat higher in the other regions compared to 2014. We expect fiscal 2015 sales to be approximately $6.8 billion plus or minus about 2%. That's an organic growth range of 2.5% to 6.5%. By region, we expect growth rates in 2015 to be similar to last year. The U.S., Asia Pacific and Latin America should all see mid-single digit growth. We expect EMEA to be low single digit growth with growth driven primarily by emerging EMEA. This is the region we are watching most closely due to recent macro data and political uncertainties. We expect Canada to be about flat year-over-year for 2015 with continued weakness in the oil sands. Based on the beginning solutions and services backlog and recent order trends, we expect 2015 to be a second year of higher growth in our product businesses, about 5% organic growth compared to 3% organic growth in our solutions and services businesses. We expect currency to reduce sales by above 180 basis points next year. That\u2019s significant and primarily weaker Europe. Our projection for translation impact assumes average rates for 2015 at above the average level for October. For example, we're assuming an average euro rate of 1.27. Yesterday the euro rate was 1.24, if it stays that way for the full year, we'll have additional translation headwind to contend with. We expect segment operating margins to be about 21% that would be about half point increase compared to 2014 with conversion margin of about 35%. We expect the full year tax rate to be about 27%, a little over than in 2014. Our guidance for adjusted EPS is $6.55 to $6.95. We expect free cash flow conversion on adjusted income of about 100%. And there are a couple of other items not shown here. General corporate net expense should be approximately $80 million next year. We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about $136 million for the full year. Because of the lower than expected backlog at the end of 2014, you should expect a slower than normal start in Q1. We typically see a sequential decline in total company sales from Q4 to Q1 but in 2015 that's likely to be at larger than average client. Reported sales in Q1 will likely be down year-over-year with headwind from currency and roughly flat organic growth, the flat organic growth due to the lower backlog in solutions and services. The final slide on Page 11 provides a walk from fiscal 2014 to fiscal year 2015 for adjusted EPS at the mid point of guidance. I'll start with operating pension expense. Interest rates dropped over the course of 2014 and that's created a $0.04 headwind in operating pension expense for 2015. I mentioned currency effects on the prior chart. We expect currency effects to reduce earnings next year by about $0.17. The lower tax rate contributes about $0.05 increase. We expect share count increased adjusted EPS by $0.17 in 2015. We intend to continue to return excess free cash flow to investors. We announced the 12% increase in the dividend last week as Keith mentioned. The amount we spend on share repurchase in 2015 will depend on free cash flow and acquisition spending. But assuming 100% conversion on adjusted income and about $100 million of spending on acquisitions, we would expect to spend about $470 million on repurchases in 2015. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rondi for questions. Rondi Rohr-Dralle: Great. Thanks Ted. Before we get started, I'd just like to remind you that and ask you to limit yourself to one question and a follow up and then if you have another question on a different topic to get back in the queue. So we\u2019d appreciate that. Ian, let's go ahead and take our first caller. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Please go ahead, Scott. Scott Davis - Barclays Capital : Good morning, everybody. Keith Nosbusch :  Good morning, Scott. Rondi Rohr-Dralle:  Hi, Scott. Scott Davis - Barclays Capital : I know it's tough. You guys don't have a lot of visibility so guidance can be a little challenging, but what does it -- historically if you go back and look at longer data series, what does it mean when solutions and services comes in week like that? Is there a canary in a coal mine effect there, or is it just a lumpy enough business where we shouldn't read too much into it? Keith Nosbusch : I think historically it's been a lumpy business and there is not a lot to read into it with a quarter or two of data. I think if you go back to 2012 which Ted referenced, the second half of 2013 was very strong in the solutions business. So I think it's just a matter of the ability to rebuild the backlog particularly in the SSB portion of that business and the medium voltage portion of that business. And right now from a front log standpoint, we still see activity other than some project push-outs and delays because of the commentary that Ted and I talked about with respect to whether its geopolitical or economic uncertainty in some of the regions in particularly Asia Pacific and EMEA. We are still seeing and are still quoting at a \u2013 I'll say pre-Q4 rate. So we don't see the indication of one quarter of, quit candidly week book-to-bills that it's telling us anything at this time. Scott Davis - Barclays Capital :  Okay. And as a follow up, can you give us a sense of there's -- you'll have an increased headwind maybe with oil and gas, but when you think about mining which has been tough for the last couple of years, does that turn the corner for you in 2015 and start to become a neutral or at least potentially a modest tailwind from a very low level? Keith Nosbusch :  Well we would expect it to be a neutral, I mean that is our plan. I think the upside would come from the opportunity to see China grow a little faster and drive demand at a higher rate than they have this past year. And the other part would be the conversion of spending from I'll say CapEx to operating spending where they\u2019re trying to drive productivity. And I think there is a lot of emphasis particularly in some of the larger mining companies to now focus on productivity and generating better asset utilization on their existing investment. So, I think that\u2019s the other space that we can look for. But right now we see mining as a neutral next year. Scott Davis - Barclays Capital : Okay. Fair enough. I'll pass it on. I'll see you guys next week. Keith Nosbusch : Thanks for coming Scott. We will see you then. Thank you. Operator :  Thank you, Scott. We have another question for you, this one is from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, Rich. Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Hi, good morning everyone. Keith Nosbusch : Good morning, Rich. Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: How you're doing? Just wondered a second, what's the expectation for process growth for 2015 at this point? I know that it was a little bit below expectation for 2014. How are you thinking about the puts and takes there? Keith Nosbusch :  Well for process for 2015, we expect process to grow mid-to-high single digits. So definitely a better growth rate than this year. Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay. And then is the oil and gas vertical -- how do you think about that in terms of your exposure between upstream and midstream? And what are you seeing in terms of front log activity that would bolster the growth rate or detract from the growth rate at this point? Keith Nosbusch :  Well from our position we've been a stronger in the upstream sector over the last couple of years and certainly that plays to more of our strengths in both motor control as well as process control. And what we are seeing now is some of the investments moving to midstream and ultimately downstream. And there in the midstream sector, we do well in some of the transportation and storage facilities. I think one of the weaknesses that we\u2019ve seen is when there is a lot of investment in that midstream petrochemical and chemical market, that's an area where we don\u2019t have a lot of installed base and its also an area that we don\u2019t have the perfect match with our plant-wide optimization strategy and so its much more focused on safety and intelligent motor control there. As we see it move further downstream, and when I meant in that area, I would say that chemical and the bulk chemical and the oil refining areas is what I was talking about. As it continues to move downstream, we think it\u2019s much more suitable, in particular lot of those applications are batch whether it would be specialty or refined chemical and we see that as another opportunity for us. With the current situation of what the pricing levels of oil are, we don\u2019t see a significant change at this time. This is an industry that really invest in the long term and so our two quarters of reduced prices not going to dramatically change a lot of their investment decisions. In fact last throughout 2015 that would be a different situation than what we currently have. And quite frankly oil and gas is one of the better growth verticals in fiscal year 2014. It's still healthy. We see the growth and I think I might have said 2014, I meant 2015, next year we see it as one of our better growth initiatives and we expect it to grow above the company average. So, we still see that as an opportunity for us and an opportunity to expand our share in that vertical. Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay. Thanks, Keith. That's helpful. Just a quick one, Keith or Ted I might have missed this. Did you get a buyback expectation for 2015? I might have missed this. Ted Crandall : Yeah. I mean, assuming the 100% conversion on adjusted income and assuming about $100 million of acquisitions spending, we expect to spend about $470 million next year on repurchases. Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay. Thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on. Keith Nosbusch : Thanks Rich. Operator : And Keith, we have another question for you. This is from the line of John Inch, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, John. John Inch - Deutsche Bank AG : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Keith Nosbusch : Good morning, John. Rondi Rohr-Dralle:  Hi, John. John Inch - Deutsche Bank AG : Could you provide a little bit more color on if you call it lumpiness within solutions by vertical? Is that possible, Ted and Keith? Is there a vertical or two that's maybe providing the somewhat lower conversion rates or book-to-bill today? Keith Nosbusch : No. It's not so much specific verticals, it\u2019s more of just a timing of projects, which can occur in many of the verticals. However, I would say, it's probably more significant in heavy industries where the projects tend to be bigger, they tend to be predicated around resource based pricing, commodity pricing. So I would say those are the ones that are most impacted as opposed to consumer, where they tend to be plant investments that are as significant in magnitude of dollars. So, I would characterize it that way, but any quarter, it could be any one of the industries, it could be metals, mining, oil and gas, pulp and paper, water wastewater, and - I think we mentioned this quarter, that more difficult ones were metals and mining, particularly in EMEA and Asia. John Inch - Deutsche Bank AG : And actually that all dovetails with the phenomenon that you've seen these larger more complicated projects get pushed to the right. So I'm presuming solutions is caught up a little bit in that. Can I ask you about process? If you look at Honeywell and Emerson and some of the others, they're seeing pretty good orders kick in for North America for lots of different reasons. And I realize that you're not completely apples to apples with those companies, but you do play in a lot of the same spaces. Do you think process needs a bit of a kicker to get it to the next level, Keith? Or are you satisfied that based on this positioning, new product backlog, and the cadence of business that it's on track to capture incremental share, based on the way it performed earlier in this cycle? Keith Nosbusch : Well, John, great question. I mean, quite frankly I am not satisfied with our results in process. I think because of its importance to us, the fact that it is our best growth opportunity that we can't reach our growth objectives without a share increase. And so, we are continuing to invest to expand our capabilities and our commercial reach in process applications. We will continue to make specifically targeted investments to accelerate our growth, and quite frankly this is a very important focus for me and us in 2015. To be fair, some of these areas are not where we have a large installed base, and it's not where we - I would say are recognized as the key player. But certainly we have expanded our capabilities and for us to continue to grow our presence, grow our share, we have to win in some of these new applications and new areas - geographies and so, we can and will do better here. And I think it's just a continuation and evolution of our growth and our maturing as a process control DCS supplier, and we\u2019re very excited about our modern DCS system that we think brings tremendous value and certainly that is \u2013 that will be one of the key points of our conversations during Automation Fair, and we see that as a continuing evolution of our business strategy and capabilities. John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG : And Keith, do you think you can do this organically, or does the experience of process in the past year and as markets fluctuate and evolve, maybe you have to begin to add more on the M&A front for whatever purpose or whatever application? Has your thinking evolves or changed in any way with respect to that business and capital allocation? Keith Nosbusch : I don't think that we need to make an acquisition. We constantly look at different acquisitions, process would be an area where we continue to evaluate opportunities and also the rest of the process base, and how can we do more in the entire market. So, I don't see where acquisition is silver bullet here. I think we look at it as how can we continue to grow our domain expertise, how can we build up the resources that we have calling on customers in various geographies and various industries, and various engineering environments. And I think it\u2019s something we can do a lot ourselves and if the right opportunity comes along given that this is an area for growth for us, we'll certainly look at an acquisition to accelerate what we would view as a more organic play at this point in time. John Inch - Deutsche Bank AG : Got it. Thanks very much. Appreciate it. Keith Nosbusch : You're welcome, John. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, John. We have another question for you, this one is from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please go ahead, Steve. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Hey guys, good morning. Keith Nosbusch : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: So I'm just having even with the solutions book-to-bill the way it is in the first quarter. I'm having a hard time getting to flat organic. How much is the ForEx headwind in the first quarter? Ted Crandall : It will probably be about two points. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Okay. And then just how does that impact the incremental? Maybe if you could also talk about why the incremental margin in architecture and software was so strong this quarter? You guys have called out the net benefits of in the fourth quarter of 2013, so maybe just some color around how the incrementals trend year to year? Obviously you're going to be down in the first quarter, so maybe just a little bit of high-level on how the - will margins be down in the first quarter as well? Ted Crandall : It would not be unusual to see a decline in margins with a decline in sales, and there's always a sequential decline in sales Q4 to Q1. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Okay. That's helpful. One last question just on the forward guide. What are you assuming for specific growth in oil and gas? And then maybe if you could give -- do you have a breakout of what your upstream versus down and mid is for that business? Ted Crandall : If you lumped upstream and midstream together our split of business is about 90% upstream, midstream and about 10% downstream. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Right. So that obviously would explain the difference between you guys and Honeywell and Emerson to a good degree as far as differences in trends I would assume. And so what are you thinking for growth there? Is that at the high end of the process range of high-single digits oil and gas this year? Ted Crandall : We don't give guidance generally by vertical I think. But I think it would be fair to say we expect oil and gas to be kind of at or above company average next year. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: One last question. Just very quickly if you start at flat organic, should we think about this as kind of -- are you going to be better than seasonal for the last three quarters of the year? Or are you assuming - is there anything that bounces back? Is this an issue of the funnel isn't clicking here, but you have such a big funnel that at some point in the next three or four quarters there's going to be a lot of stuff that falls through despite the little bit of a weaker start to the year? Ted Crandall : I think you've characterized it well. I mean, product businesses like two-thirds of our total business, and we\u2019re seeing good momentum and continuing healthy order trends in the product business. We have a hole in the backlog in the solutions and services business to begin the year. So compared to the average, our loading in the year is going to be a little more back-end weighted than the average. Keith talked about - we don\u2019t think that, that's all in the backlog in Q4 is kind of indicative of fundamental change in the market, rather it's just kind of a lumpiness in that business, in that regard. We're seeing pretty healthy orders performance in the month of October. It's only one month. We don't want to draw conclusions based on that, but it\u2019s somewhat encouraging. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: And is most of that oil and gas that's expected to come back? Ted Crandall : No. I wouldn't say that. I would say - I think Keith addressed this, I mean - it was broad, the performance in the fourth quarter in solutions and services \u2013 what we saw shortfall was pretty broad across verticals, I would say if anything it was maybe more regional in terms of being weak in Asia and weak in EMEA. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Okay. Great. Thanks for the color. Keith Nosbusch : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Thank you, Steve. We another question for you, this one is from Steven Winoker at Bernstein Research. Please go ahead, Steven. Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.: Thanks and good morning. Ted, let me start with you. On the incremental margin front for the guidance at about 21%, I'm thinking about that at 60 basis points in 2015 versus 90 in 2014 on just slightly better growth. You talked about Q1 just now. But maybe talk a little bit about the investment -- pace of investments in R&D and sales expense. What are the kinds of things are you picking up at all on that front that -- or is this just a question of look, at the midpoint range that's how we get there, but there's obviously a significant amount of upside to the op margin target as well if we hit high end of our range? Maybe a little color there. Ted Crandall : So, there's a lot there. Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.: That's just the first question. Ted Crandall : We have 5.1% organic growth in 2014, and spending was up about 4%. So relatively in line but a little bit below the organic growth. The midpoint of guidance for 2015, is 4.5%, so little bit lower organic growth, but with roughly the same increase expected in spending, maybe even a little bit more. Okay. And so that's in part - I mean there's a lot of factors that are in that margin including currency. But I would say that\u2019s probably the largest factor that results in a 60 basis point improvement rather than a 90 basis point improvement year-over-year. In terms of where that investment is going, it is not significantly different than what we\u2019ve talked about in the past. The larger share of that is going to increase R&D, and with our focus on continuing to expand the capabilities of the Logix platform, and building on some of the things we\u2019ve talked about around Integrated Control and Information. And then it's also in continuing to extend commercial resources so that we can grow in the targeted industries. Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.:  Okay. Great. Keith, maybe a little more color, and this may be more appropriate next week when I see you, but some of the other competitors that were mentioned earlier in particularly maybe more some of the downstream applications, but you see some of the technology investments around everything from the world evolving from Emerson's charmed approach originally to Honeywell's making a big deal out of universal I/O and cloud engineering and virtualization and the kinds of things that can take out installation time. I think it's beyond just a specific domains where their installed bases are strong. But from a process perspective, are you starting to -- is this an area that you guys are starting to already ahead of addressing? Is this any part of the process discussion that you just mentioned earlier? How should we think about that area? Keith Nosbusch : Well, quite frankly we've had capabilities in all of those areas already. We do have a capability to utilize virtualization for helping customers simplify their plant floor and also to isolate them from some of the changes in software technologies. Cloud is something that quite frankly I think we pioneered in the industry, in particular in remote monitoring applications, and in particular around critical assets. So we feel really good in that. We have a very broad IO portfolio that is able to simplify the customers installation and application and maintenance which is a very big part of this. So, on our technology front, I think we have a very strong story there. And then of course, we continue to have two major differentiators and one would be a plant wide optimization, there is still an awful lot of multi-discipline control that occurs in many of these applications. And we have the ability to have integrated intelligent motor control, which is very key in particular in the heavy industries and those differentiators continue to be very viable against the pure DCS companies. So, I think we continue to be able to demonstrate a value proposition that can give us a competitive differentiation, and a customer value proposition that helps them reduce their business cost. So, as I said, we've been a leader in some of these spaces, and two of those would have been virtualization, which we started a couple of years ago, and then remote asset monitoring and cloud based solutions which is about a year ago, we created that capability. So, I think from a technology standpoint, we feel good. Obviously there is a lot more we need to do and continue to evolve these technologies, but I don't think that we see ourselves at a disadvantage. Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.: Great. I look forward to learning more and seeing you next week. Thanks. Keith Nosbusch : Hey, sounds great. And we'll have people being able to cover all of those areas for you when you're there. Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thanks, Steve. And we have another question for you. This one is from Jeremie Capron from CLSA. Jeremie Capron - CLSA: Hi, good morning. A question on the factory automation side of the business and your alliance with FANUC. Keith, I wonder if you could give us more details on this alliance? It looks like it's taking a new dimension beyond automotive powertrain. And in particular could you explain us what are the benefits from Rockwell's perspective? Keith Nosbusch : Well first, the primary focus is on powertrain. So let me talk a little bit about that, and then I can expand to the point that you were making. But certainly fair enough, the benefits to Rockwell Automation is that FANUC is world leader in CNC and in robotics, and industrial robotics. So, we see it as an opportunity to help our mutual customers have a more seamless integrated solution that enables them to provide a safer contemporary work environment, as well as - as we talked now, the Integrated Control and Information Solution to help them do a better job of creating zero downtime, which is something that\u2019s very critical in the powertrain automotive space in their plants today with the way they run them. So we see customer benefits, we see two world leaders providing a best-in-class solution of Integrated Control and Information, and it basically helps faster time to market and reduce total cost of ownership. So, we see great business value for our customers. As far as the expansion of that, I mentioned the robotics area and certainly in some of the consumer products industries and the line applications where you\u2019re doing palletizing and taste packing or other types of material handling applications, we see the integration with robotics as very important, and the ability to do that with an integrated solutions once again creates differentiation and value for customers. So, automotive is the first place where this will create differentiation and then we\u2019ll see it moving to other industries, other verticals, particularly through the robotics side of it, and the CNC is heavy in the machining which is obviously powertrain. Jeremie Capron - CLSA: Thanks. And a follow-up question for Ted this time. On the tax rate we are looking at 27% for next year. So pretty much the same as last year, but somewhat higher than in previous years. So should we think of that 27% as the right level in other years as well? Could you explain the dynamics behind this increase in the effective tax rate in recent years? Ted Crandall : I would say the biggest dynamic in terms of the increase from where we were in 2012 and 2013, is \u2013 in those years we had some favorable discrete items, some larger favorable discrete items that were recognized that brought down the tax rates. In 2014, we actually had some smaller, unfavorable discrete items, I think the 27% in 2015, it's reasonable to think of as kind of more of a underlying run rate tax rate. Jeremie Capron - CLSA: Great. Thanks very much. And see you next week. Keith Nosbusch : Looking forward to it. Operator : Thank you. We have another question for you. This one is from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, Julian. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse :  Hi, thanks. Just on your China business, the slowdown that you had was similar to what a lot of other electricals had seen in the September quarter. It sounds like you think that will be up about mid-single digits in fiscal 2015. So just wondered what the visibility was like on China and when you think that will start to return to growth? Keith Nosbusch : Well, we expect growth next year. So, I think the challenge for us this past year was in our solution business. We had very good growth in OEMs and with our product portfolio for OEMs, and OEMs now continue to become a bigger portion of our total sales. As far as the solution side of it, I think we see continued slowness in metals because of the overcapacity that's in China today. And we see improvements in oil and gas in China, next year. And I think \u2013 and somewhat in mining is hopefully one of the areas that will see an increase, but as far as the visibility, Ted mentioned some of the improvements in October and certainly China had a stronger solutions order month than in Q4. So, some of that was project push-outs that we have been talking about, that in the last call and now this call that we saw in Q4. So, we\u2019re starting to see some of that flow through the pipeline so to speak at this point. So, we obviously with the cycle being extended, which we definitely have seen the order cycle in the solutions business has doubled in the last half year. So we know things have slowed down and so it\u2019s just a matter of when do those break loose, and certainly that\u2019s part of how we characterize the outlook for this year, and I think it was an earlier question that we do see the second half stronger solution sales than we\u2019re going to have in the first half. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse : Thanks. And then just my follow up is on the food and beverage market. You've heard some industrial companies talk about slowdowns there or order push-outs in food and beverage. That had been very strong for Rockwell. I just wondered if you'd seen any change in customer spending there? Keith Nosbusch : Not really in food and beverage, I think that\u2019s been a little more regional where things have gone up or down, we talked about the strength, Ted mentioned it as far as Q4, there was good strength in China, in particular Latin America, and certainly that's part of the reason we have the OEM growth is because of what's happening there, and food and beverage was the strongest vertical in China in fiscal year 2014. And at the end of the year I think Q4 in Latin America, it was the strongest vertical as well. So, we see food continue to be strong. I think that was reinforced with some of the commentary at Pack Expo this last week in Chicago. I think of the two segments, beverage maybe the one that will be a little weaker as we go through 2015, given some of the changes that's going on in the industry dynamics themselves. But we do see this as an opportunity for us next year. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse : Great. Thank you. Keith Nosbusch : Thank you, Julian. Rondi Rohr-Dralle: Okay. Ian, we\u2019re going to go ahead and we\u2019ll take one last call. Operator : Thank you. The last one is from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Please go ahead, Jeff. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research : Thank you. Good morning, thanks for squeezing me in. Keith Nosbusch : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research : Morning, morning. So, you covered a lot of ground, so I'll be brief in the interest of time. I was just wondering on your upstream oil and gas exposure obviously was a very big focus last year at Automation Fair in Houston. How much of it is actually North America centric? We obviously already have the weakness in the Canadian Oil Sands, but when we think about North America in aggregate, how would you size it? Keith Nosbusch : From a geographic standpoint, it's probably around 60/40, North America and certainly when I say North America, I would be including Mexico in that. So we\u2019ve got Mexico, we\u2019ve got U.S. and Canada, it\u2019s probably about 60% of our upstream business. And then obviously we\u2019ve done work in China, we do work in the North Sea, and the Middle East, and Brazil. So there is a number of other areas where we have our capabilities, but the largest footprint would be the totality of the North American region. Ted Crandall : And interestingly the dispersion of our - the geographic dispersion of the oil and gas revenue is in a lot different than our total revenue. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research : Okay. And then just on Europe, obviously the macro weakness understandable and visible. I'm just wondering if you're seeing anything different in the European OE machine builders? In other words any early indication that euro weakness is helping them in any way kind of pulling through to your business differently? Keith Nosbusch : No. We haven't seen any changes in that dynamic. What I would say - what we are seeing is with the challenges going on in Russia and Eastern Europe, we are seeing some slowness in the exporting of Germany. And Germany has a lot of business that flows East through Central and Eastern Europe, and into Russia. And I think with the issues there, I would say that's where there\u2019s been some impact with the OEM performance in Europe for us. We still see good shipments back into the U.S., good shipments into the majority of the Asian countries, but that flow into the East as probably been the only area that we've seen a dynamic or I should say a change from what we would be talking about six months ago. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research : Thanks. And then just one little quick final follow-up for Ted. Ted, just the cash geographically, is the repo that you laid out pretty much kind of all you are really kind of capable of given kind of stranded cash issues? Could you just kind of address where we're at with that currently? Ted Crandall : I think it would be - I think it would be fair to characterize it as what we\u2019re capable of without significant increase borrowings. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research : Great. Thank you. Keith Nosbusch : Thanks a lot, Jeff. Appreciate it. Rondi Rohr-Dralle: Okay. Well, that concludes today's call. We're going to wrap it up here. So, thanks everybody for joining us. We look forward to seeing bunch of you next week at Automation Fair in Anaheim. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes your conference. You may now disconnect.",

Inch - Deutsche Bank AG Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein Operator : Thank you for holding and welcome to Rockwell Automation's Quarterly Conference Call. I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. Later in the call, we will open up the line for questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rondi Rohr-Dralle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rohr-Dralle. Please go ahead. Rondi Rohr-Dralle: Thanks, Dan. Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's first quarter fiscal 2015 earnings release conference call. With me today as always are Keith Nosbusch, our Chairman and CEO and Ted Crandall our Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda includes opening remarks by Keith that include highlights on the Company's performance in the first quarter and some contexts around everybody's outlook for fiscal '15 then Ted will provide more details on the results as well as sales and adjusted earnings per share guidance. As always we take questions at the end of Ted's remark. We expect the call to take about an hour today. Our results were released this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website, at www.rockwellautomation.com. Please note that both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is accessible at that website and will be available for replay for the next 30-days. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. So with that, I'll hand the call over to Keith. Keith Nosbusch : Thanks, Rondi. Good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. We hope those of you in the Northeast have weather the storm okay. I\u2019ll start with the highlights for the quarter, so please turn to page three in the slide deck. We had a good start to the year with 2% organic sales growth in the quarter. This was better than we expected given the strong sales last year in Q1 and especially giving the low backlog in solution and servicing at the beginning of the quarter. I\u2019ll start with some color on the top line. Architecture & Software delivered its six straight quarter of at least 5% organic growth, our investments there are paying off. Logic sales were up 7% in the quarter, so back to more normal expected relationship. The Logic sales exceeding the segment average and we continued to see traction with our mid-range portfolio. It\u2019s not on the chart, but our process business grew 4% in the quarter. Latin America was a standout region with 18% growth. Brazil and Mexico continued to grow about 10% and we saw even higher rates of growth in selected other countries in the region. Our team there is executing very well and I congratulate them on an outstanding quarter. We expect Latin America to be our highest growth region this year and they are off to a great start. Ted will provide additional color on the other region\u2019s performance. Operation margin EPS growth and free cash flow were all very strong in the quarter, so all in all that was a very good start to the fiscal year. Let\u2019s move on to the macro environment. One of the big changes since I talk in November is a continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against a broad basket of currencies. At current rates, we are facing a significantly larger sales headwind then we originally expected. Ted will provide more detail regarding currency impacts in his remarks. As it relates to underlying market condition with the exception of oil and gas, things haven\u2019t changed much at all. The U.S. continuously demonstrating strength, we are watching EMEA closely as we deal with geopolitical and economic challenges, but we aren\u2019t expecting any significant change in market conditions there. In Asia, things are looking better in India and a bit softer in China. Despite lower commodity prices, we expect to see continue growth in Latin American markets. Regarding vertical markets, generally we\u2019re seeing continued healthy investment in consumer verticals and transportation. In heavy industries, we\u2019re expecting mix market conditions for relative stability overall, however there is obviously a good deal of noise related to oil and gas. Just like other suppliers, the oil and gas industry, we are trying to understand the near-term and longer term implications of the rapid decline in the price of oil. We did not see any negative impact to our business in Q1 and our front log [ph] in oil and gas is stable. Most of our oil and gas customers had not yet declared their capital spending plans for calendar 2015, a lot of that will become public in the next several weeks. But at this point, here is out view. There will be a negative impact on CapEx investment due to the lower price of oil, but the timing of spending cuts is harder to predict. We think oil and gas customers are likely to complete large projects already underway and proceed with those they consider strategic. Generally this industry takes a longer-term view of their CapEx investments. Any negative impact on spending will likely be more significant in exploration especially for unconventional sources. We expect to see some shift in spending from large projects in exploration to smaller productivity improvement projects in production similar to what we\u2019ve experienced in the mining industry over the past couple of years. Lastly, we think midstream and downstream investments are likely to be sustained. Taking all of this into consideration, we see modest risk to our previous sales outlook for fiscal \u201915 related to lower oil prices. With all of that said, let\u2019s move on to our updated outlook for fiscal \u201915. Our most GDP and industrial product forecast continue to call for stable growth in 2015. We are incorporating the more significant headwind from a stronger dollar and the anticipated impact of lower oil prices into our revised outlook. For full year sales, we\u2019re increasing the currency headwind by almost three points and lowering the top end of our organic growth guidance of 6.5% to 5.5% while these results in a preferred change to the top line, the midpoint for EPS guidance in only $0.10 lower. We now expect fiscal 2015 reported sales of about $6.6 billion with organic growth in the range of 2.5% to 5.5% and adjusted EPS of $6.50 to $6.80. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks. So to wrap up, Q1 was a very good start to the year, even though I\u2019ve talked a lot about oil and gas here, it is only 12% of sales. In fact, the oil prices remain low, we expect to see some benefit in our other verticals especially consumer, which is sweet spot for Rockwell Automation. We\u2019ve remained excited about the opportunities we see in consumer and automotive in process with OEMs and to the connected enterprise. We continue to invest in all of these areas. Our revenue diversification works and we\u2019re executing very well across the globe. I want to thank our employees, suppliers and partners for their dedication in expertise and continually expanding the value we provide to our customers and shareholders. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Ted. Ted? Ted Crandall : Thanks, Keith and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll start with page four, first quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were $1.574 billion, 1.1% lower than Q1 last year. Organic sales growth as Keith mentioned was 2.1%, a current translation reduced sales in the quarter by 3.4 points. Segment operating margin was very strong at 22%, up 140 basis points from Q1 last year, despite the small sales decline. The year-over-year margin increase was primarily due to the higher organic sales, favorable mix and a strong productivity quarter, partially offset by a modest increase in spending. General corporate net expense was $23 million in Q1, up about $1 million compared to a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.64, up $0.17 or 12% compared to the first quarter of last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 26% compared to 27.8% in Q1 last year. The 26% adjust effective rate in Q1 reflects the retroactive extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit for calendar year 2014. Free cash flow for Q1 was $233 million, a very good result for the first quarter and strong start for the year. Free cash flow conversion on adjusted income was 103% in Q1. Our trailing four quarter return on invested capital was 30.1%. There were couple of items not shown here. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were $136.9 million that\u2019s down about 2.5% compared to last year. And during the first quarter, we\u2019ve repurchased 1.55 million shares at a cost of about $167 million. At the end of the quarter, we had 884 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. The next two slides presents the sales and operating margin performance of each segment, I\u2019ll start with the Architecture & Software segment on page five. On the left side of this chart, you can see that Architecture & Software segment sales were $708 million in Q1 an increase of 1.7% compared to Q1 last year. Organic growth was 5.1%. Moving to the right side of the chart, on 5.1% organic growth A&S margins were 31.3% up 90 basis points compared to Q1 last year. With the improved margin primarily due to the higher organic sales and a good productivity quarter. Now turning to page six, a similar view for the Control Products & Solutions segment. In the first quarter, Control Products & Solutions segment sales were down 3.3% year-over-year and essentially flat year-over-year on an organic basis. Organic growth for product sales in the segment was a solid 3.3%. Solutions and services sales were down 2.8% organically. That was actually a bit better than we expected given the low starting backlog. The book-to-bill in Q1 for solutions and services was 1.13 that\u2019s pretty healthy and starts to rebuild the backlog that we need to drive growth in the balance of this year in this part of our business. CP&S delivered very good operating margin in Q1 at 14.5%, up 150 basis points compared to last year, despite the decline in reported sales. The earnings conversion on the negative currency impact was modest in this segment. Mix was somewhat favorable. Project margins were better in the solutions and services businesses and that was particularly strong productivity quarter. Page seven, provides a geographic breakdown of our sales and shows organic growth results for the quarter. The organic sales growth in Q1 was driven largely by Latin America with Canada and Asia Pacific also contributing. The U.S. was flat year-over-year in Q1 with 3% growth than the product businesses and a 4% decline in the solutions and services businesses. The decline in solutions and services was expected and consistent with our comments last year regarding a low beginning backlog. The underlying market in the U.S. remains very healthy and that was reflected an orders growth in the U.S. in the mid-single digits. Canada saw 8% growth that was partly about project timing and an easy comparison in the last year. But with the exception of the Oil Sands, we\u2019re seeing some pickup in most other markets in Canada. EMEA was down 1% organically, it was somewhat unusual quarter for the region in that sales and Western Europe were actually up 1.6%. However that was more than offset by declines in emerging countries particularly South Africa and to a lesser extent Turkey and Russia. Asia Pacific was up 2.9%, growth was pretty broad based across the region with the exception of China which was down 2%. I would attribute the decline in China more to project timing than any change in underlying market conditions. China orders in the quarter were up mid-single digit. India organic growth in Q1 was 9%, so we continue to see improvement in that market. Keith already talked about Latin America, so I\u2019ll close out this slide, I\u2019ll just add that overall for emerging markets, organic growth was 4.4% and that obviously led by Latin America. And that takes us to the fiscal year \u201915 guidance slide. As Keith mentioned, we\u2019re revising our full year guidance. We\u2019re reducing full year sales guidance primarily to reflect a much more significant headwind from currency and to a lesser step, less optimism about the high end of the sales range. We\u2019re dropping the high end of the sales range primarily due to the very significant decline in oil prices, but also because we\u2019re continuing to see forecasts for IT and GDP be revised downward in most regions although the forecast still call for growth in 2015 that\u2019s similar to 2014. Our previous guidance call for reported sales of approximately 6.8 billion at the midpoint, in the original guidance, we expected currency to reduce sales by 1.8 points and we expect organic growth of 2.5% to 6.5%. Now for the full year, because the dollar is continued to appreciate against the broad basket of currencies, we expect currency to reduce sales by 4.5 points. That difference in currency impact from previous to current guidance results in a reduction and reported sales for the full year of about $180 million. We\u2019re also reducing the high end of organic growth from 6.5% to 5.5%. We\u2019re maintaining the low end of organic growth to 2.5% that will drop organic growth at the midpoint by 1.5 point. We\u2019re revising EPS guidance from the previous 655 to 695 to a new range of $6.50 to $6.80. From the old to the new midpoint, EPS will be down by $0.10, that\u2019s a very modest EPS decline on a roughly $200 million sales decline coupling the currency impact and the organic sales change. In part based on our performance in Q1, we now expect slightly higher operating margins for the full year about 20 basis points, but still about 21%. We\u2019re projecting an adjusted effective tax rate of 26.5%, half a point lower than previous guidance and largely due to the R&D tax credit. We didn\u2019t plan on the extension of the R&D credit in the original guidance. Those factors allow us to absorb a pretty large drop in the sales guidance with a relatively small impact on EPS. We continue to expect converted by 100% of net come to free cash flow and that\u2019s couple of items not shown here, we continue to expect general corporate net expense to be approximately $80 million for the full year and we continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 136 million for the full year. The last slide is a walk for adjusted EPS from the previous to the revise guidance midpoint. Starting on the last slide, the previous guidance for adjusted EPS midpoint was $6.75. The big change as you can see here is currency compared to prior guidance with the additional top line translation headwind of a 180 million. All in, we expect a related earnings impact to reduce adjusted EPS by about $0.25. A little higher operating market is more than offsetting the impact of a half point lower organic sales growth at the new midpoint and the net effect adds about $0.09 to quarter. Lower tax rate and share counts add an additional $0.06 compared to prior guidance that gets us to the new midpoint of $6.65. And with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Rondi to begin Q&A. Rondi Rohr-Dralle: Great, that said, before we start the Q&A, just look at the list, we have quite few callers and that few I know we\u2019re not going to be able to get everyone, but I guess in the spirit of trying to get to as many as possible if you can you know letting yourself to a question and one follow-up that would be great. We appreciate your cooperating on that and so let\u2019s take our first question. Operator : And your first question comes from the line of John Inch, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. John G. Inch: Thank you, good morning everyone. Keith Nosbusch : Good morning, John. John G. Inch: Good morning. We start with Canada, I know it\u2019s relatively higher proportionate exposure for Rockwell. How much of the $0.25, Ted, is Canadian dollar? Let\u2019s start there. Ted Crandall : I would say probably about a quarter of it. John G. Inch: Okay. Ted Crandall : A large as you would expect the largest impact we have from currency is from the euro and depending on whether you talk about the full year or the quarter of the balance of the year, the euro accounts generally for more than half of the impact. John G. Inch: You know greater called out transaction exposure in Canada, do you have that in other words, are you selling Canadian customers U.S. made product that\u2019s going to create for perspective margin headwinds, just again trying to be somewhat proactive in the through process? Keith Nosbusch : Well it cuts both legs and then we do have transaction exposure in Canada because we manufacture around the globe and selling to Canada, but we also manufacture in Canada and export to the rest of the world. So we\u2019ve got some natural hedge, we do have some transaction exposure and we hedge that. John G. Inch: Okay, the other question I had was just automotive powertrain, I know you guys are making a lot of head growth into that arena, what point do you think we might actually, maybe this question for Keith, started actually realize some sales from the powertrain, start for orders you\u2019d be talking about because right now the popular view is your auto business is peaked but in theory you\u2019ve got two - you know you got another 50% of the market that you just beginning to tab? Keith Nosbusch : Yeah, John, I would say we\u2019ve had limited success only because - at this point only because these are projects that are lawn in the planning stage and we just started a little over a year ago in the - I\u2019ll say in the pursuit. So we\u2019re seeing that the backlog on powertain opportunities increase, we don\u2019t have a lot of booked orders at this point in time. I would say that we should see an increase as we go through this year with a stronger outlook in the next three - two to three years with respect to strictly the powertrain segment of automotive. John G. Inch: Just last, you guys are sitting on the most over capitalized balance sheet maybe next to ITT, I realize you are buying incrementally more shares but what are your thoughts toward somehow stepping mess up in some manner through other financial leverage or some other actions to return more cash to shareholders? Thank you. Ted Crandall : But John, we\u2019ve had a lot of conversations about this in the last couple of years and as part of that talked about cash balances and where they are. I think we\u2019ve been very consistent in our cash deployment philosophy or expectation is that we will continue to exhaust free cash flow each after organic growth funding and acquisitions and return the balance to shareholders. Last year, you know we did a little bit more than that because of the strong cash flow year. This year we\u2019ve got north to start that is in pace of brought back you know given that we will - it\u2019s possible that we won that spending a little more than that this year. But I don\u2019t think we are fundamentally changed our approach. John G. Inch: Got it, thank you. Ted Crandall : Welcome. Operator : Thank you, John. We have another question for you. This one is from the line Scott Davis of Barclays. Please go ahead Scott. Scott R. Davis: Hi, good morning, guys. Keith Nosbusch : Good morning, Scott. Scott R. Davis: Can you help us understand, I mean I am picturing a scenario where it seems is calls other people are going to say that you are not being conservative in oil and the impact. I mean, can you give us a sense of what you\u2019ve learned in mining and what the parallels are here as far as how fast things can ramp down and how you mentioned in your prepared remarks, how project can gravitate. But help us understand and maybe a first point to start is, give us a sense of where mining when peak the trough for you guys and where you see some parallels in oil? Keith Nosbusch : Well I think the parallels are more along the lines of that new investments in expansion is the area that gets impacted first and obviously they were rising commodity prices when there were a lot of process going on and the commodities pricing was going up mainly driven by the China growth. And I think that we\u2019ve seen in mining and what we think is in parallel is the major projects that were going on were not stopped, those continued to move through to conclusion. And as those were moving through what we saw was a decline in new investments in new capacity and a switch of that to more including productivity and taking cost out of their existing operations. And they were doing that obviously because the prices were going as opposed to prices going up and you can sell everything you can mine. And so I would say those were the learnings and I think the other thing that we feel is similar is that both of these industries take a long term view of their investments, a mine is plan to run generally for decades and oil depending upon the magnitude the field is also for decades. So it\u2019s not a decision they take are literally or capriciously based upon a short term swing in the price of oil - in the price of whatever the commodity is. In this case, obviously there has been a dramatic drop in about six months. So I think the important thing in here is I won\u2019t say we\u2019re not being aggressive in our beliefs here. I don\u2019t think that final card has been placed to understand what\u2019s going on in the market yet. You know very few companies have come out with their CapEx guidance. I think we\u2019ve seen one of the major oil company so far. I think we\u2019ve seen some oil services company respond, but we need to at least wait until we get a little more insight before we\u2019re making calls in this industry and I just think it\u2019s still too early to say anything more than we have at this point in time. So we\u2019re obviously monitoring it. But to your point, in mining what we say was a 15% decline over two years, so that gives you a little bit of a scale of what is possibly ahead of us in oil, but we just feel at this point, it\u2019s too early to make that call given that CapEx budgets haven\u2019t been outlined and secondly it takes time, it takes time for these decisions to ripple through organization, they don\u2019t happen in the same day, the same week, the same month that the decisions are made. So they have to prioritize, they have to recalibrate, they have to reevaluate and then come up with the new list and how that impacts us, we\u2019ll not be knowing for a meaningful down the road. So we\u2019re trying to keep it write down the middle of the fair way here and call it by what we\u2019re seeing today and to your point, we making it a little bit to experiences that we\u2019ve had in and perhaps a similar industry of mining. Scott R. Davis: And I think people on this call it down 15 of two years of victory, but so I hope that happens, but anyway I just wanted to ask a quick follow-up on currency in competition. You know you guys have done really well with the machine builders in Europe for probably ten years, but this is a different level of yen for the Japanese competitors and clearly depend level for euro. But have things change to the point where you have such a fantastic relationship with the OE builders that somebody coming in at 5% or 10% lower price is not enough to get on the switch or is it still somewhat of aggressive, you know a more commoditize product? Keith Nosbusch : Well, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a more commoditize product, I certainly don\u2019t feel that\u2019s the core of our business quite frankly. But that the issue is more around machine cycles than it is around price. With OEMs, the important thing and what we\u2019ve been working on over the last decade is how do we get in the design cycles and how do we validate our differentiation that enables them to get better machine performance utilizing our technology. And at the end of the day, it\u2019s that combination that is more important than strictly a short term price based upon currency fluctuations which obviously moving both directions at some point in time. So I think it\u2019s about creating that value and creating that differentiation to enable us to build the loyalty and the confidence that we are the best solution for them and not have to be 5% to 10% price up - on upfront cost advantage because it really is all about the total lifecycle cost for the end users and that\u2019s where the bigger emphasis is placed. Ted Crandall : Scott, I think that the price that was talked about previously is you know historically we have not seen a lot of changes in price dynamics and price behavior associated with currency changes and we\u2019ve had a lot of discussion about that over the last couple of years as it relates to the yen. You know our global supply chain isn\u2019t perfectly balanced but it\u2019s certainly not like we build everything that we manufacture in the United States. And most of our major competitors have a similarly global supply chain. And so I think that\u2019s partly the reason that you don\u2019t see big changes in pricing behaviors consequence of the currency changes. Scott R. Davis: It\u2019s very helpful. Good luck guys, best of luck this year. Keith Nosbusch : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you, Scott. We have another question for you. This comes from Steve Tusa of JP Morgan. Please go ahead Steve. Stephen Tusa : Hey guys, good morning. Keith Nosbusch : Good morning, Steve. Stephen Tusa : So can I just ask you what do you assuming now for oil and gas growth this year? Ted Crandall : Yeah, so I mean maybe the easiest thing is to think about it as, we\u2019re expecting no growth at midpoint. Stephen Tusa : Okay, no growth in oil and gas at the midpoint, okay. And within that I guess you know what do you guys looking for over the next couple of weeks as far as what should we be watching and looking for when it comes to these CapEx budget, I mean is there specific sliver at the market that you guys are more focused on, you said you\u2019re looking for another turn of the cards, just curious just to you know maybe a little more detail on and maybe were you most worried or where you think you have the best change of stability and what the cap for over the next month or so. Keith Nosbusch : Sure, first half, it\u2019s just the magnitude of their CapEx reductions. I think that\u2019s the first test period. And then it goes back to okay, so how does that - how does that really play out against the different applications and the different segments of the market. And certainly, we\u2019re more exposed to upstream and so that would be our greatest concern. If a lion share of that reduction was targeted in the upstream, we certainly think there is opportunities to continue to improve the productivity of well, so we believe that as they move to OpEx in upstream that is beneficial for us and would be helpful as an offset to the new well drilling and then the split between unconventional and conventional spending and how they are seeing the impact of the lower prices and the stock of oil. Stephen Tusa : Got it and so clearly the solution to book-to-bill, you are saying you are seeing really any unusually behavior from your customers? Ted Crandall : That would fair, we haven\u2019t seen any at this point. Keith Nosbusch : Yeah, I think that was the Q1 takeaway, we have no change. Ted Crandall : And Steve to your question about then the announcement will come up in the next couple of weeks, we\u2019re key started, I think what we get a better picture for is the magnitude of expected cuts. I suspect what was still be a little bit uncertain is the timing of that and all that based on experiences, it\u2019s going to take a little longer to implement those cuts then some others might be expecting. Stephen Tusa : And will this be like the big guys or you know like the Exxon to the world or is it mostly you know is it really broad based. Keith Nosbusch : It\u2019s yes, it\u2019s very broad based because, today our business is you know with majors but also with the NOCs and also with the Tier-2s given the magnitude of unconventional, a lot of that has been driven by Tier-2s. So it really is across all the spectrum of the industry which as you have known has grown pretty dramatically, so with the advent of unconventional. So we would look at it in each one of those segments and then look at our exposure into those segments and our front lot against those segments and then have a better feel. And obviously when I am taking upstream, we\u2019re move heavily into production then we are into exploration. So that\u2019s the other split. And we think the safest area quite frankly is downstream where all of this low cost oil and gas is going to flow into the chemicals and petrochemicals market and while that at this point is a smaller segment of our total sales. It\u2019s an area that we feel we\u2019ll be state the most stable for the longest period of time going forward. So we think that is where the opportunities can remain and can grow even if there is a reduction in the upstream segment. So it\u2019s a complex market that has many different variables and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to - we need to evaluate each one of those as we get more influence. Stephen Tusa : One last question, any impact on that, your margins were very strong and the growth in emerging markets are strong and several years ago that was headwind. Any impact from you know, did the movements in foreign exchange on your margin because the margins are just absolutely blowout this quarter very strong when this expected with the growth in Latin America and Canada, so any impact from hedges or like that on the margins in the quarter? Ted Crandall : I would say, I mean that you are saying any significant favorable impacting. Answer is no. Actually currency in the quarter probably converted a little bit more negatively than what we expect is average conversion. Stephen Tusa : Great execution. Keith Nosbusch : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Thank you, Steve. We have another question for you. This comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Keith Nosbusch : Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : Good morning. Keith, just on the comments that oil and gas being 12%, is that all away through the entire complex down through petrochemicals or is there you know you kind of stopping at on refining when you say that. Can you just put fine point on kind of whole complex? Keith Nosbusch : Absolutely, my comment would be, mainly the 12% is oil and gas, we would put chemical at about 4% about sales. Jeffrey Sprague : Okay, thank you. Keith Nosbusch : And that would include petrochemical. Jeffrey Sprague : Right, what do you think you know kind of describes the serves that you saw in the quarter on kind of the low starting backlogs and you know is there some kind of budget flush or something else going on that this seems the - you know that in fact happens? Keith Nosbusch : Well, I don\u2019t think there was any budge flush quite frankly that I think some of it was project timing. I think as always we get the - you know you get the quarterly what gets in and what gets pushed out. And I think what we did see and what we did talk about at the end of our Q4 was there were a lot of push outs and delays in the solutions business and we definitely saw a return to a much more normal end of the year. And that probably more than the budge flush though process is what turned it a little more positive for us and - in that category. Jeffrey Sprague : And on the outlook for oil and gas, there is kind of a wait really a little bit more clarity of what the customers are actually going to do. Is there you know kind of prevented or predictive draw out in distribution that starting to happen or that\u2019s not even underway either? Keith Nosbusch : No, we\u2019ve seen - there has been no draw down. Our outgoing flow is as you know we basically match our distributors shipments with our deliberates and we\u2019re not seeing any deviation at this point in time in anticipation of any future activities. Jeffrey Sprague : And this another quick one. I think last time you know I mean is up 18 right with Brazil and Mexico of 10, I would imagine those are 75% or 80% of lifetime. So how do you get up, I mean what was up 100% or some crazy number in Latin America? Keith Nosbusch : Well the two of those are generally about two thirds, so a little less than what you\u2019re talking about. But if you remember probably one of the biggest that the biggest differences was Argentina which a year ago was pretty much shutdown for us anyways and we\u2019re now back to a more I\u2019d say stable environment that could change at any time. But in our entire first quarter that was probably were the biggest doubt that came. And then we also had some Central American activities that were stronger and the Andean Regions are Chili was another benefit and that\u2019s a little bit back an earlier commentary around mining, mining was very weak in Chili last year and we\u2019re starting to see some of the operation OpEx spending that\u2019s kicking in as opposed to pure CapEx. So I would put it into those two to three countries. Jeffrey Sprague : Great, thank you for that color, I appreciate it. Keith Nosbusch : You are welcome Jeff. Operator : Thank you for your question, Jeff. We have another for you. It\u2019s coming from the line of [indiscernible]. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst.: Good morning, guys. Keith Nosbusch : Good morning, Shawn. Unidentified Analyst.: Hey, Keith maybe can you dig in a little bit more in terms of these you know the pickup in investment you are seeing in the consumer industries and you know are these capacity investments are the new product related or technology migrations, I mean you know it seems like you are probably seeing a pickup there the cycle and just maybe a little more color on what types of things you are seeing? Keith Nosbusch : Well, I think with the consumer industries, it\u2019s always dependent upon the regions that we\u2019re seeing it. And basically you can think of everything in emerging market is new investment particularly as far as developing, I\u2019ll call it more sophisticated manufacturing processes in particular with domestic in suppliers. Take China as the primary example, you all know that they\u2019ve had a food scares, so that they are going to much more rigger in their internal processes and that requires automation investments. We also know that they are continuing to expand capacity in their food sector as the middleclass continues to grow which is the other driven in the immerging markets and that\u2019s not just China that would be Latin America, Mexico as well. So I would put a lot of it into that space in immerging. In the mature economies I think the majority of it is continued drive for cost reduction and productivity and out of that they also get some capacity expansion. But generally speaking, it\u2019s more along the lines to reduce cost and to be able to continue to drive higher levels of productivity. And really as always in the mature markets, packaging styles change and whether it\u2019s the materials used or how they do printing on them or the size of the package, it\u2019s a little bit like the automotive industry where you have model change years even though you don\u2019t have capital spending - you don\u2019t have a lot of increase in new card sales, they just have to modernize their portfolio. And in consumer industry, it\u2019s a lot of times around the packaging that is very similar to the styling of cards. And so they have to buy new packaging lines, take advantage of new technology, so I would say that\u2019s what we see more in the matured markets. Unidentified Analyst.: Okay, great, that\u2019s really helpful. And then Ted, maybe you know free cash flow was up around I think 30% year-over-year and the buyback was up about 50, I mean any reason you know either of those were elevated in the quarter and why they would moderate from what happened in 1Q? Ted Crandall : Yeah, I mean on the cash flow, I\u2019d say quarter-to-quarter, there are a lot timing issues just about you know things like payables and receivable cutoff dates and also timing of tax payment. So I think we\u2019re off to a good start but we\u2019re not really changing forecast for cash flow at this point. On the repurchases side, you know we\u2019re facing a significant drop in the price in October from the time previous to that and under a 10b5-1 plan; we bought very aggressively with the drop in price. As the drop in price continue to end at November and December, we continue to buy what I would call above average rate and so I think that explains that the first quarter repurchases. Unidentified Analyst.: Okay, great, thanks a lot guys. Keith Nosbusch : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have another question for you. This comes from Andrew Obin of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Yes, good morning. Keith Nosbusch : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just a question you know you were talking about expanding capacity of logics you know adding sales people in the Gulf region, what are these capacity expansion plans are right now given decline market dynamic? Keith Nosbusch : Well, we continue to see a - I am assuming when you are talking about oil and gas in the Middle East. Andrew Obin : Yeah. Keith Nosbusch : Yeah, we\u2019ll continue to see a project activity there. The Middle East is probably got the lowest cost conventional oil and I think you\u2019ve also seen most of those countries say they are going to keep pumping because of that. So we\u2019re not seeing any change, we also continue to see the activities going on with respect to metals in the Middle East region. So I would at this point in that region, we\u2019re not sensing any change in their current plans. Andrew Obin : I think I was also refurnishing the Gulf of Mexico as well because you guys are pretty optimist think about the dealt out there? Keith Nosbusch : I am sorry, I misunderstood the gulf. Okay. Andrew Obin : Hey I am Russian, it\u2019s not my first language. Keith Nosbusch : That\u2019s fair enough, but it might my ears too. With the Gulf, we have not seen at this point any change in the activities there. A lot the Gulf is - we\u2019re not a lot but a significant portion of the Gulf is Mexico production, it\u2019s obviously very important to their economy. And I think we\u2019ll see a bunch of that continue as the - as we see that some of the majors determine what\u2019s going to happen with their CapEx. I think the question in the Gulf is, some of the modernization and some of our comments about the modernization of those wells and the ongoing expansion could be at risk going forward. And really most of our previous comments on the Gulf were what would happen along the Gulf of the U.S. We were very - not very, we were more positive about the downstream activities and the impact on the Gulf of Mexico, U.S. region which was really about the chemical and petrochemical industry and we still feel bullish about that. We think those investments will continue to go forward, they are building the ethylene crackers, they are building the new ammonia and other chemical plants. And we see that is continuing basically because of the ongoing cost their input cost if anything have gotten better over the last six months than they were previously. So I now remember the questions around the Gulf and it was really the Gulf region of the U.S and we invigoration of the chemical, petrochemical industry in the Texas, Louisiana area and we still see that as a growth opportunity for Rockwell Automation. Andrew Obin : And just a follow-up question. You know I think the big day among our clients is what happens to North American energy production in 2017. When you talk to your customers the initial conversation, what do you think the prevailing view, do you think the low energy price kills the growth in North American production beyond 2016 or do you think the view is that somehow technology and engineering prevails in North America continues to grow its production? Keith Nosbusch : I would say in 2017, is a long time out for predictions with respect to the energy market. But I think the one thing that has probably proving now overtime is technology works and the U.S. is probably the most innovative technology country when it comes to oil and gas. So I would never count that dimension out. But I just can\u2019t forecast two years out. Ted Crandall : I also think - I also think at least at this point most of our customers and don\u2019t think this is a prediction for Rockwell but if it goes to our customers, don\u2019t expect oil price is to say 50 bucks a gallon or 50 bucks a barrel, certainly for two years. Andrew Obin : I really appreciate it. Thank you very much. Keith Nosbusch : You\u2019re welcome. Thank you, Andrew. Operator : Thank you, Andrew. We have another question for you. This comes from Nigel Coe at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Thanks guys, good morning. Fed and then Keith, you brought some pretty good 1Q color, I hope - I think the 1Q color was more in line because of the softer book-to-bill during 4Q. But I am wondering, anything standard for 2Q which is better minded, Ted? Ted Crandall : Maybe the only think I would say about the second quarter is you know it\u2019s very normal for us to see a sequential sales and EPS decline when we move from Q1 to Q2. And this Q1 we have told you we thought was a particularly strong earnings quarter. Nigel Coe : Okay, that\u2019s - but you\u2019d expect organic to accelerate from 1Q levels? Ted Crandall : What we certainly in the balance of the year, we\u2019re expecting higher rates of organic growth in the remaining nine months that in Q1. Nigel Coe : Okay, now that\u2019s helpful. And then follow-on question, you know I think the relative mining is a good one and you mentioned Keith that mining was down you know picking up for the two years and I am wondering you know over that period, did the pricing holdup and then that did you margins in mining holdup as well? Keith Nosbusch : Yeah, so I think we did not see any meaningful change in margins in the mining industry over those years. I think the projects become more competitive. But in general, that\u2019s why we have to continue to drive productivity. Ted Crandall : I think Nigel we even think that happens is as you might expect. As we start to see the larger project going away which is the larger projects generally tend to be lower margin and more smaller productivity related projects coming in and moreover activity. In some respects, we actually see a little bit of margin benefit. Nigel Coe : Okay and that\u2019s we are seeing right now in the - you mentioned actually that\u2019s more OpEx driven? Keith Nosbusch : Yes, that is correct. Nigel Coe : Okay and then just the final one, we think sometime think of Latin and Canada as resources markets, currently you are seeing down there, is that primarily within oil and gas in resources, so is it broader than that? Ted Crandall : I say much broader, I mean in Canada right now, we\u2019re seeing significant weakness as you would expect and Alberta with the oil sands, we\u2019re seeing some improvement in other markets in Canada, consumer, automotive, primarily in the Eastern part of the country and Latin America, you know our growth in the quarter and I\u2019d say for last couple of years has been pretty broad based especially in Mexico and Brazil. In Mexico, we\u2019re seeing great growth consumer and transportation. In Brazil, you know transportation not as great, the consumer has been pretty good in additions of the resource based industries. Nigel Coe : Okay, thanks guys. Operator : Thank you for your question. And we have another question for you. This comes from Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Please go ahead, Steven. Steven Winoker : Thanks, good morning. Could you maybe talk a little bit about lot of your peers are attacking their cost structures right now with significant restructuring and they are currently putting up mid-single digit organic growth, they see a global environment that not to similar to what you just described in terms of those international challenges anyway. But maybe just help us think through a little bit about how you are thinking about sensitivities and reaction time right now given the uncertainty at least that\u2019s not weakness outside the U.S. and Argentina and Canada? Ted Crandall : Yeah, so Steve, this is Ted. You know last year, especially with what we\u2019re seeing is the slowdown in our solutions and services businesses, we started the kind of adjust the cost structure in those businesses and we took some restructuring action in the second of the year and some charges in the fourth quarter to facilitate that. And there just one other reason we\u2019re driving the levels of productivity that you saw in the first quarter. So we think we got a little bit ahead of that with the outlook we have for the balance of this, we don\u2019t think we require any additional large restructuring actions, but obviously we\u2019ll continue to monitor that and conditions to material way, we\u2019ll make the appropriate adjustments to our cost structure. Steven Winoker : Ted on that, you know you talked a little bit about GDP in IPI forecasts weakening as well locally, maybe some sense on the sensitivity around that, so when you say you know much weakening from here, I mean how well do you think you are protected, is it just sort of you know miles deceleration from here that you could handle a flat or the absence of growth or have to be something much more than that? Ted Crandall : Well, I mean obviously we got roughly 1.5% to 2% decline from our midpoint, that was reflected, you can see the earnings impact, that is reflected in that low end of the guidance range. And I would say impart, our assumption is that also reflect some cost actions we would take if we saw sales coming in at that level. You know things deteriorate beyond that would be in kind of new booking. Steven Winoker : Okay, alright. And then just a second question on process and your progress interaction on that front. In this environment, are you seeing any further reduced opportunities in terms of your ability to penetrate new customers and new project opportunities, is that as your - is the environment changing and so we be thinking about growth here differently? Keith Nosbusch : No, I think you know we saw 4% growth in process in Q1, we think that is a good growth in this current environment. It\u2019s obviously improved from where we were at the end of last year. And we do - we did lower process growth for the full year, so we were in the mid to high single digits, we are now in the mid-single digit. So we\u2019re little lower about one to two points lower. So our outlook is a little less or bullish and it was at the start of the year, but the majority of that is because of the anticipation of oil and gas as opposed to and inability to be able to continue to find opportunities for Rockwell in process. We still see this as a good growth market for us and opportunity to expand our share. But given the oil and gas environment, we just started would be a little lower than what we started off in - at the start of the year with our November guidance. So process still importance to the good market and something that we can continue to grow and expand our footprint in. Steven Winoker : Okay and just one last one on China, how do you see, I know you talked about the project issue this quarter but Keith, going forward, what is that sort of puts and takes in China that you think could be better at least for Rockwell? Keith Nosbusch : Well, as I mentioned a little bit when we were talking about consumer, we certainly thing that\u2019s a market that\u2019s going to continue to take off as they continue to grow and they continue to demand more from their food supplier. So food, beverage, home and personal care, the consumer related markets were very bullish long term. On China, I think the difficulty in China is the metals markets and overcapacity, liquidity, the banking structures with the bank loans, so I think there was some financial - as far as the underlying markets other than overcapacity mainly in metals. We think consumer there is probably a little overcapacity in the total automotive market, but the multinationals and the JVs continue to growth their share, that\u2019s where we\u2019re obviously the strongest. So we have a good outlook in consumer and transportation. We think oil and gas will continue to be good in China and so that scenario that we\u2019ve been investing more in. And also the infrastructure with the one area that the Chinese our government has continued a stimulus in has been in their metro and rail systems and that scenario where we have opportunities as well and have participated previously. So we think China even with the slowing growth rates will continue to be a market that we find opportunities in. Steven Winoker : Thank you. Keith Nosbusch : Thank you. Rondi Rohr-Dralle: Okay, we have reached the end of our hour or little bit less than hour, so I think we\u2019re going to ramp it up here and I appreciate everyone\u2019s questions. I think we had very great thoughtful questions today on the call and I look forward to talking to most of you afterwards. So thanks for joining us and we\u2019ll talk soon. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s conference call. At this time, you may disconnect. Thank you.",

Baird Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Operator : Thank you for holding and welcome to Rockwell Automation's Quarterly Conference Call. I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. Later in the call, we will open the lines up for questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rondi Rohr-Dralle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rohr-Dralle. Please go ahead. Rondi Rohr-Dralle: Thanks, Matt. Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's second fiscal 2015 quarter earnings release conference call. With me today as always are Keith Nosbusch, our Chairman and CEO; and Ted Crandall, our Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda includes opening remarks by Keith that include highlights on the Company's performance in the second quarter and the first half, and some contexts around our updated outlook for fiscal '15. Then Ted will provide more details on the results as well as our sales and adjusted earnings per share guidance. As always, we\u2019ll take questions at the end of Ted's remark and we expect the call to take about an hour today. Our results were released this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website, at www.rockwellautomation.com. Please note that both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is accessible at that website and will be available for replay for the next 30-days. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. So with that, I'll hand the call over to Keith. Keith Nosbusch : Thanks, Rondi, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call today. Before I get started, I just wanted to say a few words about the announcement that we sent out a couple of weeks ago about Rondi\u2019s retirement plans. This will be her last earnings call and I want to thank her for the outstanding job she has done over her career. Her leadership and contributions most recently in the Investor Relations role has been tremendous. I value her consults, insight and positive can-do attitude. She was a pleasure to work with, a true professional and a great person. She helped us become a better company, but she\u2019ll be around for a while yet and I can assure you that you will all be in good hands as Patrick [Goss] assumes responsibility for Investor Relations starting in July.  Let me start with some highlights for the quarter and the first half. So please turn to page three in the slide deck. Earnings growth in the quarter was robust despite a decline in sales due to a large currency headwind. Organic sales growth was a solid 2.7%, led by Architecture & Software. Logix sales were up 6% in the quarter, driven by our midrange portfolio. Our process business grew 2% in the quarter, which is good results given underlying market conditions. Margin expanded 270 basis points in the quarter, which contributed to a strong adjusted EPS growth of 18%. Free cash flow was also very good in the quarter. Ted will elaborate more on Q2 performance in his remarks.  For the first half, organic growth was about 2.5%, very close to our expectations coming into the year. The standout region was Latin America, with double digit organic growth. Although Mexico led the growth, it was broad-based across the region. Segment operating margin expanded more than two points in the first half, with particularly strong performance in control products and solutions and adjusted EPS was up 15%. So excellent earnings performance in this market environment.  Let\u2019s move on to what we are seeing in economic indicators and market condition. Global GDP and industrial production growth forecast has softened since January. For the US, industrial production growth has moderated for the past several months, with oil and gas weighing on overall economic growth and incremental consumer spending has not yet filled the gap. Automotive remains strong and consumer industries are still solid. For the second half, we expect market conditions to be similar to the first half, but with further declines in oil and gas and improvement in other verticals including auto, chemicals and some other heavy industries.  EMEA's economic indicators have improved slightly and we expect growth to be a little better in the second half with improvement in Home and Personal Care, Life Sciences and increased project activities in Metals and Water, Wastewater. In Asia, India continues to recover and we are seeing good growth there. China remains slow, which is consistent with the PMI continuing to hover around 50. For both China and the region, we expect low single digit growth for the second half and full year. Other conditions in Latin America are mixed. Mexico remains healthy, but Brazil and Argentina are in a recession and Venezuela remains very challenging.  With all of that said, let\u2019s move on to our updated guidance for fiscal 2015. Overall, while not a lot has changed from a quarter ago, we are somewhat more cautious about the rest of the year. Some industrial economic indicators have weakened. Oil and gas customers have cut CapEx more quickly than we anticipated and we would have liked a stronger book-to-bill in Q2. But based on our current assessment of backlog and front-log, we continue to expect higher growth rates in the second half, primarily in our solutions and services businesses. They just won\u2019t be quite as strong as we thought a quarter ago. For our full year guidance, we are lowering our organic sales growth by 1 point and taking off an additional 1.5 points, due to a larger currency headwind. We now expect fiscal 2015 reported sales of about $6.4 billion. In spite of the topline reduction, our expectation for a higher full year margin enables us to maintain an adjusted EPS guidance range of $6.50 to $6.80. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks.  I just have a few closing comments. While I wish we were seeing stronger market growth, I like our competitive position. Revenue diversification and agility are helping us pursue the best growth opportunities. Our strong productivity culture enables us to invest in innovation and organic growth and we\u2019ve demonstrated that even in a lower growth environment, we can still grow earnings and deliver great value to shareowners.  Before I turn it over to Ted, let me take a moment to mention something that I\u2019m very proud of. We recently received the Ethisphere award for the seventh time, naming us one of the world\u2019s most ethical companies. This recognition reflects our employees\u2019 and partners\u2019 commitment to integrity, responsibility and accountability, all essential qualities of a successful and sustainable company.  So Ted, I\u2019ll turn it over to you. Ted Crandall : Thanks, Keith. Good morning everybody. I\u2019ll start on page four, second quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were $1.551 billion, 3.1% lower than Q2 last year. Organic sales growth was 2.7%, but currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 6 points. Sales were down about 1.5% sequentially. Sequential organic growth was about 2%, pretty typical in terms of the historic pattern, but currency translation reduced sales by over 3 points sequentially.  Segment operating margin continued to be very strong at 21.6%, up 270 basis points from Q2 last year, despite the sales decline. The year-over-year margin increase was primarily due to the higher organic sales, strong productivity and favorable mix, partly offset by some increased spending. I\u2019ll note that Q2 last year is our easiest quarterly margin comparison.  General corporate net was $21 million in Q2, up about $2 million compared to a year ago. Still in line with our expectations for the full year.  Adjusted earnings per share were $1.59, up $0.24 or 18%, compared to the second quarter of last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 26% compared to 27.9% in Q2 last year. Last year\u2019s rate included some unfavorable prior period adjustments.  Free cash flow for Q2 was $269 million, another strong result. Free cash flow conversion on adjusted income was 125% in Q2. Our trailing four quarter return on invested capital was 32%. A couple of items not shown here. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were $136 million, down about 3% compared to last year. Also during the second quarter, we repurchased 1.14 million shares, at a cost of $127 million. Year to date, we\u2019ve repurchased 2.69 million shares at a cost of $294 million. In November we talked about a full year repurchase target of $470 million. We are running about 25% ahead of that pace through March. Similar to last year, it\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll spend above the target for the full year. At the end of the quarter, there was $757 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization.  The next two slides present the sales and operating margin performance of each segment, both for the second quarter and year to date. I\u2019ll start with the Architecture & Software segment on page five and I\u2019ll focus my comments on the second quarter results. On the left side of the chart, Architecture & Software segment sales were $674 million in Q2, down 1.8% compared to Q2 last year. Organic growth was 4.8%. We continue to see very attractive growth rates in this segment driven primarily by our Logix platform. Currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by almost 7 points on a year over year basis.  Moving to the right side of the chart, on 4.8% organic growth, A&S margins were 29.8%, up 210 basis points compared to Q2 last year, with the improved margin primarily due to higher organic sales and another good productivity quarter. Spending in this segment was up modestly year-to-date through March. We expect spending to increase in the second half.  Turning to page 6, this the Control Products and Solutions segment. In the second quarter, Control Products and Solutions segment sale were down 4.1% year over year with organic growth of about 1.2%. Currency translation reduced sales by about 5.5 points. Organic growth for product businesses is in the segment was 5%, equally strong to the growth rate seen in Architecture and Software.  However, we continue to experience weakness in the Solutions and Services businesses, with organic sales down about 2%. The book-to-bill in Q2 for Solutions and Services was 1.06. This was lower than we expected and consequently we will be reducing our growth expectation for Solutions and Services in the second half compared to the prior guidance. The order shortfall in Solutions and Services was primarily and heavy industry, with about half that coming in oil and gas. CP&S continued to deliver strong operating margins, 15.2% in Q2, up 300 basis points compared to last year. The year over year margin improvement was due to the organic sales growth, continued favorable mix as our product businesses are out growing Solutions and Services, and particularly strong productivity performance in this segment.  Moving to the next slide, page 7 provides a geographic breakdown of our sales and shows organic growth results for the quarter and the first half. Again, I'll focus my comments on the second quarter. The organic sale growth was driven largely by the Americas, with Latin America continuing to experiencing the highest percentage growth rate. The U.S was up 3.5%. Growth in automotive and customer industries more than offset declines in oil and gas.  Canada was down 11% compared to Q2 last year. As we discussed last quarter, that was not unexpected. Canada is down 1.7% year to date and we are expecting to be down above mid-single digits for the full year. Canada has a disproportionate exposure to oil and gas and declines there are more than offsetting attractive growth rates in transportation and consumer industries.  In Q2 in Latin America, Brazil was about flat year over year, but otherwise growth was pretty broad based across the balance of the region, with Mexico up 18%. Latin America was the only region to experience year over year growth in oil and gas in Q2. EMEA was up 1.2% organically. We saw growth in both mature and emerging EMEA, with a little higher growth in emerging EMEA this quarter. Asia Pacific was up 3.2%, driven primarily by India and China. India was up 16% off of a relatively easy comparison and China was up 6%. As a final note on this slide, overall, emerging market organic growth in Q2 was up over 8%.  Please turn to the next page, which is our updated fiscal year 2015 guidance. As Keith mentioned, we are reducing our full year sales guidance but holding the prior EPS range. Across the guidance range, we are reducing sales by about 2.5%. Approximately 1.5% point of that decline is due to currency translation. In our prior guidance, we expected currency transition to reduce full year sales by 4.5%. We now expect currency translation to reduce full year sales by 6% and to reduce full year EPS by about $0.40.  We are also reducing sales guidance by 1 point to reflect lower organic growth. The lower organic growth is due in part to lower than expected orders in Q2, primarily in our Solutions and Services businesses. Also, we are now seeing an earlier drop in oil and gas spending than we previously expected. These first two factors are related to some extent. And the last factor, we are continuing to see declines in the forecasts for industrial production growth rates.  Our previous guidance called for reported sales of approximately $6.6 billion at the midpoint. We now think the midpoint will be a little over $6.4 billion. The previous guidance called for organic growth of 2.5% to 5.5%. The new guidance is for organic growth of 1.5% to 4.5 %. At the midpoint of sales guidance, we expect year over year organic growth rates in our product businesses to be about the same in the second half as the first half. We expect higher second half growth rates is the Solutions and Services businesses that\u2019s consistent with our backlog and our front log at the end of March. We also expect to see a typically large fourth quarter for sales in our Solutions and Services businesses.  Despite the lower sales, we are maintaining the previous EPS guidance ranges of $6.50 to $6.80. We now expect higher margin to offset the earnings impact of reduced sales. The margin improvement compared to prior guidance is based on stronger Q2 margins, a continuation of the strong productivity into the second half and a more favorable earnings conversion on currency translation than we previously expected.  We now expect operating margins for the full year to be a little over 21.5%. This margin guidance incorporates an increase in spending in the second half compared to the first half. We continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate for the full year of 26.5%. Given our strong cash generation though the first six months, we now expect conversion on adjusted income to be above 100% for the full year.  There are a few other items not shown here that I think generally are of interest. We continue to expect general corporate net expense to be approximately $80 million for the full year. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about $136 million for the full year and finally we are expect process sales growth for the full year to be at above the company average. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Rondi. Rondi Rohr-Dralle: Okay, great. Thanks Ted. Before we start the Q&A, I\u2019d just ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow up so that we can get to as many callers as possible. Mark, we\u2019ll then take our first question. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Please go ahead. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan : Congratulations Rondi. Thanks for all the help. Appreciate it. Hope you enjoy it. Keith, on the consumer industries, could you maybe walk us through a little bit Food and Beverage, Home and Personal Life Sciences, what you are seeing in those different markets. And then also maybe the nature of the investment you\u2019re seeing. You mentioned that Logix was strong in mid-range. I'm just wondering sort of the types of activity you are seeing. Keith Nosbusch : Yes. If we look at the consumer verticals, certainly food and beverage we see that growing in line with the company average in the quarter. We continue to see investment particularly in Asia Pacific and Latin America where there\u2019s ongoing strength with both multi-nationals and indigenous food companies. We are also seeing in particular in Asia and China in particular, the continued need for safety and the risk management of having quality food and quality production processes and that\u2019s driving some of the investment there. In the home and personal care, we are seeing continued investment in innovation in their products and many of the companies are expanding their SKU\u2019s and therefore need new and more flexible machinery to do that. We expect that to continue as we go forward in the second half of the year. And as I mentioned, we think home and personal care will be an area that is above the company average growth. And then Life Sciences, we did see growth in all geographies, including EMEA and this is a pick up from what spanned the previous couple of quarter. That\u2019s a quick picture of what we are seeing in some of the major areas buts a good quarter and basically a good outlook for the remainder of our fiscal year. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan :  Thanks, and then just on process, the up two like you said, pretty good in this environment. Can you just maybe frame for us a little bit how you are approaching the process business right now and thinking out how to grow it in a tough oil and gas environment? Are there other verticals you\u2019re approaching or different approach in terms of product set, etc.? Keith Nosbusch : The product set is pretty much the same. We\u2019ve had some new functionality releases in some of our process in both continuous and the batch hybrid space. But in general, our product portfolio has been pretty consistent over the last couple of quarters after a major release in our planned PAX previously. We are looking forward to some new introductions later this year that will particularly be in the batch hybrid space which is an area that we believe we can continue to grow in. But as far as the markets themselves, while oil and gas is certainly going to see a decline, we believe that chemical will be stronger for us in the second half and going forward. That\u2019s an area that we continue to believe we have some opportunities to grow in.  Even in oil and gas, if you look at -- Ted mentioned that Latin America grew for us in the second quarter. We think there are pockets of investments that are going on, both in emerging markets where either they\u2019re trying to become more energy independent or they just have a government industry that they want to continue to invest in, whether it be the oil side or the gas side. We see isolated opportunities even in oil and gas and in particular some of the midstream activities that will continue to be invested in. And investments, as we talked about in mining, OpEx spending will become more critical in some of these areas and that spending should continue.  We are seeing very isolated, but some pockets of spending in metals. It is very project specific. It is not broad-based and we\u2019ve been successful in a couple of those. We also see once again isolated but pockets of spending in Pulp and Paper, which is an industry that has really been reduced over a number -- probably over the last decade. And so they do look at modernization and energy efficiency investments. And in North America we do see modernization going on in some of those locations. That gives you a little feel for where we see the opportunities to have a little bit above average growth to offset some of the oil and gas decline. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan : That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeremie Capron from CLSA. Jeremie Capron : Thanks. Good morning and congratulations, Rondi, on your retirement. I wanted to ask about Latin America. Very impressive growth coming from Mexico. I\u2019m wondering how much of that is driven by the automotive industry and how long do you think this is going to last? Keith Nosbusch : Certainly parts of it has been driven by automotive and there\u2019s been investment in automotive from both the U.S car manufactures, as well as European and Asian. We see that automotive investment continuing over the next couple of years. It\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019ve identified automotive as one of the areas that is going to grow a little faster for us in the second half. Mexico is where some of these investments are going in. And so we see Mexico and automotive continuing. And when we talk about this, there\u2019ll be two dimensions to that. One will be the car manufacturers themselves, but secondly it will be the tier 1 suppliers to the automotives.  And certainly that\u2019s an opportunity for us as well. The investment and the automation intensity is different than an automotive plant, but we also see that is an area. The other area that we see as an opportunity for us is the fact that some of the opportunities that we\u2019ll see in powertrain now with FANUC and we do know there are some powertrain investments that will be going into Mexico. Independent of what I just talked about with automotive, that\u2019s probably not where the greatest growth has been for us. There is still significant investment going on in oil and gas. Pemex as you know has opened up the energy sector for external investments. So we see that as a continued opportunity.  Oil and gas is very important to the Mexican economy and they\u2019re also modernizing some of their existing facilities. We see that as a potential. And then mining, mining in Mexico is one of the few areas where investment is taking place and also then the growing middle class is pushing for the consumer industries and we see food and beverage and brewing, all of the consumer related industries. Home and personal care has also opportunities for growth. So it\u2019s really a broad-based set of industries that\u2019s driving up growth in Mexico and we have a very good partner network there, a very strong distributor organization that is able to support that growth. So we see continued ability to grow in Mexico in a diverse set of verticals. Jeremie Capron : Thanks Keith. And Ted, I wanted to ask about the margins. Again strong margin performance this quarter despite the decline in reported revenue. You talked about increasing spending in the second half. I\u2019m wondering if you could give us a little more color around that and if you expect the incremental margins to remain at this elevated level for the remainder of the year. Ted Crandall : First, I think spending has probably started off a little slower for us in the first half of this year than we expected in terms of a ramp up. We are up about 2% year over year in spending in the first half. We expect to be up more like 4% year over year in spending in the second half. As it relates to incremental margins, I do not expect incremental margins in the second half to be as strong as what you saw in the first half, but I expect absolute margins in the second half to be about equal to the first half. Jeremie Capron : Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Tusa from JPMorgan. Please proceed. Stephen Tusa : Hey good morning. Rondi, congratulations. It\u2019s been a pleasure working with you. Just on the forex. I think you guys guided to a 40, something in the low kind of $0.40 range forex impact year over year on the last call. Ted Crandall : Last call was $0.38. Stephen Tusa : Okay. So it\u2019s basically another couple of pennies on the percent half. Has anything been changed with regards to the kind of conversion rate of that forex that you\u2019re assuming? Ted Crandall : Yeah, I think I mentioned that. We think we are now going to have a somewhat more favorable conversion rate for the full year than what we anticipated in the previous guidance. Stephen Tusa : On the foreign exchange? Ted Crandall : On the foreign exchange, correct. Stephen Tusa : What\u2019s driving that? Ted Crandall : The conversion rate on the foreign exchange is probably one of the most difficult things for us to forecast. Over time it tends to run at about our normal operating margin, our normal operating earnings margin, but it varies a lot quarter to quarter. Now that we are six months through the year and we\u2019ve got the first half behind us, and it was slightly favorable to what we were thinking, our best estimates now for the second half say that likely continues. Stephen Tusa : Right, okay. And as far as the kind of the core incremental margin, I mean clearly you guys are putting up some very good numbers. How do we think about kind of 30 to 40 going forward? Is that something you\u2019re managing too? Is it -- I know it\u2019s kind of -- all these numbers are kind of an output obviously on the ground doing business. How do we kind of think about what\u2019s going on structurally? Ted Crandall : We have made some structural changes that have boosted our productivity this year and I think we are going to run at a somewhat higher level of productivity this year than it's been the case for the last couple and that\u2019s providing a nice boost to our margins. On a year over year basis, I think you are going to see the largest impact of that in the first half because the margin comparisons get a little tougher in the second half. If you looked at our second half expectations and you pulled out the effect of currency, I think what you see is a conversion is margins that\u2019s pretty normal, kind of around 30%.  That\u2019s kind of a fiscal 2015 answer. In the longer term, we still believe that if we are driving reasonable levels of organic growth and I use that to mean 4%, 5%, 6% organic growth that we should be able to drive 30% to 35% conversion margin. Now it's always going to depend on mix of growth between our Solutions and Service business and Products business and the rate at which we\u2019re ramping spending. It won\u2019t be that in any particular period, but over the longer term we think that\u2019s a reasonable expectation. Stephen Tusa :  Okay and then one last quick one just in Lat Am. You said oil and gas grew. Was that mostly offshore down there or was it just a flavor of that growth? Keith Nosbusch : No. It\u2019s a combination. Matter of fact, the majority of it was probably onshore in the Andean region. Countries like Peru, Colombia in addition to Mexico and Mexico is a mix with a lot of it offshore there, but the rest of South America is pretty much onshore. Stephen Tusa :  Okay great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question come from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed. Richard Eastman : Good morning and Rondi, congrats. Keith, could you maybe just speak for a minute or two, when we look at the modest downtick in core growth that\u2019s forecast now for the year, when I look at this regionally, is this--- it would appear as though maybe expectations for APAC and also perhaps for Canada, maybe you\u2019ve come in a little bit. So thinking about it regionally. And is that again -- I would expect Canada to be oil and gas but APAC, what would be maybe the reason for that? Is that just kind of China globe PMI or? Keith Nosbusch :  I think just to characteristic it for the year, we believe each region will be down other than Latin America. That would be the way we would characterize it in total, but [indiscernible] I'm talking about versus other -- versus our guidance last quarter. So that\u2019s why we took the overall guidance down organically a point. Richard Eastman : Then just one follow up question here on exports. With the stronger dollar, are you seeing anything on pricing, -- also competitive pricing there? And also again is the US dollar just making us less competitive from an export standpoint? Keith Nosbusch :  As always quite frankly, a stronger dollar makes us less competitive export wise. When you see the dramatic change against the Euro, that is helping the Europeans, particular OEMs compete and then there\u2019s also another dynamic going on and that is China. And you look at China now versus the dollar and China currency is pretty much pegged to the dollar. And with what happened with the Euro, we\u2019re now seeing that the Chinese OEMs are not as -- do not have the same advantage against the European Euro.  So we are seeing some different dynamics going no from a competitiveness standpoint that haven\u2019t been seen in a while, in particular because of the magnitude of the Euro-Dollar change and then the impact on other currencies, particularly with there\u2019s strong exporting economies. And I think that\u2019s part of the reason why you\u2019re seeing a little bit of a decline in the China numbers. China for us, OEMs have slowed a little. So we have seeing some of the impact there. But just to be clear in the US, in the US most of our OEM business is domestic business, not export business. We have not seen a significant impact to our business at this point in time. Richard Eastman : Your business, what\u2019s good for the European OEMs competitively versus the Chinese, your component sales into those European OEMs, is that business held up? Because that\u2019s where our cost advantage would be, right? Keith Nosbusch : Yes. So far it has and part of the reason is a lot of the European strength is with exporting OEMs. And so that\u2019s for machinery and a lot of the strength of exporting OEMs is to the US now and that\u2019s into where our strength is and where our capability of supporting those machines and the customer base is the strongest. I think you\u2019ll see our ability to continue to grow. It\u2019s why CompactLogix is growing at a faster rate than the ANS and Logix average quite frankly is because we continue to be able to work the European exporting OEMs and that\u2019s because it's not a domestic sale and it's a benefit to Rockwell to have a strong position with the exporting OEMs in Europe. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning and Rondi, I hate to should so repetitive, but congratulations and thanks for the help. It's been a pleasure. I just want to some back to the FX conversion. Is it because the mix of currency has changed i.e. a weaker Euro region performance, weaker Canadians performance or has there been a change to your hedging policy? Ted Crandall : I would say there has been a change in the mix of currency from our prior guidance to this guidance and that is some of that. We have made no changes in our hedging policy, although the mix in currency, it does have impact on the hedging results related to that. But I would say a lot of this is just about we\u2019ve got better visibility now about what to expect in the second half and we\u2019ve got two quarter under our belt. Nigel Coe : Okay, that\u2019s clear. And then on the revision to the full year core growth outlook, obviously the second half range is pretty wide as it normally is, but I was a bit surprised you lowered the -- took the low end down to 1.5, which implies a deterioration from the first half run rates. Given that we\u2019re seven months into the year now, I\u2019m just wondering, what drove that incremental course at the low end? And perhaps if or could maybe add some color in terms of what you saw in March going into April. Ted Crandall : I don\u2019t think we were trying to send any message with the low end. I mean we focus kind of primarily on the midpoint. We always think of the midpoint as the most likely result. We maintain kind of a symmetric range around that midpoint. I wouldn\u2019t read a lot more into it than that. As it relates to the month of April, I would say early in the month it started a little bit slow. It has accelerated through the month and right now I think it would-be fair to characterize it\u2019s -- what we have seen is consistent with our guidance. Nigel Coe : Okay great. And then just finally, the 10.6 book-to-bill on solutions, it's in the zone of where it was last year 1.1. What sort of book-to-bill were you expecting in your previous plan? Ted Crandall : I would say we were hoping we were going to see something about 5 point higher than that. So maybe like 1.11, 1.12. We missed orders in Solutions and Services on the order of $40 million. Nigel Coe :  Okay, great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question come from the line of Richard Kwas from Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Richard Kwas : Good morning. On the solutions service or CP&S versus ANS, what\u2019s the split on oil and gas exposure between the two businesses? I assume that CP&S with solutions exposure there, there\u2019s a fair amount there, but what\u2019s the split out when think about segments? Keith Nosbusch : When we think about the two segments, we don\u2019t have a precise, but we believe A&S is about 30% of it and CP&S is about 70% of it. Within CP&S, about 85% of it is solutions and services. So in total it\u2019s about 40% products and about 60% solutions and services. Ted Crandall : Rich, what Keith was giving you is kind of the breakdown of our total sales in oil and gas. I think where you were going is and I would agree, we have a lower percentage of sales in oil and gas and Architecture & Software than we have in Control Products and Solutions. Rondi Rohr-Dralle: I think if I do some high level quick math here, as a percentage of A&S, sales is less than 10%. As a percentage of CP&S, sales is going to be 15% blocks for this and 12% for the total company. Richard Kwas : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then with the debt raise and the free cash flow generation, any change in the priority for use of cash? Ted Crandall : I don\u2019t think any significant change is in the priority. As I mentioned, cash flow is running a little stronger this year than we originally projected. We are running ahead of pace on repurchases. I suspect that\u2019s going to continue. Richard Kwas : Okay, great. Rondi, thanks for everything. Enjoy San Diego. Rondi Rohr-Dralle: Thanks Rich. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Please proceed. Steven Winoker : Thanks and Rondi, I\u2019ll echo everybody\u2019s congrats and thanks as well. Let me just ask a finer point on the margin question and the margin details sustainability. That FX conversion, could you maybe quantify a little bit more how much that contributed and were there any transaction benefits as opposed to translation in there? Ted Crandall : Every period we\u2019ve got a combination of translation, transaction and re-measurement gains and losses running through that currency number. Rondi Rohr-Dralle: And hedging. Ted Crandall : Well, hedging is part of the transaction. But in Q2 we saw a very modest margin benefit from currency. Margins were up year over year 270 basis points. The favorable currency effect related to that we think was about 20 basis points. It was not zero, but it wasn\u2019t large. Steven Winoker : Okay. And then, so then that brings me back to pricing mix productivity, the other items and you already mentioned the incremental investments came in -- or the year on year came in lower than you expected. But maybe give us a better sense for what you think was productivity versus pricing mix leverage just to help us understand that sustainability question going forward. Ted Crandall : I would say productivity was probably the single largest item in the quarter, although we did get a favorable kiss from both organic sales growth. We have this favorable mix year over year. It\u2019s probably about half a point. On the productivity, we\u2019ve talked about this a little bit in the past. We have a very well established and ongoing productivity program in the company and it includes our strategic sourcing efforts, a continuous focus on improved manufacturing and labor utilization, product and process cost reductions and all of that consistent with implementing lean and six sigma business processes. In the second half of last year, we stepped up our productivity goals, thinking that we might face more difficult macro conditions this year. And we\u2019ve had success across both segments driving higher productivity, but with particularly strong productivity improvement in Control Products and Solutions. We talked last quarter about restructuring actions in CP&S, in the second half of last year. Those are showing up now as higher margins, particularly in our Solutions and Services business. As I said, we expect this to be above average year for productivity improvement. Steven Winoker : Where do you take R&D? Ted Crandall : R&D is up year over year, but I would say the increase right now is relatively modest. That is a timing issue. I think you\u2019re going to see that. That will pick up for us in the second half. Keith Nosbusch : That\u2019s what I was just going to say. That is one of the areas that we\u2019ve been slower with the ramp up simply because of availability and it\u2019s going to be part of that 4% growth in the second half that Ted mentioned earlier. Steven Winoker : Okay, great. And just lastly Keith, maybe talk a little bit more about the competitive dynamics and process. You talked about the currency impact, but further to that, it sounds like your commentary you think you\u2019re gaining share still relative to even if we just compare to the Europeans or others. How are you thinking about your share moves progressing? Keith Nosbusch : We believe we continue to gain share in the process space. Obviously it\u2019s an area that we did not compete with the breadth of our portfolio historically. So it\u2019s a new area for us. It\u2019s been the biggest growth in our serve markets over the last couple of years. And we still see process as one of the better opportunities and areas for us to drive revenue growth. So the majority of that quite frankly, is going to be, we have to take share. The market, we have to be growing above the market growth rates here and that means we are going to have to take share. We think the best opportunities for us to take share are in the batch hybrid space and then in certain applications in the heavy industries that we are focused on in oil and gas, in Pulp and Paper, in metals and now chemicals is a better area.  We\u2019ve identified specific applications, specific geographies that we can continue to make inroads with the modern DCS approach that we take with our portfolio. We think we have some competitive differentiation. We think our plant-wide optimization message is critical for helping customers drive cost and global competitiveness and cost efficiencies and productivity. We have a very targeted approach for where we are looking at it and there\u2019s a large legacy install base that we also have focused on to be able to update and upgrade because of the fact that those legacy systems are no longer supported or available from the original manufactures. We have a very broad, but yet focused initiative here to drive that growth. And we still believe that it\u2019s an area that while the timetable has stretched out, our goal continues to be to double that business that we had as of 2012. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Julian Mitchell : Hi, thanks and thanks again Rondi for all the help. In terms of European demand, I think one of your competitors had sounded pretty good about Europe improving in general in the industry business a few days ago. I don\u2019t think you had mentioned some of the OEMs obviously getting a boost from the currency. I just wondered underlying sort of fundamentals beyond just some of those export OEMs, are you seeing a genuine increase in the pace of order intake in Europe? Keith Nosbusch : Yes. We have seen some improvement in the outlook in Europe in our front-logs. We see that the major areas that we see the improvements would be in the Home and Personal Care markets. The Life Sciences markets have been growing there for us as well. And then also if you take very isolated countries or locations, we\u2019ve seen some growth in metals and some growth in the water Wastewater area, as well as part of it. That continues to be an area that we see growth opportunities and consumer is a space that continues to develop and continues to create opportunities for modernization in I\u2019ll say mature Europe. And then in the emerging Europe that\u2019s where we have seen some of the higher growth opportunities. And in fact emerging Europe grew at a faster rate for us this last quarter than Western Europe. A couple of good industries, a couple of good countries and yet a more positive view of the economy there than certainly six, 12 months ago. Julian Mitchell : Thanks and then just one last one on the margin outlook. Ted, I think you\u2019d called out mix was around 50 bps helped margins in Q2. I think in Q1 it was also a decent drive up, particularly in CP&S of the margin. Just wondering in your second half outlook on margins, what are you -- are you assuming mix is flattish, or still should be pretty favorable? Ted Crandall : I think mix is going to -- it will certainly be less favorable than the first half because we\u2019ll get that traditional significant jump up in solutions and services sales, particularly in Q4. And as we said, we are expecting better growth in solutions and services in the second half. I think we are going to have a little bit of mix headwind, but my expectation is the volume leverage should make up for that. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Rondi Rohr-Dralle: Before we go to our last caller, this is Rondi, I just want make a couple of comments. I\u2019m not sure that we got this out, but I want to make sure that we are clear about our revised expectations for oil and gas for the full year. We think it could be up to 10% down as implied at the midpoint of our guidance. And then if you back engineer second half, that\u2019s probably down something like mid-teens. And so I just want to make sure we get that out. The other thing I just wanted to say a few words quickly before we go to the last caller, since this is the last call that I\u2019ll be participating in, I\u2019ll take a little bit of license here, but I just want to say that it\u2019s certainly been a privilege to represent such a great company to the investing community. I feel really lucky that Ted asked me to do this job seven years ago. I\u2019ve often said that I think I have the best job in finance. Now I\u2019m going to cry. I\u2019ve learned a ton. I\u2019ve really enjoyed working with all of you and I appreciate all the best wishes. With that, I think we\u2019ll just take the last call. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical research Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research : Thank you very much. Well, we don\u2019t want to make you cry Rondi, but hopefully we are making you blush a little bit. You\u2019ve done a great job. You deserve it. Thank you for taking the last call. Ted, I just wanted to come back. Obviously, perhaps not obviously, but I think the biggest surprise for everyone is the margins this quarter. And it is very difficult from the outside looking in to get our head around productivity and how to model that and that\u2019s always going to be the case for sure. I guess really my question is; as you said you\u2019re pretty comfortable at 30% to 40% incrementals on 4% to 6% organic growth, but how do we think about what you have left in productivity tank if we really are stuck at, pick a number two or three. Where does the incrementals want to go in that type of environment? Ted Crandall : Sure. So I think that\u2019s a fair \u2013 Jeff, I think your question is beyond fiscal 2015. Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research : Yeah, beyond fiscal 2015. Correct. Ted Crandall : I think you\u2019re absolutely right. Look, if we start to operate in an organic growth mode of 2% to 3%, it will be difficult for us to drive incrementals that are in that 30% to 35% range. And part of the reason it will be difficult is it will be more difficult to drive higher levels of productivity. Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research : Yeah, it makes sense. Could you also give -- it\u2019s interesting, we didn\u2019t get many oil and gas questions. So Rondi, thanks for jumping on with that. It\u2019s like, wow, this whole debate is over. Let\u2019s move on to the next thing. I was interested in what you were actually seeing in OpEx versus CapEx. We\u2019ve heard from a lot of companies that OpEx is getting slashed very dramatically because it\u2019s what people can cut quickly. Are you seeing that type of behavior? A little bit of color on what you can see in the forward CapEx budgets versus the near term behavior of your customers. Ted Crandall : Yeah, so Jeff I think the first thing I would say is our actual visibility into what exactly is CapEx and OpEx is not great, but the larger declines and the earlier declines we have seen have come more on the solutions and services part of our business than in the product part of our business, which I think would cause us to conclude that so far it has been more about CapEx and not as much about OpEx. Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research : That\u2019s really interesting. And then just finally on the FX question, so really your guide now at $0.40 puts your FX conversion margin at your average margin roughly speaking. You were anticipating it to be \u2013 so you thought it was going to be worse than typical and we\u2019ve ended with the typical result. Ted Crandall : That\u2019s correct. Frankly, our guidance last quarter was somewhat colored by a less favorable result in Q1. Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research : Yeah. Okay, thank you for squeezing me in. I appreciate it. Thanks a lot. Take care. A - Rondi Rohr-Dralle: Okay Mark, I think you can go ahead and conclude the call. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference. At this time you may disconnect. Thank you.",

Baird Jeremie Capron - CLSA Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley Steve Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Robert McCarthy - Stifel Nicolaus Operator : Welcome to Rockwell Automation's Quarterly Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Patrick Goris, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Goris, please go ahead. Patrick Goris : Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's third quarter FY '15 earnings conference call. With me today are Keith Nosbusch, our Chairman and CEO and Ted Crandall, our CFO. Rondi Rohr-Dralle is here as well, as Rondi and I transition today. Our agenda includes opening remarks by Keith that include highlights on the company's performance in the third quarter and some context around our updated outlook for FY '15. Then Ted will provide more details on the result as well as our sales and adjusted earnings-per-share guidance. As always, we'll take questions at the end of Ted's remarks. We expect the call to take about one hour today. Our results were released this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website at www.RockwellAutomation.com. Please note that both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is accessible at that website and will be available for replay for the next 30 days. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. With that, I will hand the call over to Keith. Keith Nosbusch : Thanks, Patrick and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I hope that all of you in New York will find a cool spot, given the heat forecast coming. Before I get started, I would like to take a moment to formally introduce Patrick Goris, who as I mentioned on the last call, has taken over IR responsibilities with Rondi's upcoming retirement. Patrick joined Rockwell Automation over nine years ago and he has been be finance leader of our architecture and software segment for about four years now. Patrick, welcome to your first official earnings call. I'll start with some highlights for the quarter, so please turn to page 3 in the slide deck. I'm pleased with our performance in the quarter as we delivered another quarter of solid earnings growth, despite a year-over-year decline in sales due to a large currency headwind. Organic sales growth was 2.2% with higher growth in architecture and software. EMEA with 4% organic growth was our highest growth region this quarter, driven by emerging countries. Safety continues to do well and was up double digits. As you remember, we're the market leader in industrial safety control and this growth reinforces its importance to our OEM and process initiatives. Logics grew slightly above the architecture and software growth rate. Process reflecting underlying market conditions was down 3% in the quarter. Margin expanded 200 basis points in the quarter which contributed to adjusted EPS growth of 7%. Free cash flow continues to be very strong. Ted will elaborate more on Q3 financial performance in his remarks, but I will add a few comments about our performance through three quarters this year. Our revenue diversification efforts, whether from a geographic or vertical perspective, are yielding results. We have shown that we can continue to grow even if an important vertical like oil and gas is contracting significantly. Excellent execution and strong productivity drove a 210 basis point improvement in segment margins, resulting in double-digit EPS growth in spite of lower sales. Our ability to generate cash remains excellent, with strong free cash flow conversion through three quarters. These are very good results in a slow growth environment. Let's move on to market conditions and economic indicators and what we expect to see in our business for the remainder of the fiscal year. Global GDP and industrial production growth forecasts have softened since April. For the U.S., we experienced 3% growth in Q3 and expect about the same in Q4. Our full-year growth rate will be lower than we thought one quarter ago. Automotive and consumer remain the strongest verticals in the U.S., oil and gas, the weakest. As expected, we saw improved growth rates in EMEA during the third quarter. We expect continued modest improvement in this region led by consumer, particularly life sciences. In Asia, India is doing well and we're seeing good growth there. China, however, continues to slow and third quarter sales were flat year-over-year. We're not seeing improvement in the China market as capital spending remains very constrained. While oil and gas entire are down year-over-year in China, we continue to grow in consumer and auto. We now expect China sales to be about flat for the year. China does remain a very important longer-term growth opportunity for us. We just do not see a short-term catalyst for growth. Market conditions in Latin America remain [indiscernible]. Mexico continues to be the bright spot, while other countries including Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela are in a recession. Auto and consumer are growing above the region average and oil and gas is growing in Mexico. Other heavy industries including mining are weaker. With all of that said, let's move on to our updated guidance for FY2015. We told you a quarter ago that we expected higher growth rates in the second half of this year. Since then, the outlook for industrial production has weakened and our third quarter organic sales performance came in somewhat below our expectations. While sequential growth will continue in Q4, we know longer expect higher year-over-year growth in the second half and we're lowering the midpoint of our full-year organic sales growth guidance by 1 point. Assuming a smaller headwind from currency, we continue to expect FY '15 reported sales of about $6.4 billion. In spite of lower organic growth, improved margin performance enables us to narrow the adjusted EPS guidance range to $6.55 to $6.70. At the midpoint, this would represent a 7% increase in adjusted EPS on about a 3.5% year-over-year decline in reported sales. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks. I just have a few closing comments. While the market conditions may not be ideal, I like our competitive position. We have a differentiated portfolio of products and services and dedicated employees, distributors and partners that are committed to provide the best service to our customers globally. We remain focused on innovation and I am confident in our ability to deliver attractive shareholder return while we continue to invest in profitable growth opportunities. Before I turn it over to Ted, let me take a moment to mention Rockwell Automation's TechED 2015, an important annual training event we hosted in June in San Diego. During the event, customers, distributors and partners learned from industry leaders on how to achieve operational excellence with expert-led sessions, hands-on labs and innovative presentations. Our June event was a resounding success with about 1,800 attendees from 45 countries and all 50 states. This event is a good example of how we, together with our distributors and partners, continue to help our customers optimize their operations. Our main customer event of course is Automation Fair which will be held in Chicago this year on November 18 and 19. The investor meeting is scheduled for the 19th. Please mark your calendars as we hope to see you all there. With that, I'll turn it over to Ted Ted Crandall : Thanks, Keith. Good morning to everyone on the call. I'll start on page 4, third quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were $1.575 billion, 4.5% lower than Q3 last year. Organic growth was 2.2% but currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 6.8%. Reported sales were up about 1.5%, sequentially. Organic growth was 2%, sequentially.  Segment operating margin was 21.8% in the third quarter, up 200 basis points from Q3 last year, despite the reported sales decline. The year-over-year margin increase was primarily due to the high organic sales and strong productivity, partially offset by modestly increased spending. General corporate net was approximately $22 million in Q3, up about $4 million compared to a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.59, up $0.10 or 7%, compared to the third quarter of last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 27.9% compared to 27.6% in Q3 last year. We now expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be about 27%. That's about 0.5 point higher than are previous guidance, primarily due to a different distribution of pre-tax income across geographies. The adjusted effective tax rate in Q3 spiked a bit due to the year-to-date adjustment to the new higher full-year tax rate. Free cash flow for Q3 was $267 million, another very strong result. Free cash flow conversion on adjusted income was 123% in the quarter. Our trailing fourth quarter return on invested capital was 33.1%. A couple of items not shown, average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 135.5 million, down about 3% compared to last year. Also during the third quarter, we repurchased 956,000 shares at a cost of about $115 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 3.65 million shares at a cost of $410 million. In November, we talked about a full-year repurchase target of $470 million. We're running about 16% ahead of that pace for June. At the end of the quarter, there was $642 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Moving on to the next two slides which present the sales and operating margin performance of each segment, both for the third quarter and year-to-date, I'll start with the architecture and software segment on page 5 and I'll focus my comments on the third quarter results. On the left side of the chart, architecture and software segment sales were $684 million in Q3, down 4.4% compared to Q3 last year. Organic growth was 3.1%. Currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 7.5% compared to prior year. Sequential organic growth was 1.8%. Moving to the right side of the chart, on the 3.1% organic growth, A&S margins were 29.2%, up 60 basis points compared to Q3 last year, with the volume leverage on organic sales growth and productivity partly offset by higher spending. Turning to page 6, this is the control products and solutions segment, in the third quarter control products and solutions segment sales were $892 million, down 4.6% year-over-year on a reported basis, with organic growth of 1.6%. Currency translation reduced sales by 6.3%.  Organic growth for the product businesses in the segment was 5.3%. Organic sales for the solutions and services portion of the segment declined by about 1%. The book-to-bill in Q3 for solutions and services was 1.1%, better than last quarter and a little better than Q3 last year. Sequential organic growth for the controlled products and solutions segment was 2.2%. CP&S delivered very strong operating margins at 16.1% in Q3, up 310 basis points compared to last year. In addition to the contribution from organic growth, year-over-year productivity was particularly strong in this segment. Moving to the next slide, page 7 provides a geographic breakdown of our sales and shows organic growth results for the quarter in the nine months through June. Keith covered a good deal of the third quarter results in his comments. I'll maybe just add a couple of additional notes. As you can see on the slide, the organic sales growth in the quarter was driven largely by the U.S. and EMEA, offsetting a continued decline in Canada and with Asia-Pacific and Latin America up only slightly compared to the same quarter last year. Canada was down almost 8% compared to Q3 last year. This region had the largest oil and gas exposure. As Keith mentioned, the EMEA organic growth in Q3 was largely driven by the emerging countries. Emerging countries were up mid-teens with modest growth in mature Europe. In Asia, India grew double digits while China was flat as Keith said and mature Asia declined in the quarter. Our Latin America growth was 1.1% in the third quarter. Mexico experienced organic growth in the mid-teens but that was largely offset by declines in the balance of the region. As a final note on this slide, overall emerging market organic growth in Q3 was 5.8%, despite the flat China. Please turn to the next page which is our updated FY '15 guidance. As Keith mentioned, we're revising the full-year guidance at the midpoint. We're reducing organic growth expectation for the full year by one point. Keith talked to those changes which are primarily related to the U.S. and China. We now expect a little less headwind from currency. Previous guidance called for the combination of currency translation and acquisitions to reduce sales by 5.8%. We now expect that to be about 5.5%. We expect reported sales of approximately $6.4 billion at the midpoint. The previous guidance called for organic growth of 1.5% to 4.5%. The new guidance is for organic growth of 1.5% to 2.5%, a more narrow range with only one quarter to go in the fiscal year. Our operating margin performance has continued to be very strong through the first nine months and we expect that to carry forward into the fourth quarter. For the full year we now expect operating margin to be about 22%. That's a little above the prior guidance. As I mentioned previously, we now expect an adjusted effective tax rate for the full year of 27%. That's up 50 basis points from the prior guidance. Given the lower organic sales, somewhat higher margins and a headwind from a higher tax rate, our new EPS range is $6.55 to $6.70. Higher margin is offsetting the lower sales. We've remained within a couple of cents of the previous guidance midpoint, despite losing about $0.05 to the higher tax rate. Given our strong cash generation through the first nine months, we now expect conversion on adjusted income to be about another 110% for the full fiscal year. With better cash flow conversion and given that our year-to-date spending on repurchases was at a rate above our original full-year repurchase target of $470 million, we now expect to spend at least $525 million on repurchases for FY '15. There are a few other items not shown here that I think are generally of interest. We expect general corporate net expense to be approximately $85 million for the full year. That's up about $5 million from the previous guidance. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 136 million for the full year and we expect process sales to be about flat on an organic basis for the full year. With that, I'll turn it back over to Patrick. Patrick Goris : Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we have quite a few callers in the queue today and we'd like to get to as many of you as possible. Please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Then you can get back into the queue if you want to ask another question on a different topic. Operator, let's take our first question. Operator : The first question comes from the line of Scott Davis at Barclays. Please go ahead. Scott Davis : Can you give us a sense, Keith and Ted, if you can separate out oil and gas as best you can? I know you said Canada is down about 8%. Can you give us a sense how much oil and gas you think was down and a little bit of forward look in that regard? If there's a book-to-bill or anything else you can share to help us understand how close we're to a bottom there? Keith Nosbusch : Oil and gas in Q3 was down about 10% and we would expect for the fiscal year, it would also be down 10%, maybe a little bit better which gets us through Q3 down 7% on a year-to-date basis. I think it's a little too early for us to say that we know it's a bottom. Certainly, the next quarter will give us a good picture. If we're able to be steady state again in the third quarter I think we have our answer. It's become very mixed, however, as to spending. Obviously, you picked up Canada. The U.S. is definitely down as well, but Mexico was up. The Middle East remains reasonably solid. What we're seeing is a transition into more OpEx spending than specifically upstream exploration spending. We're hoping that we can convert some of the production dollars in CapEx into OpEx as we go forward. Scott Davis : Okay. I'm curious your views in China. You sequentially got more bearish. Some of the other companies have as well. What's your sense on the region? What I am asking, I think, really is that there was all of this hope there would be a secular shift from labor to capital that you would see more automation spend. It sounds like folks are so nervous about demand dynamics and just not wanting to spend. Do you see this more as a short-term issue? How do your local guys feel about the one, two, three year outlook? Keith Nosbusch : We definitely feel that there is a short-term issue at this point, a lot of that driven by what's the liquidity. It's still difficult for small and midsized customers. The rates are still reasonably high. We had expected to see in China growth in the second half of the year which was not the case. Particularly, I think the currency is hurting a little bit. Their exporting OEMs are suffering because of that. I think we have seen a pickup in some of the infrastructure investments, but that's typical China behavior. We believe the transportation industry, automotive is mixed with some of the leading companies still investing, but the slowdown in consumption is, I should say, in auto purchases is hurting. The majority of the market, [indiscernible] is slowing because of overcapacity now. Yet we continue to see growth in the consumer industries, mainly the food and beverage areas, particularly with the concerns for safety and the ongoing expansion of the middle class which quite frankly, is why we continue to stay positive on China in the long term. Certainly in the short term, there are spending concerns both from a company standpoint as well as individual standpoint. I think we have to see how the current phenomenon, the stock market transition the last couple of weeks, what will be the long-term impact of that as well. Operator : The next question is from John Inch at Deutsche Bank. Go ahead. John Inch : Obviously, all eyes are on 2016. For most of the companies, it's calendar, but in your case it's fiscal. What I would like to ask you, Keith and Ted, is as you literally add up all of these trends around the world, you are currently putting up very slow, low-single digit organic growth. It's actually better than lots of companies, but it's still pretty slow. Do you see anything in your front log, your mix, your initiatives that prospectively should call for 2016 to be an improvement from that trend or perhaps even a deceleration in some manner? Obvious China is decelerating and it's a pretty important region for you. Then you called out EMEA improving. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it sounds like there's really nothing on a net basis, but you guys are insiders. What are you thinking there? Keith Nosbusch : What we\u2019re thinking as we're going to reserve commentary on 2016 until November, so that's our first thought. To just to give you a little flavor for what currently is going on and that is our front log and quotation is stable. I wouldn't say we're seeing a meaningful change in the activity. Obviously, the concern that we have talked about is the declining industrial production. That's been a pretty consistent drum beat starting in the spring time frame now, but when you look at the forecast for industrial production, it shows improvement as we go through 2016. I would say there's mixed messages at this point and that's one of the reasons we want to get a couple of more months here and get a better feel before we give our 2016 guidance. John Inch : Keith, some companies, not against the quarters backward but looking, they have called out trends in the June quarter with very weak May and then an improving June, July. Did you see any of that? If so, was there in the commentary you can give overall about the way the quarter progressed? Keith Nosbusch : The quarter did get stronger as we went April through June. June would have been the strongest month in the quarter. That, I guess, you could say would be the trend for the quarter. Ted Crandall : Although, I would say that's pretty typical for us works for us. Keith Nosbusch : Yes. That's not unusual in our business. I would say that July with the holiday and everything started out slow. John Inch : Just last, the commentary, Keith, I think is apparent for China. You have over the last couple of years put in through a lot of initiatives with lower-end product, as part of the bifurcation in the market right there between consumer and heavy industry. Are you seeing and are you satisfied with the adoption rate of those lower-end microcontroller products? Obviously you're very strong in large controller. What's happening in smaller controller? Could that be a Rockwell specific source of improvement in 2016 in China, even if the overall market doesn't improve? Keith Nosbusch : Certainly, we believe that is one of the areas that we should be able to grow in. That's heavily influenced by our success in the OEM market and that's what a lot of it is targeted for. I did mention OEMs were weaker, particularly exporting OEMs, because of the exchange rate, particularly into Europe. I think our product portfolio continues to get better to serve that market. We call that the mid-range market and that's our controllers, our drives which is a very strong portfolio as well. That will continue to be an area that we expect better than market performance in China. Certainly, has been an area of focus for us this past year in particular. We've still got to get a better little traction. Ted Crandall : John, at the risk of cutting that answer a little too fine, I do want to draw upon I think we have a better opportunity in mid-range and a larger opportunity in mid-range than in microcontrollers. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan at UBS. Please proceed. Shannon O'Callaghan: Maybe just a quick margin question, obviously CP&S, really strong margins, you mentioned the productivity. It also looks like the product mix was favorable, but maybe just some more thoughts on why that came in so strong and if that productivity is sustainable? Ted Crandall : Yes, so I talked about actions we took at the end of last year, some restructuring actions. That structural productivity contribution to CP&S is probably about half of the productivity that we're seeing in that segment and certainly, why that segment is running stronger than A&S. The other half is what I would call normal sourcing actions and lean and Six Sigma productivity projects that we always have in the pipeline. I think we probably tended to underestimate a little bit as we have gone to this year the level of productivity we were driving in CP&S. I would say it's been stronger on the solutions and services side of that business than on the product side, but I do think it will be sustained. I think as we go into Q4 the margin comparisons get a little bit tougher, but I think we will sustain that productivity. Keith Nosbusch : Yes, the only comment I would make in addition is, I think we're also benefiting by the mix. As solutions grow at a faster rate going forward, that will have some downward pressure on margin. Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay. And then just in terms of when you look at verticals that are actually growing, what kind of investments are you seeing customers make? Our customers actually willing to make, it might not be capacity but a major redo a plant or whatever, are they willing to stick their necks out and make a real investment? Are these kind of smaller necessity kind of upgrades that you're seeing? Keith Nosbusch : I think it depends on the geography. For example, the two verticals that are growing the best for us are automotive and then consumer. In automotive, there's a lot of greenfield investment, particularly in Mexico and a couple of the emerging markets, including China in that comment. In the mature markets, as you know in the U.S., the U.S. automotive companies are continuing to invest in new platforms so it's not necessarily capacity as much as new models and refurbishing their lines. In particular, we see longer-term investment in the power train side of the business because of the fuel standard improvements that are mandated, new engines, new transmissions which you are now seeing. I think that would be the area that we see there. With respect to the [indiscernible], it's pretty much the same story, emerging markets with the growing middle class and the greater need for automation and for protecting the safety of the product. We see more investments in automation. When we see it in the mature markets, it's really driving modernization of some of the new lines to update the existing installed base and also to deal with new, more flexible packaging to drive productivity. I think that's where we're seeing the greatest growth in those two verticals and it varies between mature and emerging markets. Operator : The next question is from the line of Rich Kwas at Wells Fargo Securities. Go ahead, please. Rich Kwas : Can you comment on the competitive framework in China right now? There's been one of your largest competitors out there saying that pricing has been more competitive there. What is your angle on that? What's your view at this point? Keith Nosbusch : In China, pricing is always competitive but it tends to be the nature of the culture as well to some degree. I would say we're not seeing significantly different activities, but there is fewer large projects. I think on the few there are, what you traditionally see is a more competitive environment. I think that remains the case on the few large projects that are out there. I think that would include some of the infrastructure investments that our taking place. They tend to now require a more competitive bid. I would say the area that is probably the greatest impact and it's not necessarily a pricing phenomenon, it's just a situation of currency which is the exporting Chinese OEMs are less competitive now because the RMB is pegged more to the dollar and therefore with the euro weakness against the dollar, the European OEMs our more competitive. That hurts the exporting OEMs in China, particularly into the European market. I would say that's not necessarily a pricing issue. It's more of a currency issued there. Rich Kwas : You've seen the impact from that in the last couple of quarters that have been part of the slowdown? Keith Nosbusch : Yes, we have. I think that is part of it. Rich Kwas : I guess this is a question for Ted, on the margins, if you back out FX you've got a very high incremental again. In the past, you've talked about organic growth having being in that mid-single digit range to get to that 35% incremental on an organic basis. How should we think about it as we move out the next several quarters in terms of momentum on productivity and how much that can help sustain the margin versus what you need in terms of underlying demand improvement? Ted Crandall : I think I would still give the same guidance we have always talked about which is if we get organic growth falling into the low-single digits, it will be harder for us to drive conversion margins in the 30%, 35% range. I think what you are seeing this year is really a combination of two things. One is our productivity is above average this year. We've talked about that in previous quarters. The other thing is we're getting about 1% price this year on low organic growth. That also tends to help with the conversion margin. Rich Kwas : Okay. Just a quick one, Ted, you had a very strong CP&S margin quarter here. Typically, you see a nice sequential ramp in the fourth. Just given the base level is higher here, how do we think about that just shorter term? Ted Crandall : I think we're certainly going to see an acceleration in volume in CP&S just because fourth quarter is always our highest solutions and services shipment quarter. Normally, we would see some expansion of margin consequent to that, even though we're going to have a significant negative mix impact. Operator : The next question is from Steve Tusa at JPMorgan. Go ahead. Steve Tusa : On that margin side, I guess just to ask the question a little bit differently as John was talking about in this low-growth environment and the trend for the second half of this year carrying into next year, can you still improved margins? There was such an amazing performance this year. I'm just wondering if your conversion is below the 30%, can you still improved margins in that environment? Ted Crandall : Without talking specifically about 2016 because as Keith said, we're not giving guidance on 2016 yet, I would say generally our expectation is even at low levels of organic growth, 2%, maybe even 3%, 2% to 3% range, even at those levels we think we should be able to drive some level of margin improvement generally, but not the 30%, 35% conversion that we would expect at higher rates of organic growth. Steve Tusa : Okay. Just to Mexico, how strong was Mexico? Then within Mexico on oil and gas front, should we think about Pemex there obviously? What's the flavor of the Mexico oil and gas strength that you're seeing? Keith Nosbusch : Yes, Mexico for the quarter was up, I think, mid-teens. That was, once again, a strong quarter of growth for us. When you were talking oil and gas in Mexico, you're talking Pemex. Of course, they have a supply chain there, but Pemex drives it. It's 100% of the business and they are continuing to invest and modernize. They are modernizing their platforms and also their transportation areas. That has been the area of growth as opposed to significant new drilling that's going on. We do see an opportunity with some of our install base to be able to participate in the upgrades and the modernization that's going on. Steve Tusa : Okay. One last quick one, process for the fourth quarter, what you expect that growth rate to be for the fourth quarter for total process? Keith Nosbusch : Process for the fourth quarter, we expected to be right around flat maybe a little negative, but overall for the fiscal year, flat. Operator : The next question is from Richard Eastman at Robert W. Baird. Go ahead, please. Richard Eastman : Keith, could you maybe speak just a little bit to the EMEA commentary. You mentioned emerging countries in EMEA were plus mid-teens. I'm curious. What is the industry exposure there and the market exposure, as well as which countries are you speaking to there? Ted Crandall : Sure. We're speaking to Turkey. I would say the Middle East, when you think of the Middle East in my commentary, think of it as the oil industry in the Middle East which is now broader than just oil. Think of it as Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, Abu Dhabi. Then sub-Saharan Africa would be the other one and Central and Eastern Europe. It's pretty much the rest of Europe, Middle East and Africa and we sold good growth. Other than Turkey in the quarter, we saw strong year-over-year growth. Actually, we also saw growth in Russia, but that was the delivery of a project. We're certainly seeing less opportunity with respect to orders. Once again, that's the lumpiness of our solutions business which is prevalent throughout that entire region. Richard Eastman : Are the end markets, it sounds like spend, Middle East spend on oil and gas is still holding its own and the other markets slant towards consumer, food beverage, that type of thing? Keith Nosbusch : Yes, just to clarify the Middle East, the Middle East is expanding and other areas. Some of our growth there was in metals. Because of the low cost of energy, they do attract energy intensive industries. The other was in wastewater project as they continue to build infrastructure for their population. I would say oil and gas is the primary, but we had two very significant projects in metals and wastewater in the Middle East. In the Eastern Europe, a lot of it does tend to be the consumer related industries, per your comment. When we talk about sub-Saharan Africa, it tends to be heavier in mining than anything else at this moment. The resource industries typically lead. We also see some consumer as the population growth is starting to attract some of the multinational food companies to invest. Richard Eastman : Then a last follow-up here, Ted, when I look at the low end of the FY2015 organic growth guide, so the 1.5% core growth, as the fourth quarter plays out and the trend seems to play out, I suspect the A&S business would still trend line out at low-single digits through the fourth quarter, simply because it's got the consumer facing exposure and processor and auto. The CP&S when you pick up the all in gas exposure, the process, that could likely be a negative number in the fourth quarter year-over-year, despite the fact it should be up sequentially? Would that be the trend? Ted Crandall : I do think our solutions and services business will be down slightly in the fourth quarter year-over-year. Our products business will be up. Operator : The next question is from Jeremie Capron at CLSA. Please go ahead. Jeremie Capron : I wanted to follow-up on Scott's question around oil and gas. I get a sense from your commentary that you think we may be approaching a bottom at least in terms of year-on-year contraction. I think your guidance implies double-digit contraction in Q4 and then we will have to see what happens. Wouldn't that be a rather weak down cycle here, particularly as you compare to what happened in mining? I think it took a good two years for your business to find a flow there? Do you think it's fair to assume that starting next year oil and gas would not be a major drag on your business anymore? Keith Nosbusch : No, I don't think that's what I was trying to say. What I was trying to say is we aren't ready to call it stabilizing. We'll need at least another quarter to see if the declines that we saw in Q3 start flattening out or if we're going to see continued reduction in Q4. Right now we're calling, to your point, exactly right, we're expecting a double-digit decline in oil and gas in Q4 and depending on at what level that comes in, we'll have a better feel for going forward. I do think to the point of your question, I don't think we will see a significant increase in spending until we see an increase in the price of oil. I think those two will be a very connected. At this point, I think we're still at too low of a level to see meaningful incremental investment, no matter where the bottom is. I think we still need to see higher oil prices to drive new investment, as opposed to just OpEx spending to improve productivity and their cost structure. Jeremie Capron : Okay. And shifting gears here a little bit here, the free cash flow looks very strong, conversion rate, well above 100%. We've seen that for a few quarters now. Can you help us understand what is driving this and as a consequence do you see upside to your share buyback target that was set earlier in the year and I think you explained you're trending ahead. How should we think about buybacks going forward? Ted Crandall : I would say the biggest factor influencing the higher conversion on adjusted income is better working capital management. Working capital has not increased at the rate we expected, despite the fact I'm talking on a constant currency basis, despite the fact we've had about 2% organic growth. That's the biggest factor. As it relates to share repurchase, we originally set a target in November of about $470 million and as I mentioned in my comments, we now think we will spend at least $525 million this year. We ran ahead of pace through nine months and I think we will run at pace or higher in Q4. Obviously, that will depend on whether there's any acquisition spending in Q4 and also to an extent on stock price. Operator : The next question is from Nigel Coe at Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Nigel Coe : I want to understand and maybe it's a dumb question, but when you say productivity, Keith and Ted, what you mean by that? Are we talking here about when the factory is more productively, especially cost control? What does that actually mean? Ted Crandall : All of the things you've talked about. You can think about this in part as volume leverage that we're getting organic growth. You can think of it as lean and Six Sigma projects which are there to reduce costs, the efforts of our strategic sourcing organization to influence material costs. Margins in our solutions businesses which relates a lot to basically selection of projects and then the execution on those projects. In addition to all of that, savings we got from restructuring actions that we took late last year. Nigel Coe : Okay. And then digging down the next layer, we've got SG&A down 5%, just under 5% year-over-year which is slightly more than sales growth. Normally we would expect SG&A to be a bit stickier than sales. How does all of those actions you just referred to, how is that impacting SG&A line? Ted Crandall : I don't think the actions we've taken have had a big effect on SG&A. I think what you're looking at in the 5% decline is more the effect of currency translation year-over-year. With that said, we've not had large spending increases either in SG&A. Nigel Coe : Okay. Just final one, maybe I'm wrong but mining, I think last quarter you mentioned expectation of maybe some growth in mining in the second half of the year. It sounds like that's gone a little bit weaker. Is that fair? Maybe add some color to what you have seen on mining? Ted Crandall : I think if we look at the year-to-date results, mining is actually slightly up for us year-over-year. The performance in any quarter is going to bounce around a little bit. I suspect for the full-year, mining's going to be either flat or slightly up for us this year. Operator : Your next question comes from Steven Winoker at Bernstein. Please go ahead. Steven Winoker : Last quarter, you had talked about as part of the margin discussion, that spending was a bit slower in first half than originally expected, especially R&D efforts. I think you're up 2% compared to 4% you might expect in the second half on R&D. You talked a lot about this. Can you may be hit the R&D side a little bit? On all of the spending side, are you no longer anticipating bringing that up? What's going on with the projects? Ted Crandall : Last quarter, we talked about spending up about 2% in first half and the expectation that it would be up about 4% and second half. We did not accelerate a lot of spending in the third quarter and we now think that our spending for the second half will be up about 3% instead of 4%. As part of the margin improvement that's reflected in the guidance. Steven Winoker : Okay, all right. All of that's really coming in the fourth quarter now. Ted Crandall : I would say, not all of it, but back weighted. Steven Winoker : Quickly on the solutions versus services down 1%, obviously, I assume solutions was down significant and service is stable. Can you put color around that? Ted Crandall : If I recall correctly, services was actually up year-over-year in the quarter. You are correct. The decline was all due to solutions. Steven Winoker : Okay. Any number around that? Ted Crandall : I don't know that offhand. Steven Winoker : Okay. Keith, a bigger picture of your question, given the unique picture that you guys are in. What I'm seeing across the sector now, what's your view? I know it's a big question here, but what your view of world manufacturing, excess capacity and excess inventory? You've talked about automotive. You've talked about consumer a little bit. Are their particular spots where you think the world is in a significant excess capacity situation other than the oil and gas commentary in mining? Keith Nosbusch : I think the one we've been talking most about, historically, is metals. I would say metals is still definitely in an overcapacity situation, particularly metals in China which has not reduced their capacity. You've seen capacity taken out of the U.S. and that's happened over a number of years. I still think we have overcapacity there. I think we're beginning to see, at least in China, some overcapacity in the tire industry. They still have overcapacity in their overall automotive industry, but it tends to be in the domestic suppliers, the second and third tier automotive companies that are losing market share. Many of those are state-owned, so they are very difficult to close and to reduce. But I would say that's where we've seen the overcapacity. I would think in most of the other industries, it's not an overcapacity situation. In the emerging markets, it's about creating capacity, particularly for the growing middle class and consumers. In the mature markets, it's about modernization and reducing cost and improving business performance and investments are going into that. An output of that would be some capacity expansion, but they are not making the investments due to capacity expansion. I would say, if you take China in particular, independent of overcapacity, there is a need to deal with the escalating labor cost. That's just a natural tailwind for automation investment as well. We do see some benefit there, independent of some of the other comments I made. Operator : The next question is from Julian Mitchell at Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : The first question, I just wanted to circle back the gross margin expansion you've seen and the extent to which you think that mix has been a help there this year or if you think the mix you've seen in 2015 is fairly typical, assuming no big changes in the overall demand environment? Ted Crandall : I would say if you looked on a year-to-date basis, the mix is slightly favorable this year. It's had a small positive effect on margin. I think for the full-year, I'd expect that to be about the same. Julian Mitchell : Understood. Secondly, I guess if you think about the appetite, the customer appetite around large project activity, if we exclude extractive industries for a second, metal, mining, oil and gas, how is the appetite for that kind of project spend changed? Is a very different versus three months ago? Your comments sound a little more cautious, but you have a decent book-to-bill. Keith Nosbusch : I don't think large project activity has changed a lot in the last three months. I think one of the things we've seen is with industrial production rates slowing and that been true pretty much globally, maybe with the exception of EMEA, with industrial production rates slowing, what we're seeing is somewhat less MRO and small project activity. Operator : Thank you. This comes from Robert McCarthy at Stifel. Go ahead, please. Robert McCarthy : First and I apologize if you've already talked about it on the call, did you cite what the book-to-bill was for services and solutions was on the quarter and what Logix growth rate was? Ted Crandall : Yes. The book-to-bill for solutions and services was 1.1 and Logix growth rate in the quarter was 3.5% organically. Robert McCarthy : Do you have any outlook for what you expect the fourth quarter for Logix? Ted Crandall : We expect Logix in the fourth quarter to grow less than 3.5%, but still positive. Robert McCarthy : Okay. And then, the final question is in terms of Canada, in terms of [indiscernible], you have a big global balanced mix in terms of your productive capacity, but clearly the Canadian dollar has moved against you. Have you called out what kind of the headwind has been on transactional basis there? Ted Crandall : No, I don't think we have. I don't think we have ever talked about specific currency transactional headwind. Robert McCarthy : Okay. Was it material or not? I guess it wasn't. Ted Crandall : I'm stopping to think about it. We manufacturing in Canada and export to the U.S. and we also manufacture in the U.S. and export to Canada. I'm trying to think of what that balance will be. Robert McCarthy : Okay. It sounds like it's relatively balanced. For some other industrials, they got nipped by that. Don't worry about it. I'll leave it there. Keith Nosbusch : Okay. Thank you, Rob. Patrick Goris : Okay, that concludes today's call. Thank you very much for joining us. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. At this time, you may now disconnect. Thank you.",

Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Operator : Thank you for holding and welcome to the Rockwell Automation quarterly conference call. I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. Later in the call, we will open up the lines for questions. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Patrick Goris, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Goris, please go ahead. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's fourth quarter fiscal 2015 earnings release conference call. With me today are Keith Nosbusch, our Chairman and CEO; and Ted Crandall, our CFO. Our agenda includes opening remarks by Keith on the company's performance in the fourth quarter and full year. Keith will also provide context around our outlook for fiscal 2016. Then Ted will provide more details on the results as well as our fiscal 2016 sales and adjusted earnings per share guidance. As always, we'll take questions at the end of Ted's remarks. We expect the call to take about one hour today. Our results were released this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website at www.rockwellautomation.com. Please note that both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is accessible at that website and will be available for replay for the next 30 days. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. So with that, I'll hand the call over to Keith. Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Patrick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to page three in the slide there. Both sales and earnings came in below our expectations in the quarter. Organic sales declined a little over 2%. As we progressed through the quarter, conditions softened. And September was especially weak, particularly in the U.S. product businesses. We expected the U.S. to be up low single digits, and organic sales instead declined almost 3%. Remember that we have limited visibility in our product businesses, and September typically is the strongest month of the year. The shortfall in the U.S. was broad-based across verticals but particularly in oil and gas. China was the other weak spot. Sales in China were flat compared to the third quarter, but came in a bit lower than expected. For the company, currency was an even larger headwind than we expected, reducing sales by 8% year over year. Overall, lower operating margin and lower sales led to the decline in adjusted EPS. Ted will elaborate more on Q4 financial performance, including the restructuring charges, in his remarks. Obviously, the fourth quarter was a challenging end to the year, but I believe we executed well during 2015 in difficult market conditions. Here are some full-year highlights. We delivered modest organic growth despite significant headwinds from heavy industry end markets, including oil and gas. Process was down a bit in the quarter and flat for the year. We feel pretty good about those results given what other process players are reporting. Logix was up 4% for the year. That is about one point above Architecture & Software growth. For the quarter, Logix was flat. Segment margin improved 120 basis points due to excellent execution, including particularly strong productivity in the Control Products & Solutions segment. EPS grew 4% in spite of 5% lower sales. And free cash flow conversion was excellent, resulting in record free cash flow of about $1.1 billion. Return on invested capital of almost 33% was also a fiscal year record. We continued to return cash to shareholders, over $950 million during fiscal 2015. This was a 19% increase compared to fiscal 2014. And today we announced a 12% dividend increase, the seventh consecutive double-digit increase since the beginning of 2010. These were good results in a difficult environment. I would like to thank our employees, partners, and suppliers for their continued commitment to serve our customers. Their dedication is key to our success. Let's move on to the market conditions and economic indicators and what we expect to see in our business in fiscal 2016. We are experiencing weak market conditions as we enter the fiscal year. Heavy industry end markets, including oil and gas, have not stabilized, and we see continued softness in key emerging markets. Growth in automotive and consumer verticals globally will be insufficient to offset these headwinds. In the U.S., the strong dollar is also affecting producers and equipment builders, and the broad-based slowing we experienced in September has persisted in October. We therefore expect a particularly weak start to the fiscal year. Current forecasts, however, call for continued global GDP and industrial production growth in 2016. And for the U.S., industrial production is expected to pick up after an anemic first half. That is why we are projecting gradual improvement, including year-over-year growth later in the year. Taking all these factors into consideration, we are expecting fiscal 2016 organic sales to be flat to down 4% year over year. Including the impact of currency, we are initiating fiscal 2016 sales guidance of about $6 billion and adjusted EPS guidance of $5.90 to $6.40. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks. Before I turn it over, I would like to remind you that we will be holding our main customer event, Automation Fair, next week in Chicago. As in prior years, we expect to welcome thousands of customers and partners from all over the world. We will showcase our latest technology and that of our partners. Attendees will take part in forums, technical sessions, and hands-on labs and network with peers to learn how to bring their connected enterprise to life, optimizing their business performance, and driving their competitive advantage. I am particularly excited about this year's event. We are on track to have record attendance. And in fiscal 2015 and 2016, we will have launched an unprecedented number of new products, including our next-generation high-performance integrated control and information architecture. With this new offering, we will help our customers realize a step function change in productivity and global competitiveness. In short, we are enabling our customers to achieve their connected enterprise. Our innovation engine is really humming. In closing, the prospects for Rockwell Automation continue to be very attractive. Even in the challenging market conditions we currently have, producers and equipment builders still need to have our technology and expertise as we help them achieve their business objectives. The long-term secular drivers for industrial automation and information remain intact. And we will continue to enhance our competitive differentiation in order to expand the value we provide our customers and gain market share. With that, here's Ted. Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Keith. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to start on page four, the fourth quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were $1.608 billion. That's down 9.8% compared to Q4 last year. This was the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 with an organic sales decline and coupled with the largest negative impact from currency of any quarter this year. On an organic basis, sales declined 2.3%. We were expecting organic sales growth of about 1%. As Keith mentioned, that shortfall was driven primarily by lower sales in our product businesses and especially in the U.S. market. Currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 7.6%. That was a full point more than we expected at the beginning of the quarter. Segment operating margin was 20.9%, down 1.3 points from Q4 last year. The lower margin year over year is primarily due to lower organic sales, unfavorable currency conversion, and $12 million of restructuring charges that we took in the quarter. We took the restructuring charges to get our cost structure more aligned to the outlook for fiscal year 2016 and to create some headroom to reallocate spending to our most important priorities in what we expect to be a difficult market environment. General corporate net expense was $20 million in Q4 compared to $22 million a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.57. We missed the midpoint of our guidance by $0.23. Unfavorable currency effects and higher restructuring charges accounted for half of that miss. Of course, lower organic sales also contributed to the miss. Adjusted EPS was down from $1.86 last year, primarily due to lower sales and margin, partly offset by lower share count. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 134.3 million, down 3% from Q4 last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 28.2%. That compares to 27% in the fourth quarter last year. Free cash flow for Q4 was very strong at $309 million. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares at a cost of $196 million. For the full year, we repurchased a total of 5.4 million shares at a cost of $606 million. That's almost 30% more than the $470 million in repurchases that we projected at the beginning of the year, and related to our strong cash flow performance. The rolling four-quarter return on invested capital was 32.6%. Turning to page five, this is the full-year version of the key financial information. Sales were $6.308 billion for the full year, down 4.8%. Organic growth was 1.1%. Currency translation reduced sales by 6%. Segment operating margin for the full year was 21.6%. That's up 120 basis points from last year. The primary causative factors were the contribution from organic growth and strong productivity, which were partly offset by higher spending and unfavorable currency effects. Adjusted EPS was $6.40. That's up 3.7% compared to last year despite the decline in reported sales. Free cash flow for the full year was $1.077 billion, which was 124% of adjusted income. The strong conversion was driven by very good working capital management through the year. The next two slides present a graphical view of the sales and operating margin performance of each segment. I'll start with the Architecture & Software segment on page six. On the left side of the chart, you'll see that Architecture & Software segment sales were $684 million in Q4. That's down 8.5% from the same quarter last year. The organic sales decline was 0.4%, and currency translation reduced sales by 8.1%. Moving to the right side of the chart, in the fourth quarter, on the 8.5% decline in reported sales, Architecture & Software margins dropped by 3.8 points to 27.3%. A little less than half of the drop in operating margin is due to a higher than normal unfavorable currency conversion in the quarter. The balance is due to increased spending and the segment's share of the restructuring charges that I mentioned previously. As we expected, spending was up significantly in the quarter in this segment both sequentially and year over year, and largely related to the timing of R&D project costs. The Q4 spending level in A&S is not indicative of an ongoing run rate. For the full year, A&S sales were down 3.4% as reported, with 3.1% organic growth. Segment operating margin for the full year was 29.4%, essentially flat compared to fiscal year 2014, with about one point headwind due to unfavorable currency effects. On page seven, a similar view for the Control Products & Solutions segment; in the fourth quarter, Control Products & Solutions segment sales declined by 10.7% year over year, with an organic sales decline of 3.6%. Currency translation reduced sales in this segment by 7.2%. The organic sales decline for product businesses in the segment was about 3%, and for solutions and services about 4%. The book-to-bill in Q4 for solutions and services was 0.83. That's about the same book-to-bill as Q4 last year. CP&S has delivered very good operating margin performance this year, and that continued in the fourth quarter. Operating margin was 16.2%, up 40 basis points compared to last year. For the full year, CP&S sales were $3.558 billion, down 5.8% year over year and down 0.4% on an organic basis. On an organic basis, product sales in the segment were up about 3% for the full year, and solutions and services sales declined by about 2%. CP&S segment operating margin for the full year was 15.5%, an increase of 190 basis points compared to 2014. This was a great result despite an almost 6% drop in reported sales and largely attributable to very strong productivity performance in the year. Page eight provides a geographic breakdown of our sales and shows organic growth results for the quarter and the full year. My comments will all refer to organic growth rates. As Keith mentioned, the U.S. was the biggest negative surprise in the quarter. Sales in the U.S. declined almost 3% compared to Q4 last year. Product sales declined about 4% year over year. Sales in the U.S. were flat sequentially. We expected sequential growth of 7%, which would have been more in line with historical norms. Sales to customers in oil and gas in the U.S. were down year over year almost 30% in the fourth quarter and sequentially about 15%. We expected a sequential decline, but not quite this large. In the balance of the world, oil and gas sales were pretty much as we expected in the quarter. There appears to be a general slowdown in U.S. industrial customer spending, both capital and operating spending. And what we experienced in the U.S. market in Q4 seems to be consistent with what we have seen reported by other automation-related and electrical suppliers, including some of the major distribution companies. Demand slowed through the quarter, as Keith mentioned, and September was especially weak, down about 10% compared to September last year. Demand levels in October and early November were down about the same amount. And consequently, we expect a very weak first quarter for sales in the U.S. For the full year, U.S. sales were up about 1%, with automotive as the best performing vertical. Canada sales in Q4 were down just under 10%, but pretty much in line with our expectations for the quarter. For the full year, Canada was down 5%. Resource-based industries continue to be a drag on our Canadian business. EMEA was up almost 4% organically in the quarter and up a little over 2% for the full year, with consumer-related industries as the best performing. The emerging countries of EMEA generated the higher growth rates in 2015, but mature Europe was up 1% for the full year. At the beginning of last year, we didn't expect that EMEA would exceed the U.S. growth result. In Asia-Pacific, sales were down 10% year over year in Q4. India experienced modest growth in the quarter, but China was down high teens percent year over year. China was flat sequentially, but we expected to see some growth. For the full year, Asia-Pacific was down about 1%, with China down mid-single digit and low double-digit growth in India. Latin America had another solid quarter at 5% growth, with strong growth in Mexico more than offsetting a decline in the balance of the region. For the full year, Latin America was up 9%, with Mexico growing in the high teens and Brazil about flat year over year. Organic growth in emerging markets for the full year was 4%, led by Latin America and despite the decline in China, which is our largest emerging country. And that takes us to the fiscal 2016 guidance slide. Based on demand levels as we exited September and that have continued through October and early November as well as our current backlogs in solutions and services businesses, we expect a very weak start to the year. We expect organic sales in Q1 to be down mid-single digit year over year, driven by the U.S. being down high single digit. With that starting point, even with projected IP [Industrial Production] growth next year, we don't expect sufficient sequential growth in the balance of 2016 to get us to a positive organic growth result for the year. At current exchange rates, we expect a headwind from currency in Q1 similar to Q4. So on a reported basis, Q1 sales could be down over 10% year over year. For the full year, we expect currency to reduce sales by 300 basis points. Our projection for translation impact assumes recent exchange rates. For example, we're assuming an average euro rate of $1.09. We expect fiscal 2016 sales to be approximately $6 billion. Organically, we expect sales to be down next year about 2% at the midpoint, with a range of minus 4% to flat for fiscal year 2015. By region, on an organic basis, we expect U.S. and Asia-Pacific to decline a couple points more than the company average, and we expect to see growth in EMEA and Latin America. We think results will be relatively balanced across our products and solutions and services businesses, with product businesses declining at a little greater rate than solutions and services businesses in 2016. We expect segment operating margin to be a little above 21%. That would be less than a 0.5 point decrease compared to 2015, with conversion margin of about 30% on the sales decline. We expect the full-year tax rate to be about 27%, equal to fiscal year 2015. Our guidance for adjusted EPS is $5.90 to $6.40. At the midpoint of guidance, that represents a 4% reduction in adjusted EPS on 5% lower sales. Q1 will be our most difficult year-over-year earnings comparison. We expect free cash flow conversion on adjusted income of about 100%. A couple of other items not shown here, general corporate net expense should be approximately $80 million in 2016. We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 132 million for the full year. We intend to continue to return excess free cash flow to investors. Keith already talked about today's dividend increase. The amount we spend on share repurchases in 2016 will depend on free cash flow and acquisition spending. But at this point, we expect to spend about $500 million on repurchases for the full fiscal year. The next page includes an EPS walk from fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2016. As you can see, currency is expected to be a significant headwind in 2016. As the benefit of currency hedges becomes smaller, currency conversion is more unfavorable year over year. Core performance is down about $0.10. That represents about 15% earnings conversion on lower organic sales, which we think is a pretty good result. Modestly higher spending and a somewhat unfavorable mix is offset by strong productivity and a tailwind from lower incentive compensation. As I mentioned on the previous slide, no significant impact from tax year over year. And finally, continued share repurchases are expected to provide a $0.20 or roughly 3% tailwind to EPS. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Patrick to begin the Q&A session. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we have quite a few callers in the queue today, and we would like to get to as many of you as possible. So please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. We appreciate your cooperation. Operator, let's take our first question. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan, UBS. Please proceed. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning, Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, Keith, how do you reconcile or make sense of the record attendance at Automation Fair? It certainly seems like there's a lot of interest when you talk about all the innovative new products coming out, but yet contrasting that with the extremely weak trends here and seemingly a lack of willingness to invest. There's a lot of interest in the Automation Fair, but we're not seeing the spending. Explain a little bit what you're seeing in that contrast, and then just your confidence coming out of this. Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Two things, the first would be Automation Fair, we believe with the theme of it being the connected enterprise and then, to your point, the dramatic increase in new products that are going to be introduced during the fair that we have a lot of excited customers about the opportunities to learn what is coming and how it can help them be more competitive. And there's no better time for our customers to focus on new technology than when their business is slowing and they have an opportunity to look at the new technology and integrate it into their strategies or their new machine lines as they come up. So we think this is a great opportunity. The fact that it's in Chicago, it's always a well-attended fair. We think this year it will be even greater than the last time we were in Chicago, and that's because the Midwest is still the heart of manufacturing in the U.S. So we're excited to be there. We're excited with the messages that we will be providing our customers and, quite frankly, the confidence in the future. I think we have never been better positioned than we are today, and it's only going to get stronger. As I mentioned, this release of the new architecture, the next generation of that architecture and the ability to provide a broader portfolio of Rockwell Automation products and services and solutions is going to be unmatched in the both the industry and in the global environment. So we're going to have customers there from around the world, Europe, Latin America, Asia-Pacific. That will also be a very strong showing. So you can see the interest that our customers have in basically continuing to drive their productivity and improve their competitiveness, and I think that's the message that has been out. We did a lot of pre-work to make sure that our customers knew all of the new products as well as something this year that we're going to have, the innovation demonstrations, where we talk about how the technology is going to evolve in the future and give them a snapshot of how that future is going to look three to five years down the road. So from a combination of new products, the innovations that are coming, and how technology is evolving to enable the connected enterprise, we think that's what's behind the attendance. And quite frankly, we're happy many of you will be there. Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Shannon, your question about high attendance and low spending right now and that disconnect, what we're hoping it is indicative of is customers' expectations that despite low spending right now that they will be spending more sometime next year or sometime this year. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. And then in terms of cash flow, a particularly strong year. I know you guys have been just working on productivity and working capital. Anything one-time in nature this year that you would call out, or is this just good cash execution? Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: I think we really did have good working capital management this year. But in the interest of full disclosure, we also have some favorable timing items that we benefited from in 2015. I think we had some favorable cutoffs at the end of the year on receivables, and we also had some benefits in the timing of things like tax payments this year. So this was an exceptional year for cash flow generation. Some of that is going to reverse next year, I expect. But we're still expecting another good year in 2016. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Shannon. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of John Inch, Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Morning, John. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Can we start with restructuring? You called it out, which you normally don't do. Could you parse it between CP&S and A&S? And then could you give us the total restructuring spend that would compare to the $12 million this quarter for fiscal 2015 and what would be embedded in your guidance for fiscal 2016? Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: There's a lot there, so let me see if I can get all of that. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That's my long one question, first question, yes. Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: So $12 million in Q4 and about $20 million for the full year. We called it out because this was an unusually large amount for one quarter. We're expecting to generate about $25 million of savings in 2016 on that $12 million of restructuring spent in Q4, and that's reflected in our productivity expectations for next year. For next year in terms of restructuring charges, what we'll build into the plan is an amount that is similar to this year \u2013 or to 2015, I should say. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So about $20 million year over year, the same percent? Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yes, and I'm sorry. In A&S and CP&S, it was roughly equal. The restructuring charges in Q4 were roughly equal between the two segments. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Given how quickly things have deteriorated, right, and you guys called out tough U.S. products business in September that spilled into October, we've got tough first quarter coming. I guess without being too specific, it sounds almost though that you're anticipating some sequential pickup, but not enough to get your EPS up year over year. But why would that be the case, meaning if this is the first period of serious U.S. decline, why do you think that next year for whatever reason that things are actually picking up because it really does look like that certainly on the heavier industry side, the global economy is getting worse, not better? So I just want to make sure I'm -- we all know how old Rockwell was very, very cyclical. Now you're more of a CPG company, but we're still trying to understand what's the expectation set for a company that obviously doesn't have a lot of visibility you're not baking in some false hope to the guide framework? Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Right. First I would say, I was going \u2013 you just mentioned it -- I was going to start the answer by saying you know, we don't have great visibility. And I think your question is a legitimate question because there are concerns right now. There has been overall continued very slow global growth. We've got the slowdown in the U.S. in Q4 in industrial business. And if you look in the emerging markets, Brazil and China are still \u2013 we're not really seeing anything that is a near-term catalyst for improvement there. But as Keith mentioned, the forecasts for GDP and IP for 2016 are still indicating growth. Generally, our sales tend to track well with IP growth. In the media and what we're hearing from business people and customers, people are not talking about the recent conditions in the U.S. as a general recession, although there has been some noise about maybe an industrial recession. In the U.S., the consumer side of the economy still seems to be in pretty good shape, including the most recent jobs report that was very positive. And we've generally thought that this should be a longer up cycle given the sluggish global growth. So it was all of those things that we took into account in looking at the outlook for 2016. And based on that, we're thinking this is more of a pause that will be followed by some sequential growth, not the beginning of a deeper downturn. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That's fair. But on the other hand, we're going to get through the December quarter and roll into a new year. I guess what I'm trying to understand is, are you assuming things hold, Ted, at these levels and then pick up maybe beyond the March quarter, or do you assume that things are going to actually start to begin to sequentially improve post the December quarter, I guess, is the question. Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: No, I would say generally we're not expecting to see sequential growth until the second half of the year. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, so first half tougher and sequential growth second half. Got it. Okay, thank you. Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: You're welcome. Thank you, John. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa, JPMorgan. Please proceed. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Good morning. Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning, Steve. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Can you just tell us? I guess the software business outside of embedded and the stuff that goes along with the products, but just your more \u2013 like the MES [Manufacturing Execution Systems] type of stuff, what that did in the quarter, and then ultimately what that did for the year as well? Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yes, absolutely. We had a very good quarter in our IS Solutions business, which is Information Software, in the quarter. We had a high for the year of sales. It was up above the average for the company. We also had very strong margin and OE performance in the business as well. We continue to expand the pilot programs with rollouts at multiple customers now. We currently have over 100 customers running FactoryTalk Production Center, and we have the suites installed in over 200 plants. And so this continues to be an area that now we are looking at growing it more aggressively. It's at the forefront of the connected enterprise and what we can do for customers in the IT/OT convergence that is currently going on. And quite frankly, after a number of years, this is the best that that business has been positioned with the suites that they have as well as the ability to deliver both revenue growth and profit growth at the same time. So that team has done a very good job there. And we think as we continue to build upon the connected enterprise story and vision that our software business will play a more important role going forward. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Sorry, so it did grow, just to be clear. And then just lastly as a follow-up, because your sales were down, so I would assume that it grew above when you say above the company average. And then lastly, just in Mexico, what's growing so strongly there? Is that still oil and gas that's holding up, or is that auto? And then maybe at a higher level, what are your comments on global auto? And that's it. Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Okay. Yes, it did grow and it has grown for the year, our software business. Mexico is a very broad-based story from the standpoint of what's growing. Obviously, the strongest growth there has been oil and gas, and it has been for us. And we continue to win more midstream projects in oil and gas. The areas, automotive continues to grow, and we expect that to continue into next year. The ability of \u2013 the powertrain capabilities that we have will open new opportunities for us there. We also have great channel capabilities in Mexico, and we're starting to see the power of our distribution model as it continues to mature. And in your emerging markets, Mexico is probably the most mature distribution capability that we have. And so it's brought across verticals. Consumer was very good. OEMs grew tremendously this past year, mainly because of the mid-range capabilities that we have. And so we see the oil and gas, consumer industries, automotive, and the channel work that is going on in OEMs being the areas that is driving growth for us, and we do expect that to continue as we go into 2016, not at as high a level as it grew in 2015, but still the best emerging market performance of the larger countries for us next year. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for the color, Keith. I appreciate it. Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: No problem, Steve. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague, Vertical Research. Please proceed. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Good morning, just a couple other subtopics here. Keith or Ted, could you elaborate a little bit more on just how this abrupt deceleration unfolded? And by that, I mean does it look like it's inventory liquidation? You mentioned MRO. Was there a more abrupt pullback in MRO? Is there is any common theme to what you saw happen? I'm asking the question in the context of trying to understand how we do consider stabilization at some point. Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: So, Jeff, my comments are going to \u2013 this is Ted. My comments will reference the U.S. July was a little bit below where we thought it would be. Things picked up a little bit in August and then deteriorated significantly in September, and September got worse as the month progressed. You know as it relates to inventory that generally our end users and OEMs don't keep a lot of inventory of our stuff, and we have very good visibility in North America of the channel inventories. There has been no significant change in channel inventory, so we don't think this is about destocking. I think what we believe is what we have seen here, it has been \u2013 in the U.S. this year it's been generally a lower number of larger projects. But what we saw in the fourth quarter and particularly September looks like a turn down in both MRO and small project spending. And that's why in my comments I suggest that we think this is both capital spending and operating spending. Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: And that's why I think the product business is more because that is what drives obviously the MRO. But also small projects tend to be much more product-centric. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And what's going on with price? Have you seen degradation in price and anything from your foreign domiciled competitors that are disruptive on price? Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: So in terms of our price realization in Q4 and the full year, it was right at about one point, maybe even a little bit better than that. I'd say this year has been a little bit better than average, so pretty much as we expected. I think it would be fair to say we haven't seen any significant change in competitor pricing dynamics. But the U.S. dollar being as strong as it is, is not helpful and thus put increased pricing pressure on us. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And are you seeing a reciprocal positive effect on the European OEM machine builders? Obviously, your share and exposure in the U.S. would be higher, so I wouldn't expect a like-for-like offset. But can you tangibly see and feel U.S. OEM machine builders losing share globally and it being picked up in Europe and other places? Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: I think that is the way the global OEM market operates. It does move \u2013 not with every quick change in currency, but this has been relatively long now. And you are seeing the competitiveness of Europeans increasing. I think we see their attention being turned more to the U.S. because of that. And also, we're seeing because Asia is weaker, China is weaker, there is less European exports to China and to Russia. So I think they're looking at the U.S. as the opportunity to make up for that other decline. And to Ted's point, the currency is giving them a competitive advantage in that regard. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you for the color. Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: You're welcome, Jeff. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe, Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning, Keith and Ted. Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Ted, I guess I just want to run through the bridge. The top line feels reasonable. I mean who knows, but it looks reasonable. But the decrementals on core sales feel a bit light. And I understand there's some restructuring payback, but 15% given what you've done in the past and given the expectation of products is going to be worse than the average, how do you control decrementals in this kind of environment? Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: I think it's a couple of things. There is some spending increase, but it's pretty modest year over year. And then probably the most important thing is we're expecting another strong year for productivity, similar to what we generated in 2015, and that should be helped by the restructuring charges that we took. And then equally important is there's going to be some tailwind from incentive compensation with lower sales and lower EPS year over year. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, okay. And then, Keith, you mentioned your short cycle, it's tough to get a handle on your 2016 trends, but you've seen a lot of down cycles. And I think we tend to agree with you this is more of pause than something more sinister. But drawing on your experience from prior downturns, what gives you confidence, be it from what you've seen in the channel or be it from customer conversations, what gives you the confidence that this isn't a bit more of a severe downturn? Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: I think it goes back to some of the comments that Ted made why we're going to see a very difficult first half to the year. We're still looking at the key indicators for us, which is industrial production. And that's still forecast to grow in 2016 and to grow at a faster rate later in the year. So that historically has been a very good indicator of our performance. And I also think some of our new products, we do expect next year to be able to take market share. So that is always a piece of our equation. I think that's how we look at our ability to demonstrate differentiation. And certainly, with our new technology and our new products, we expect as the year unfolds to be able to take share, even in a difficult market environment. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you, Nigel. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas, Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Hi, Rich. Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Keith, on your last comment there around market share, where do you \u2013 I assume that's a global comment in terms of taking share. Is it the usual suspects in terms of taking share in process, or are there other areas that you expect to drive share gain? Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yes, that is the main one. But I would say in addition to that, we think we can continue to grow our share in safety. We think we can continue to grow our share in our power control businesses, both in what I would call our drives business and our intelligent motor control center business with some of the some new capabilities that they are building out. And then as we've talked previously, we are starting to quote and be involved in more activity in powertrain. And we see that as an opportunity that's going to expand for us this next year, and we expect to be able to create some more wins there. And that's an area, as all of you know, we historically did not participate greatly in. So that would be the other one that I would add to the pile in addition to process. Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then just as a follow-up, can you give us some framework for how you're thinking about the various verticals that you're tied to, oil and gas, auto, consumer, food and bev, et cetera, in terms of what's embedded in the outlook? And then second, what's your assumption for the China auto business in 2016? What's embedded in the outlook? Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Okay, let me start with the last one. We think China in automotive will probably be down on a year-over-year basis. That has been a growing piece for us previously, but we have seen some slowdown in the automotive market there with the decline in sales of autos, the front end of autos. With respect to the outlook in the different industries for us, auto, we expect that to grow above the company average and, as I mentioned, increased opportunities in powertrain. Tire is expected to grow above the company average. We've been talking recently about the weakness in the China OEMs. That is going to continue to be true, but there have been eight greenfield plant announcements in the U.S. and Mexico, primarily with Asian manufacturers. And we're very well situated in those expansions. So we see that as a growth. Food and beverage, we think that will be flat next year. With North America, the focus is on modernization and productivity. And in Europe, Latin America, and Asia-Pacific, we expect to get the traditional different variety and packaging changes that will drive growth there for us. In home and personal care, we expect that to grow about the company average. And there, new product introductions and innovation is driving a lot of that. Life Sciences we expect to be above-average growth for us, and that will be driven by the new requirements, including serialization. If we look at some of the heavy industries, there we expect that oil and gas will be weaker in the U.S. for sure and especially in the first half of the year, but we do expect Latin America to be a little bit. Overall, oil and gas will be down about 10% next year. And then some of the small \u2013 excuse me. First, mining will continue to be weak across all regions, with the commodity prices continuing to be down. And also you're seeing a lot of restructuring in the larger global customers, and that tends to slow CapEx spending while that's going on. In some of the smaller verticals, pulp and paper, we think it will be in line with the company average. There is spending going on in the U.S. and Canada for modernization. Metals continuing to be weak and soft, and just a couple of large projects that we'll be participating in in EMEA and Asia-Pacific but overall weak. Chemicals, about the company average, and obviously everyone knows what's going on there with the lower feedstock prices driving additional expansion and modernization in that industry, particularly along the Gulf Coast. So that's a quick overview of all the key verticals and how we're thinking about them next year. Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I appreciate it. Thanks, Keith, for that. Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: You're welcome. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeremie Capron, CLSA. Please proceed. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Thanks, good morning. Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Following up on the oil and gas markets, it sounds like came in below your expectations in the quarter. Can you talk about what you're seeing there and maybe dig a little deeper into your comment about that market being down another 10% next year? How do you see that unfolding, and where do you see a bottom there? Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Well, I think at this point, we haven't seen the stabilization or the bottom. We were a little surprised with the drop in the U.S. this last quarter. The rest of the world operated pretty much as we expected, but the U.S. was stronger decline, which is why we're believing we haven't gotten to stabilization yet. We'll learn a lot more in the first calendar quarter as all of the key companies release their capital spending. But as you've seen with some of the recent releases, they're expecting that to continue to be reduced in the next year, in some cases as high as 20% to 30% reduction. So we're not expecting capital spending to be strong. We do believe that they will continue to spend on driving down their operating costs. We believe we have some new technology that we'll also be talking about at Automation Fair that enables us to create a much more productive oilfield as well as the ability to create more of helping them maintain their assets, their rotating equipment, which is very important in that industry with some capabilities in remote monitoring and in asset management capabilities of that equipment. So we think in some of the smaller countries, they will continue to create opportunities for us to help them become more productive so they can compete better against some of the majors. So the Latin America countries, in particular, Southeast Asia, we'll see some benefits there. But overall, it's going to be another declining year of capital spending in that industry in 2016. So that's why we're cautious about how we're approaching this because we don't believe we've seen the bottom. Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Jeremie, I think the other thing coloring our view of oil and gas in 2016 is particularly in our solutions businesses, we're going end of the year with a weaker backlog, and our front-logs would indicate that we're going to see continued declines. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay; that's helpful. Then maybe quickly on EMEA, obviously pretty robust performance there. I wonder how much of that is due to your machine OEM clients, where I think you've made good progress over the recent years. And just a quick one for you, Ted, on pension, you haven't made any comments on that. Just a view on expenses around this and funding. Thanks. Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yes. Certainly, Europe, the best part of our success story there is the continued expansion into the OEM space. We continue to expand the number of customers that we have, and we continue to expand the breadth of our portfolio to where it's more than just a motion on the machines. We're growing our safety business there and we're growing our network sensor business there in addition to our standard drives. So we do see the OEM business in Europe as one of the areas that has been responsible for our continued growth, even in a very difficult environment. Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Jeremie, this is Ted. I didn't mention pension because it's a pretty modest change 2015 to 2016. On an operating cost basis, it's less than $5 million, and the full-in GAAP pension expense increase year over year is about $15 million. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Operator, we will take one more question. Operator : Thank you. And your last question comes from the line of Steven Winoker, Bernstein. Please proceed. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks very much, guys, for fitting me in. Just first on the cost side, in terms of the $20 million of restructuring for next year and given the lack of visibility to increased technology spending and the productivity that's no doubt freeing up capacity, why stop there? Is that just a placeholder? Do you have the project pipeline? How quickly might you increase that if conditions I guess worsen, or how are you thinking about the relative size? We're just seeing maybe larger programs at many of the other companies. Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Steve, I think we believe that the restructuring charges that we took at the end, across 2015, and particularly in the fourth quarter should be reasonably sufficient to get our cost structure adjusted to what the current outlook is. There in any year we've always got some normal level of restructuring charges, which I would say typically is about $10 million a year. We left an extra $10 million in 2016 because of the uncertainty around the outlook right now. And so if things play out the way our current guidance indicates, we think our cost structure is in pretty good shape. If things get a little bit worse, we will probably be looking at taking more restructuring actions. Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: But as we have often said, the areas that we're very careful and cautious about is, as an intellectual capital business, we have to continue to invest in new technology. I mentioned a lot of new products coming out. We want to finish those. And we also need to make sure that our customer-facing resources stay as strong as possible because that's how we're going to get the interest level at our customers with our capabilities. So it does require expense spending to do that. It's all about people. And those are the areas that we want to maintain as high of a capacity as possible for the reasons that we do see this as short term in nature. And we are building our capabilities and our product and service portfolio for the long term for our customers. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, fair comment. And then just on process growth, obviously very, very difficult end markets, but still second year of I guess 4% or below growth in the area, better than apparently with the peers with some of the competitor moves. But maybe just comment on the rate of deceleration in process. And as you look forward, given all the new product introductions and all the effort, are some of the competitors closing the gap as you see them or getting more aggressive in that area, or do you attribute the process growth \u2013 or slower growth all of it to the markets? Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: The simple answer is we are putting it all on the market at this point in time. We believe, to your earlier part of the question, know that some of the new capabilities that we're going to come out in the batch hybrid space will create additional opportunities for us. And as I mentioned, we have some strong capabilities now in the oil and gas space that we believe will also help drive productivity as opposed to just looking at increased production levels and new wells. We think we have an opportunity to help customers reduce their operating costs, improve their competitiveness with the lower oil prices. That's very important, and it's something that they're very interested in as opposed to just expanding the production rates themselves. And so we think there are a couple of things in here that allow us to still be very focused. We've improved some of our go-to-market strategies in the industry with some project pursuit capabilities. And so we continue to add capabilities to our platforms. So I wouldn't say people are catching up with the multi-discipline control. And I would say we're continuing to remove any of the shortcomings against some of the pure DCS players with our modern DCS approach. So we have a lot of expectations for our ability to continue to grow in process. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, guys. Thanks, see you next week. Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: I'm looking forward to it, Steve. Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Okay, that concludes our call today. Thank you for joining us, and I look forward to seeing all of you at Automation Fair next week in Chicago, and safe travels. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your conference call for today. At this time you may disconnect. Thank you.",

Baird Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley Ronnie Upskill - Wells Fargo Jeremie Capron - CLSA Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein Andrew Obin - Bank of America Operator : Thank you for holding, and welcome to Rockwell Automation\u2019s quarterly conference call. I need to remind everyone that today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. Later in the call, we will open up the lines for questions. If you have a question at that time, please press star, one. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Patrick Goris, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Goris, please go ahead. Patrick Goris : Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation\u2019s first quarter fiscal \u201916 earnings release conference call. With me today are Keith Nosbusch, our Chairman and CEO, and Ted Crandall, our CFO. Our agenda includes opening remarks by Keith on the company\u2019s performance in the first quarter. Keith will also provide context around our outlook for fiscal \u201916. Then Ted will provide more details on the results, as well as our sales and adjusted earnings per share guidance. As always, we\u2019ll take questions at the end of Ted\u2019s remarks. We expect the call to take about an hour today. Our results were released this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website at www.rockwellautomation.com. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures, and the webcast of this call is accessible at that website and will be available for replay for the next 30 days.  Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings.  With that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Keith. Keith Nosbusch : Thanks Patrick, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I\u2019ll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck. As expected, we had a weak start to the fiscal year with organic sales down a little over 3%. During the quarter, heavy industry end markets continued to soften globally, particularly oil and gas. Consumer and auto verticals were about flat. In the U.S., the weakness that started at the end of fiscal 2015 persisted throughout the first quarter and was broad-based across verticals.  Oil and gas again was the weakest vertical in the U.S. with sales down over 30% compared to last year, worse than we expected. In China, solid growth in the consumer and auto verticals was more than offset by the very weak heavy industry and tire verticals. Sales in China declined about 10% in the quarter. I am pleased with our continued solid growth in EMEA and Latin America. Emerging EMEA and Mexico continued to be bright spots. Total emerging markets were up 3% in the quarter despite the decline in China. Further weakening of heavy industry end markets globally impacted our process business, which was down 14% in the quarter. Process growth in EMEA and Latin America was more than offset by declines in the U.S. and Asia. Logic sales were impacted by the significant decline in process industries, including oil and gas, and declined 6% in the quarter. You may recall that logic\u2019s growth was 7% in the same quarter one year ago, so certainly a tough comp. I am pleased that we were able to hold segment margin near 21% despite 9% lower sales. Ted will elaborate more on Q1 financial performance in his remarks. Let\u2019s move on to what we expect for the balance of fiscal 2016. With respect to the macroeconomic indicators, the most recent industrial production forecasts call for lower economic growth in 2016 than previously estimated, and only modest sequential improvement later in the fiscal year. Also, since we provided guidance in November oil and commodity prices have further deteriorated. As a result, we expect our global heavy industry end markets, particularly oil and gas, to be weaker than assumed in our November guidance. For the U.S., our largest market, industrial projection growth projections have now turned negative for our fiscal year, and a further strengthening of the U.S. dollar continues to affect U.S.-based producers and equipment builders across verticals. In China, we expect continued weakness in the heavy industry and tire verticals that remain plagued with over-capacity and a lack of capital investments. The consumer, life sciences and auto verticals are still not large enough to offset those declines, but they continue to grow, which bodes well for the future. In EMEA, we see continued growth led by emerging countries. Western Europe is stable and continues to improve slowly. Home and personal care is expected to be the strongest vertical in this region, oil and gas the weakest.  Finally, we believe Latin America again will be our strongest region this fiscal year, led by Mexico. Mexico continues to do exceptionally well across a broad range of industries, including oil and gas. We expect strength in Mexico will offset weakness elsewhere in the region. Taking all these factors into consideration, we now expect fiscal 2016 organic sales to be down 1% to 5% and no longer expect year-over-year growth later in the fiscal year. Including the effects of a larger headwind from currency, we are updating fiscal 2016 sales guidance to about $5.9 billion and EPS guidance to $5.70 to $6.20. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks. Before I turn it over to Ted, I would like to again thank the many of you who attended Automation Fair in November. We had record attendance and I\u2019m sure you were able to notice firsthand the excitement generated by our technology innovations, our expanding product portfolio, including our next generation high performance architecture, and our broader and deeper domain expertise. The connected enterprise message and deliverables are resonating with our customers globally, and our progress has not gone unnoticed. Control Magazine, a leading process industry publication, just released its annual Reader\u2019s Choice Awards and once again our results were great. Of the 53 opportunities across 10 industries and six control disciplines, Rockwell Automation received 32 first place awards. The next best recipient had only 12.  We continue to be recognized as the only automation company with a scalable, multi-disciplined, integrated control and information architecture for plant-wide optimization. This was our best performance yet in this annual survey of process automation professionals, and it is a good indicator of how far we have come with our modern DCS portfolio of technology and domain expertise. Innovation truly is the lifeblood of our sustainable, competitive differentiation.  While current market conditions certainly are challenging, we will appropriately balance short-term financial performance with our long-term opportunities. We will protect key investments in innovation, domain expertise and commercial resources, and we will continue to expand our served market and gain share.  I am very optimistic on our long-term growth prospects and would like to thank our employees, partners and suppliers for their continued dedication in serving our customers. With that, let me turn it over to Ted. Ted Crandall : Okay, thanks Keith. Good morning everybody. I\u2019ll start on Page 4 with our first quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were $1.427 million, and that was 9.4% lower than Q1 last year. On an organic basis, sales declined 3.3% and currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 6.1%. Segment operating margin was 20.7%, and that was down 130 basis points from Q1 last year and primarily due to the lower sales volume and the negative impact from currency. General corporate net was $18 million in Q1 compared to $23 million a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.49, down $0.15 or 9% compared to the first quarter of last year.  The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 22.8% compared to 26% in Q1 last year. Congress recently enacted a retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit for 2015 and made the credit permanent going forward. Without that extension, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 would have been pretty close to our previous full-year tax rate guidance of 27%.  Free cash flow for Q1 was $145 million. Free cash flow conversion on adjusted income was 74%, and we would think of that as a pretty typical result for Q1. Our trailing four-quarter return on invested capital was 32.6%, and there are a couple of items not shown here. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 132.6 million, down about 3% compared to last year, and during the first quarter we repurchased 1.2 million shares at a cost of $122 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $323 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. The next two slides present the sales and operating margin performance of each segment. Page 5 is the architecture and software segment. Beginning on the left side of the chart, architecture and software segment sales were $643 million in Q1, down 9.2% compared to Q1 last year. The organic sales decline was 2.7%, and currency translation reduced sales by 6.5%.  Moving to the right side of the chart, on the lower sales volume, A&S margins were 27.4%, down 3.9 points from Q1 last year. Lower sales volume had a significant impact. This segment also bears the larger brunt of the negative currency conversion impact. I would note that Q1 last year was the highest quarterly margin for architecture and software. Sequentially compared to Q4, margin in this segment was about flat.  Moving to Page 6, the control products and solutions segment, in the first quarter control products and solution sales were $784 million, down 9.6% year-over-year and down 3.8% on an organic basis. Currency translation reduced sales by 5.8%. For the CP&S product businesses, the organic sales decline was about 1%. Solutions and services sales were down about 6% organically. The book-to-bill in Q1 for solutions and services was 1.13. CP&S continued to deliver very good operating margin at 15.3% in Q1, up 80 basis points year-over-year despite the decline in sales, another good productivity quarter. Page 7 provides a geographic breakdown of our sales and shows the year-over-year organic growth results for the quarter. The overall organic sales decline in Q1 was driven primarily by the U.S. and Asia Pacific. The U.S. was down 6%, which was actually a little better than we expected. We saw declines in most verticals, and oil and gas was worse than expected, as Keith mentioned. Canada was down 8%. We saw reasonable growth in the quarter in the transportation and food and beverage, but not enough to make up for continued declines in heavy industry, led by mining and oil and gas. EMEA saw 6% organic growth in Q1. Results across countries were mixed, but with higher rates of growth in the emerging markets. That said, we did experience low single-digit growth in the mature countries of EMEA and market conditions there seem to be modestly improving. Asia Pacific was down 11% year-over-year with China down about the same. We saw declines in most countries across the region. India was an exception with growth in the low double digits. Latin America grew 8% led by Mexico. The growth in Mexico was pretty broad across verticals. Overall for emerging markets, organic growth was about 3% with Latin America and the EMEA region offsetting declines in Asia Pacific. That takes us to the guidance slide. As Keith mentioned, we\u2019re making some changes to guidance. We\u2019re dropping reported sales across the range by 2%, approximately one point to reflect a more significant headwind from currency and an additional one point reduction to reflect a more cautious outlook for organic growth, particularly in the second half of the fiscal year. The lower organic growth assumption is due to three factors. Since we last provided guidance, macro indicators related to the industrial economy globally have continued to soften. This is especially true of industrial production growth rates and projections. Generally PMI is weaker, and particularly in the U.S. PMI was solidly below 50 for November and December. In addition, oil prices have continued to decline. We now expect our oil and gas business will decline at a higher rate for the full year and likely weighted more toward our U.S. business. In the key emerging markets, particularly China and Brazil, we\u2019re not seeing any evidence of or catalyst for meaningful improvement in the near term. Our previous guidance called for reported sales of approximately $6 billion at the midpoint. Our revised guidance has reported sales a little under $5.9 billion. Prior guidance called for an organic sales decline of 4% at the low end to flat at the high end. The new range is a decline of 5% to a decline of 1%. Our previous margin guidance was about 21%. The new guidance is about 20.5%, that reflects the additional currency impact that\u2019s converting at a higher than normal rate - we talked about that last quarter, and we now see more risk to our product business growth rates and to our business in the U.S. both on average higher margin parts of our business.  We previously expected margin conversion on a year-over-year sales decline of about 30%. Based on the changes I just mentioned, we now expect that to be about 35%. Previously we expected a full-year adjusted tax rate of 27%. We now expect that to be 25%, reflecting the benefit of the R&D tax credit that I mentioned.  We\u2019re revising adjusted EPS guidance from the previous range of $5.90 to $6.40, to a new range of $5.70 to $6.20. You can think of the change in EPS guidance as about a $0.14 improvement due to tax rate, about a $0.16 decline due to the additional currency headwind, and about an $0.18 decline that is a combination of lower organic sales and a lower margin expectation. We continue to expect to convert about 100% of net income to free cash flow. A couple of other items - we now expect general corporate net expense to be approximately $75 million for the full year, and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be closer to 131 million for the full year.  With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Patrick for Q&A. Patrick Goris : Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Operator, let\u2019s take our first question. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Scott Davis from Barclays. Please proceed. Scott Davis : Good morning guys. Keith Nosbusch : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : I\u2019ve probably asked this question on three of the last four calls, but do you have a sense in China of what the overall market growth is and whether you\u2019re outperforming that or not? I mean, down 11 seems like a pretty big number, and I know the industrial economy over there isn\u2019t so great, but that seems like a little outsized versus what some of your peers are putting up. Keith Nosbusch : Well, we do not have great market data for China, but I would say that at this point, we do not believe we\u2019re underperforming the underlying market. We just believe that some of the impacts, particularly in the heavy industries, continue to reduce capital spending in many of those areas - obviously metals, cement, mining. All of those are very challenging at this point in time, and we have seen growth in many of our OEM sectors other than tire. Tire has been a major downturn this last quarter and last--probably almost up to a year now, but the other OEM sectors are able to grow, and we\u2019re seeing growth in mainly the consumer and automotive OEMs. Unfortunately, those are still the smaller pieces of our business, so I think challenging in the broadest sense but we continue to see new opportunities and continue to believe that China will be a very important growth market for us in the future. I was just there a little over a week ago, and I\u2019m very encouraged with the outlook that the country has with what they\u2019re doing to drive towards their strategy of China Manufacturing 2025. That\u2019s their 10-year vision, but behind that is a 30-year vision as to where they\u2019re going to improve the competitiveness of their manufacturing sector now that their costs are increasing. We believe the connected enterprise is absolutely the way that they will be able to start the journey for that 2025 vision that they have for their manufacturing sector. So we\u2019re encouraged in the long term, and I think right now we\u2019re just seeing a period of time where they\u2019re rebalancing some of their spending, some of their investments, and as we know from the previous five-year plan, that they are trying to drive towards a more consumption economy. I think that once again plays very strongly into these sectors that I said were performing better for us this past quarter. Scott Davis : That makes sense, so it\u2019s a mix issue. Keith, I\u2019m just curious on your view on this economy. You\u2019ve seen cycles. You did a--you did an excellent job in 2001, 2002. You were known at the cost-cutting guy back in that time period and did a great job of getting asset base down to a realistic size and such. What do you see--I mean, you could make an argument that this guidance cut is going to be the first of many, or you could make an argument that you\u2019re being realistic to a modest industrial recession. What do you see--I\u2019m just curious in your opinion on what you see on the endgame of if this gets substantially worse, and are you concerned about the weakness in the industrial economy moving into the more consumer-based stuff, which of course is where you guys had a lot of exposure. So it\u2019s a bit of an open-ended question, but--. Keith Nosbusch : Yeah, very open-ended, but let me try to comment a little bit. My first comment would be, I\u2019m not an economist, so I think I can predict the economy about as good as we can forecast our future performance, given our short cycle business, which is really the point I wanted to make. We believe that given everything we\u2019ve seen, that while the industrial economy is struggling, the consumer is still spending. I just saw a report that consumer confidence has gone up again, so we\u2019re not seeing this as a consumer-led recession at this point in time. We do believe that the industrial economy with the latest industrial production measures, particularly in the U.S, is definitely weakened since our last quarter, and that was what was behind our change in our guidance. But right now, the expectation is that we will not see a recession. Obviously you know that our visibility is limited in two-thirds of our business, but when we look at the macroeconomic indicators, it\u2019s not point to that at this point in time, so that\u2019s how we structured our business going forward. Certainly given what happened over the last quarter from the outlook standpoint, we are definitely looking at what do we need to be ready for in case this view changes over the remainder of our fiscal year. Scott Davis : Okay, good answer. Thanks guys and good luck. Keith Nosbusch : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Tusa from JP Morgan. Please proceed. Steve Tusa : Hey guys, good morning. Keith Nosbusch : Morning Steve. Steve Tusa : Keith, a ton of debate right now on auto. I know you guys have tremendous insight and a pipe into what\u2019s going on there, it seems like. You said consumer and auto was stable. Can you maybe disaggregate that and tell us what auto was, and just walk through what you\u2019re seeing by region, and then what your customers are telling you about their future needs on capacity? Keith Nosbusch : Mm-hmm. Well, with auto, if we want to walk through the regions, the U.S. auto continues to be solid. We think the programs that we\u2019ve seen in the pipeline, there has been no change to those programs over the last quarter, and we see that as one of the stronger verticals as we go throughout the remainder of the year. If we go to Asia, in particular China, while the China sales have been slowing and in some cases slightly negative, depending upon the auto company, we\u2019re still seeing investment in China automotive. We see once again the need to continue to automate to take costs out of their operations, and auto is one of the places that we\u2019ll see that. We\u2019re also seeing a lot of interest in what we can do with respect to our operational intelligence software to help them improve the asset utilization and efficiencies and effectiveness of their manufacturing plant floor. So there, we think it\u2019s great. As you know, Mexico has seen a lot of investment in automotive. I would say the difficult areas for automotive, Brazil, is struggling now given the economy, and we\u2019re not seeing significant investments in Western Europe at this point in time either. So that\u2019s how I would characterize the automotive market on a global basis. Canada, a little more investment quite frankly, and I think a lot of that is the change of the dollar and the currency has improved Canada\u2019s competitiveness in automotive. There\u2019s a little more activity there than previously. Steve Tusa : Okay, and then lastly I guess, just on the competitive dynamics out there, anything you\u2019re seeing from your European competitors that\u2019s at all--you know, any pockets of greater competitive behavior and a more aggressive push for installed base, where that type of business comes into play? I know your business is pretty insulated when it comes to the upgrading of installed base and things like that, but anything that you\u2019re seeing out there from European guys that concerns you competitively? Keith Nosbusch : I don\u2019t think that concerns us. I think in certain countries in certain areas, I think a little more competitiveness, given particularly the drop in the heavy industry, we\u2019re seeing a few projects that are now being released or being processed, that there is a little more competitiveness on those projects and on that activity than we\u2019ve seen in particular when oil and gas was booming. It was a very capital expenditure pocket, and now that we\u2019re seeing that reduced, some of the competitiveness has moved into other spaces where historically they probably wouldn\u2019t have participated. Steve Tusa : Great. Thanks a lot. Keith Nosbusch : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from John Inch from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. John Inch : Hey, thanks. Good morning everyone. Keith Nosbusch : Morning John. John Inch : Morning. Hey, I want to also pick up on the auto somatic. It\u2019s obviously--there\u2019s this widespread, fast money view that anything auto is about to fall off a cliff. Could you just remind us, Keith and Ted, how big is auto for you, and what does your penetration opportunity look like over the next couple of years for the power train side, particularly in Asia and then North America? I mean, at the end of the day I realize you can\u2019t forecast this precisely, but it\u2019s obvious there\u2019s going to be a little bit of an auto correct. I think even Parker yesterday talked about in-plant capex slowing a little bit, but do you think based on as you\u2019ve been building this pipeline up with power train, that there\u2019s enough to kind of offset that? Maybe you could just sort of frame what you think a scenario might look like. So just remind us what your exposure is, and then just talk to kind of the scenario if in fact auto softens, which probably is likely to occur. Keith Nosbusch : Well, our exposure currently is around 10%, and that\u2019s been the number that we\u2019ve had for probably the last couple of years now as we\u2019ve grown in some of these other verticals, so 10%. We believe that when you look at the price of gas, you\u2019re seeing continued growth in auto spending, in particular the vehicles that they make a lot of money in. So that bodes well for continued investment and continued modernization of their platforms, so we aren\u2019t anticipating a significant change in the automotive outlook, particularly in the U.S. With respect to penetration, we believe, as we\u2019ve talked a couple of times, our best opportunities for increased penetration is in power train, and we think that\u2019s an area where there will be continued investment because of the need to continue to achieve the fuel guidelines that are being mandated now over the coming five-plus years. So most of the investment and improvements are going to have come in engines and transmissions, so we see a healthy pipeline of power train, and we believe that has the opportunity to add $20 million to $30 million of incremental revenue to our automotive business going forward. John Inch : But in fairness, you are actually a little more profitable than 10%, right Keith? You\u2019re probably not 20, but you\u2019re more profitable. Auto is one of your richer mix businesses, is that not a fair statement? Keith Nosbusch : That is a fair statement, and I would lump all of the consumer in that, consumer in auto simply because they\u2019re more A&S-centric businesses. They have a much higher control concentration and architecture concentration than the heavy industries, because the heavy industries have a lot of solutions built by Rockwell, and they have a lot of intelligent motor control, which is the heavy asset, critical assets are a bigger part of the expenditure in those industries. So it\u2019s a mix more than anything else, and our software and our automation is the predominant purchase of the consumer, including automotive companies. So yes, but it\u2019s because of the way automation and the intensiveness of automation in those industries. John Inch : Okay, so that\u2019s a good segue into my second question or follow-up. The follow-up is basically if you--I think from a high level, if you look at Rockwell, A&S margins which were obviously very high before, right, are coming under some pressure. This is against a backdrop where, Keith, you just mentioned the word mix. We\u2019re obviously against a backdrop with very tough markets globally, where pricing is increasingly becoming a factor. Now, I know that Rockwell in the past, you don\u2019t really compete on price - it\u2019s not the nature of discrete automation, but could you talk to the mix context for A&S, because you may not be seeing price but maybe you\u2019re seeing people swap into lower priced or margin solutions. The question is obviously just from a high level, what are the risks that A&S margins go from where it was to materially lower in the coming quarters, even if your sales are still relatively resilient? Keith Nosbusch : Well, to your point, I think it is all about mix in our A&S segment. Our highest margin business is the controller and software business, and we talked about the controller decline, but we still have very solid margins in our motion business, our safety business, our sensor business, and so I think the overall impact to A&S margins will not be substantial as we go forward. I think that is not a critical issue. I think the bigger issue for A&S is going to be volume and then the exchange rates. Those are the two more compelling concerns that we would have at this time, as opposed to overall mix in the segment. Certainly with the high margins throughout that segment, volume declines are very impactful, and you saw some degree this quarter the impact of FX changes that come about as well, particularly in some of the currencies that are, I\u2019ll say, different than just a traditional euro-U.S. dollar or Canadian-U.S. dollar, which is the ones that we have a greater concentration in. Ted Crandall : Hey John, the one mix impact we may see in A&S this year that\u2019s a little negative is with process now being down more than we expected and oil and gas down more than we expected, and probably consumer and auto a little bit better, particularly consumer, we think we\u2019re going to see a less rich mix of control logics made up for with a little more compact logics and motion control, particularly on the consumer side. That will create a little bit of mix headwind, but compared to the volume issues in A&S and the currency, that\u2019s not a big number. John Inch : Right, there\u2019s no cliff function that you\u2019re anticipating. Ted Crandall : No. John Inch : Got it. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Keith Nosbusch : Thank you, John. Operator : Your next question comes from Shannon O\u2019Callaghan from UBS. Please proceed. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Morning guys. Keith Nosbusch : Good morning Shannon. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: On CP&S, it seems like that should just be under all kinds of pressure, which apparently it is with all the oil and gas that\u2019s in that segment, the solutions book-to-bill was 1.13 and you\u2019ve got up margins, even on the down revenues. Can you just give us a little better sense on the outlook for that piece of the business, because the book-to-bill looks good but I imagine it shouldn\u2019t be too encouraging given what\u2019s really going on in that segment. Can you continue to drive up margins on down revenues? Ted Crandall : Yes, so let me start with book-to-bill. The 1.13 is about what we were expecting. I think you\u2019ve got to recognize it\u2019s 1.13 on a lower sales number, obviously, but we would expect to be above 1 in the first quarter of the year, and we got that, so that\u2019s keeping us reasonably on track now as we enter the next two quarters.  On the margin side, we had great margin performance in CP&S all through last year. We talked a lot about productivity last year, and that was kind of disproportionately on the CP&S side and we\u2019re continuing to see some of that year-over-year benefit in Q1. I think the other thing that influences this is I mentioned that architecture and software is the segment that bears the largest burden of the currency conversion problem that we\u2019ve got, and CP&S doesn\u2019t really face a lot of that because of their more balanced supply chain, particularly because of the solutions and services business where we have the people resources deployed all over the world, so we get a better match across currencies. Keith Nosbusch : I would add in answer to your question of being able to continue to do this, is no. There is only so far we can take this, and our key now is get back to growth in our solutions and services business. Obviously as we have talked before, we had done a lot of work in improving the competitiveness and the cost structure of our engineering resources, and to Ted\u2019s point, we\u2019ve globalized that, we\u2019ve created a much more standard approach to the application and the engineering tools that we\u2019ve used, and we\u2019ve focused very much on the applications that are most important to us and where we\u2019re most competitive and have the ability to serve the market best.  So we\u2019ve tried to be able to take a much better approach to that overall business, and I think you\u2019re seeing the results of that. It started last year and it\u2019s continuing into this year, but at the end of the day we do need to make sure we\u2019re driving growth for the long term success and the long term protection of what we\u2019ve done over the last couple of years. Ted Crandall : Shannon, the other thing I would add is in the quarter, we were up about 80 basis points. You asked about can we continue to deliver improvement. Keith\u2019s answer was no, but I want to make sure I don\u2019t leave the wrong impression - for the full year at the current sales levels, we don\u2019t see margin deterioration in CP&S either. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Then just on this broad-based U.S. weakness, how broad-based is it? We know oil and gas is down, I think you said over 30%. Can you just kind of give a little color on the ranking of the other verticals, and is everything feeling bad? It sounds like auto is still okay in the U.S. Maybe just a little bit of color by vertical specific to the U.S. Keith Nosbusch : Yes, I think while it\u2019s a small vertical, it\u2019s a somewhat meaningful one in the U.S., and that would be pulp and paper is probably the best vertical for us in this quarter. I think we\u2019ve had some success in the chemical arena, but that is still a small percentage for us. At about the average, as we mentioned, was auto and food and beverage, and certainly home and personal care, and then at the negative side would be the metals, wastewater, and a little bit in some of the heavy industry--not heavy industry, but the life sciences sector this quarter. But obviously the biggest negative was oil and gas, and that\u2019s what triggered the vast majority of the decline from a vertical standpoint. The others compared to that were all much better performing across the board, but obviously the reduction in IP has impacted more than just oil and gas. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Okay, great. Thanks guys. Keith Nosbusch : Thank you, Shannon. Operator : Your next question comes from Richard Eastman from Robert Baird. Please proceed. Richard Eastman : Yes. Keith or Ted, given last year\u2019s performance on the oil and gas side, could you just size that business in dollars at this point? Ted Crandall : So roughly $700 million a year, that\u2019s pretty close. Richard Eastman : Yes okay, that\u2019s fine. Then the expectation for this year on the back of this first quarter, but what is the expectation for this year in terms of that base in oil and gas? Is it down 20, or--? Ted Crandall : Yes, so originally in November we were thinking down 10. We\u2019re now thinking it\u2019ll be down closer to 20. Richard Eastman : Okay. In the guide when you dropped the organic growth by essentially a point or two, it looks like about half of that is FX; but the balance of that equates to maybe 70, $75 million. Is that largely the oil and gas outlook that you\u2019re adjusting that? Ted Crandall : Yes, so just to correct a little bit, we dropped top line sales by 2%, one point for currency and one point organic. Most of the organic--I mean, there are some puts and takes across verticals, but I would say you could think of most of that organic decline as related to oil and gas. Richard Eastman : Okay, fair enough. Then just last, Ted, typically in the fiscal second quarter, expenses step up. I think you give your annual comp expense increase there, also some of your investments. Should we expect that same dynamic on the expense line here for this fiscal year? Ted Crandall : Yes. Every year we do across the globe our merit increases in January, so there is a step-up, ballpark think of it as about $0.05. There\u2019s a step-up in cost from Q1 to Q2 sequentially. Richard Eastman : Okay, all right. Very good. Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to dig into the organic cadence to the year. You\u2019re looking for a midpoint base case of down 3, and you did down 3.3 in 1Q. You\u2019ve said--I think Ted, you mentioned, or maybe it was Keith, that second half of the year you\u2019re no longer expecting growth, but if we assume that easy comps get you to maybe a fattish result in the second half of the year, it implies that 2Q might be worse than 1Q. Is that how you\u2019re thinking about it? Ted Crandall : Yes, Nigel, it is, and then you know we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance, but we think Q2 is probably similar or maybe a little worse than Q1, and things get a little bit better in the second half. Nigel Coe : Okay. Siemens called out some channel de-stock in China, which I\u2019m assuming given that down 11 in China, you\u2019re seeing as well. Are you seeing--you mentioned in November you\u2019re not seeing channel de-stock, but are you starting to see that now in the U.S.? Ted Crandall : No, we don\u2019t have the same--I would say two things. In China [audio interference] but on the other hand our Chinese distributors don\u2019t carry all that much inventory, so we don\u2019t think the results we\u2019re seeing in China are about de-stocking. In North America, we have very good visibility of our distributor inventories, and they\u2019ve remained pretty stable. Keith Nosbusch : I would only add, in China we have a different--well, around the world we have a different channel model than our competitor, so there is different dynamics going on there that may be part of the reason for that difference in the way we see our channel performance versus the way some others might. Nigel Coe : Sure, I understand. Then just quickly on the products, it seems that the CPS products business has performed better than the A&S product, and that sort of fits in with my channel de-stock question, so I\u2019m just curious - is that true, and would you expect that to continue? Ted Crandall : I think there\u2019s just some normal variability quarter to quarter around the performance of A&S versus CP&S. I don\u2019t think there will be for the full year a significant difference at this point, and I\u2019m not sure I understand the part of it related to channel de-stock. Nigel Coe : Just that I would expect channel de-stock to impact A&S more than CPS, given CPS is a bit longer cycle in nature, but I can follow up offline. Thanks guys. Ted Crandall : Yeah, just on the product side, if there was channel stocking or de-stocking, it would pretty much affect the A&S and CP&S product businesses about equally. Nigel Coe : I see. Okay, thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rick Kwas, Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Ronnie Upskill : Hi, this is Ronnie Upskill [ph] on for Rich Kwas. Just wanted some clarification. Has there been any change to the $20 million restructuring target for oil and gas? Ted Crandall : I would say there\u2019s no change to having $20 million available for restructuring. We always have about $10 million in what we would think of as pay-as-you-go, and last quarter we talked about having an additional $10 million in case we needed some restructuring. I don\u2019t think we ever talked about that as specific to oil and gas. Ronnie Upskill : Okay, sorry. Then on the MRO front, or mix front related to new projects, are you seeing anything incremental there? Keith Nosbusch : I didn\u2019t catch the first part of the question. Ronnie Upskill : Are you seeing anything mix-related on MRO or anything else that could be keeping margins higher than expected, at least on our end? Ted Crandall : I think on the--generally, but particularly on the additional one point of organic growth that we\u2019re dropping out, that extra $60 million, we think that is weighted toward our U.S. business and weighted more toward our product businesses. So in the U.S. is our largest installed base, that\u2019s where we have the most MRO business, so there is some unfavorable margin impact in a relative sense of having that coming out of the U.S. and coming out of product business. Keith Nosbusch : And that\u2019s correlated with the significant reduction in IP in the U.S. that recently came out, so that slowdown will impact the MRO business, as Ted outlined. Ted Crandall : And that\u2019s reflected in our guidance change. Ronnie Upskill : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for taking my questions. Keith Nosbusch : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeremie Capron, CLSA. Please proceed. Jeremie Capron : Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. Keith Nosbusch : Good morning Jeremie. Jeremie Capron : I want to stay on the discussion around cost. Could you tell us a little bit more about where you\u2019re taking cost actions? I see you\u2019ve lowered the corporate expense guide for the year by about $5 million, but more generally speaking I know you\u2019ve talked about being positioned or being more--having more flexibility on the cost side of the equation this time around relative to the previous cycle. So tell us about where you\u2019re talking cost actions and how you see cost unfold through the year. Ted Crandall : Jeremie, I think you will remember in Q4, we took about, I think it was $12 million of restructuring charges so that we could start to get ahead of getting cost out, recognizing that fiscal \u201916 was likely to be a more difficult year. At the current time, and including the revised guidance, we\u2019re implementing what I would call sensible expense controls that are consistent with the revised guidance and given a slow and uncertain economic environment, but we are not calling this the beginning of a recession. We expect business levels to remain reasonably stable from this point out into the balance of the year, and consequently we\u2019re not planning additional major restructuring actions at this time. If things get worse, we may have to go there, but we think our cost base is reasonably well structured at the current guidance sales levels. Jeremie Capron : Okay, thanks for that. Mexico, I know we\u2019ve talked about it for several quarters now, but you\u2019re talking about broad-based strength, including oil and gas. What sort of visibility do you have in Mexico? Are we talking about strength for the next year or so, or is that much more near term strength that you are expecting there? Keith Nosbusch : Our visibility in Mexico, given that a portion of this is our solutions and services business, we think our outlook at this point is for the remainder of the fiscal year and feel that the economy there at this point continues to grow, and more importantly our ability to support our customers and the demands continue to improve as well, in particular our channel partners are very strong. It\u2019s probably the strongest distributor network that we have in an emerging market, so we feel very good about the capabilities there. Jeremie Capron : Thanks very much. Keith Nosbusch : You\u2019re welcome, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Please proceed. Steven Winoker : Thanks, and good morning guys. Keith Nosbusch : Morning. Steven Winoker : Hey Ted, sorry to push a little bit on this, but you say you\u2019re not calling for a recession right now. I guess with your second quarter of organic decline and forecasting what now is at least the next, maybe one, two or three, so now we\u2019re looking at a good year of declines, what do you need to see inside the business to call it a recession, and does that really matter anyway in terms of what you call it relative to expense declines? Is it more just that you say, look - we have R&D programs where we want to have them, we\u2019re willing to hold out for a year because we\u2019re going to have another share gain opportunity on the back of this, like we did before. How should we think about it from an investor standpoint relative to the negative growth that we\u2019re looking at? Ted Crandall : I think you captured a lot of what I would have said in my answer to where you started. I think basically what I\u2019m trying to say is, look - given an expectation that sales are going to be one point lower now than we previously thought, and given that we had already implemented restructuring actions in Q4, we will take some steps now to sensibly control expense, and I expect our full-year spending now is going to be a little bit lower than we previously talked about. But we don\u2019t see the need, based on that one point reduction in organic growth, to take major restructuring actions. Keith Nosbusch : I think the point you also made in your question is relevant as well, and that is we do see the opportunities to come out of this stronger, and certainly as an intellectual capital business, it is about people and we think we have some great investment opportunities that we discussed during the investor day at Automation Fair. We think those are important to continue to keep that investment level, given that we feel we\u2019re in a stable economic environment, to Ted\u2019s point. So we do want to keep that in place, and our goal is to come out stronger and gain share just like we did in the previous recoveries.  So I would say that\u2019s the other piece of the equation, and that\u2019s the balance that we constantly evaluate and make trade-offs and ultimate decisions on. Ted Crandall : Given the uncertainty right now, it wouldn\u2019t be prudent not to have contingency plans, but we\u2019ll go there if we need to but we don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary at this time. Steven Winoker : Keith, just on this whole question of growth, we often talk about the secular versus cyclical dynamics. It\u2019s really hard sometimes on the outside to figure out whether those secular growth dynamics are buffering what would otherwise be a much worse cycle on the growth. Are you seeing evidence that says, hey, our secular growth dynamics are still in place, we still feel confident about these? Keith Nosbusch : Absolutely. We see that based upon the conversations we have with customers. There is no question, and these are global discussions, customers understand that they need to continue to drive productivity and sustainability and their competitiveness [audio interference] just on my recent trips to Europe and to Asia. So I think the secular story is absolutely in play - if anything, I believe it\u2019s stronger today than a couple of years ago when we started on this journey. So it\u2019s real in this area. It moves a little bit around that trend, based upon the current economic environment, but I think the underlying secular trend here is in play. It will continue to become even more important as time unfolds, so that\u2019s why we have such a positive outlook for the long term, and that\u2019s part of the reason why we need to keep investing during this period, because we do see the demand for what we\u2019re doing as something that is not going to disappear from a cyclical standpoint. Steven Winoker : Okay, and just one clarification quickly on the quarter. Last guidance, I think you guys had talked about kind of down mid-single digit expectations for the quarter. Even though it was down 3, it was better. What again was better than what you had previously thought might happen? Ted Crandall : So I would say one of the places we were better than we thought was the U.S., and in the U.S. it was primarily around our product business. Some of that was about backlog reduction at the end of the quarter. The underlying orders were down about what we expected in the U.S. but shipments were a bit better. Steven Winoker : Okay, thanks. Patrick Goris : Operator, we\u2019ll take one more question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Please proceed. Andrew Obin : Hey guys, good morning. Keith Nosbusch : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just a follow-up question on the FX impact, and you were sort of talking about CP&S having a global supply chain. As I look at my notes, Monterey is the biggest manufacturing facility you have in the world, I think by far. My notes say something like 20% of your manufacturing capacity globally is there. The Mexican peso is down 20%, I think, in the past year. How does it impact your profitability? How do you book the transaction effect in your P&L from that facility? Ted Crandall : Andrew, I may have to defer this one to some time you can spend on the phone with Patrick, but basically I would say we hedge our peso exposure, so that helps offset some of the decline in the Mexican peso. Also, part of our manufacturing activity in Mexico is U.S. dollar-based, so we don\u2019t really have an exposure on it. Andrew Obin : Got you, okay. We can take it offline. In Europe, can you just provide more color, what you\u2019re seeing in Europe, northern Europe versus southern Europe? Any particular trends that you\u2019re seeing, because you highlighted it\u2019s a better market for you. Keith Nosbusch : Yes, the biggest increase last quarter was in emerging Europe, and that would be the Middle East and Eastern Europe. But within Western Europe, the strength came more from Italy and the southern Europe - Italy and France, as opposed to the northern. Northern had been where the strength was previously. We\u2019re now seeing it move a little bit to some of the other countries in the south that were not as fortunate earlier in the period. So that\u2019s how Europe played out. Andrew Obin : Terrific, thank you very much. Keith Nosbusch : Thank you. Patrick Goris : Okay, that concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you all for joining us. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference call. At this time, you may disconnect. Thank you.",

Baird Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - UBS Steve Winoker - Sanford Bernstein Operator : Thank you for holding and welcome to Rockwell Automation\u2019s quarterly conference call. I need to remind everyone that today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. Later in the call, we will open the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Patrick Goris, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Goris, please go ahead. Patrick Goris : Good morning. And thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2016 earnings release conference call. With me today are Keith Nosbusch, our Chairman and CEO, and Ted Crandall, our CFO. Our results were released this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our Web site. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that Web site for replay for the next 30 days. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. So with that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Keith. Keith Nosbusch : Thanks, Patrick. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I suspect by now that you have read the press release that was issued last week Tuesday. I will be stepping down from the role of President and CEO of Rockwell Automation on June 30. And effective July 1, Blake Moret will succeed me and become President and CEO of the company. I will remain Chairman of the Board. Blake has been with the company for over 30 years and has gathered a wealth of experience across the organization, including sales management, business management positions in both segments, and international assignments. He brings a strong customer focus as well as a deep understanding of our values, people, and technology. He has proven himself to be an exceptional leader with demonstrated readiness to lead the company. Blake is the ideal executive to move our company forward. I know many of you have had the opportunity to meet Blake over the last few years. In the coming months, we will find opportunities for Blake to meet with investors in his new role. With that, I\u2019ll start with some key points for the quarter. So please turn to page three in the slide deck. The quarter generally played out as we expected, with organic sales down about 3.5%, heavy industry end markets remained very weak globally, lead by oil and gas and mining. Oil and gas was down a little over 20% in the quarter, in line with our expectations. Consumer and auto verticals saw low to mid-single-digit growth. In the US, oil and gas, again, was the weakest vertical. The US is a region where we have seen the largest decline in oil and gas. Food and beverage was one of the stronger verticals and automotive was flat. In China, strong growth in automotive was more than offset by continued weakness in heavy industries and tire. Sales in China were down a little over 10% year-over-year. Clearly, the US and China remain our most challenging geographies. However, sales in both the US and China increased modestly compared to last quarter. EMEA was about flat in the quarter, but built backlog. We expect to return to low-single-digit growth for the balance of the year. Home and personal care and life sciences remain the strongest verticals in this region. I\u2019m pleased with continued strength in Latin America, led by Mexico. Let me add another couple of points on the quarter. Weak heavy industries continued to affect our process business, which was down high teens in the quarter. Logix sales declined over 5% in the quarter, reflecting the weakness in process industries. And segment margin was 19.3% in the quarter. This is a bit lower than we expected. However, I was pleased that the Control Products & Solutions segment maintained its margin despite lower sales. Ted will elaborate more on Q2 financial performance, including our segment margins in his results \u2013 in his remarks, excuse me. Let me add a couple of brief comments about our first half before moving on to our outlook for the fiscal year. Organic sales declined 3.5%. Heavy industry verticals were down globally. And growth in Latin America and EMEA was offset by declines in the US and China. I\u2019m pleased that we have been able to keep segment margins at 20%, despite 8% lower sales. And we are very proud to have received the Ethisphere award for the eighth time, naming us as one of the world\u2019s most ethical companies. This recognition is a testament to our strong culture of integrity. Let\u2019s move on to what I expect for the balance of fiscal 2016. With respect to macroeconomic indicators, the most recent industrial production forecast has called for lower economic growth in 2016 than previously estimated, but continue to indicate some modest improvement in the second half of our fiscal year. Also, since we provided guidance in January, oil and commodity prices seem to have stabilized. Another welcome change is the stability and modest weakening of the US dollar since January. As we mentioned last quarter, the strong US dollar has adversely impacted US-based producers and equipment builders. So given that the macro environment has remained relatively stable, we believe that our performance in the balance of the year will be in line with what we projected in January, modest sequential improvement, but no year-over-year growth. Globally, we expect heavy industries to remain weak with some continued growth in the consumer and automotive verticals. The US and China will remain our weakest geographies. We expect continued growth in EMEA and believe Latin America will remain our fastest growth region for the year. Taking all these factors into consideration and with two quarters to go, we are narrowing our fiscal 2016 organic sales guidance range to down 1.5% to 4.5%. No change to the midpoint. We continue to expect fiscal 2016 sales of about 5.9 billion and are narrowing the EPS guidance range to $5.75 to $6.15. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks. Before I turn it over to Ted, let me add a few closing comments. As I travel and meet with customers and partners around the world, I\u2019m confident that our vision of The Connected Enterprise is coming alive. Early adoption of our new technology is promising and customers realize that our new high-performance architecture optimizes their business performance and makes them more globally competitive. Whether our customer is focused on expansion or productivity, CapEx or OpEx, our technology is equally relevant. Innovation, new product development, and domain expertise are the lifeblood of our company and we continue to invest to enhance our differentiation. I\u2019m very excited about The Connected Enterprise and could not be more confident about the future success of Rockwell Automation. With that, let me turn it over to Ted. Ted Crandall : Thank you, Keith. And good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll begin my comments on page four, second quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were 1.440 billion, down 7.1% compared to Q2 last year. On an organic basis, sales declined 3.6%. That\u2019s similar to the organic decline that we saw in Q1. Currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 3.5%. This quarter, we lapped some of the larger currency rate differences. Segment operating margin was 19.3%, down 2.3 points from Q2 last year, primarily due to lower sales, some unfavorable mix, primarily in the Architecture & Software segment and a negative impact from currency. General corporate net expense was $20 million in Q2 compared to $21 million a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.37, down $0.22, or about 14% compared to the second quarter of last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.7% compared to 26% in Q2 last year. The lower effective rate this year is primarily due to the recognition of a discrete tax item.  Free cash flow for Q2 was $203 million. Free cash flow conversion on adjusted income was 113%. Through six months, free cash flow was $348 million with related conversion on adjusted income of 92%. Our trailing four-quarter return on invested capital was 32%. A couple of items not shown on the slide, average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 101.3 million, down over 3% compared to last year. During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares at a cost of approximately $127 million. Through the first six months, we\u2019ve repurchased 2.5 million shares at a cost of approximately $248 million. In November, we projected repurchases for the full year, totaling $500 million. We are on that pace. At the end of March, we had $197 million remaining on our then-existing share repurchase authorization. And on April 4, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1 billion share repurchase authorization. The next two slides present the sales and operating margin performance of each segment for the second quarter and year-to-date. Page five is the Architecture & Software segment and I\u2019ll focus my comments on the quarter. Beginning on the left side of the chart, Architecture & Software segment sales were $630 million in Q2, down 6.6% compared to Q2 last year. The organic sales decline was 3.3% and currency translation also reduced sales by 3.3%. Moving to the right side of the chart, on the lower sales volume, A&S margins were 24.6%, down 5.2 points from Q2 last year. The year-over-year decline is primarily due to lower sales volume, negative currency effects, some mix headwinds within the segment, and increased spending. The margin result was about a point worse than we expected in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, the largest unfavorable mix factor is related to a larger decline in controller and software businesses compared to the balance of the segment. The controller and software businesses are the highest margin business within this high margin segment. As expected, spending is also up modestly year-over-year in Architecture & Software, despite sales being down. The spending increase is primarily related to new product development and we remain committed to investment in key technologies even in these more difficult market conditions. We expect to see continued mix headwind in the Architecture & Software segment over the balance of the year. However, we expect some sequential sales growth into the second half and consequently expect Q2 to be our lowest margin quarter this year in this segment.  Moving to page six, the Control Products & Solutions segment, in the second quarter, Control Products & Solutions sales were $811 million, down 7.5% year-over-year and down 3.9% on an organic basis. Currency translation reduced sales by 3.6%. Sales in the product businesses and the solutions and service businesses within the segment were each down about 4% organically. The book-to-bill in Q2 for solutions and services was 0.98. That\u2019s weaker than we expected and reflects continued weakness in heavy industries. The Control Products & Solutions segment continued to deliver very good operating margin at 15.2% in Q2, flat to Q2 last year, despite the lower sales. Turning to page seven, this provides a geographic breakdown of our sales and shows the year-over-year organic growth results for the quarter and year-to-date. Keith covered the quarter in his comments and the year-to-date performance pretty much mirrors the second quarter, so I\u2019ll move to the next slide. And that takes us to guidance. As Keith mentioned, there are a couple of adjustments to the guidance. We\u2019ve narrowed the range for both organic sales and adjusted EPS. That\u2019s pretty typical for us to do at this point in the year. For organic growth, the midpoint remains at minus 3%, but the new range is minus 1.5% to minus 4.5%.  For currency translation, due to a recent weakening of the US dollar compared to several currencies, we now expect currency translation to reduce sales by about 3% rather than about 4% in the previous guidance. That takes us back to the level of the original November guidance. We still expect reported sales to be about $5.9 billion. With the improvement in currency translation, we went from a little below that number to a little above that number.  Regarding segment operating margin, we now expect that to be a little lower than 20.5%. We continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of about 25%. We\u2019re narrowing adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.75 to $6.15, with the same $5.95 midpoint. We continue to expect to convert about 100% of adjusted income to free cash flow. And there are a couple of items not shown here. We continue to expect general corporate net expense to be approximately $75 million for the full year and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 131 million for the full year. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Patrick to begin the Q&A session. Patrick Goris : Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we\u2019d like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Operator, let\u2019s take our first question. Operator : Our first question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank. John Inch : Good morning, everyone. Keith Nosbusch : Good morning, John. John Inch : Keith, congratulations on an incredible career. And, Blake, congratulations. Keith Nosbusch : Thank you. John Inch : You\u2019re welcome. So let me start with Apple missing Consumer Electronics this week. 3M called this out yesterday. Can you just remind us what kind of exposures you have to these verticals and do they present some sort of an incremental headwind over the course of the coming quarters? Keith Nosbusch : No. We don\u2019t have much exposure to the consumer electronics space. That is not one of the key areas. We do a little bit in the semiconductor industry that feeds the market, but those markets are much larger than just one dimension. So we don\u2019t see that as any change or any impact to our current business or our outlook for the rest of the year. John Inch : Keith, 3M called out improvement in Europe yesterday. I realize you don\u2019t have a large presence there, but you guys have been gaining ground in recent years. Are you seeing similar sort of trend as the quarter progressed and based on what you\u2019re seeing in April. Keith Nosbusch : Yes. I think that\u2019s why we said we had \u2013 we built backlog last quarter and we expect growth for the full year, the remainder of the year. And we had a very good first quarter in Europe. So would say that we are seeing improvement there and it\u2019s been driven from both emerging Europe and then specific countries in mature Western Europe, particularly now that the south has come back a little better, strengthen in Italy, particularly in some of the home and personal care OEM segment. France has turned positive as well as Spain. So we do see that improvement, but it is also modest growth at this point. John Inch : Okay. And then maybe just one for Ted. If I remember how you kind of laid out \u2013 how Rockwell has laid out its framework of expectation for 2016. Ted, you have the option of doing $10 million of extra restructuring. I think you said $10 million was a placeholder; you\u2019re doing $20 million. You have this option of doing $10 million depending on the cadence of economy. Could you just remind us about those numbers, right, and what\u2019s now baked into your thinking and the numbers going forward? Ted Crandall : Yeah. You do have the numbers right. What we said, and I think this was back in November, is in a typical year we generally spend about $10 million on restructuring and we believe we will spend that this year. And I would say, through the first half, we\u2019re on pace to do that. And we said we had an additional provision for an extra $10 million if we saw conditions deteriorating to an extent that we believe required some further restructuring actions. So that remains the case. John Inch : In other words \u2013 you\u2019re right. But we\u2019re already in the third quarter. It sounds like you\u2019re not really planning to spend it. Ted Crandall : Well, we\u2019ll see. If you remember correctly, looking back, oftentimes, we\u2019ve taken some larger charges at the end of the year if we thought that was necessary to set us up for the expectations for the coming year. There\u2019s no way to predict at this point whether that would be the case. But if it is, we\u2019ve got the provision. John Inch : Okay, I got it. Thanks very much. Keith Nosbusch : You\u2019re welcome, John. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Steve, your line is open. You can ask your question. Steve Tusa : Hey, great. Hey, everyone. Sorry for the delay there. Good morning. Keith Nosbusch : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : Keith, congratulations on the announcement. It\u2019s been a heck of a run and one of the best we\u2019ve seen in our group over the last 15 years. Through all the downturns and everything, you did a fantastic job and deserve all the kudos, so congratulations. Keith Nosbusch : Well, we have a great team, but I appreciate the kind words. Steve Tusa : Could you just talk about what you are seeing out there in auto? Broadly, what your expectations are for the rest of the year there? And just remind us, I think you said it was kind of low-single-digit in the quarter? Keith Nosbusch : I don\u2019t think we said that in the quarter, but we do expect auto to grow in the second half of the year. Consumer and auto would be the two areas that we anticipate the above-the-company average and positive growth. And the specific question on auto for the quarter was that it was up 3% and I don\u2019t think I said that. But that was the number. So it was one of the offsets to some of our heavy industry declines, if you will. What we\u2019re seeing in auto is continued high levels of investment. There is a lot of platform investment that is going on. We also see continued investment in Mexico by many of the US and European and Asian auto producers. We are seeing continued strength in China in the core automotive companies that we deal with. There\u2019s still many fringe companies that are struggling. Western Europe still is very slow, not a lot of growth there. And Brazil, given the recession, it has been a difficult market and we\u2019re seeing declines and projects being put on hold in Brazil. I think the other piece to the question is probably \u2013 you were thinking is \u2013 powertrain. We continue to see improvements in powertrain. We are winning more projects. We have increased commitments in powertrain over the last 12 to 18 months and we still see that as a good opportunity for us going forward. And that\u2019s an area that we believe there will be ongoing investments and a place where we\u2019ll be able to grow share. So that\u2019s pretty much the color around auto. Steve Tusa : And then just to follow-up, anything you\u2019re seeing competitively out there from a pricing perspective? And then one just quick follow-up on that, Pentair talked about some of the beverage companies merging and they\u2019re kind of delaying projects. Are you seeing anything like that? Your food and bev business has been pretty good. So those will be the other two. Thanks a lot. Keith Nosbusch : Okay. Well, let me answer the last one first. We\u2019re not seeing any impact in the beverage industry with the consolidations that are going on. We continue to have projects, particularly with some of the key brewing companies and have had some recent wins there. So we\u2019re, obviously, watching that. But many times we\u2019re a supplier to both sides of that activity. So we tend to be able to work that in the interim as opposed to when we\u2019re not on one side or the other and they\u2019re going to make some other decision. So that\u2019s the characterization there. With respect to China\u2026 Steve Tusa : Not price. Price and kind of competitive behavior out there. Keith Nosbusch : China is what I was going to say about price. Steve Tusa : Well, got it. Keith Nosbusch : But thank you for throwing that in. Price, I would say, it continues to be a topic in our conversations with customers. We haven\u2019t seen a significant impact, other than China has become even more aggressive in pricing than we had seen previously. We are seeing that in some of the infrastructure projects and some of the SOEs that operate in some of the major industries. And we still expect pricing to be less than a point globally for us this year, probably a little lower than last year. Ted Crandall : But, Steve, I would say, our price realization in Q2 was very similar to price realization in Q1. Steve Tusa : Okay. And still flat for the year-ish? Ted Crandall : I think, suspect for the full year, we\u2019re going to be less than a point. Steve Tusa : Okay, great. Thanks a lot, guys. Congrats again, Keith. Keith Nosbusch : Thanks, Steve. Operator : The next question comes from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning and I want to echo the congratulations to Blake. And, Keith, quite a career. Congratulations. Keith Nosbusch : Thank you. Nigel Coe : Okay. So just on the mix in A&S, and you called out controller and software. And I\u2019m a little bit surprised because I think my understanding is that food and beverage and auto are very rich for controllers and software. I understand that process might be the reason for the software mix. Maybe just add some color there and why expect that to remain weak going through the back half of the year. Ted Crandall : So I think, in the past, generally, when we talked about mix, it\u2019s been about product businesses versus solutions and services. But within the Architecture & Software segment, our controller and software businesses have a pretty balanced exposure across heavy industry, auto and consumer that is pretty similar to the overall company average in terms of exposure. The balance of the Architecture & Software segment, and particularly our motion control, sensing and safety businesses, are much more auto and consumer-centric. So with the significant decline we\u2019re seeing in heavy industry and with our process business down 18% year-over-year in Q2 and with auto and consumer showing modest growth, the bigger declines in the segment are coming in the controller and software businesses. So that is principally what\u2019s causing that mix issue. And I would say, in that regard, look, there\u2019s always going to be some normal variability in mix on a quarterly basis. Nigel Coe : Of course. [indiscernible]. And then, maybe Ted as well, the way the quarter panned out, we\u2019ve seen a lot of commentary in past quarters, not necessarily from Rockwell, but from other companies, about stable trends, but then a weakening in the last month, did you see any variability through the quarter? So maybe just add some color in terms of what you\u2019re seeing as we go into April. Ted Crandall : Yeah, I would say, it\u2019s pretty typical for us for sales to build as we move through the quarter and that\u2019s what we saw in Q2. So we didn\u2019t see any weakening in March. Nigel Coe : Okay, so normal seasonality basically. Ted Crandall : Yeah. Keith Nosbusch : Yes. Nigel Coe : Yep. Okay, great. Thanks, Ted. Keith Nosbusch : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning. Sorry if you covered this, just jumped on late. But how do you see people behaving on price, particularly kind of in the oil patch? Is there any discernible negative trend that\u2019s developed there? Ted Crandall : So, Jeff, we had a previous question on this that Keith answered. Our price realization through the first half has been pretty much as we expected. We haven\u2019t seen any significant change in pricing dynamics as a consequence of currency. And I would say up to this point, we haven\u2019t seen any significant change in pricing levels in oil and gas compared to where we were last year. Jeff Sprague : Right, thank you. Keith Nosbusch : You\u2019re welcome, Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Deepa Raghavan : Good morning. This is Deepa Raghavan for Rich Kwas. Congratulations, Keith. Question for me is, you mentioned in the release, you see growth opportunities for the balance of the year. Could you please give us your thoughts on where you see those pockets of strength, whether in terms of verticals and geographies, and if any of your geographical revenue expectations have changed since the last call? Ted Crandall : I think the easiest way to think about this might be, we expect some sequential growth in the second half of the year that\u2019s reasonably in line with normal seasonal patterns for us. Deepa Raghavan : Okay. Keith Nosbusch : Basically, that means we end up having a stronger Q4 as a normal seasonal pattern. With respect to where we\u2019re expecting this, we expect that the consumer and auto industries will be the best growth areas for us and that heavy industries, in particular oil and gas and mining, will be the weakest areas and that\u2019s the way we would characterize it. And I would say not a meaningful difference from what we have been seeing up to this point in time for the year. So that part has stayed pretty consistent, but, yes, we are expecting some sequential growth, modest sequential growth in the second half. Deepa Raghavan : As a follow-up, process around the world, is that getting incrementally worse, better or the same as you would have expected? And just curious, what should happen for us to start to see growth in Logix especially? Is that \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 what drivers are material for it? Is it profitable at \u2013 oil prices seems to have stabilized. So is there a particular oil price level that you should be looking for or any other drivers that would help see an inflection in Logix? Keith Nosbusch : First off, from the process standpoint, process was a little worse than we expected in the quarter. Oil and gas was what we expected, but the other heavy industries, particularly mining and metals, was a little worse and that\u2019s what triggered the decline. We also believe that \u2013 your comment about Logix, two points to make. We do expect Logix to be a little bit below the A&S average, as Ted outlined earlier. Why that shift is occurring, it\u2019s really because of the end markets performance, with the other areas within the A&S segment. I would say the opportunities to continue to see growth will be the expansion of our footprint in the OEM sector, mainly because of some of the new introductions of CompactLogix and the capabilities of integrated motion and safety in that platform. We believe that will allow us to create more opportunities in that space. And the other would be heavy industry. As the process starts coming back, we expect to see a better impact in the performance of our ControlLogix business in that sector. And then, as we continue to build out the high-performance architecture and The Connected Enterprise, we see that as great growth opportunities for our hardware platforms, of which Logix would be front and center there. Deepa Raghavan : Okay, thanks. So are you expecting process to improve in 2017? Is that \u2013 obviously, you have easy comps going into 2017, but is there any other expectation behind that? Keith Nosbusch : For 2017, that\u2019s a little early for us to be going there with all of you knowing the visibility we have. So we\u2019ll give our 2017 guidance in the November call, but we do expect that process in fiscal year 2016 will be down in the mid-teens. So certainly not a recovery expected in this fiscal year. Deepa Raghavan : Thank you very much. Keith Nosbusch : Welcome. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays. Scott Davis : Hi. Good morning, guys. Keith Nosbusch : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : Congrats, Keith. I remember, you took over, I think the stock was about $20. And I wasn\u2019t smart enough to recommend it at the time, but, boy, it was a heck of a run that you had, I think. Blake, the stock would have to get to about $700 by the time you retire to equal your predecessor\u2019s impact on the market. Good luck with that. Blake Moret : [indiscernible]. Scott Davis : No pressure at all. Good luck. Anyways, it\u2019s been a great run, so congrats and good luck in your retirement. Guys, I want to talk a little bit about long order books. I know it\u2019s hard and some of the other questions have touched on this bit. But if you think about your front log or your inquiries out, call it, 12-plus months on bigger projects where guys bring you in early, have you been \u2013 have you seen any inflection there at all, any encouragement at all, any folks that are now taking a look at the little pickup in commodity prices we\u2019ve had and start to have a little bit more confidence to do stuff. Keith Nosbusch : No, I would say, at this point, our front log has remained relatively flat. What we are seeing is a few more quotation activity in some of those industries. And generally, at this point, we would attribute that to, \u2018they have a little more time now,\u2019 and so they\u2019re starting to look at future potential projects and we\u2019re involved in that either directly with the end user or sometimes with a system integrator or EPC. So we are seeing more of that activity, but we aren\u2019t seeing the opportunities to convert into our front log at this point in time as of yet. Scott Davis : Okay. And just as a follow-on, I don\u2019t hear you guys talk much about distributor inventories. Certainly, I would imagine, just given the size of some of your distributors, do you see some trends of stock restock that may mirror customer confidence and such? But have you seen anything \u2013 and I don\u2019t know what your channel view is with all your distros, but have you seen any patterns of inventory changes even in the last four or five months? Ted Crandall : So, Scott, we get point-of-sale data from most of our distributors. And for a very large portion of our distributors, we manage their inventory of our products electronically and do electronic replenishment. So we have pretty good visibility, maybe very good visibility of what\u2019s in the channel, particularly in a market like North America. I would say, distributor inventories have been relatively stable. They have come down over the last 18 months, consistent with the drop in the volumes, but not in excess of that, and we haven\u2019t seen any evidence of kind of overstocking. Scott Davis : Okay. Keith, I was just \u2013 before I pass it on, I wanted to share a story. I remember your first presentation to the Street back many years ago. You hadn\u2019t traded in your engineering outfit for your CEO outfit yet and you showed up with pants that were about 3 inches too short. And I remember the guys looking at each other and saying, \u2018God, we have to take up a collection and buy this guy some new suits.\u2019 Looks can be deceiving. At first, we all thought you might have been a little bit of a nerd, but it was a great run. So congrats and I\u2019ll pass it on. Keith Nosbusch : Thank you, Scott. And I\u2019ll take that suit anytime you\u2019ve got it. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Richard Eastman : Yes, good morning. And Keith and Blake, congrats. Keith Nosbusch : Thank you, Rich. Good morning. Richard Eastman : Just a question, Keith, Latin America had another kind of standout quarter, up almost 13% in local currency. And I think you explained a lot of that by the transition by the major global auto putting production in Mexico and that benefit. But one of the things that did come up during the quarter in February, I believe, Pemex basically was the last to blink on their capital spend plan, but kind of quite dramatically. So when you look to the balance of your fiscal year, is that in your plan and does that function as an offset to your growth in Latin America in the second half and into next year? Keith Nosbusch : , : We are very hopeful that with Argentina and the change that is going on there that we\u2019ll see more positive \u2013 matter of fact, that is one of the areas where we\u2019re seeing more interest in companies thinking about making investments than 6 to 12 months ago. We\u2019re also seeing in the Andean region the need to continue to spend some money on OpEx and small productivity projects in the mining industries, obviously, because of the share prices. Because of the commodity prices there, it\u2019s important that they continue to drive costs out. So I would say the greatest challenge remains Venezuela and Brazil and those will be the greatest challenges in Latin America. Richard Eastman : Okay. And then just one last follow-up question. When I look at maybe the incremental weakness in the metals and mining piece of process and then also the book-to-bill at less than 1 in the solutions business, usually, you build backlog in Q2 for the second half, but is that \u2013 when you take those two things into consideration, the incremental weakness in those two areas, are we best of shading the minus 4.5% core growth because there was no change here to your guidance essentially on core growth? Ted Crandall : So our outlook by vertical is at best a little bit fuzzy when we\u2019re going out nine or even six months. I think now is \u2013 updating our guidance from January, we think mining and metals are going to be a little bit weaker than we expected back in January. As it relates to oil and gas, we were thinking down 20 in January. We still think that\u2019s down 20 for the full year. But we now expect consumer-related industries to be a little bit better. So that\u2019s why we\u2019ve maintained the overall organic growth rate for the year. Richard Eastman : Okay, that\u2019s fine. Ted Crandall : And, Rick, as it relates to the 0.98, that\u2019s below what we thought it would be in the quarter, but we were thinking of a number more like 1.03, 1.04, so it wasn\u2019t too dramatically lower. Richard Eastman : Yes, okay. And then, obviously, we\u2019d pick up $60 million from currency translation [indiscernible], okay. Okay, very good. Thank you. Keith Nosbusch : Thanks, Rick. Operator : Our next question comes from Shannon O\u2019Callaghan with UBS. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Good morning, guys. Keith Nosbusch : Good morning, Shannon. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Congrats, Keith and Blake. I echo everything else that was said. I\u2019ll spare you the gushing, but congratulations. Hey, in terms of the adoption of Connected Enterprise you were talking about, what are customers willing to spend on in this kind of a macro environment right now? Are you seeing them do sort of broad-based adoption or very sort of small kind of \u2013 putting their toes in the water on this stuff? Give a little sense of what people are willing to do and is that willingness improving at all? Keith Nosbusch : It kind of has a broad spectrum. It\u2019s not one approach that every customer is taking. But we now have more than ten pilots and rollouts that are going on at key customers in multiple industries. We are doing it in mining and metals and automotive and tire, in food, home and personal care, diversified industrials, consumer, multi-industry companies, and quite candidly, in our own Rockwell Automation journey on The Connected Enterprise. So I would say, what we\u2019re seeing customers doing, are starting to implement their journey of digitizing their enterprise. And they are willing to spend at this point on learning and creating value and demonstrating that value in a portion of their business. We have only one or two major, I\u2019ll say, companies or multi-plant, multi-geography rollouts that are going on. But the majority of it is testing of the concepts, of the integration of IT and OT, that convergence, and how they can also be thinking about this from reducing \u2013 improving their asset utilization on the plant floor and they\u2019re willing to spend money in that. And they\u2019re also trying to think about how does this extend more broadly into their entire supply chain. And so, that is what we\u2019re seeing at this point in time. And with the introduction of the high-performance architecture and the ability to do real-time integrated control and information, that is the foundation of where they are starting to do this. And it\u2019s about conversations and dialogues across multi disciplines in their organization. So our meetings now are with the IT organizations, the senior leadership of companies as they\u2019re trying to understand what their broader strategy should be and, of course, the automation teams where we\u2019re traditionally focused. So it\u2019s working with different parts of the organization, it\u2019s delivering on business outcomes as opposed to simply the productivity from automation and that\u2019s a characterization of where we\u2019re at at this point in time. And it\u2019s an area that we think will continue to develop over the next couple of years and we\u2019ll see the pace of it increase down the road. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: And are any of these big enough or far enough along to sort of qualify as sort of signature adoptions that you can use, kind of customer testimonials as ways to drive adoption in other customers or are these all like \u2013 some of them smaller projects. Is there enough where you\u2019re going to be able to say, \u2018hey, look at what customer X did and look at what we\u2019re able to do for their enterprise,\u2019 and use this kind of a marketing of Connected Enterprise. Keith Nosbusch : Well, that\u2019s, obviously, the goal, but we don\u2019t have that opportunity now. If you remember, at the investor meeting, our annual meeting, at Automation Fair, the best example of that is the Rockwell Automation journey story where we are able to quantify the benefits and we get a customer testimonial called us. But the reality is, this is still early. And in many cases, the customers are not anxious to demonstrate publicly the value that it has driven for them. But that is certainly our goal as we go forward and we think we\u2019ll have some very significant examples and demonstrated outcomes that will be able to validate for other industries and other customers the benefits. And, obviously, that\u2019s the goal. You hit it on the head. It\u2019s about how can you take what we\u2019re doing and translate it to the marketing front-end. And that\u2019s why I mentioned the broad list of customers that we\u2019re currently working with by industry because many of these are lighthouse accounts, lighthouse customers that are viewed as market leaders. And, therefore, when we can become more public with this, it will help us demonstrate to the rest of the industry and the rest of the customer base that there is value here. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot, guys. Keith Nosbusch : Thank you. Patrick Goris : Operator, we will take one more question. After that, Keith will have some closing comments before we will end the call. Thank you. Operator : Our last question comes from Steve Winoker with Bernstein. Steve Winoker : Thanks. And good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Keith, obviously, congratulations. Hard to top Scott\u2019s stories back to 1974 to Alan Bradley. So, anyway, that\u2019s awesome for you. One question on that, though, the split of the Chairman versus CEO role, to what extent is this just a sort of convenient timing transition versus a philosophical change in governance? Keith Nosbusch : This is timing for this time. I think our governance process is very clearly articulated here, in that the Board from time to time evaluates the combination or separate roles and they make that decision based upon the circumstances at the time. So this is consistent with our governance processes and generally consistent with how Rockwell Automation and Rockwell have done this in previous transitions. So nothing more to read into it. Steve Winoker : Okay, great. And then, Ted, on A&S, you talked about it a little bit in terms of the mix impact and I assume CompactLogix, motion control, etc., but can you maybe quantify or give us a little sense for that increased spending relative to mix and currency and volume impact and where the spending was directed and continuation of it, etc.? Ted Crandall : Yeah. So all four of the major items I mentioned \u2013 the volume, the mix, the currency impact, the spend \u2013 all of those on a year-over-year basis were a little over a point. On the spend, our spending in Architecture & Software is up about 4% year-over-year in the quarter. Our comparisons will get easier in the second half on spend, so spending will not be up by that same percentage in the second half, but it\u2019s up about 4% in the quarter. And again, that reflects kind of primarily continued investment in product development. Steve Winoker : Okay. And I assume Connected Enterprise type items or is it other? Ted Crandall : That\u2019s definitely part of it. Steve Winoker : Yeah. Okay, thanks very much. That\u2019s all. See you soon. Keith Nosbusch : Thank you. Ted Crandall : Before Keith starts his closing comments, I just had two quick items for you. One, something that did not come up in the Q&A was our full-year outlook for China, and that often comes up on the later calls, so I wanted to let you know that we still expect China for the full year to be down high-single-digits to maybe 10%. The other is, I got a note from a Rockwell colleague that suggested in my comments that I misstated the full year \u2013 the expected full-year outstanding share count. So if that is the case, I apologize. And we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 131 million for the full year. Thank you. And Keith? Keith Nosbusch : Okay. So with that last comment, let me end the call on a personal note. As you know, we have great employees, great customers and great partners. That is what makes Rockwell Automation a special company. It has been an honor and a privilege to have been CEO for the past 12-plus years. I have met and interacted with many of you over that time and I\u2019ve always appreciated your keen interest in our company. Your coverage, questions and comments have been insightful and have helped us better understand our investors\u2019 perspectives.  I\u2019d also like to think that we did our part to earn your confidence and trust and your investments. We have great shareowners who understand our business model and our focus on innovation, sustainable competitive differentiation, and long-term value creation. And for that, I have all of you to thank. Over the next two months, I look forward to meeting with you at the remaining investor events. It\u2019s been a great run and we will have an even better future and Blake is the right person to lead that future. Thank you. Patrick Goris : That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect at this time and have a wonderful day.",

Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for holding, and welcome to Rockwell Automation's Quarterly Conference Call. I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Patrick Goris, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Goris, please go ahead. Patrick Goris - Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations : Good morning and thank you for joining us for our Third Quarter Fiscal 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today are Blake Moret, our President and CEO; and Ted Crandall, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that website for replay for the next 60 days. Before we get started I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. So, with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake. Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Patrick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. As you probably all know by now, I succeeded Keith Nosbusch as President and CEO earlier this month while Keith remains Chairman of our Board. I am honored beyond words and humbled to lead this great company. I thank the board for the opportunity. As several of you mentioned on the call last quarter, Keith had a tremendous run as CEO. He transformed Rockwell Automation into a technology company based on intellectual capital, expanded our served markets and increased market share by enhancing the value we provide to our customers. As a result, Keith has generated exceptional financial returns for shareowners during his tenure. On a personal note, I'd like to thank Keith for demonstrating how to win the right way, by focusing on long-term customer value and rock-solid integrity. So, certainly big shoes to fill, but I'm very confident that with our dedicated employees, experienced management team and best-in-class partners we can continue to build on our track record of differentiation, above-market revenue growth and superior financial returns. With that, I'll start with some key points for the quarter. so, please turn to page three in the slide deck. The quarter was generally in line with our expectations. Year-over-year organic sales were down about a point more than we expected and margins were somewhat better. As we projected, sales in our product businesses picked compared to the prior quarter. Orders in our solutions and services businesses improved sequentially but solutions and services orders and sales came in below expectations, particularly in the U.S. and Canada. Globally the vertical picture is pretty much the same as in prior quarters. Heavy industry end markets remain challenging, with oil and gas, and mining the weakest verticals. Oil and gas was down over 30% in the quarter, more than we expected. Consumer and auto both continued to grow. Organic sales in the U.S. and Canada were down 8%. Heavy industries, including oil and gas, accounted for almost all of the year-over-year decline. In the U.S., we experienced some delays in larger projects generally but particularly in heavy industry end markets affecting our solutions and services businesses. In China, conditions remained stable and we saw another quarter of sequential revenue growth as consumer and auto continued to outperform heavy industries. As expected, sales were down mid-teens in the quarter. I'm encouraged, however, that orders in China were up year-over-year. EMEA had an excellent quarter with over 5% organic sales growth. I'm particularly pleased with our continued progress with machine builders in this region. Home and personal care, and food and beverage were the strongest verticals in this region. In Latin America, sales were up 8% led by Mexico where strength remains broad based across most verticals. Let me add a few comments about the quarter. Our Process Business was flat compared to the prior quarter and down 20% year-over-year. Logix was down 3% compared to last year but grew 4% sequentially. And I'm pleased that as expected, Architecture & Software margins improved and were up 300 basis points sequentially. This contributed to our strong segment margin performance in the quarter of over 21%. Ted will elaborate more on Q3 financial performance in his remarks. Let's move on to our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. We expect continued improvement in our product sales but the weaker third quarter solutions and services orders and sales performance has caused us to reduce our sales outlook for the fourth quarter. We still believe we will see modest sequential sales improvement in the second half of the fiscal year, but not as much as we anticipated in April. Globally, we expect heavy industries to remain weak and see a continued positive outlook for the consumer and automotive verticals. Taking all these factors into consideration, we are lowering our full year fiscal 2016 organic sales guidance to down about 4% at the midpoint, a point lower than our April guidance and are revising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $5.80 to $6.00. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks. Before I turn it over to Ted, let me add a few comments. Given the recent leadership transition, I recognize that many of you have questions about my vision for Rockwell Automation and what changes you can expect. I'll have the opportunity to share my thoughts with you in more detail at our Annual Investor Day at Automation Fair in November this year, but here are some initial points. Rockwell Automation will continue to focus all of our passion and knowledge on making our customers more productive. We'll do that by building on the strong foundation Keith built and maximizing customer value by understanding our customers' best opportunities for productivity, combining a differentiated technology and domain expertise to deliver positive business outcomes for our customers and continually simplifying their experience. Understanding fosters loyalty. Combining technology and expertise increases customer share, preserves margins and reduces cyclicality. Simplification drives productivity for our customers and for us. Above-market growth will come from share gains, new value from the Connected Enterprise and acquisitions used as catalysts to accelerate our strategy. We are very well positioned to bring the Connected Enterprise to life for our customers, given our technology, domain expertise, partners and market access. We are implementing a growing number of pilots to quantify this new value and I am pleased with the progress and diversity of these customer engagements. Expansion of these pilots to multiple locations may take some time to play out and the pace will vary from vertical to vertical, customer to customer. However, we continue to earn the position of trusted partner at new customers every day as a single integrated business focused exclusively on making them more competitive. Finally, I'd like to thank our employees and partners for their continued dedication in serving our customers. With that, Ted? Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks, Blake, and good morning, everybody. I'll start on page four, third quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were $1.474 billion, 6.4% lower than Q3 last year. Organic sales declined 4.8% and currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 1.8%. As Blake said, the organic sales decline was about 1 point worse than we expected and the shortfall was primarily in our solutions and services businesses in the U.S. and Canada. Currency was in line with our expectations. Segment operating margin was 21.1% in the third quarter, down 70 basis points from Q3 last year, primarily related to the lower sales and unfavorable currency impact, partly offset by lower incentive compensation cost. Operating margin improved sequentially by 1.8 points. General corporate net was approximately $17 million in the quarter compared to $22 million in Q3 last year. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.55, down $0.04 or 3% compared to third quarter of last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 25.1% compared to 27.9% in Q3 last year. We recognized a favorable discrete tax item in the current quarter and we're also benefiting this year from the R&D tax credit. Free cash flow for Q3 was $250 million. Free cash flow conversion on adjusted income was 123% in the quarter. Our trailing four-quarter return on invested capital was 32.6%. A couple of items not shown here, average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 130.8 million, down about 3.5% compared to last year. Also, during the third quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares at a cost of about $122 million. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 3.5 million shares at a cost of $370 million. In November, we talked about a full year repurchase target of $500 million. We're running very close to that pace through June. At the end of the quarter, there was $1.075 billion remaining under the previous share repurchase authorization. The next slide presents the sales and operating margin performance of our Architecture & Software segment, both for the third quarter and year-to-date. I'll focus my comments on the third quarter results. On the left side of this chart, Architecture & Software segment sales were $666 million in Q3, down 2.5% compared to Q3 last year. Organic sales declined 1.3%. Currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 1.6%. Sequential organic growth was about 4.5%. Moving to the right side of the chart, A&S margins were 27.6%, down 160 basis points compared to Q3 last year, primarily due to lower sales and unfavorable mix and currency impacts, offset in part by lower incentive compensation costs. Operating margin improved sequentially by 300 basis points. Turning to page six, this is the Control Products & Solutions segment. In the third quarter, Control Products & Solutions segment sales were $808 million, down 9.4% year-over-year on a reported basis with organic sales down 7.5%. Currency translation reduced sales by 1.9%. Sequentially, organic sales for Control Products & Solutions declined by 1.5%. On a year-over-year basis, organic sales for the product businesses in the segment declined about 4.5%. Organic sales for the solutions and services portion of the segment declined by about 10%. Decline in the solutions and services portion of this business was about $15 million larger than we expected and this was primarily in heavy industry verticals in the U.S. and Canada. The book-to-bill in Q3 for solutions and services was 1.04. Particularly in the U.S., we saw a larger amount of project delays in our solutions and services businesses in Q3 and we expect this trend in delays to continue into Q4. Consequently, we've reduced our previous projections for sales in these businesses for the fourth quarter. CP&S operating margin was 15.7%, down 40 basis points from 16.1% in Q3 last year. We consider that to be good margin performance on a significant top line reduction. The impact of lower sales was partly offset by productivity and lower incentive compensation costs. Moving to the next slide. Page seven provides the geographic breakdown of our sales and shows organic growth results for the quarter, and the nine months through June. As you can see on the slide, the organic sales decline in the quarter was driven by the U.S., Canada and Asia Pacific with healthy organic growth in EMEA and Latin America. Blake already provided some regional colors so I'll just add a couple of notes. We experienced a year-over-year decline of 1% in total Emerging Market organic sales with the decline in China more than offsetting growth in the balance of the emerging countries. Blake mentioned the weakness in the heavy industry including oil and gas being down over 30% year-over-year in Q3. That was a larger decline than we expected. Previously, we expected oil and gas to be down about 20% for the full year. We now expect a decline of about 25%. Please turn to the next page, which is our updated fiscal year 2016 guidance. So, as Blake said, we are revising full year guidance and narrowing the guidance range. Given the sales and order misses in our solutions and services businesses in Q3, and a related reduced outlook for Q4, we're reducing the guidance midpoint for organic sales from a decline of minus 3% to minus 4%. You can think of the new guidance range as plus or minus about $50 million, so roughly minus 3% to minus 5% organically. We now expect currency to be a little more negative for the full year but still at about minus 3%. We expect reported sales of approximately $5.85 billion at the midpoint. We continue to expect segment operating margin to be a little lower than 20.5%, so no change from previous guidance despite the reduced top line. We now expect an Adjusted Effective Tax Rate for the full year of about 24.5%, about a 0.5 point lower than previous guidance, and primarily due to the favorable discrete item in Q3 that I mentioned earlier. Taking into account lower organic sales, our operating margin expectation and a modestly lower tax rate, the new guidance range for Adjusted EPS is $5.80 to $6. That puts us $0.05 lower than previous guidance at the midpoint. As usual, there are a lot of moving parts. But basically, the earnings contribution that we lost due to lower solutions and services organic sales we mostly offset with somewhat lower spending and a lower tax rate. We continue to expect about 100% conversion of Adjusted Income to free cash flow. There are a few other items not shown here that I think are generally of interest. We continue to expect general corporate net expense to be approximately $75 million for the full year. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about $131 million for the full year. And finally, our guidance continues to include a provision for potential restructuring charges of about $10 million in the fourth quarter. And with that, I'll turn it over to Patrick for the Q&A. Patrick Goris - Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations : Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible. So please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you for that. And, operator, let's take our first question. Operator : Your first question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys. Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: One of the things \u2013 and welcome, Blake, to your first solo call. Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Scott. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: You guys have done a pretty good job in this down cycle we're experiencing right now holding margins, keeping the wheels on and such. And when you think about your change in guidance kept margins flat versus prior guidance. How much of that is this lowered compensation dynamic? And how sustainable is that? When you think about \u2013 Blake, when you think about going into next year, I mean, you start thinking about compounding years of lower compensation. At some point I would imagine it's \u2013 you risk losing some people. So how do you think about that dynamic? Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes. So, Scott, to your first question, in terms of the April guidance to July guidance, there's no difference in the savings from lower incentive compensation. It's the same in both numbers. But to your question about sustainability. I mean, you're correct and we've been saying all year that when our sales and earnings start to improve once again, we will have to restore the incentive compensation to more normal levels. And so at some point we're going to have a headwind in our margins related to that. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's fair. And then as a quick follow-on, when you think about large project delays, are they being delayed because of macro conditions? Are they being delayed because of shortage of labor? I mean what is the primary cause? Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Typically, it's because the users don't need the additional capacity. So I don't think the shortage of labor is as big an issue as the users going slower on planned upgrades or capacity expansions. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's what I thought. All right. I'll pass it on. Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Morning. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Morning. Oil and gas, can we talk about that for a second? Down over 30%. You got companies like Halliburton and Dover that perpetually called the bottom and say, things are going to get better. And then ITW basically said, no, we wouldn't call the bottom. I understand you're not an oil and gas company, but based on your front log and the impacts, I mean where \u2013 is this thing going to sort of sequentially continue to kind of dribble down here and get worse? Or what do you think on that front? And what's maybe baked into your guidance for the fourth quarter? Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. Hey. So, John, so this is Ted. We were a little bit surprised by the Q3 results. We did not expect to see kind of a sequential decline in the oil and gas business. It was largely driven by Latin America, which was also a surprise to us, and it was related to some project push outs in the quarter because it was project specific it's a little bit hard to call whether this is a trend or whether it's just something unique to this quarter. I don't think we're comfortable calling a bottom in oil and gas but we're not expecting further sequential decline in Q4. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Ted, Latin America, by that you mean PEMEX and in that context you don't have to be an oil forecaster. You could probably look at PEMEX or whatever customer it is and try and ring fence the impact. I mean is \u2013 anything you can say on that front? Are we talking Mexico? And just my other comment, is this a customer-related issue or do you think it's just more broad? Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : The only thing I would say is this was broader than PEMEX. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : We saw this across oil, across Latin America. And so PEMEX was part of it but not the largest part of it. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Well maybe it's Zika-related. Can I ask you about the down 20% Process? Honeywell didn't put up results like that. I realize you're not Honeywell, but maybe this is a dovetail question for Blake. Process has been one of Keith's signature sort of focal points. And I understand markets are weak. But why is Process down 20%? Was there any kind of incremental color you can provide? And I'd be curious if, Blake, in your own thoughts towards how you're going to prioritize Process or how you're thinking about it in the context of strategic opportunities? Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Thanks, John. First of all, Process remains at the top of the list in terms of our growth opportunities. It's the large part of our served market and we continue to invest in technology and domain expertise and in market access to take share in Process. One of the factors I think contributing to our reductions in Process is we don't have the same historical installed base to be able to mine recurring revenue in the form of service contracts from those Process Systems that may have been installed 20 years or 30 years ago. So, that's one of the primary factors that we don't see the hedge, if you will, against the volatility in the project-based business. Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : John, I think the other \u2013 I'm not an expert on Honeywell, but I think Honeywell's exposure in oil and gas is much more downstream oriented than ours. And I think that's another factor in the performance. And then the biggest thing for us in Process is simply that a lot of our Process Business is solutions-related. Our solutions exposure is much more heavy-industry related. And with oil and gas down significantly and mining down significantly, it's hard for us to post better numbers in Process. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. No, Honeywell's definitely downstream for sure. So that \u2013 so just a last one. So just the Process then, is this dovetailing? I realize there's a lot of Venn diagram overlaps in Rockwell's results. Is this dovetailing with the Canada, U.S. kind of being a little worse? So what you're saying is your Process Business hasn't been there 30 years? So there's a lot more new project reliance. So if there's some heavy industry push to the right, which I'm assuming encompasses oil and gas, is this also explaining Process? Like is this all part of the same thing, if you will? Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes. That's right. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Okay. Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning. And, Blake, congratulations on the job. Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. So just to follow on to Scott's question. I think there's going to be a lot of questions on the impact of the compensation tailwinds. And I know that, Ted, you mentioned it's the same as the April quarter sorry, the Q2 fiscal. Maybe could you just maybe try and help us quantify what that tail could be as we think about next year's numbers? Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Well, so I can't. I don't think I want to try to do 2017 guidance, especially on a specific number like incentive comp. But I can quantify it for this year. We have consistently said that the year-over-year savings that we got from incentive comp this year was tens of millions of dollars, but less than $50 million. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And that's obviously for the fiscal year rather than the quarter? Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : That was for the full fiscal year 2016. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then that range is still valid -- okay, that's very helpful. Thanks. Thanks, Ted. And then, I guess just thinking about the way that the quarter developed. It's obviously -- your guidance for 4Q is very similar to 3Q so it doesn't feel like there's a whole lot just changing. But there's obviously a big debate about auto and actually, Mexico as well. I mean, Mexican IP is close to negative, if it's not already there. Mexico has been a bright spot. So, first of all I guess, are you seeing any signs of tired legs on the auto cycle and some of the CapEx investments? And secondly, any signs of weakening in Mexico, just given the quite weak data that we see on the macro front? Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Well, so on auto, we saw growth in auto in Q3 kind of as we expected. And we're expecting Q4 to be a good quarter. In Mexico, Mexico was not quite as good as we were thinking it could be in Q3, primarily around heavy industry. And I think our expectations for Mexico in Q4 are now a little lower than they were a quarter ago. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. No surprise there. Thanks, Ted. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, thanks a lot. Good morning. Congratulations, Blake, best of luck. Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : The Latin America oil and gas weakness, I assume that \u2013 is a lot of that offshore-related? Or is there a mix there? Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: There's a mix. When we talk specifically about PEMEX, that's going to be inclusive of both offshore rigs as well as onshore production. And then when we look at Brazil, again, a mix that would be a little bit heavier on the offshore side. But, of course, Brazil is very weak as they remain in a recession? Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And I think a lot of these guys asked a lot of good questions so far so I'll take the high level one. What are you seeing out there? How do you think this economy is trending over the next 12 months? I know we've got these kind of project delays. Are these project delays \u2013 do they represent pent-up demand or because of this capacity situation we're in, what do you kind of see from just a broad ISM or broad CapEx perspective out there from an appetite perspective as you talk to customers about the pipeline of activity? What's your sense of \u2013 how do you characterize these environments for the next 12 months to 18 months? Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Steve, speaking specifically of the U.S., we'd characterize the U.S. market as stable. We are seeing some growth in consumer but continued weakness in heavy industry, including oil and gas. Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : And, Steve, I think more than anything else this is just, what we're seeing is constrained capital spending in heavy industry. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. And so is that phased? I mean, does anything else pick up \u2013 if those declines moderate, is there anything else you see there that kind of can accelerate going forward? Is there just kind of \u2013 oh man, I just wish we got a little catalyst, there's a big pipeline of opportunities. Or just kind of hand to mouth, more hand to mouth? Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So if we look beyond oil and gas and we look for some of the pockets of relative strength in heavy industries, pulp and paper, we do see growth in pulp and paper. In water, wastewater we had a good Q3 and we expect continued growth there. Chemicals, the chemical industry continues to benefit from the lower cost feedstock from natural gas. And so we see strength in chemical as well. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thanks. And welcome, Blake. I guess, my first question would be around the U.S. demand trends that you talked about. I think a lot of companies have seen pretty weak but steady demand in the last few months in the U.S. Clearly, things seem to be disappointing for you. So is that something that got worse as the quarter went on? Or was it something that was true pretty much of the whole last sort of three- or four-month period? Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So, Julian, there's some different questions there. The first thing I would say is from a quarterly progression point of view, this was a pretty typical quarter where we actually saw improvement as the quarter progressed. In terms of overall U.S. market conditions, it's a little bit mixed right now. I mean, our product sales in the U.S. were up sequentially pretty much exactly as we expected, and I'd say we're seeing a positive demand trend on the product side. It was really the solutions and services businesses where we saw the unexpected decline and it appears to be very much related to heavy industry. As you know, we've got more exposure in solutions and services to heavy industry and a better exposure in product sales at consumer and automotive, and I think it's that dichotomy in the performance of those respective verticals that's causing that result. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Understood. Thank you, and then just within the margins within CP&S, they've been extremely resilient in the last nine months. I was curious if you're seeing in your backlog in the context of the weak orders and book-to-bill, if you're seeing anything from mix or worse, pricing that suggests that those margins in CP&S come under a little bit more pressure in the next three months to six months? Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So, if anything in CP&S we're benefiting from a little bit of favorable mix because the product sales growth has been outpacing solutions and services sales growth. Specifically, as it relates to pricing, on the product side, we saw about the same level of pricing in Q3 as we have seen in the earlier quarters this year. On the solutions and services side, in a down market like this, things tend to get more competitive, but I wouldn't say we're expecting any significant impact on margins in Q4. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Please, go ahead. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes. Welcome, Blake. Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Rick. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Just a quick couple of thoughts, if you will, on EMEA. I think the reference there on the growth rates of just under 6% was really around the more machine builders market. But could you maybe go one level deeper on the machine builders market and what is the exposure there? Is it on the consumer side? Is it exports? So just maybe a little better sense of what the customer base on the machine builder side looks like in EMEA and how sustainable that kind of mid-single digit growth rate might be here over the next couple quarters. Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Well, Rick, you said it. It is centered on the consumer side and food and beverage. So a classic OEM success story for us in Europe would be a packaging machine builder who's benefiting, quite frankly, from some of our recent product releases in our core platforms. And as they try to be more competitive, as they go after the mid range type of machines, especially in emerging markets, we've given them some new functionality that's allowed them to better compete. And so we're seeing growth in that segment of the OEM market. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And just maybe as a follow-up question. I just want to follow-up on the CP&S business again. Looking at maybe the fourth quarter core guide, it does appear though as the CP&S business should seasonally show some fourth quarter strength over the third quarter. And is the backlog and your commentary around pricing and the solutions business, does the op profit in the fourth quarter respond to that higher volume sequentially? Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So, Rick, I think everything we have talked about around the weakness that we saw in solutions and services orders in Q3 and the delays that we think are going to carry over into Q4, the typical significant revenue uptick we get from Q3 to Q4 primarily related to our solutions and services businesses. We don't think we're going to see that this year, at least not to the same extent. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Correct. Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : And so that is going to have an impact on operating margin. We're not going to get that same volume leverage, operating margin impact that we normally have in Q4. The other two things are going on in Q4, in Q3 spending came a little bit lighter than we expected. And I think there's going to be some catch up of that in Q4. And then I mentioned in my comments, we've got about $10 million of potential restructuring charges sitting in Q4 as well. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And that is the $10 million of restructuring, presumably that's a pre-tax number. That's included in your guidance? Or excluded? Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Included. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : And that is a pre-tax number. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And so just to clarify though, the revenue in CP&S for the fourth quarter will be lower than it is \u2013 than it was in the third? Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : No. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): No. Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : No, we will not be lower. We just won't have the magnitude of increase we typically see. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Correct. I understand. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Please go ahead. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. And welcome, Blake. Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, Blake. Can you fill out your thoughts on kind of the Connected Enterprise updates you gave in some of the pilots? You talked about the number increasing and just sort of the nature of the timing and how you see it developing? Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Just to set the context, the Connected Enterprise really is at the heart of the company's overall strategy. And so while we sometimes focus on the new value that comes from the Connected Enterprise with the networks and networks services, security and information management software, it really begins with our core platforms. And so the functionality that I talked about for a machine builder, those same products include the functionality that enables that higher-level productivity. So just let me give an example with that same packaging OEM. They're using our new products, some of our recent CompactLogix releases, Motion, PowerFlex drives to get more performance out of their machinery and more flexibility and to be able to perform safety functions more elegantly. When that equipment is shipped to, say, a food producer, we enable faster line integration with our software. We can provide network design services to remove bottlenecks and we can remotely monitor that line and a hundred other lines around the world to benchmark performance to maximize up time. So the data that can be turned into information to make better decisions already exists in our plan for drives and controllers. And we've been asked by users in a wide variety of industries to get involved with pilots to quantify that value. So they're starting small so that they can have a discreet opportunity to look at the benefits of this new functionality before they roll it out to multiple locations. And that's going to take a little while to play out, and each customer's going to move at their own pace. But we're very encouraged by the early progress. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks. And then, Rockwell has always made great use of the partnership network, as well as alliances over the years. Is any of that changing? There's a lot of partnerships seeming to be formed out there, GE with Microsoft recently. And that's been one of your alliances for a long time as well. Does that change anything? Do you guys need to adapt at all in terms of your historical approach to partnerships and alliances? Or is it still the same approach? Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, Shannon. It's still the same approach. We don't anticipate any changes in our strategy, the closeness to Microsoft from the recent announcement because most of these partnerships are non-exclusive. And at the end of the day it's bringing positive outcomes to the user, combining the technology and the domain expertise that count. So that particular partnership is a lot around infrastructure and some of the specific cloud-level functionality. What we talk about in terms of new value, importantly, is scalability, and so a lot of the benefit that we can bring to a user is going to happen without having to leave the four walls of a plant. But we continue to work closely with Microsoft and Cisco and AT&T and a host of other partners to be able to bring the functionality that, that customer needs to make them most productive. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. That's great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Jeff. Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. I don't think we're looking at starvation of MRO and OpEx. And I think, Jeff, the health that we're seeing in product demand is indicative of some reasonable level of MRO spending ongoing. I mean, I think my comments about the vertical exposure on the product side was more related to projects. Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Well, I'm not going to break out growth spending. I'll just talk about spending generally. Our sales are going to be down, if we're right about the guidance, by about 4% organically year-over-year. Spending I think is going to be close to flat year-over-year. So, on balance it's a little bit of a headwind to the margins. But when you look within spending I think what you would see is our R&D spending is actually up year-over-year a little bit in absolute dollars and up considerably as a percent of sales because of the sales decline and we've seen some reduction year-over-year in the SG&A areas. Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Jeff, acquisitions still remain an important part of our growth strategy. And I look at acquisitions as catalysts to identify strategic growth opportunities for the company. So we're not going to get into acquisitions that take us into lines of business that we don't understand but to speed up activities that we've already begun internally. I see it as an important part of our overall growth plan. We remain focused on organic growth first. But then acquisitions as catalysts are in the second position. We have a strong pipeline now. We're pursuing acquisitions now and we're not constrained by any small size limit. The ones we've done recently have happened to be on the smaller side. But we'll look at bigger ones too if they make sense and they fit that model. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning, guys. Blake, congratulations. Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): So, China down mid-teen in the quarter but orders up year-over-year. You mentioned consumer and auto still doing well there. I think your guidance before was for China to be down high-single digits to about 10% for the year. Is that still the case? And are you seeing any signs of tire and heavy industry at least bottoming, given some stability in China over the last couple quarters? Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So your first question, I think China's going to be down about 10% year-over-year. I mean, that's our expectation given the Q3 performance and what we're looking at for Q4. I'd characterize China generally, including heavy industry, as stable. It doesn't seem to be getting a lot worse. But I would not say that we think we've turned the corner yet either. Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And, Andy, on the specific comment around tire. From a worldwide standpoint, there are a number of greenfield tire plants that are under construction or under design around the world. A lot of those are heading towards North America and Mexico. It's a bit of an issue of timing and which machine builders win the big portions of those facilities to determine where those will hit. We have a strong position in tire. That's going to be re-enforced with these new greenfields. But again, we're not exactly sure where all of those orders are going to be placed. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks for that. And I think I know the answer to this, but I'll ask it anyway. Have you seen any improvement at all in metals and mining at this point? Or at least signs of a bottom? It might be too early for actual improvement but what about incremental discussions in the space? Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. Here and there, there are consolidations of steel mills and mines as people are trying to get productivity. We participate in some of the ongoing productivity projects within metals and mining. But the low cost of the resources and the overcapacity is still putting pressure on those verticals. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): All right. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks. And good morning, all. Just to put a finer point on one of your earlier answers. You said that auto saw growth in Q3 and expecting a good Q4. But last quarter you said it was specifically 3% up. What was the number this quarter? Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So auto was up about 1% this quarter. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And powertrain growth where you're taking some share? Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. The powertrain is proceeding as we expected. We've gotten some great commitments this year. And I'd say we're kind of on track for the kind of $20 million incremental that we've been talking about. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And, Ted, one other thing. On the whole restructuring question, you've got this $10 million placeholder for 4Q. When we had talked about this in the prior quarter, you had talked about $10 million, potentially $20 million. What did you end up executing in the third quarter? And why holding off longer given the broader environment that you're looking at? Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So a couple different pieces to that. First, we've always talked about in our normal course of business we'd expect to spend about $10 million on restructuring over the course of a year. And this year we had provided for an additional $10 million. We have spent some on restructuring earlier in the year. But given the slowdown that we saw in the solutions and services businesses in Q3 and the revised outlook for Q4, we're now kind of taking that into account, as well as assessing what we think we're going to see at least in the first half of next year and we're going through a careful assessment of one, do we need to adjust the cost structure, and two, if we don't need to adjust the cost structure, do we need to do some reallocation of resources so that we can get positioned for what we think the best growth opportunities will be next year. That's a combination of both of those things that have caused us to put some potential restructuring charges into Q4. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. All right. I know we've talked a lot about the fourth quarter, but just so I'm just trying to get some clarity in terms of how you're thinking about that progressing. You've got 4.5 points of easier comps, I guess, up 2.2% to down 2.3% from Q3 to Q4 in 2015. You're calling for roughly down 4% organic growth on top of that in the fourth quarter. You mentioned the solutions and services pressures going into the fourth quarter. But given the lapping of the comps at this point, are you thinking about at least \u2013 and I know we don't get guidance for a little while for 2017, but are you thinking about exiting 2016 at that weaker rate for some time to come, or can you picture this as actually probably sort of a shorter-term issue? Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, we're going to defer any discussions about 2017 until we provide guidance in November. But I would say, particularly in the solutions and services businesses, our comparisons start to get a little bit easier after Q4. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. All right. And they are getting easier in Q4 too though, right? Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, not necessarily in solutions and services. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. That's just the broader segment. Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. All right, I'll leave it there. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good morning, and congratulations, Blake. Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Joe. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes. My first question I guess, maybe just a little bit of clarification on China auto. With the light vehicle tax stimulus potentially rolling at the end of this calendar year, have you guys sensed that you've gotten any benefit from the tax stimulus being in place in the first place? Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. We haven't seen any direct impact from that stimulus on accelerating or increasing the number of projects in the pipeline. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Great. And then, maybe a couple of quick hits on the margins. Ted, did you \u2013 this year, was there any impact from the FX hedges? I know last year you had some gains come through. Was there anything that was impacting your margins this year on the FX side? Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. That's something else we've been talking about all year. Our hedges are rolling year-over-year and they're rolling kind of with a lower benefit. So we've still got hedge gains this year but lower hedge gains than we had a year ago. And it's about $13 million on a year-over-year basis. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. The $13 million is incrementally lower than last year? Is that the right way to think about it? Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. Yes. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. All right. Great. And then maybe just on the 4Q margins. I know last year you guys had elevated R&D spend. Your margins in your A&S segment were down pretty significantly on a year-over-year basis. And so are there some potential tailwinds that we should expect in the fourth quarter from just a comps perspective? Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : There are always a lot of puts and takes on a year-over-year basis. But I think I'd repeat what I said earlier about fourth quarter margins. Sequentially, it's likely margin will be down a little bit Q3 to Q4. We don't expect to see the same pop in solutions and services sales that we normally see. So we're not going to have that volume leverage this year, that same volume leverage. I think sequentially spending is going to be a little bit higher in Q4. And we've got that potential restructuring charge sitting in Q4 where there was very little restructuring charge in Q3. So those are all the reasons that I think we're going to see a little bit lower sequential margin. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Gotcha. That's helpful. Thank you. Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Operator, we will take one more question. Operator : And our final question is from the line of Jeremie Capron with CLSA. Please go ahead. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Thanks. Good morning. And welcome, Blake. Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Jeremie. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Just a quick question on the cash flows here. We've seen quite a bit of change in terms of your geographic mix now with North America business coming under pressure. I wonder how does this affect your ability to continue to return excess cash to shareholders in a tax efficient way. And are you willing to take on more debt as you did last year to continue with this strategy? Thanks. Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So subject to what our acquisition spending is we continue to be committed to deploying our full excess free cash flow to share owners either through dividend or share repurchase. And as you mentioned, we did that last year and it required taking on a little bit more debt. I think you're going to see the same thing this year. And so I think the answer to the question is yes. There was another question in there about kind of weakness in the U.S. and I'm guessing you're asking about distribution of cash flows. I would say that has not changed significantly for us as a consequence of the U.S. market conditions. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Thanks very much, and good luck. Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you. Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks. Patrick Goris - Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations : Okay. That concludes today's call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. So with that, I'll hand over the call to Blake. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Patrick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to page 3 in the slide deck. The quarter was a little better than our expectations. Sales in our Product businesses continued to improve sequentially, and the Architecture & Software segment returned to year-over-year organic growth. Orders and sales in our Solutions & Services businesses, while still down year over year, came in as expected. Globally, oil and gas and mining remained the weakest verticals, with oil and gas down about 25% year over year in the quarter. However, it appears these markets are stabilizing. Consumer and automotive both had good growth in the quarter. For automotive, this was the best year-over-year growth quarter of the year. Our powertrain initiative is yielding results and is contributing toward growth and share gains in this vertical. From a regional perspective, in the U.S., our Product businesses continued to improve sequentially and were up year over year for the first time this year. Food and beverage and automotive were our strongest verticals in the U.S. EMEA was down year over year in the quarter, a bit weaker than we expected, but order growth was strong and up mid-single digits year over year. Our performance in Asia was stronger than we expected, with growth in most countries in the region, including China, where we saw modest year-over-year growth for the first time this year. And as expected, our organic growth rate in Latin America slowed down. Continued growth in Mexico was offset by weakness elsewhere in the region, including Brazil. A couple of additional comments about the quarter, our Process business was down 14% year over year, reflecting continued weakness in heavy industries. Logix was down 1% compared to last year but grew again sequentially. And I'm pleased with about 20% segment margin in the quarter, despite higher restructuring charges. Ted will elaborate more on Q4 financial performance, including the restructuring charges, in his remarks. Moving to the full year, fiscal 2016 was a challenging year, but I believe we executed well in difficult market conditions. Here are some key points. Throughout fiscal 2016, we've talked about significant declines in heavy industry verticals. Oil and gas was down about 25% for the year, mining mid-teens. Weak heavy industry performance impacted Process and Logix performance, which were down 15% and 4% for the year respectively. Consumer verticals were up mid-single digits. This reflects our continued success with machine builders. After several strong years, automotive continued to grow, including the contribution from our powertrain initiative. And we saw double-digit growth in revenue streams related to new value from the connected enterprise. We'll talk more about that on Thursday at our Investor Day. With respect to financial performance, we were able to keep our segment margin above 20% despite 7% lower reported sales. We had another good year of free cash flow conversion, over 100% of adjusted income. And we continued to return cash to shareowners, almost $900 million during fiscal 2016. Just last week, we announced a 5% increase in the annual dividend. This reflects our confidence in sustained free cash flow through the cycle. To accelerate the execution of our strategy, we acquired three great companies during fiscal 2016. These acquisitions further strengthen our technology differentiation, increase our domain expertise, and expand market access. MagneMotion adds to our portfolio of innovative motion control solutions for consumer and transportation verticals. Automation Control Products adds new value to our software offering in applications across all industries, and Maverick Technologies adds expertise in chemical, consumer, life sciences, and oil and gas industry applications. I believe these acquisitions will help us grow market share. Finally, I would like to thank our employees, partners, and suppliers for their continued commitment. Let's move on now to the fiscal 2017 outlook. I'll start with market conditions and economic indicators. Since the significant declines in early 2016, oil and commodity prices have somewhat recovered, and our business in heavy industry markets generally appears to have stabilized. Current forecasts call for improved global GDP and industrial production growth rates as well as higher levels of global capital expenditures. We therefore expect improvement to continue into fiscal 2017, with continued growth in the consumer and auto verticals and with heavy industries about flat year over year. Taking all these factors into consideration, we are expecting fiscal 2017 organic sales to be up about 2% year over year. In addition, we project the acquisitions we made in 2016 to contribute significant growth. Including the impact of currency, we are initiating fiscal 2017 sales guidance of a little more than $6 billion and adjusted EPS guidance of $5.85 to $6.25. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks. Before I turn it over to Ted, let me add a few comments. I look forward to seeing many of you later this week at our annual Investor Day. As usual, we will hold Investor Day at Automation Fair, our main customer event, which will be in Atlanta this year. Coincidentally, Atlanta is my hometown. We again expect to welcome thousands of customers and partners from all over the world for this year's Automation Fair. We will showcase our latest innovations, acquisitions, and information solutions, and highlight how the powerful combination of Rockwell Automation and our partners bring the connected enterprise to life. Regardless of the macro environment, the secular tailwinds for automation remain intact and the opportunities provided by the connected enterprise are real. I believe we are best positioned to deliver the connected enterprise to our customers because we are already on the plant floor with a large installed base. We have differentiated technology and domain expertise, and we have a long history of successful partnerships. And the value we provide is in high demand, as every day customers are pulling us into their plans to connect their enterprise to become more competitive. We will continue to invest in technology and domain expertise to expand this value and profitably grow share, more on Thursday during Investor Day. And with that, Ted. Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Blake. Good morning, everyone. I'll start my comments with page 4 of the fourth quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were $1.539 billion, down 4.3% compared to Q4 last year. On an organic basis, sales declined 4%. Currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 70 basis points, and acquisitions increased sales by 40 basis points. Both the organic result and the currency impact were a little better than we expected. Segment operating margin was 19.8%, down 1.1 points from Q4 last year. The lower margin year over year was primarily due to lower organic sales and higher restructuring charges, partly offset by favorable mix. Restructuring charges in the quarter totaled about $20 million, higher than the $10 million that we talked about in our last earnings call. We elected to go deeper with restructuring to help offset known earnings headwinds in fiscal year 2017 and to create some headroom to reallocate spending to areas where we believe we have the best growth opportunities in the coming year. We expect these actions to generate gross savings of over $30 million in fiscal 2017 and over $40 million on a full run rate basis. General corporate net expense was $25 million in Q4 compared to $20 million a year ago. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 23% compared to 28% in the fourth quarter last year. In Q4 this year, the adjusted effective tax rate was lower than last year but also better than we expected, primarily due to a more favorable mix of income across our global operations. Compared to Q4 last year, we also benefited this year from the R&D tax credit. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.52 compared to $1.57 in Q4 last year. The effect on adjusted EPS of lower operating earnings was partly offset by a lower tax rate and lower share count. Adjusted EPS of $1.52 was a few cents above the implied fourth quarter guidance, including the lower tax rate but despite the higher restructuring charges. Free cash flow for Q4 was $235 million. That's another very good quarter. The rolling four-quarter return on invested capital was 33%. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 130 million. That's down 3% from Q4 last year. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares at a cost of $130 million. Turning to page 5, this is the full-year version of the key financial information. Sales were $5.880 billion for the full year, down 6.8%. Organic sales declined 3.9%. Currency translation reduced sales by 3 points. Segment operating margin for the full year was 20.2%, down 1.4 points from last year. The primary factors were lower organic sales and the negative impact from currency effects, partly offset by lower incentive compensation expense. Adjusted EPS was $5.93, down 7% compared to last year on the 7% reported sales decline. General corporate net expense was $80 million for the full year. That was about $5 million more than we talked about last quarter. Free cash flow for full year was $834 million, which was 107% of adjusted income, a little better than our targeted conversion and previous guidance. For the full year, we repurchased a total of 4.6 million shares at a cost of $500 million. That's right on the $500 million target that we shared last November. The next two slides present a graphical view of the sales and operating margin performance of each segment. I'll start with the Architecture & Software segment on page 6. I'll start with the quarter performance. On the left side of this chart, you'll see that Architecture & Software segment sales were $696 million in Q4, up 1.8% from the same quarter last year. Organic sales increased 1.4%. Acquisitions increased sales by 1%, and currency translation reduced sales by 60 basis points. As Blake mentioned, this is the first quarter for year-over-year organic growth in the Architecture & Software segment in over a year. Moving to the right side of the chart, Architecture & Software margins in the quarter were 25.8%, down 1.5 points from Q4 last year, and primarily due to unfavorable mix and higher restructuring charges. For the full year, A&S sales were down 4.2% as reported, with a 1.5% organic sales decline, a 30 basis point contribution from acquisitions, and currency translation reducing sales by 3%. Segment operating margin for the full year was 26.4%, down 3 points compared to prior year, primarily due to lower sales, unfavorable mix, and unfavorable currency effects. Now on page 7, a similar view for the Control Products & Solutions segment. In the fourth quarter, Control Products & Solutions segment sales were $842 million, down 8.8% year over year, with an organic sales decline of 8%. Currency translation reduced sales in this segment by 80 basis points. The organic sales in the Product businesses in this segment grew by about 1%. Solutions & Services business sales declined by about 14%. The book-to-bill in Q4 for Solutions & Services was 0.92. That's better than the typical Q4 result but on a relatively weak billings denominator. Operating margin was 14.8%, down 1.4 points compared to last year, primarily due to the significant organic sales decline, partly offset by productivity. For the full year, CP&S sales were down 8.8% year over year and down 5.8% on an organic basis. Currency translation reduced sales by 3%. On an organic basis for the full year, Product sales in the segment were down about 2%, and Solutions & Services sales declined by about 8%. CP&S segment operating margin for the full year was 15.2%, 30 basis points below 2015. This was a very good result despite an almost 9% drop in reported sales, and largely attributable to strong productivity performance in the year. Page 8 provides a geographic breakdown of our sales and shows organic growth results for the quarter and the full year. My comments will all refer to organic growth rates. Starting with the quarter, the U.S. was down about 7%, Canada down about 10%. In the U.S., our Product businesses grew year over year in Q4 for the first time in fiscal 2016. EMEA was down 3% but, as Blake noted, underlying orders were good and it was a relatively difficult year-over-year comparison. We saw about 5% growth in Asia-Pacific, with China growth a little below that, and with India up in the high single digits. This is the first quarter for organic growth in Asia-Pacific and in China in more than a year. Latin America was up about 1%. Mexico was up almost 10%, but that was largely offset by declines in Brazil and the balance of the region. Moving to the full year, I'll try to provide some vertical color on the full-year results. In the U.S. and Canada, sales declined 7%. Across all regions this year, we experienced significant weakness in heavy industries, and that was particularly true in the U.S. For the company in total, oil and gas was down about 25% for the full year, but our largest decline in oil and gas occurred in the U.S., considerably worse than the company average. Similarly, mining, which was down mid-teens year over year for the company, was down over 20% in the U.S. The best growing verticals in the U.S. were food and beverage and life sciences. In EMEA, organic sales were up 2% year over year, with 1% growth in the mature markets and almost 4% growth in the emerging markets. On a vertical basis, oil and gas was down about 10%. Mining was down mid-single digit, and we saw particularly strong growth in life sciences and home and personal care. In Asia-Pacific, we finished the year with sales down 5%. India saw double-digit growth, and China was down a little less than 10%. In Asia-Pacific, heavy industry verticals were down across the board except for water/wastewater. Automotive, food and beverage, and life sciences were the best performing. Food and beverage was up about 20% year over year, primarily due to China. In Latin America, sales increased 7% for the full year, with Mexico over 20% and Brazil down almost 10%. Oil and gas was down about 10%. Mining was about flat. We saw growth in most other verticals, with strong growth in auto and home and personal care. Organic growth in emerging markets for the full year was 1%, with growth in Latin America and EMEA emerging markets and declines in China. And that takes us to the fiscal 2017 guidance slide. On the revenue side, here's how we're thinking about fiscal year 2017. We've seen solid sequential growth in our Product businesses over the last two quarters of fiscal year 2016. Orders in our Solutions & Services businesses seem to be reaching a bottom. From a vertical perspective, it appears that oil and gas and mining are stabilizing. We don't expect things to get better in fiscal year 2017, but we don't expect the drag in these industries that we experienced in 2016 to continue. We expect our business in auto and consumer industries to continue to grow. We've always said that our business tracks best with levels of industrial production. Current forecasts of industrial production for fiscal year 2017 indicate growth of a little over 1%. That compares to a 20 basis point decline in industrial production in 2016. Generally, we expect to grow at a multiple of IP growth. Blake mentioned that during 2016 we saw double-digit growth in some revenue streams related to the connected enterprise. We expect these revenue streams to continue to grow faster than the company average in fiscal 2017. With other share gain opportunities like powertrain and OEM, this will help us to continue to generate above-market organic growth. Taking all of that into account, we expect organic growth in fiscal 2017 of about 2%. We expect acquisitions to add about 1.5 points of additional growth. We expect a minor headwind from currency, about a 50 basis point reduction to sales for full year. Our projection for translation impact assumes recent exchange rates. For example, we're assuming a euro rate of $1.09. We expect fiscal 2016 sales to be a little over $6 billion. Our guidance range for organic growth is zero to 4%. We expect to see growth in all regions except Canada. We expect Canada to be about flat year over year in 2017. We expect slightly higher growth in the Product businesses than in our Solutions & Services businesses. And given the beginning backlog in our Solutions & Services businesses, for the company in total, we expect to see a lower rate of growth in the first half of the year and higher growth in the second half. We expect segment operating margin to be about 20%, maybe a little bit lower. That's not our normal conversion, but we know we have margin headwinds to deal with in 2017, namely, the restoration of inventive compensation and increase in operating pension expense and unfavorable currency impact that's catching up to us from the rolling of currency hedges we had in place last year. We expect the full-year adjusted effective tax rate to be about 24%. That's a little higher than in 2016. The rate reflects recognition of an expected discrete benefit in the first quarter, so the rate will be lower in Q1 and higher over the balance of the year. Our guidance range for adjusted EPS is $5.85 to $6.25. We expect free cash flow conversion on adjusted income of about 100%. And a couple of items not shown here, general corporate net expense should be approximately $75 million in 2017. We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 128 million for the full year. We intend to continue to return excess free cash flow to investors. Blake already talked about last week's dividend increase. The amount we spend on share repurchases in 2017 will depend on free cash flow and acquisition spending. But at this point, we expect to spend about $400 million on repurchases in 2017. The final page includes an EPS walk from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2017. I think what's most relevant on this chart is that you can see graphically the fiscal 2017 earning headwinds we've been talking about over the past few quarters. The restoration of incentive compensation is about a $0.25 headwind, with pension, currency, and tax rate all at about $0.05, all together about $0.40 of headwinds. Based on our previous and ongoing share repurchases, we expect a tailwind of about $0.15 from share count. Along with the core contribution, that's the walk to the $6.05 at the midpoint for fiscal 2017. We expect the effect of the recent acquisitions to be about neutral to adjusted EPS, including acquisition-related costs. And with that, I'll turn it over to Patrick and we'll begin Q&A. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Okay. Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Operator, let's take our first question. Unknown Speaker : Operator. Certainly. Our first question today comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Sawyer C. Rice - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, it's actually Sawyer on for Nigel. I just wanted to drill into the guidance a bit more. I guess on a geographic basis, how should we be thinking about fiscal 2017 geographically, and how does the zero to 4% organic shake out across the regions? Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yes, I think maybe addressing it at the midpoint of 2% organic, we would expect all of the regions to be close to that, but with Latin America probably a little above the average. Sawyer C. Rice - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thanks, and then I guess just one more here on auto specifically. You highlighted that as a growth end market for next year. Should we expect North American auto to be positive into 2017? Thanks. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yes, we do. And again, the growth of our automotive industry sales is really more dependent on model changes than the SAAR [Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate] count. And we have good visibility to model changes around the world, but including the U.S. Sawyer C. Rice - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Daniel J. Innamorato - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, guys. This is Dan on for Steve. How are you? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Daniel J. Innamorato - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So on the $0.35 expected for core growth next year, can you talk about the ability to toggle that depending on where you fall in the organic range? Basically meaning if you fall towards the low end of that organic, are there levers you can pull on margins to keep you close to that target, or is that $0.35 at the midpoint of 2% and it toggles that way? Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: We worked that bridge at the midpoint, but you could do a similar bridge at the low end of guidance. And the two things that would inflect at the lower end of guidance are both that core contribution and to some extent the incentive compensation. Daniel J. Innamorato - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. And then just a quick follow-up, can you walk us through the heavy industrial commentary for next year? Are there any verticals that are actually going to be down, or is that just a flattish trajectory across each of those end markets? Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: If you look at our performance in 2016, it was largely oil and gas and mining that pulled down the heavy industry verticals. In the balance of heavy industry verticals, it was relatively flat, with some up a little bit and some down a little bit. I think what we're counting on in oil and gas and mining is we have had in oil and gas now about four quarters of relatively flat sales sequentially, and in mining, about three quarters of relatively flat sales sequentially. And when we get to Q1, we will have an easier comparison year over year in oil and gas, and by Q2, an easier comparison in mining. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Overall the heavy industries are expected to be flat to slightly down. We do get some contribution particularly in chemical and oil and gas from the Maverick Technologies acquisition. Daniel J. Innamorato - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it, all right. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Steven Winoker from Bernstein New York. Please go ahead. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks and good morning, all. I just want to make sure I understand $0.35 core growth at the midpoint on the bridge for next year. So that's something north I think of a 50% incremental margin in terms of how I should think about just the core growth. And I assume that the restructuring, the $10 million to $20 million \u2013 well, the $20 million of which $10 million was a little bit more than we had talked about last quarter, without that, the bridge would be that core incremental would be closer to, I guess 25%, without the full $20 million a little higher. I'm just trying to make sure I get your thinking on this. Is the restructuring a big piece of that benefit? Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yes, so I think, Steve, you're right on. Part of that higher conversion is we'll probably guide about $15 million less restructuring charges reflected in 2017 than in 2016. And then in addition to that, we've got the restructuring savings that will impact 2017 favorably from the charges we took in Q4. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: And those are probably the two major factors that cause that conversion to be a little bit higher than you might have otherwise expected. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, perfect, and then just a little bit of clarity on both maybe auto and then MRO versus CapEx overall. In auto, you guys had been calling out decelerating organic growth. I think it was 1% up last quarter, maybe 3% the quarter before that. Where did it actually come out now? And then just more broadly, what are you seeing again on the MRO side as opposed to CapEx? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Auto was up almost 10% in the quarter, globally. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And MRO versus CapEx, what kind of trends are you seeing on the MRO side? Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Steve, is that question specific to auto or more generally? Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: No, more generally across the businesses. Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: It's hard because we sell so much through distribution that it's hard for us to know exactly what the split of CapEx is and MRO. But I referenced before that in oil and gas and mining, we've now seen three or four quarters of relatively flat sales. And I think that is a reflection of relatively stable MRO spending, small project spending, and then also investment in productivity improvement projects as opposed to new capacity. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: To add to that, I don't think we've seen anything to indicate a change in MRO spending in auto. What we are seeing is in that vertical particularly high uptake of some of the new value that we talk about with the connected enterprise. So adding information solutions that sit up on top of the basic control system, we're seeing really around the world a fairly rapid adoption of those additional sources of productivity. Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: And it's one of the things we'll talk about a little bit more on Thursday. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Please go ahead. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, just in terms of this product uptick you've seen in the last couple quarters, a lot of other companies are talking about the uncertainty weighing on spending out there and also the election obviously not helping. What are you hearing from customers? You're seeing these encouraging trends in products, which makes sense in some sense, but don't really foot with this uncertainty weight that other people are talking about. So maybe just a little more color on what customers are telling you. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: I think there's stability in terms of some of the key industries. And remember, those product sales do get impacted by heavy industries as well as the consumer industries. But there's more optimism really on the consumer side, and we see the impact of new products as well having some benefit for us. So the new product releases, we've been talking about the investment for the last couple years. And we did see in 2016 and continuing into 2017 some important new products that are now available on the market. Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: It's hard for us to comment on what other companies are saying because geographic exposures and industry exposures are somewhat different. But we have seen a couple of encouraging quarters of sequential growth, particularly in the Product businesses. Obviously, it's been better in auto and consumer than it has been in heavy industry. I'd say what we have reflected in guidance is consistent with what we're hearing from customers about their capital spending plans. As far as the election goes, we haven't talked to many people who are happy about the election, but I also haven't talked to many customers who are saying they're holding back spending specifically for that reason. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. And then within the oil and gas, I know your visibility is not always perfect if it's is going through distribution and things. But is there any difference within your products that you're selling to oil and gas? It seems like part of that market has stabilized and maybe even turned and other parts haven't. Are you seeing anything you can glean from the mix of what you're selling into that market in terms of what's improving and what's not? Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: No, I can't think of any significant mix change in the Product or Solutions set that we're selling into oil and gas. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Just to recap, our primary exposure is upstream and some in midstream, less in terms of control and downstream, although we do sell our intelligent motor control offerings as well as our process safety offerings in downstream, but we're not seeing any significant change in the mix. Again, we took some steps to increase our domain expertise, which impacts oil and gas primarily upstream and midstream. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning, Jeff. Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Good morning, two questions, one on just Q1, if you could give us a little help, and then a strategic one after that. But not to put too fine a point on Q1, I'm sure you don't want to get into quarterly guidance. But given what you said about backlogs and book-to-bill, do you expect Q1 organic revenue growth to be in your annual growth band of zero to 4%? And I'm also just wondering, if you could, Ted, tell us what is the tax rate you're using in Q1. Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: So let me go to your first question about the growth rates. I don't think we're going to see year-over-year growth probably until Q2, and at best I think Q1 will be at the low end of the guidance growth range. Since we don't do quarterly guidance, I'm not going to do a Q1 tax rate, but the Q1 tax rate will be below the average for the full year. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then perhaps for Blake, but either who wants to take it, the acquisition of Maverick raised my eyebrows a little bit, the biggest independent systems integrator. It seems to rub a little bit against the grain of the Rockwell us-and-our-friends type approach to the market and maybe creates a channel conflict. Could you address that and how you view that, and does it actually reflect some fundamental change in your thinking? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: It does not reflect a fundamental change in our thinking. We remain committed to strong support of our systems integrators and solutions providers. We've had really a dual approach to the market, particularly in process, for a long time now, in that for some industries and applications and even some specific customers, they do expect the manufacturer of the control equipment to have the domain expertise to be able to most efficiently apply that technology. But we recognize and remain committed to strong support of independent engineering firms for integrating those products as well. Particularly in the process space, there's not as much of an integrator footprint in the U.S. or around the world. On balance, the integrators are typically a little more focused on discrete applications, but in no way does this signify a rollup of our integrators either in process applications or in general. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : All right, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, thank you. Firstly, I just wanted to ask around the trends you saw monthly, if there was any notable difference since the end of the June in any region or end market, or whether the trends you saw on orders and sales were pretty steady in the last four months. Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: So, Julian, generally, conditions improved as we moved through the quarter, but that's pretty typical for any quarter for us and particularly so for Q4. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: And October is consistent with our guidance as well. Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Right. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Understood, thank you. And then secondly, I guess, China, you had a very good return to growth. That echoed what some of your peers have talked about last week. I just wondered if you could give us any color around which end markets drove that pickup and how you think about the sustainability of that growth, as your numbers in China have been very volatile in the last few years. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: A lot's been said about the growth of the consumer vertical in China, and we continue to see that and automotive as the engines of our growth there. And I mentioned before about around the world customers in addition to the basic control systems that they're adding or upgrading, adding the additional information solutions on top in their overall platform. And we're seeing particularly high adoption in China, and specifically in consumer verticals like Life Sciences as well as in the automotive industry. And in fact, the adoption rate is probably higher than in any other place in the world, as those manufacturers, including indigenous manufacturers, are trying to move more rapidly up the productivity curve than other economies did in the past. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. So it's more of I guess the structural element is overcoming any short-term cyclical weakness? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yes, I think what we're seeing is the long-term trends towards a consumer industry to support the growing middle class playing out in China. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes, good morning, Blake, Ted, Patrick. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Just two questions, one around auto, a very good quarter. And is there any way to just dissect maybe the growth rate by the conventional maybe paint content and spend level versus the share gains on the powertrain side? And I guess where I'm going with the question is how much room do we have to run with the share gains? We're not peak shipments or anything there on the share gains, do we, relative to the capital investment going into Mexico? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: There's plenty of room to run on these share gains. And so I don't know that we can break down specifically the percentage of growth. We've talked about a $20 million incremental opportunity in powertrain on a yearly basis. But we think it's fairly balanced in terms of our ability to grow share due to powertrain as well as capitalizing on model changes and identified programs around the world. Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Rick, the other thing, I think Patrick mentioned 10% growth in automotive in the quarter. I wouldn't get overly excited about the 10% in the quarter. It tends to be a project-related business for us. There's some lumpiness in project timing, and so we were really pleased with the results in the quarter. I would say what we're more pleased with is full-year growth in automotive in 2016, and so don't draw too big of a conclusion on one quarter's results. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, I understand. And just as a follow-up, given the Solutions book-to-bill at 0.92, that's reasonably typical. And I think, Ted, you made the comment that the second half growth in the Solutions business would be better than the first half. But is the first half for the CP&S in total and Solutions, is it still likely to be a negative number? Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yes. I think in the first half of the year, we will have modestly negative growth rates in Solutions & Services businesses probably. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And then averaging into the full year, does CP&S show growth if the midpoint 2% becomes a reality, the CP&S growth? Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: At the 2% midpoint, I think CP&S will show some growth, but it will likely be below the average, and A&S we would expect to be a little above the average. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Understood, okay. All right, thank you and nice quarter. Thank you. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning, guys. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning. A lot of your big process customers have started to generate cash again; at least they're getting their act together a bit. You've gotten flattish revenue from heavy industries. But can you talk about the potential for an uptick in large project activity? Have customers given any indication to you on when you could see larger heavy industry projects, particularly in mining go-forward again and when you could see more orders? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: We're seeing activity, but it's a little hard to say when money will actually be released for those projects because what we've seen in the past is during periods where capital expansion is lower, then the engineers are busy getting ready for future projects, and they have the time to do that as opposed to keeping \u2013 running at very high levels of output. We've seen some evidence that there's a little more productivity spending in mining in Latin America, but no signs of a major uptick in capital expenditures. And just to be clear, what we look at as a big project, it's not all that big. We're not playing in the mega-projects more than to be providing the capacity specifically related to controls as well as productivity on brownfields. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, that's helpful. And then you saw a pretty big swing in EMEA, with growth turning negative after mid-single-digit positive last quarter. We did see a slowdown from some of our other industrial companies in Europe, but you mentioned that you saw mid-single-digit organic order growth in the quarter. So it seems \u2013 you'd think that the sales weakness in EMEA is maybe more temporary, more a hiccup than anything else. Can you give us more color on what you're seeing there in Europe? And the visibility, I think you mentioned relatively flattish for 2017, but maybe you can talk a little bit more about that. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: We do think a lot of that is variability. We think that the optimism that we've seen \u2013 I was in Europe last month with our employees and some customers as well. I think we're continuing to see the impact, particularly in the consumer applications of some of our new product releases. They're making a difference. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Blake, is the Middle East holding you back at all? Is it weaker than the rest of Europe? Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: I would say the only change we have seen in the Middle East is there has been some pullback in infrastructure investment. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, good morning, all, just two questions for me. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning, Rich. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : For fiscal 2017 automotive and consumer, what's the underlying assumption for the growth rates for those particular verticals? Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Without getting overly specific, I think you ought to think of it as we expect both the company average growth in automotive and consumer and below the company average growth in heavy industry, and with heavy industry relatively flat, maybe even slightly down. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Auto and consumer we're looking at up mid-single-digits globally for 2017. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, all right. And then just a follow-on to an earlier comment, Blake, around China, you talked about information solutions and there's more adoption of the product over there seemingly, rather, versus the developed markets. I'm just curious. What do you think is driving that? What do you think the hindrances are right now around developed market adoption, Europe, North America specifically, around the information solutions and software product? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: When I talked to customers in China over the last couple of years, I've been told by some of them that what took the Western economies and the U.S. 40 or 50 years to work to high levels of productivity, they want to do in much less time. And I think a lot of those customers are committed to and with the encouragement of the government to more rapidly adopt additional sources of productivity. So it's certainly about the base automation. But when you look at initiatives like China Manufacturing 2025, those are really good fits with what we talk about with the connected enterprise vision. And in fact, just again there in August, having joint presentations for indigenous customers about the linkage of the connected enterprise with the China Manufacturing 2025 initiative, particularly around those information solutions, the addition of MES software, higher-value services to complement the products and the software, those ideas resonate with the customers. And beyond that, there's a growing number of them that can talk about how it actually achieved the business outcomes that they were looking for. And we'll talk about some of those on Thursday, but it's real and it's having an impact on their overall competitiveness. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Do you think there's going to be much more of a lag or resonance in the developed markets, Blake? I know you'll probably talk about this later in the week. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: It's the pilot concept. And for each customer, it's an individual journey, so they're picking up these concepts at a different state of readiness. Some of them already have the smart products installed. Others it's just getting the basic communication infrastructure in to create the plumbing, if you will, for the data that's turned into information. But we're seeing that pull that I mentioned before bringing us into those pilots. It's highly iterative. There's not a set playbook for the industries. Each customer is looking for a partner to work through this with them, and that's why it's taking a while. But we do see the adoption and the momentum building. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. See you next week \u2013 later in the week. Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: See you soon. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Ashay Gupta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Ashay on for Joe Ritchie, just one quick question for me. Can you remind us where pricing ended up for 2016 and what your underlying assumption is in the FY 2017 guidance? Thank you. Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yes, so for 2016, pricing was a little less than a point, and basically we're expecting a similar result in 2017. Ashay Gupta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeremie Capron from CLSA. Please go ahead. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Thanks and good morning, everyone. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Congratulations on the three acquisitions. It's good to see capital going to acquisitions, and I think you've had a pretty good 2016 in that respect. And from your prepared remarks, it sounded like you may be seeing other acquisition opportunities in this new fiscal year. Ted, you talked about lower share repurchase in fiscal 2017 depending on acquisition spend. So, I'm wondering if you could help us understand what you're seeing out there. Now that you own Maverick, there may not be a large opportunity \u2013 or as large opportunities on the system integration side. And, Blake, if you could comment on your willingness to maybe do somewhat bigger deals. There's a number of attractive segments of the industrial automation industry that you're maybe not participating in today. So I'm trying to understand your appetite there. Thanks. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Sure, I will be talking some more specifically about the role of these acquisitions and others on Thursday. But briefly, we remain primarily an organic growth company. There's no better way for us to spur our growth in performance than growth in our core platforms. That being said, the pace of the technology and the demands of customers that they have on their automation and information partners for credibility and an understanding of their best opportunities for productivity do put a little additional emphasis on acquiring and partnering for new technology and domain expertise. So it's more about the accelerated pace of the technology that may spur a little bit more activity on the acquisition side. But again, our priorities remain first, organic growth, and then in terms of capital acquisitions, followed by dividend and share repurchase. So I don't want to signal \u2013 I'm not signaling an interest in going after something big. We're not constrained. But our first priority is when we do consider acquisitions are how do they accelerate our existing strategy? How do they bring us technology, innovation? How do they increase our domain expertise? How do they increase our market access? And so the best acquisitions address one or more of those areas, and then we look secondarily about their impact on some portion of our financial structure. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Thanks, and a pleasant surprise from Asia-Pacific. This quarter you talked about improving trends in China. I know you've made some changes there in terms of senior leadership in recent quarters. I wonder if you could talk about your strategy in China and any changes there in terms of your approach to distribution. It sounds like you're doing well with machine builders. You're seeing a nice take-up of your information solutions there. Maybe give us more color on your approach to distribution. Thanks very much. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Sure. We remain committed to limited market-making distribution around the world, and we have seen some optimism coming from our distributors and from our salespeople who are working with distributors. We also see the need to increase our own capabilities, particularly when we're having these more unstructured discussions about the connected enterprise. So we can't depend entirely on our distributors to make that market for us. And so we're investing in people who have skills in that area and have the expertise in the applications and the technology for driving that additional productivity. And we're looking at partners as well. Engineering companies, when they see the value of working with us, they can be a very credible source of information and value-add for those customers as well. So it's a broad approach. It remains one that includes distribution at its core, but it also includes developing our own capabilities as well as developing deeper relationships with key engineering firms. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Thanks very much and good luck, guys. Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Operator, we'll take one more question. Operator : Our final question today comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten from Longbow. Please go ahead. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : Good morning, everyone. Thank you. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : One clarification, you said the tax rate would be 24% with a benefit in the first quarter. Are we headed back towards mid-20s? And when you get past 2018, are we going to normalize the tax rate? Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Eli, I think we've talked about this in the past. If you ask what I think more a long-term base tax rate is for us, I think it's more like in the 26% to 27% range. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : Okay, thanks for doing that. And as we looked at the businesses, you talk about mining getting better. You have a very small exposure to coal I believe, but there's no exposure going up with any of the bankruptcies. And there's basically, with the coal market still in shambles, that it shouldn't have much of an effect in 2017, and with the auto business up by itself ex the powertrain business in 2017. Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: We're talking about a $20 million opportunity in powertrain for us annually. If you think about our automotive business as being ballpark, $600 million \u2013 $650 million of our total sales, you can do the math yourself. Without powertrain, there would be significantly lower growth. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: And going back to your first question about coal, you're right. Our exposure to coal is fairly low. It was a little bit more in China, but I would say it's decreased quite a bit over the last couple of years, and we don't expect additional exposure to coal in the U.S. or elsewhere. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : All right, thank you very much. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Okay, that concludes today's call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : This indeed does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I need to remind everyone that today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. Later in the call, we will open up the line for questions. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Patrick Goris, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Goris, please go ahead. Patrick Goris : Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation\u2019s First Quarter Fiscal \u201817 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today are Blake Moret, our President and CEO; and Ted Crandall, CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that website for replay for the next 30 days. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. So with that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks, Patrick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I\u2019ll start with some key points for the quarter so please turn to page three in the slide deck. We had a good start to fiscal 2017. Organic growth was 4% better than we expected. Our largest market, the U.S., returned to growth and we saw double-digit growth in emerging markets. Globally, consumer and transportation were our strongest verticals. Oil and gas and mining remained our weakest verticals but have now been stable sequentially for several quarters. While the quarter was better than we expected, we believe we may have seen a somewhat higher than normal budget flush at the end of the quarter primarily in the U.S. and we did see some larger projects hit in Q1 that we expected later in the year. From a regional perspective, as I mentioned, U.S. returned to organic growth earlier than we expected. Strong growth in consumer and automotive was partially offset by weakness in heavy industries including oil and gas and mining. As expected, EMEA started the year slowly and was down about 2% year-over-year. However, orders were up year-over-year and we expect sales growth for the balance of the in this region. Our performance in Asia was better than we expected, with strong in the consumer and transportation verticals. We saw growth across all countries in this region including China where we saw double-digit growth. And in Latin America, growth was driven by Mexico and Brazil. A couple of additional comments about the quarter. Our recent acquisitions performed well and contributed almost 2% to sales growth. Our process business improved and was about flat year-over-year organically. Including our recent Maverick acquisition, process was up high single digits. Architecture & Software had a very strong quarter with almost 8% organic growth. Within this segment, Logix was also up 8% compared to last year. I\u2019m also pleased with over 21% segment margin in the quarter. Ted will elaborate more in Q1 financial performance in his remarks. Let\u2019s move on to our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2017. The macro outlook remains consistent with our assumptions earlier in the fiscal year which - continued growth in the consumer and transportation verticals. Oil and commodity prices have been stable or inched up and our business in these markets has been relatively flat now for few quarters. We expect every industry to be about flat year-over-year. Recent projections continue to call for improving GDP and industrial production growth rates as well as higher levels of local capital expenditures. Taking the macro outlook and our strong first quarter into consideration, we now expect fiscal 2017 organic sales to be up about 3% year-over-year. Including the impact of acquisitions and a larger headwind from currency, we continue to project fiscal 2017 sales of little over $6 billion and revising the adjusted EPS guidance range to $5.95 to $6.35. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks. Before I turn it over to Ted, let me add a few comments. A couple of months ago we hosted many of you at our annual Automation Fair in Atlanta. Once again it was a resounding success as thousands of customers and partners attended and learned about our latest technology innovations and capabilities. We\u2019ve heard that our customer testimonials resonated with many of you and provided powerful examples of how we partner with our customers and help them become more globally competitive. Strong underlying demand for our products enables us to accelerate investments this year in core technologies and domain expertise and to expand in new value, we\u2019re providing information solutions and connected services. Together, these will further enhance our ability to bring the connected enterprise to light and profitably grow share at customers globally. And the powerful indicator that our integration is creating value for customers is the recognition we are receiving. Control magazine, a leading process industry publication recently released its 2017 Readers\u2019 Choice Awards. Our results looked great as we again won both first place awards than any other company. Now, as we get ready to hear from Ted, I want say a few words about him. As you probably all know by now, this is Ted\u2019s last earnings call in the CFO role but I\u2019m very happy to be able to continue to leverage his well recognized experience and understanding of our connected enterprise strategy in the CP&S segment leadership role. I\u2019m also very pleased to welcome Patrick to my senior leadership team. With his proven leadership and extensive experience, I\u2019m confident he will move seamlessly into his new role as CFO. The leadership changes are the result of a thoughtful and long-term leadership succession plan that maximizes the contribution of our experienced leaders while ensuring the continuous addition of new talent and prospective for our company, customers, partners and investors. On a personal note, Ted has helped immensely with my own transition. I believe we have a great management team in place. With that, Ted. Ted Crandall : Thank you, Blake and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll start my comments on page four which is the first quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were $1,490 million, an increase of 4.5% compared to Q1 last year. Sales increased 3.8% on an organic basis. Acquisitions contributed 1.8% to growth and currency translations reduced sales in the quarter by 1.1%. Segment operating margin was 21.2%, 50 basis points higher than Q1 last year and primarily due to higher sales and lower spending and despite the restoration of incentive compensation that we talked about in the November guidance. Spending was a bit light in the first quarter and you should expect spending to increase as we proceed into the balance of the year. The margin result also reflected a good productivity result in Q1 including savings from our restructuring actions in Q4 last year. General corporate net expense was $15 million compared to $18 million a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.75, an increase of $0.26 or 17% compared to the first quarter of last year. The increase is due to the combination of higher sales, improved margins and a lower tax rate. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.1% compared to 22.8% in Q1 last year. As expected, the adjusted effective rate in Q1 included a significant benefit from discreet tax items. We talked about this benefit when we provided guidance in November. A relatively small part of the discrete tax benefit was due to our adoption of the new accounting standard regarding equity based compensation. Free cash flow for Q1 was $271 million, free cash flow conversion on adjusted income was 119%. Our trailing four quarter return on invested capital was 34.6%. And a couple of other items, average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were $129.7 million, down about 2% compared to last year and during the first quarter, we repurchased almost 650,000 shares at a cost of about $81 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $864 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. The next two slides present the sales and operating margin performance of each segment. Page five is the Architecture & Software segment. Beginning on the left side of this page, Architecture & Software segment sales were $696 million in Q1, up 8.3% compared to Q1 last year. The organic sales increase was 7.6%, currency translation reduced sales by 1% and acquisitions contributed 1.7% to sales growth. Moving to the right side of the chart, A&S margins were 30%, up 2.6 points compared to prior year and primarily due to the operating leverage associated with higher sales coupled with lower spending. Moving to page six, the Control Products & Solutions segment. In the first quarter, Control Products & Solutions sales were $794 million, up 1.3% year-over-year. Organic sales increased 0.7%, currency translation reduced sales by 1.3% and acquisitions contributed 1.9% to growth. In the CP&S product businesses, the organic sales increase was about 3%, solutions and services sales were down about 1% organically. The book-to-bill in Q1 for solutions and services was 1.11. CP&S operating margin was 13.6% in Q1, down 1.7 points year-over-year, the biggest factor being higher incentive compensation costs. Moving to page seven, this provides a breakdown of our sales and shows the year-over-year organic growth results for the quarter. Blake covered much of this in his remarks, I\u2019ll add just a couple of comments. The organic sales growth in Q1 was driven primarily by Asia-Pacific and North America. Asia-Pacific was up 20% year-over-year with China and India each up mid-teens. We experienced strong growth in both product and solutions and services businesses in the region. The strong growth in Asia-Pacific was admittedly off[ph] relatively easy comparisons and as Blake mentioned, sales performance benefited from some favorable timing on larger projects that we thought would hit later in the year. Overall for the company, organic growth for emerging markets was 11% this quarter. And that takes us to the guidance slide. As Blake mentioned, we\u2019re making some changes, primarily based on the better than expected sales performance in Q1, we\u2019re increasing our expectations for organic growth by one point across the range to a midpoint for organic growth of 3% for the full year compared to the previous 2% and the new range of 1% to 5% organic growth. The better than expected organic growth in Q1 accounts for most of the increase the organic growth guidance for the full year, though our outlook for sales for the balance of the year remains reasonably constant with our November guidance. Based on recent currency rates, we now expect the larger headwind from currency translation, the headwind increasing from about 0.5 point to a little less than 2 points. We still expect total sales to be a little over $6 billion with the additional currency headwind offsetting the higher organic growth. Our previous margin guidance was about 20%. In November I said may be that would be a little lower than 20%. Now we think maybe it\u2019s a little higher than 20%. Previously, we expected a full year adjusted tax rate of 24%, we now expect that to be closer to 23.5% and basically that reflects a somewhat higher discrete tax benefit in Q1 than we previously thought. We\u2019re revising adjusted EPS guidance from the previous range of $5.85 to $6.25 to a new range of $5.95 to $6.35 and the midpoint increases from $6.05 to $6.15. For the full year, we expect free cash flow conversions to be above 100% of adjusted income. A couple of items not shown here, we now expect general corporate net expense to be approximately $70 million for the full year. Also, we now expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 129.5 million, that\u2019s about 1.5 million shares higher than the November guidance. We continue to expect to spend about $400 million on repurchases this year but the share prices increased. Before I turn it over to Patrick to begin our Q&A session, as Blake noted, this will be my final earnings call as CFO. I\u2019d just like to say that it has been an honor to be the Chief Financial Officer at Rockwell Automation. As you can imagine, it\u2019s a lot easier job when you\u2019re representing a great company with such great culture and such great people. I\u2019m really pleased to have Patrick Goris succeed me as CFO. Most of you have gotten to known him over the past few years in his industrial relations role. He has a great breadth of financial management experience across our different businesses and functions. He\u2019s very well prepared for this and I know he\u2019s going to do a great job. I\u2019ve really enjoyed the CFO role in the past 10 years. Part of that was the opportunity to interact with all of you, the analysts and the investors. I learned a lot from your questions, the challenges and sometimes your different views on the industry and the company. I\u2019m excited to be moving back to an operating role where I think I can make a different contribution [indiscernible]. I won\u2019t be interacting with this group as often going forward, but if not before then, I look forward to seeing many of you at the next Automation Fair. And since this is my last earnings call, I expect you all to take it easy on me in Q&A. So thank you and over to you, Patrick. Patrick Goris : Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. As usual, Blake and Ted will handle the Q&A today. Thank you. Operator, let\u2019s take our first question. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. And first today is Scott Davis from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Good morning guys and Ted, we\u2019re going to miss you but I must say on behalf of shareholders, we\u2019re happy you\u2019re not retiring and at least Rockwell\u2019s not losing you altogether. So thankfully you\u2019re staying on board so best of luck to you. It\u2019s been a pleasure. Ted Crandall : Thank you. Scott Davis : And I know Patrick will do a great job, but anyway, I\u2019m intrigued by your comment about capital spending I mean when I think about the world, people struggle with the concept of new capacity just given how limited growth is out there. But what are people spending money on I mean if you could generalize? Are we going back into the existing factory stock and upgrading? Is it the supply chain? Is it distribution? I mean what\u2019s your sense of - if capital spending is coming back, what people actually are spending money on? Blake Moret : I think it\u2019s primarily around increased productivity and as we\u2019ve seen a lot of people implement the first waves of productivity in terms of just basic automation replacing hardwire control, the next wave in many cases involves the integration of that basic control and information. So taking advantage of the basic data that\u2019s part of their production processes and integrating the information software and the analytics so that operators could make better decisions about the manufacturing processes. Ted Crandall : Scott, I think too in this quarter from a vertical perspective, the acceleration we saw was largely in consumer and transportation. Scott Davis : Okay. And just Ted, you commented on spending will go up as Rockwell going through a \u2013 compensation, accruals and stuff like that. But what explicitly do you feel like you need to spend money on? Is it few capacity on your own? Have you been under-investing at all, just give us a little color on that. Ted Crandall : Yeah I mean I think the spending is more. It\u2019s not so much about capacity and supply chain. The spending is going to be more about R&D and commercial expenses and very much targeted some of the new opportunities we have related to connective enterprise. Scott Davis : Okay. I\u2019ll pass it on. you guys have done a great job and it\u2019s been a pleasure, so good luck to you Ted. Ted Crandall : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Inch from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. John Inch : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Ted Crandall : Good morning, John. John Inch : Good morning, Ted. Patrick, congratulations. So first question China up mid-teens that has been running down. China has sort of been this tail for Rockwell kind of two halves right? The consumer piece up there very strongly and then the heavy industry piece down a lot. What happened in China in the quarter? Did the consumer get even stronger or did heavy industry revert? You talked about some \u2013 could you just provide a little more color please? And is it sustainable really? Ted Crandall : And the first thing I would say is we mentioned that there were some pool-ins, we think there were some pool-ins of jobs we expected to hit later in the year, that was true in Asia generally, but particularly in China. I would say the vertical profile that we experienced most of last year which was strength particularly in consumer to a lesser extent in transportation and weakness in heavy industry, that continued but we had particularly strong quarter entire in China. Heavy industry was better although still weaker and I don\u2019t think -- we do not expect China to be 15% growth for the full year. We still think for the full year an expectation of something in the mid-single digits is appropriate. John Inch : So it sounds like Ted, based on your commentary, this is may be more Rockwell specific rebound versus a China market rebound? I mean \u2013 talked up China, some other companies have talked up Parker sort of talked about China rebound a little bit and some of the heavier stuff. Are you suggesting that this is a pull-forward initiatives you were working on, I mean how much is Rockwell versus how much you think is sort of market in the fourth quarter for China? Ted Crandall : I\u2019m not sure I know exactly how to quantify that, but my guess would be may be half of the growth in the quarter was kind of pool-ins and unique to Rockwell projects. And the other half was kind of underlying market. Blake Moret : Strong parts of the China market are playing to our strengths. John Inch : Yeah, absolutely. Makes sense. Can we then, just as my follow up, can you please talk about your export versus import position? We know kind of had a very sort of high level what your situation is in Mexico. Obviously we\u2019re going to wait to see sort of what Trump does, but could you just talk about sort of - again export versus import position in United States? And then your own thoughts toward repurposing perhaps some of the production say in Monterrey or whatever, back to the U.S. or alternative sourcing, anything you could add at this point would be helpful. Thank you. Ted Crandall : Yeah, so may be just to start with little context. We\u2019re a U.S. based company, but we serve a global customer sect and our global supply chain has been constructed to serve those customers all around the world. Today, we are a net importer into the U.S., but I think it\u2019s very important to note that we\u2019ve got flexibility in our global supply chain and we believe we could make adjustments if there were changes in the tax law that made that appropriate. John Inch : That\u2019s it? Ted Crandall : Yes. John Inch : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi guys. This is Dan on for Steve. Just wondering if you can give us some color on how the quarter looks from a monthly perspective? Did they get better as you moved along? And then how has January started off? Are you seeing kind of a similar environment or a step up or down in activity? Ted Crandall : Dan, I would say that the quarter played out in a pretty typical fashion which is it started a little bit slower and then picked up as we moved through the quarter. I would say may be the only unusual thing in the quarter was, a last couple of weeks in December were stronger than normal and it\u2019s the reason that we think there might have been a little bit of budget flush particularly in North America. January has started off slowly as a typical January, but things have picked up a little bit as the month is going on. Unidentified Analyst : Great. And then just as a quick follow up, what was auto for you guys in the quarter, I guess both globally and do you have any color on strength by region? Ted Crandall : So auto was up over 10% in the quarter. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thanks, guys. Operator : Next we have Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Yes, thanks. Good morning guys. Nice strong quarter. You mentioned some budget flush between North America, what do you think caused that? Why would we have seen that budget flush in December? And on top of that, what do we see in your channel inventories specifically within North America? Ted Crandall : So Nigel I\u2019m not sure I know I don\u2019t know that we know what caused the budget flush. We heard that comment from several of our distributors and we also observed that there was a little bit higher than normal order rate in those last couple of weeks in December, that\u2019s why we\u2019re speculating that there may have been some higher than normal budget flush. In terms of distributor inventories, particularly in North America, we have very good visibility on that and distributor inventories were up slightly from September. Nigel Coe : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then on the segment margin guidance for FY17, didn\u2019t change obviously there\u2019s a squiggle in front of the number, but you\u2019ve given the higher organic growth and given the strong incremental margins in A&S, would have expected to see a slightly better or slightly higher segment margins guidance. Is there any change in the way you\u2019re planning the year between CPS and A&S or are there some offsets in FX and/or comps that we should consider? Ted Crandall : I think it\u2019s more about the latter. I mean basically we\u2019ve got more currency headwind now, top-line and bottom-line as a consequence of what\u2019s happened with exchange rate. There were also the higher spending in the latter half of the year, some of that is just a ketchup from under-spending in Q1, but we also believe we\u2019re going to spend a little bit more in total for the year now consistent with higher organic growth. And then incentive comp will also be higher as a consequence of higher organic growth and higher EPS. Nigel Coe : Okay, that\u2019s clear. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Shannon O\u2019Callaghan from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Good morning guys. Ted Crandall : Good morning. Blake Moret : Good morning. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Congratulations Ted and Patrick, Ted glad -- to be around we\u2019ll see you at Automation Fair. Relative to that, the last few Automation Fairs at least the last couple, it seems like Blake you\u2019ve had a lot of these productivity solutions that you\u2019re talking about you\u2019ve offered customers, but may be adoption wasn\u2019t great because there wasn\u2019t a lot of business confidence out there. I mean have you heard in the last couple of months a change in tone from your customers, has there been sort of better follow-on to Automation Fair than we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years in terms of people\u2019s willingness to adopt these sort of productivity related solutions that you\u2019re offering. Blake Moret : Yeah, the progress is still relatively slow and of course, customers are in different stages in their journey as they begin to adopt some of our new solutions. But it starts with having the foundation placed with smart products. And so we do think that customers are getting that message as they know they have to have the data at the foundation of their manufacturing process to be able to do something with it. The pilot projects that we\u2019ve been running, I think have become a little more formalized over the last few months, we\u2019re getting better at it. Our customers are understanding the process and so we have a large number of engagements that are just moving through the pipeline and we\u2019re happy with that progress and some of the increased spending is going to acceleration of those activities. Ted Crandall : Shannon I also think when we debriefed our sales organization this quarter, we did hear kind of a more positive sentiment both from our own sales people and from the channel that would have been the case six months ago. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Okay, great. Thanks. And then on the oil and gas piece, given kind of the upstream waiting of your business and things, I mean almost think you\u2019re starting to see a little bit more improvement there than you need to be indicating. Any change in activity that you\u2019re seeing there or when would you expect I know you\u2019re kind of still assuming it\u2019s flattish, but anything on the margin that you\u2019re seeing improving there? Any reason that you wouldn\u2019t expect your business to kind of turn with an improvement in some of the U.S. upstream activity? Ted Crandall : After the last two years, what we\u2019ve experienced the last couple quarters is getting close to flat year-over-year, that feels pretty good actually. We do think there\u2019s potential for some improvement as we move through this year, but for the full year, we still think it\u2019s going to be close to flat. Blake Moret : The sentiment in heavy industries in general is a little bit more positive but when that\u2019s actually going to turn into orders and shipments, these are longer term projects. Oil and gas continued strong in Latin America but for the rest of the world, we\u2019re still not seeing that manifest itself in sharply increased orders. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys. Congrats. Ted Crandall : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen and congratulations, Ted and Patrick. Ted Crandall : Hi, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : Just to the A&S business, wondering if you could comment on A&S U.S. performance in the quarter specifically and whether it was different than kind of the modest increase in total U.S. that we saw on a [indiscernible] basis? Ted Crandall : The A&S business in Q1 was pretty similar to the balance of the company in Q1. It was strong growth. Jeffrey Sprague : And the A&S margins Ted, did they not have the incentive comp pressure that CP&S did or it was just overwhelmed by the volume leverage in the mix and therefore it wasn\u2019t apparent? Ted Crandall : You\u2019re exactly right. I mean the year-over-year margin impact of incentive comp was pretty similar in the two segments, with almost 8% organic growth in A&S, it just got us swamped that impact. Jeffrey Sprague : Right. And just wondering if you could step back perhaps just play big picture on automotive - automation obviously there\u2019s a lot going on in Washington D.C. Any auto plan I believe is pretty highly automated these days. But is the, for a lack of a better term, is the Rockwell calorie count likely to be higher in a U.S. automotive plant than it is say in a Mexican automotive plant? And how would you think about that, how would you frame that to us? Blake Moret : So I think that\u2019s a fair assumption that as U.S. manufacturers increase or as manufacturers increase their U.S. footprint, it\u2019s going to be done with a higher relative content of advanced manufacturing. And that\u2019s great for us. We have of course a very large market share particularly in that industry and so anything that encourages increased manufacturing in the U.S. is a good thing for Rockwell automation given our footprint. And that impact on sales is something that has us very optimistic and talking to customers about what additionally we can do to help them as they make those decisions to increase their footprint here in the country. Jeffrey Sprague : Now I know rule of thumbs are dangerous, but if we thought about a typical auto plant that maybe it\u2019s 200,000 or 300,000 units plant, can you give us some idea of what you think the revenue upside in the U.S. versus some other market might be kind of a percentage terms or index or whatever kind of framework you might want to give us? Blake Moret : I think it depends on a lot of factors of course and in terms of when that plays out for us, timing is a big issue, but if you look at some of the numbers that were published for instance with the recent board plan and you can look at the labor differences between what they were going to employ outside of the U.S. versus their expectations for new jobs in the U.S., you can\u2019t apply that linearly to the increased dollar count for Rockwell, but it gives you some idea of an order of magnitude. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Richard Eastman : Yes, good morning and congrats on a nice quarter and good luck Ted and Patrick for that matter. Ted Crandall : Thank you. Richard Eastman : Just very quickly on the CP&S segment margins, Ted could you may be run through that a little bit. I think what\u2019s kind of noticeable here is on the sales growth our incremental or decremental margin here is almost a 100%. And I\u2019m curious, I realized Maverick comes in a lower margin, but is that business losing money? And then also, if not, is the margin on the core CP&S business is that lower than historic norms? Ted Crandall : Well, so couple of things, first Maverick will not lose money, so we\u2019re not expecting in the first year for both purchase accounting and integration cost that we\u2019ll get a significant profit contribution from those sales. On the CP&S core, I don\u2019t think I would say this performance was significantly worse than historic results, but I would say if we\u2019re going to have some margin pressure in this business compared to last year, I mean we had a particularly good margin performance last year, that included some higher margin project business that isn\u2019t going to repeat this year. And as we progress through the year with downturns and heavy industry and the pressure, we\u2019ve got some lower margin projects in the backlog they\u2019re going to work their way out this year as a consequence of some more aggressive pricing. So we\u2019re going to have some margin pressure in that business this year. I think that our full year margins will be a little bit lower than last year, but I don\u2019t expect them to get worse as we proceed through the year compared to the first quarter. Richard Eastman : Thank you. And just a follow up question, Blake you had noted in the press release this issue of investing a bit more in the business given the fast start on the core growth. Could you may be just define that in terms of dollars Ted, pre-tax, I mean are we talking about $0.05 or $0.10 per share and hence again the full year outlook \u2013 adjusted EPS outlook may be only going up a dime we\u2019ve got negative currency there and is there another 5% to 10% -- $0.05 to $0.10 of incremental investments? Ted Crandall : See may be think about it this way, there\u2019s probably about $10 million that we under-spent in Q1 that we\u2019re going to catch up on now in the balance of the year and compared to our previous guidance, there\u2019s another incremental $10 million that we now expect to spend. Richard Eastman : Okay. Okay, very good and good luck again. Thank you. Ted Crandall : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andrew Obin : Yes, good morning. Ted Crandall : Good morning. Andrew Obin : Congratulations Ted and Patrick. Patrick Goris : Thank you, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just a question, as we look at software sales at Rockwell and specifically software excluding embedded software. Could you share what kind of growth you are seeing in the channel and what are the trends, what are the customers asking for? Blake Moret : So if we look at the information solutions then we\u2019re seeing double digit growth in that area. So this is the MES solutions, this is the modular software, this is where our new analytic offerings would be. And so, that\u2019s part of the information solutions and connected services which we\u2019re expecting double digit growth in. Andrew Obin : And when you say double-digit, is it low-teens, high-teens, just sort of ballpark? Ted Crandall : I think you can think of that for this year it\u2019s kind of low-to-mid teens Andrew Obin : Thank you. And just to follow up on Jeff\u2019s question on what -- can you give us some color just general post the election, what kind of conversations are you having with customers, what industries are the most interested in talking to you in putting capacity in North America because you guys probably are the cutting edge of what\u2019s happening on the kind of conversations people are having? Blake Moret : I think a lot of the early conversations are around discrete manufacturing or batch so again, it\u2019s right in our wheelhouse in consumer and transportation. And there\u2019s some obvious things that we can do to help those manufacturers ensure that they have the labor that\u2019s ready to address the advance manufacturing technology, that\u2019s a big issue for manufacturers particularly if they deferred those investments in automation for some time. So we\u2019re well positioned to be able to offer to enable that workforce and then when they need additional sources of labor to augment their own existing workforce, then we have a lot of solutions there. And so we\u2019re actively engaged with those manufacturers to be able to put specific new proposals in place on top of what we already offer them. Andrew Obin : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steven Winoker : Thanks. Good morning and congrats I\u2019ll echo everybody\u2019s comments. So just may be going, covered a lot of ground but going back to your comment that larger projects were pull forward, larger projects at the end of the year were pulled forward in terms of your expectations. Can you maybe expand on that a little bit? I know there\u2019s only a certain level of visibility given the nature of the business, what makes you believe that there\u2019s not something behind that as well and what kind of projects we\u2019re talking about? Ted Crandall : Well I mean the larger projects pulled forward primarily occurred in Asia-Pacific, it was kind of a combination of cross vertical as it affected both transportation and heavy industry, semi-conductor was one of those. Look Steve, if I had to estimate, I would estimate that our organic growth in the first quarter between project pull forwards and potential budget flush, may be 1 point of the organic growth was related to that. And even if you take that out, this was still a better quarter than we expected. Steven Winoker : Okay, okay. And then as we think about your $20 million or so of spending in how things are going to layer in through the year as well as kind of growth. Normally, in terms of seasonality I might start to look at the Q2 being may be a little more challenging, but you have this acceleration and then you have a very strong back half now. Can you may be comment on how you think we should or how we should think about kind of layering into seasonality given the commentary you\u2019ve had? Ted Crandall : Well I think there are two things you ought to think about, one is our normal merit increases occur basically effective January 1st across the company and so sequentially, there will be a step-up in spending probably about $10 million on a sequentially quarterly basis, it\u2019s just a consequence of that merit increase. And then in addition to that, you\u2019ll start to see us ramp what I would call more underlying spending and I think that will ramp as we proceed through the year, so probably a little lower in Q2 and a little bit higher in Q3 and Q4. Steven Winoker : And then but from a growth perspective as well as you\u2019re thinking about that step up in organic growth, is this something you think about kind of natural year-on-year acceleration each quarter from here? Ted Crandall : I think on sales, you\u2019ll see some increase from Q1 but not a lot of sequential growth in Q2, Q3 then you ought to expect kind of a step-up in Q4 which is typical for us on a seasonal basis. Steven Winoker : Great. Helpful. And I guess one more thing Ted, in your response to John\u2019s comments about being a net importer, I think it\u2019s probably we kind of know that you\u2019re a net importer, the question is more about size. We\u2019re talking about low hundreds of millions not something more than that or the possibility\u2026 Ted Crandall : That\u2019s correct. We think we\u2019re probably about $250 million in net importer. Steven Winoker : Okay. Thanks so much. Good luck. Look forward to our next conversation. Bye. Operator : Your next question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Richard Kwas : Hi. Good morning. Congrats, Patrick, Ted. Look forward to working with you in your new capacities. Two questions, quick ones. So, on the change to the organic growth outlook the 100 basis point improvement, how would you segment that between heavy industry may be a little bit better versus automotive and consumer coming in better than expected because I know you put some guidelines out there underpinning the growth act in November and it looks like at least this quarter both of those areas came in better. So how should we think about that? Ted Crandall : Rich, I think it\u2019s fair to think about that increase as primarily transportation and consumer. Richard Kwas : Okay. And then based on what you\u2019re seeing right now on heavy industry flattish which is a little bit better than flat to down, but need to see more evidence of order improvement to get constructive? Ted Crandall : I think that\u2019s fair. I mean I think Blake mentioned earlier, we\u2019re hearing some better things about potential investment in heavy industry, but we\u2019re not seeing it translate into orders yet. Richard Kwas : Okay. And then just a quick one, Ted, on free cash flow there\u2019s a plus sign in that 100%, now seasonally speaking, you did pretty well this quarter on conversion, anything puts and takes what we should think about the balance of the year as we try to model this out? Ted Crandall : The only thing I would remind you of is because there were no incentive compensation earned last year, there was no payout this year either in the first quarter or in the balance of the year. So, that\u2019s going to contribute somewhat to a better conversion on the year. That\u2019s probably the most important thing. Richard Kwas : Okay, great. And then just a quick follow up on auto and consumer, are you still thinking mid-singles for the year growth\u2026? Ted Crandall : Yeah I would say may be now it\u2019s mid-to-high singles. Richard Kwas : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Robert McCarthy : Yeah I\u2019ll echo all the comments Ted and Patrick and I\u2019ll also remind you the importance of comparers and remember Patrick you were a very tough comparer and Ted I think you had a very interesting compare. So anyway, congratulations. Alright, moving over from the ridiculous to the sublime, clearly you talked about the budget flush and the reacceleration and underlying growth and the pace of business. This has been kind of talked about with the several other analysts in the call, but could you just comment across the board how you\u2019re feeling about the front log, are you seeing a change in the pace of business? You talked about the budget flush but could you talk anything about January trends, anything about just kind of the current state of what you\u2019re seeing? And are you seeing a change in the underlying psychology association with business with the change of administrations? Ted Crandall : I think it\u2019s fair to say that there\u2019s a general optimism but front log is flat and it\u2019s still early in the year. Our backlog overall is up a little bit and \u2013 positive signs. Importantly, we\u2019re releasing new products and that has an impact as well, but it\u2019s still early to call this a different trajectory in terms of the outlined months. Robert McCarthy : Okay. And then obviously I think John asked a series of intrigue questions, he may have covered this, but what I would ask is may be just talk about the prospect for cash repatriation, the uses of cash, the M&A environment, how you\u2019re looking at that, that kind of old chestnut Ted Crandall : Yeah, so it\u2019s I think we\u2019re encouraged by some of the things that are being talked about around U.S. corporate tax rate and house proposal that\u2019s been put out there we think addresses a number of important issues that currently created disadvantage for U.S. based companies, a lot of corporate tax rate, territorial tax system, potential to repatriate foreign earnings. We view all of those as positive for Rockwell for U.S. manufacturers and for U.S. economic growth generally. Specifically as it relates to repatriation, what we would repatriate ultimately would depend on the rate -- the tax rate that would apply to that and any conditions that might apply to the repatriation. But we probably currently have about $2 billion that could be repatriated at some point. Those funds if repatriated, could be used for investments in organic growth, they could be used for acquisitions especially U.S. based companies, it could be used for retirement of debt or better funding of our pension plans, or to return to shareowners through dividend repurchases. And once we get a clearer view on what the conditions might be, we\u2019ll be prepared to talk in a little more detail about specifically about how we would use it. Robert McCarthy : Just one follow up with a M&A question, do you think it\u2019s a better environment now for M&A just given the standpoint of perhaps optimism and of reacceleration of the underlying cycle and may be the ability to stomach some valuations in that context? I mean do you think there\u2019s been a change in the psychology around M&A for you at all? Ted Crandall : We haven\u2019t passed on attractive acquisitions in the past for a lack of U.S. cash. We continue to look at acquisitions as opportunities to accelerate what we\u2019re doing in terms of technology, domain expertise to market access. And we\u2019re pleased with the results of our recent acquisition, we\u2019ll talk more about the need to be present in M&A to accelerate our strategy, so I don\u2019t really see it as a significant accelerator to the amount of M&A we would otherwise do. Robert McCarthy : Thanks for your time. Operator : Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is [indiscernible] on for Julian Mitchell. As a follow up for the M&A question, can you just talk about the M&A pipeline right now and touch on any specific end markets or geographic regions that look particularly attractive right now? Ted Crandall : I think if you were to look at where the concentration of our activity is, it\u2019s really in that the new value that come from information solutions and connected services. So in the network space, in the software space it sits up above the real-time control, those are the areas where we\u2019re probably relatively active and it\u2019s spread across the world, it\u2019s not constrained to any one geography. Unidentified Analyst : Understood. And could you just quantify the impact of incentive comp on CP&S margins for the quarter please? Ted Crandall : It was approximately one point. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you very much for your time. Ted Crandall : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning everyone and congratulations, Ted and Patrick. My first question is really on pricing, you guys have done a great job on continuing to get price through this malaise that we\u2019ve been in the last couple of years. Just wondering if we do see this CapEx acceleration, is there an opportunity for you to get greater than point in price or how does that -- how do you guys foresee that? Ted Crandall : Joe, I think what\u2019s reflected in our current guidance is what we talked about in November which we think for the full year price will be little less than a point and similar to what it was last year. If the economy heats up, who knows, I mean maybe pricing could be a little better. Joe Ritchie : Okay. And I guess maybe I guess along those lines, if things were to heat up and just along the lines of your guidance and the higher end of that range getting to 5% growth, what would have to happen for us to get to that higher end of the range? And then if we do get towards the higher end of the range, what kind of incremental would you expect to see across the business because historically they\u2019ve been a lot higher than your gross margins? Ted Crandall : So in answering the first question which is about the top-line, I mean may be the way to think about the higher end of the range is, clearly, we had a better organic growth result in Q2 than we were expecting coming into the year. But basically, we have not changed our balance of the year guidance. So if Q2 is truly kind of a new baseline, and we should expect the same sequential growth we were originally expecting in the November guidance, that\u2019s a way to think about how we would get to the higher end of the range on the top-line. Our conversion now in the new guidance is about 20% which is almost double what it was in our November guidance and that\u2019s the spike the headwinds we talked about November around incentive compensation and pension in particular. So, there will be some better conversion at the higher end than we would see at the low end or midpoint. Joe Ritchie : Okay, fair enough. May be in fact sneak one more in there, going back to the question we had on the repatriation, I guess Ted when you think about bringing in cash back, I mean it feels like today company is a facing a little bit of a conundrum in that, valuations are really high from an M&A perspective, stocks are hitting all-time highs. How do you think about the allocation of capital if you are able to bring back overseas cash? And then, specifically, do you need to invest internally if we do accelerate from a CapEx standpoint? Ted Crandall : One of the things we\u2019ve always talked about is we\u2019re not all that capital intensive as it relates to growth. With immediate deductibility of CapEx, is it possible we might spend more than we originally planned, I think it\u2019s possible but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a very big number particularly compared to the amount of earnings we\u2019ve got sitting overseas. Blake Moret : The bigger impact would be the increased sales for our more capital intensive customers. Joe Ritchie : That makes sense. Thanks guys. Blake Moret : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning guys, Ted and Patrick congratulations. Ted Crandall : Thank you. Andrew Kaplowitz : Solutions and services, they were down 14% last quarter, I think you said down 1% this quarter and you mentioned previously that the business may stay negative in the first half of \u201817 but based on what you\u2019re seeing, you mentioned the strong bookings in the quarter. Is any of the improvement there timing, can it be up now sequentially going forward in that business? Ted Crandall : Well I mean I would love to think that we\u2019re going to start to see some improvement in heavy industries as we proceed through the year. But we haven\u2019t seen that yet and it\u2019s not reflected in the guidance. I mean I think our solutions and services business right now we believe will be about flat year-over-year and any improvement that does start to occur in heavy industry, for a significant part of that business, we really need to see it in Q2 or may be early Q3 in order for that to have an impact on shipments in the year. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay. Thanks for that. And then Blake, you mentioned that you had a slow start in EMEA this year as expected. Last quarter, you talked about strong orders in the region, I think it was up mid-single digits, it didn\u2019t seem like last quarter\u2019s orders translated but you did talk about improving from here. So did you see any actual weakening in any part of EMEA and specifically in the Middle East, how is that region doing? Blake Moret : So for EMEA overall, the orders were actually up, they were up year-over-year and sequentially and we do expect the result for the full year to be growth in EMEA. Ted Crandall : I think the Q1 performance in EMEA was just more about timing of when projects hit, principally in the solutions and services businesses. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay. Thanks guys. Patrick Goris : Operator, we will take one more question. Operator : Our final question today comes from Eli Lustgarten from Longbow Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Eli Lustgarten : Thank you. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions and my congratulations to both of you. Ted Crandall : Thank you. Eli Lustgarten : Just a quick clarification, the shipments that were brought forth in the first quarter, was it all A&S and would it b added in the second quarter or was it spread out over the year? Ted Crandall : So I would say it was primarily advanced into the second quarter and it was not all A&S it was kind of a combination of A&S and CP&S. Eli Lustgarten : Okay. And so, we understand the weakness in margins that we saw in with control solutions business, but A&S had a very strong margin I suspect that with \u2013 brought forth, [indiscernible] and I suspected it to be sustained at that level and expected to be off a little bit\u2026 Ted Crandall : That\u2019s correct, we do not expect A&S margin at 30% for the balance of the year, we expect lower margins for A&S for the balance of the year. Eli Lustgarten : And one final, one of the things we heard from a lot of companies you saw the Trump Bump I guess it\u2019s what referred to these days. But we\u2019re hearing from a lot of companies particularly in the heavy industries, of an almost wait and see for spending they talk a lot wait and see for spending to see what policies really because not much can change in the first half of the year. Are you hearing any of that from your customers, that there\u2019s a lot of talk but more excited about \u201818 spending than \u201817 spending at this point? Blake Moret : I have not heard specifically that people are waiting to \u201818 but I do believe as we are before we make specific changes in any plants, we want to see what actual changes to various elements of tax code or rather incentives might be. So I think that is a fair characterization. Ted Crandall : Eli, maybe it\u2019s a little bit different approach to the answer and this is not intended in any way to be a political commentary, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re hearing anything from investors that would cause us to believe that what we saw as the acceleration in the first quarter is related to upcoming potential tax changes. Eli Lustgarten : Okay. Thank you very much and congratulations to both of you. Patrick Goris : Thank you, Eli. Ted Crandall : Thank you. Patrick Goris : Okay. That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you for attending.",

Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Operator : Good morning. Thank you for holding, and welcome to Rockwell Automation's Quarterly Conference Call. I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. Later in the call, we will open up the lines for questions. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Patrick Goris, Senior Vice President and CFO. Mr. Goris, please go ahead. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's second quarter fiscal 2017 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our President and CEO; Steve Etzel, Vice President of Investor Relations is unable to be with us this morning as he is attending a personal matter. Our results were released earlier this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that website for replay for the next 30 days. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company, and are therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. So with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Patrick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to page 3 in the slide deck. This was a good quarter for us. Organic growth was 7%, which was better than we expected. Growth was broad based across most regions and industries. Globally, transportation was particularly strong. We also saw signs of improvement in certain verticals within heavy industries. Overall, the economic environment has improved. From a regional perspective, our largest market, the U.S., grew over 5%, continuing the trend we saw in Q1. We saw growth in most verticals, led by strong performance in automotive. We also saw growth in some of the heavy industries in this region. As expected, EMEA returned to growth and was up 12% year-over-year. Growth in the region was strong in both developed and emerging markets. OEMs in this region are adopting our latest midrange technology. We then saw double-digit growth in Asia. The transportation in consumer verticals continued to perform well. Heavy industry saw growth, except in oil and gas, where capital spending remained soft. Most countries in the region were up, including China, which again grew double digits. Latin America declined 3%, as growth in Mexico was more than offset by declines in Brazil and the rest of the region. I'll make a few additional comments about the quarter. Our recent acquisitions continued to perform well, and contributed almost 2% of sales growth. Our Process Business improved, and was up 3% year-over-year organically. If you add our recent Maverick acquisition, Process was up double-digits. Architecture & Software had a very strong quarter, with almost 14% organic growth. Within this segment, Logix was up 13% compared to last year. I'm also pleased with double-digit EPS growth in the quarter. Patrick will elaborate on Q2 financial performance in his remarks. Let's move on to our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2017. The macro outlook continues to improve. Recent projections of industrial production growth have been adjusted upward and rates are expected to improve over the course of the year. We expect continued growth in the consumer and transportation verticals. We now expect heavy industries to be slightly up for the year, even with continued softness in oil and gas and mining. Turning to guidance. Taking the macro outlook and our strong first half into consideration, we now expect fiscal 2017 organic sales growth in the range of 4.5% to 7.5%. Including the impact of acquisitions and the smaller headwind from currency, we now project fiscal 2017 sales of approximately $6.25 billion at the midpoint of guidance and are increasing the adjusted EPS guidance range to $6.45 to $6.75. At the midpoint, this guidance represents 11% EPS growth for the year. Patrick will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks. Before I turn it back over to Patrick, let me add a few comments. We're obviously pleased with our results through the first half of fiscal 2017. The Connected Enterprise is gaining traction, and we are increasing the number of pilots across industries, applications and geographies. As we move forward, we will sharpen the focus of our investments to expand the value we provide in the Connected Enterprise. We are confident that our differentiation will continue to fuel attractive returns for our share owners. I also want to highlight two additional accomplishments during the quarter. We are very proud to have received the Ethisphere award for the ninth time, naming us as one of the world's most ethical companies. This recognition is a testament to our strong culture of integrity. We are also proud to have been one of the 2017 Catalyst Award winners. The Catalyst Award honors innovative organizational approaches that address the recruitment, development and advancement of women, and have led to proven measurable results. We are thrilled to receive this recognition from Catalyst for our culture of inclusion journey, demonstrating our commitment to our employees, customers and community. Our people are the foundation of our company's success and we're committed to creating an environment where employees can and want to do their best work every day. Our employees, partners and suppliers continue to make the difference at our customers, the dedication and enthusiasm creates a loyalty that sets us apart. With that, I'll turn it back over to Patrick. Who, as you know, recently joined my senior leadership team as CFO; many of you know Patrick from his former role in Investor Relations. Patrick? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you, Blake and good morning everyone. I'll start on slide 4, second quarter key financial information. As Blake mentioned, we had good sales performance in the quarter, with reported sales up 7.9%, organic growth was 6.8%, acquisitions contributed 1.7%, and currency translation reduced sales by 0.6%. Segment operating margin of 19% was down a bit compared to last year. A margin tailwind from strong organic growth was offset by the restoration of incentive compensation. Given our revised sales and EPS outlook for the full year, our second quarter results also reflect a year-to-date true-up of incentive compensation accruals. And as expected, spending also picked up in the quarter. General corporate-net expense of $21 million was up a little year-over-year. And adjusted EPS of $1.55 was up $0.18 compared to the second quarter of last year, an increase of 13%. The increase in adjusted EPS is primarily due to higher sales and a lower tax rate, partially offset by higher incentive compensation. As I mentioned, the tax rate in the quarter was lower than last year. The adjusted effective tax rate was about 450 basis points lower, contributing about $0.09 of adjusted EPS. The main driver of the lower tax rate is a tax benefit related to the adoption of the new accounting standard for equity-based compensation, as we mentioned on the call last quarter. We have not included any potential future benefit from this in our guidance for the year. We're pleased with our free cash flow performance in the quarter. Free cash flow was $273 million, or 135% of adjusted income. 12-month trailing return on invested capital was 36.4%. A few additional items not shown on the slide, average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 130.3 million, down 1 million or less than 1% compared to last year. And we repurchased about 690,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $105 million. Through two quarters, we are basically on track to spend $400 million on share repurchases this fiscal year. At March 31, we had $759 million remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. Moving on to slide 5, sales and margin performance of the Architecture & Software segment. This segment had an exceptional quarter with 14.2% sales growth, organic sales were up 13.7% year-over-year, currency translation reduced sales by 0.7%, and acquisitions contributed 1.2%. Segment margin improved from 24.6% to 26.5% year-over-year, almost 2 points. Strong operating leverage associated with the sales growth was partially offset by higher incentive compensation. As expected, spending was also up year-over-year. Slide 6 provides the sales and margin performance overview for the Control Products & Solutions segment. Sales in this segment were up 3%, organic sales were up 1.4%, currency translation reduced sales by 0.4%, and acquisitions contributed 2%. For the product businesses in this segment, organic sales were up about 8%. Solutions and services sales were down about 3%. Orders in our solutions and services businesses in this segment were up year-over-year, and we are pleased with a strong book-to-bill performance of 1.17% in Q2. As expected, segment operating margin contracted year-over-year in this segment. Segment margin of 12.6% was down 260 basis points compared to Q2 last year, primarily due to higher incentive compensation. We expect segment margins to improve in the balance of the year for this segment. The next slide, 7, provides an overview of our sales performance by region. Blake covered most of this in his remarks, so I will just add a few comments. You will note that our Q2 organic growth was broad based, with all regions up 5% or more with the exception of Latin America. Our highest growth regions were EMEA and Asia-Pacific. In Asia-Pacific, China was up about 10% and we saw strong growth in most countries in this region. In Latin America, continued growth in Mexico was more than offset by weakness elsewhere in the region. And finally, we saw a good growth in emerging markets. So in summary, good, broad-based growth performance in Q2; and this takes us to the guidance slide. As Blake mentioned, we are increasing our sales and EPS guidance for fiscal 2017. Based on stronger-than-expected organic sales performance in the first half and a significant increase in our backlog, we are increasing our expectation for organic growth to a range of 4.5% to 7.5%. At the midpoint, this reflects a 3 point increase in organic growth compared to our January guidance from 3% to 6%. As a reference, our organic growth for the first half of fiscal 2017 was 5.3%. Based on current currency rates, we now expect a slightly smaller headwind from currency translation, about 1.5 points. Our outlook for the sales contribution from acquisitions remains unchanged at 1.5%. In short, the combined impact of currency translation and acquisitions on the topline is expected to be about neutral. At the midpoint, we now project sales of about $6.25 billion compared to a little over $6 billion in the January guidance, an increase of a little over $200 million. We now expect segment margin to be closer to 20.5%. This implies full-year earnings conversion of a little under 25% for fiscal 2017. As expected, the restoration of incentive compensation is causing earnings conversion to be lower than we would typically project with this level of organic sales growth. We believe the full-year adjusted effective tax rate will be closer to 22%, mainly a reflection of the lower tax rate in the first half of this fiscal year. The adjusted EPS guidance range is now $6.45 to $6.75. At the midpoint, this reflects a $0.45 increase from the January guidance. The lower tax rate accounts for about $0.12 of this increase. We now expect free cash flow conversion to be over 105% of adjusted income. And a couple of other items, general corporate-net is expected to be a little over $70 million for the full year; and finally, we expect we expect fully average diluted shares outstanding to be 129.9 million, that's about 0.3 million shares higher than the January guidance. With that, we'll move to the Q&A. Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible. So, please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Operator, let's take our first question. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Your line is open. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning, Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, as you look at this pickup in spending. Can you \u2013 based on what you're hearing from customers, how much do you think that is kind of a catch-up from deferred maintenance and upgrades that should have been done that people were putting off versus adoption of the new technology offerings that you have out there? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: We really don't see this as an unusual surge that's going to quickly go away and the reason that we have the confidence in that is that, the growth is somewhat broad based. These aren't one-time big projects that we've been tracking. The diversity and the relatively small size of the projects that we're seeing lead us to believe that this isn't a surge or a catch-up from deferred spending in the main part. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: I would also say, Shannon, that generally we've seen the projections for industrial production also improve. So, I think some of this is just a general improvement in the economic condition. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. And then, Blake, as you've done more of these Connected Enterprise pilots and continue to roll them out, how are you feeling about your value proposition that puts a premium on domain expertise, while partnering with cloud providers and things like that. I mean, do you \u2013 are you getting \u2013 is it reinforcing your view that Rockwell's position of where this is heading or are you thinking \u2013 are you noticing some things that maybe you have some holes to fill or anything like that? Just some perspective on what you're learning from the pilots? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Shannon, our recent experience make us very confident in our strategy. So the combination of our technology, our domain expertise and the partners that we're bringing into bear on these customer problems across a variety of industries and across the world make us more optimistic than ever that we're on the right path. The other important point is that the concept of pilots of taking these in tangible bite-sized chunks to start with is really resonating with customers as opposed to telling them that they have to rip down everything they already have across their enterprise. So that step-by-step approach, recognizing that customers all started different places on the journey is really resonating with the people we're talking with. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you, Shannon. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Barclays. Your line is open. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning, Scott. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I guess Blake, it's nice to start your new job and also Patrick on an upswing. So I hope... Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: It is. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: ...beginning, yeah. Anyways, I am trying to get a sense, I mean, what \u2013 a couple of questions on \u2013 all related to Control Products & Solutions. I mean, first the comp increase, it wasn't as if the segment itself had all that great of a quarter, so is our folks in that segment compensated overall for the firm overall and participate in the rest of the firm's success or is it more specific to Control Products and somewhat unusual to see a kind of a 1% up organic and then down margin on comp this early in the cycle. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. So Scott, we \u2013 both segments share a common sales organization and common supply chain. So, a very large part of the incentive compensation within both segments relates to the overall performance of the company. It is a part that's segment specific, but the vast majority relates to the performance of the overall company. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then, it looks like you got a pretty big book-to-bill, I think if I heard you right, you said 1.17%. Was it 117% or 1.07%, I don't know, you can clarify that. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: 1.17%. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. What kind of work are you seeing in that backlog, is it retrofits, upgrades, new capacity? I mean any trends there or patterns that you can talk about? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: I'd say, the majority of it is retrofits and upgrades. There's some new capacity in certain industries, fairly diverse set of industries represented there. So we saw semiconductor, metals, infrastructure, power, chemical, even outside of the Maverick acquisition, so fairly broad based. And again, the work that we're seeing, these aren't large one-time projects as much as they are more moderate-sized projects and flow business. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Very helpful. Congrats, guys, good luck and I'll pass it on. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Inch from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Patrick, Blake, so what \u2013 can you actually quantify please the hedging and compensation headwinds in the quarter and what you're expecting them to be for the year? And does all this neutralize in 2018 if the cadence of business continues at its current pace or do you still face these headwinds? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. So, John, if we look through the first half of the fiscal year, the year-over-year headwind of incentive comp is $55 million to $60 million. Of that, $20 million was booked in Q1, and the remainder, so $35 million to $40 million was booked in Q2. The good news is that for next year, given our current outlook for the full year, we do not expect another headwind from incentive compensation next year, whatever our guidance range will be. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, your profit conversion is what then ex these headwinds? I can't do quick math? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Oh. If you look at it \u2013 and the best way look at it is through the first half of the year, given there was a catch-up in 2Q. So through the first half of the year, earnings conversion as reported is up a little over 20%. If you adjust for the incentive comps that I mentioned, you get closer to 45% to 50% year-over-year earnings conversion for the first six months. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Which is what we would have expected, right? That makes... Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Which is in the range of what we would expect, yes. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And then Patrick, if you look at your CapEx in the first half, just on the cash flow statement, it's up 28% versus last year. Similarly, your stock repurchases are down 28%. I guess you said those catch up in the back half, what are you spending the extra money on? It's not an insignificant amount. And is this like expansionary capacity or upgrade or related to Connected Enterprise? Is there like a payback on the stuff, or maybe a little more color would be helpful? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. So in general, capital expenditures, you can put them in three buckets. One would be general maintenance, the other one would be R&D related, including investments related to the Connected Enterprise, and the third bucket would be IT related. And so, we do see an uptick in CapEx, and some of that is related to our R&D investment. But that doesn't change that obviously, we remain an asset-light company. Most of our investments are P&L investments rather than CapEx. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right. But I mean 28% is not a little bit of spending, I mean that's a lot. Is there some \u2013 is it a first-half weighted issue, or is there just some big program in R&D or I mean... Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: No. I would say it's pretty general. There is nothing specific, and we do think that for the full year, we'll get closer to the $150 million, which is higher than last year. So last year, obviously we pulled back a little, our results were a little bit weaker and so, this year, we'll spend more on CapEx. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Just last. If business continues at this pace, are you guys going to have to hire? I mean you've articulated how, over the years, your model doesn't require a lot of sort of operational ramp if business goes up a ton, and I am assuming in the downturn you haven't really downsized. So, are you right sized to accommodate these big increases in future volume, or you're going to have to go higher, in theory? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: We still believe that the 30% to 35% conversion on incremental volume holds. So, there will be some hiring in certain places, particularly in customer-facing activities, so for services and sales. But the basic conversion on the incremental sales remains as we've discussed before. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: And from a CapEx point of view, John, 2.25% to 2.5% of sales, I think, is a reasonable ballpark to assume. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, got it. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning, gents. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Yeah, hi. Just want to go back to the book-to-bill, 1.17%, I think, is the strongest you've seen since 1Q 2010. So, obviously very strong. You talked about the end markets, it sounds like from the end market discussion, that this is mainly in the emerging markets, but have we seen a big pick-up in book-to-bill in the U.S.? And I'm also curious as well, whether we've seen some pricing pressure, given large (26:25) productivity is still in the very early stages of recovery. So, I'm just wondering if you're seeing some pricing pressure in that backlog? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: I would say, Nigel, that that book-to-bill was broad based across regions and industry, so not only in emerging markets. And as Blake mentioned, many different industries I would say where we have not seen a significant increase yet is oil and gas and mining. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay and on the pricing side, Patrick? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: On the pricing side, I would say what we mentioned on the call last quarter is that we had some lower-margin projects in backlog in our Control Products & Solutions segment, some of that is now flowing through the P&L. But we do not expect that headwind to get worse; we would expect that to be slightly improving over the next several quarters. So, we don't see... Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. So, the 2.5 points of CPS pressure, was that in part due to pricing or was it too small to call out? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Well, the vast majority of it is all incentive compensation, that's the biggest headwind. Sales is somewhat of a tailwind to CP&S margins in the quarter, and then margin, what we just discussed was a slight headwind, but it's less than a point. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thanks. I'll leave it there. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Good morning. Great start to the year. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning, Steve. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So, just in China, can you just give us a little more specific color on the verticals there? I know auto for these other guys, like 3M and ITW, is obviously different businesses, but up in kind of the 20% to 30% range, some \u2013 there's been mixed messaging around the process industry there. You mentioned electronics, maybe that's been influencing China, but maybe just unpack the 10% growth in China a little bit with the end markets? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. So, Steve, actually auto for us was about flat in Q2 in China, and we don't expect to grow year-over-year in China in auto for the full year. So, where we did see growth in China is some of the consumer verticals, including Life Sciences, tire continues to be strong for us. But we have also seen a pickup in some of the heavy industries, not oil and gas, but mining was up a little bit and so was metals. Semiconductor also... Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Interesting. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Semiconductor also contributed to the growth in China. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Didn't you guys crush the kind of China number in auto in the first quarter? So is there some give back there in the second half? I thought you guys had a really strong first quarter there in auto. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: I do not recall, but I think for the full year, as I said, we don't expect year-over-year growth in auto in China. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Interesting. And then just lastly on the \u2013 I don't like to usually ask these kind of soft high-level macro questions, but with all the buzz around what the President, the new President is trying to do on manufacturing in the U.S., have you seen any tangible signs that some of this stuff is coming to the table. Seems to be some bite-sized machine tool type of orders from companies, not necessarily like entire plants or lines or anything like that at this stage, but any signs of life there related to their press to finally make the U.S. manufacturing renaissance more of a reality than just an analyst discussion? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Sure, a couple of comments on that. First of all, there's no question that there's a pervasive optimism among most manufacturers about the prospects for more competitive environment going forward. We haven't seen large evidence of wholesale re-shoring. We have some anecdotal evidence that certain of our customers have slowed or delayed any moves that they might have been considering to move manufacturing out of the U.S. And we certainly see manufacturers, both U.S.-based manufacturers and manufacturers from the rest of the world optimistic about the power of the American consumers. So you see new tire plant and so on that are being located in the U.S. I don't think anybody is factoring in tangible changes. I'm trying to guess what the form of any (31:19) might look like at the end. But there's a general optimism there. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And when you say these guys are stopping moving to other parts of the world, do you typically when they move that stuff \u2013 do you typically kind of see that business on the other side of the pond or the border? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. Usually we do. I mean, some of our strongest customers are U.S. based multinationals who have a large footprint around the world. We go after everyone regardless of where that plant is. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Great color, guys. Great start to the year. Congratulations. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: And Steve, auto in China in Q1 was up less than 5%. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, gents. Just for a clarification on the incentive comp. So do we go back to kind of a ratable rate of 20% a quarter in Q3 and Q4, which was kind of what the prior ratable rate was or you caught up on the accruals for the year with this mover here in the second quarter? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Maybe the way you can think about is, Jeff, is for the full year our year-over-year increase in incentive comp is in the $110 million to $115 million range for the full year. Of that, we've booked half to two quarters and we booked $10 million in Q2 than in Q1. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. Got it. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: And so in the back half of the year, we'll have another $55 million or so headwind year-over-year of incentive compensation expense. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And how about kind of traditional growth spending, you said on the prior call you took it up $10 million versus the prior plan, has there been any change in outlook there? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: We've increased it a little bit in our latest guidance, but less than $10 million for the full year now, we think spending will be up about 3%, excluding the incentive compensation expense. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Up 3% in aggregate or 3%... Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yes, the full year, excluding the incentive compensation expense. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Got it. Blake, just back to your comment that Connected Enterprise isn't about rip and replace and kind of a technology migration has always been central to what's going on at Rockwell, but with this dynamic of PLC-5 and end-of-life and kind of support ending on the product, have you seen an uptick in that sort of activity, maybe not wholesale rip and replace, but kind of a broader reassessment of the footprint that what the investment might be required in some of your legacy installed base? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. Just to clarify, support for the PLC-5 will go on for many years, so you won't be able to buy a new one forever, but we'll continue to support the PLC-5 for a long, long time. That being said, I would say that the upgrade cycle of customers moving to Logix or CompactLogix technology has maybe ticked up a bit, and that takes several forms. So that could be a complete project that one of our services and solutions businesses undertakes. It could be an offer to make it attractive to get the newer hardware. And many times, the engineering is performed by our system integrator network. So that presents itself in a variety of ways. We see customers doing that to get the performance from newer processors, and also to be able to take advantage of the information management capabilities of those. So, this is very much a part of the overall Connected Enterprise value proposition, it's not just the higher level of software and services; it begins with that solid foundation of smart connected products. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Right. And then just finally for me, do you have in the U.S., how a \u2013 specifically A&S in the U.S. performs? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. So, A&S was up organic about close to 14%, and in the U.S., it was up a little above that. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you, Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Wanted to, Blake, what are the assumptions now for auto and consumer for the balance of the year? I mean, you had a high single-digit growth, (36:17) better than in the guidance, auto was pretty strong this quarter. I assume, there maybe been a change to that? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: So transportation is expected to be up high-teens for the full year with automotive higher than tire when we look at those together. Consumer will also be \u2013 will be strong for the full year. And within that, food and beverage is strong, Life Sciences, although smaller is really very strong, continues a trend that we've seen for some time, and then home and personal care a little bit weaker. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So, the consumer piece would be less than high-teens, in terms of the growth? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yes. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : But better than before. Okay. All right. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: A little better than (37:04) Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Right. Okay. And then, same thing on heavy industry, should we think low single-digit type growth for the year now at this point? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. Yes. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then just... Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: (37:14) the prior guidance. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then, the restructuring, I think, you had anticipated doing $10 million of restructuring for the year. Is that still in numbers for this year? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Rich, I think that's a safe assumption, and that's kind of the normal run rate that we do every year. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then just the last one on book-to-bill. So, any flavor on front-log for the oil and gas, mining markets, metals markets and what you're seeing? I know you talked about not really seeing that come through in the book-to-bill at this point, still early, but what's your level of optimism as we go through the next few quarters? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah, there's \u2013 and we've talked before in the heavy industries and in particular oil and gas and mining, there are parts of the world that we've seen a little bit of additional orders uptake, but on balance, that's not expected to have a big impact on shipments in the full year. So, there's increased quoting activity, but we're not seeing wholesale evidence that we have hit an inflection point in those components of the heavy industries. The slightly improved forecast for heavy industries is really driven by some of the other areas, which are in themselves significant, things like metals and infrastructure and chemical and power. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks for the color. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Rich. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities : Hi, good morning. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities : Just a question first around process industries, in the past you'd called out that was your biggest single growth opportunity, during the process downturn the last two or three years, it looked like your sales performed less well than a lot of your peers. So now that those markets seem to have bottomed out, are you confident that you will return to a share growth or share gain outlook over the next two years? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: We are. We think it's several components that contribute to share gains in that area. Obviously the technology is a piece of it as PlantPAx continues to mature and gain in functionality. But as important is the domain expertise and that's on the part of the people representing our offering, as well as the people delivering it. We certainly got a big boost with the Maverick acquisition, not only in their specific business, but in the help they can provide us around the world and we think that we've taken some steps to invest in that expertise, as well as in the market access. So we're pleased with the development of our process capabilities and we do think that that's going to be a significant contributor to our growth going forward. One of the things we've talked about before with process is because this is a relatively newer part of our growth strategy; we don't have the very large installed base of annuity services in that area. So we have that as less of a hedge against project downturn. But that is certainly an important part of [Technical Difficulty] (40:41) Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities : Thank you. And then, Blake, since you became Chief Executive, we have seen and heard a more confident tone on acquisitions at the company, and as you have said M&A added just under 2% to sales in the second quarter. How are you assessing the M&A pipeline today? Obviously a lot of targets out there given your growth aspirations and you have the luxury of your own valuation not being particularly depressed, which may make it easier to get deals done? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Sure. So, we remain primarily an organic growth company first and foremost, but we do look at M&A, as we've talked about to add a point or more of growth a year. Importantly, it's to accelerate the execution of our strategy. So we look first at acquisitions, for their ability to add to our technology innovation, our domain expertise and/or our market access. And we do have a good pipeline, it's got little targets and it's got some big targets from around the world. So we're looking at that, and our intention is to increase the positive impact of acquisitions. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities : Thank you. And then just last boring one from me, just on cadence of demand through the quarter in recent months, was there anything noteworthy to call out, or it was fairly steady as you went through? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: I would say it's fairly steady. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities : Thank you. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Your line is open. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, gentlemen. I guess the first question would be around the A&S strength. Could you just take it from the top, in terms of what you're seeing, are you seeing share gain, are you seeing pricing? Any kind of color beyond what you've offered to just kind of categorize what is frankly freakish growth? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Well, we think that it is translating into share gains. We think some of the areas of particular strength for A&S are, of course, Logix. So including ControlLogix as well as CompactLogix, where we're seeing continued success in winning new OEMs with our midrange offering. We're also seeing motion as a strong contributor, and that's certainly a product family that's in high demand by OEMs, material handling and packaging OEMs. So those are a couple of the highlights. We think there's no question that the macro is helping, but we think we're taking share because we're offering new products that are what the market wants. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: A similar question on the strength in EMEA. Could you kind of dissemble where you're seeing particular pockets of strength or share gain? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: So, transportation was strong in EMEA and as well the midrange gains, which are often at consumer machinery builders or a couple of places. We're seeing activity among the tier suppliers within automotive, and some of that activity is driven by certainly powertrain, as well as electric vehicle activity. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: I would also say, Robert, that obviously we're pleased with the 12% growth in EMEA, but we don't expect that rate of growth for the entire year. So, we were down a little bit there in the first quarter. We mentioned that we'd see growth for the balance of the year and obviously we saw a good Q2. But don't expect those rates of growth for the remaining quarters of the year in that region. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: The last question is just around Process. Could you just size the current state of \u2013 excuse me, the size of the Process Business, I think you kind of quantified what the growth was? And then, could you just talk about where your structural constraints are there, in terms of industries? What does that question mean, the question means basically, I think refining is a little bit of a bridge too far for you to kind of get \u2013 take meaningful share in that market, but are there certain markets where you think are go, no-go at the fringes of Process from your perspective? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Sure. Well, Process \u2013 and Patrick will come back and size the overall business for us. What we typically are talking about in Process is the control portion. So there is a significant amount of business that we enjoy that we're not tracking as closely that goes into Process applications that's more power centric. So what we're really talking about is where we're beating DCS suppliers to do the basic process control. If you take kind of the two ends of the spectrum, at one end you have primary process control in a refinery, which is not a target application for us. At the other end, you had batch or hybrid control, which may very often sit in a customer that also has discrete packaging. And that's one of the most available areas for us that we're doing a lot of today, where a customer finds it valuable to have a single control platform that is used in the wet end and the dry end of the plant, so to speak. There's a number of applications that do fit into continuous process control that are available to us. We see some aspects of chemical, like the specialty chemical business for instance, Life Sciences, where we have good solution for those applications. So there's a continuum. That also changes in time, as we add functionality to PlantPAx in a very deliberate way. We have the technology and the expertise to address those applications, we bring in another set as part of our targets. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: And Rob, the size is about $750 million. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And is there any border upon which applications you really don't go into at this point in time? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Well, the one I mentioned. So the primary process control in a refinery is not one that we would invest time in. In a given refinery, there is typically quite a bit of Rockwell installed base of intelligent motor control products. There is also a lot of process safety that we can participate in for emergency shutdown and fire and gas safety, but the primary process control is not a focus at this time. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. I know a company that does have that focus. Well, thanks, and sorry for not asking soft macro questions. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Rob. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Can you talk a little bit more about free cash flow? I think you've done almost 130% free cash flow conversion in the first half of the year. Now seasonally, you're going to do a stronger second half of the year? Has it been any pull-forward in cash in the first half, because your cash conversion target does seem, I know, you raised it, but it still seems pretty conservative based on what you've done? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. So, we \u2013 you're right. We raised our cash flow now. We now think it will be a little over a 105%. Typically, we see some pickup in capital spending in the back half of the year. And then, obviously, we want to make sure that those are from working capital point of view, given our sales increase that we are covered there. So, I'm comfortable with a 105% plus conversion for the full year. And obviously, if needed, we'll update that at the July earnings call. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for that Patrick. And then Blake, can you give us a little more color on your thoughts on Latin American growth in the quarter? I mean, you mentioned it turned negative led by Brazil. I mean, the markets there seem to have bottomed. But did Mexico decelerate a bit in the quarter? And then, how are you thinking about Latin America and Mexico, in particular going forward? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Mexico continues to be a source of strength for us. And it's across a variety of the industries. It's just not enough to more than compensate for the geopolitical uncertainty throughout most of the rest of the region. So between Brazil and Venezuela, just as a couple of them, Mexico wasn't able to keep the overall region in continued growth. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Do you guys think overall the region can grow this year or is it kind of been flattish or down? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: We do expect Latin America to be up this year. But it's going to be below the company average. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: All right. Thanks, guys. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you, Andy. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. And good morning, guys. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So I guess my first question, when I take a look at your growth guidance for the year and really kind of towards the high-end, given that your trends in A&S were really strong this quarter and CP&S had a very good book-to-bill, highest we've seen this cycle. I'm just wondering, why wouldn't we get towards the higher end of the growth guidance range for 2017 and what potential puts are there in the second half of the year that you guys perhaps are concerned about? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Well, if you look at the midpoint of our guidance from a regional point of view, the U.S., our largest market is growing at about that rate that is faster than what we've done in the U.S. in the first half of the year. We see Canada and Asia-Pacific above the company average and we see EMEA, Latin America a little bit below. If you look from the midpoint, so what would take us above that or below that is faster growth in heavy industries, maybe a pickup in mining in oil and gas that we're not counting on. But then again, we've increased our guidance by 3 points of organic growth, almost $200 million compared to our guidance a quarter ago and given our backlog and book-to-bill, we think we're comfortable with that. Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Fair enough. That was a great quarter and really strong trends. So, I guess maybe the second question there is, is really you talked about pricing a little bit earlier, because the growth has picked up more than we expected, I think probably more than you expected at the start of the year, maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing from a pricing standpoint today versus perhaps even just three months ago? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. I would just say maybe from an overall company perspective, for the full year and for the second quarter, we still saw price realization of a little bit less than a point. Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. So, it means \u2013 is that \u2013 you would imagine though with the growth improving that there is probably some opportunity for that to get stronger. I just want to make sure, I'm thinking about it okay? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: I don't think we've adjusted our price expectations based on the growth. There is obviously continued strong competition throughout the world in our various product lines. So, we haven't made any moves in what we're expecting on the price. Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. All right. Great. Thanks, guys. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Operator, we'll take one last question. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Noah Kaye, your line is open. Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Yes. Hi, this is Kristen on for Noah, thanking for fitting us in. Just wanted ask a little on the solutions and services business. We saw that down a little bit in the quarter. Can you talk about just the pilot programs and how those are converting to this recurring revenue stream, and what percentage of revenue does this account for now? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: So, solutions and services would be most impacted by heavy industries. And so, you've seen the relatively weaker performance of solutions and services versus products, primarily a function of depressed resource-based industries over the past couple of years. The pilots that we've been doing, if I understood you correctly, are really a combination of both products as well as solutions and services. So, we're looking at new value from information solutions with MES software, as well as services. And while sometimes we're providing the engineering there, other times customers are looking for some consulting help from us, and then they're applying the products their-selves. So, I wouldn't look at the pilot as exclusively a business that goes into solutions and services. It's really broad-based across our entire portfolio. And as I mentioned before, customers are in different stages of their journey. Some of those pilots have converted into orders, to be sure, others have completed their first pilot and are digesting the results and making plans to roll it out, and others are in earlier stages. But we're happy with the development, and we expect that to continue where you'll see pilots in very different phases as part of an overall healthy funnel. Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you for that. And then, you talked a little bit about this and \u2013 in conversation on pricing, but certainly we've seen some recent signs of industry consolidation, certainly with the ABB picking up RMB (54:52) this month. How are you viewing that competitive landscape as it stands today? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Sure. Well, there's strong competitors out there. But even with these recent moves, we intend and expect to continue to gain share. We've got a platform that combines real-time control and information, it brings value to machinery builders, and that same platform is able to bring value to the end-user as well, once the machinery is integrated into a line, we think it's somewhat differentiated and the fact that we use a common platform for both discrete and Process is somewhat unique. Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you so much. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Okay. That concludes today's call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. At this time you may disconnect. Thank you.",

Operator : Thank you for holding, and welcome to Rockwell Automation's Quarterly Conference Call. I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. Later in the call, we will open up the lines for questions. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Steve Etzel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Etzel, please go ahead. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our President and CEO and Patrick Goris, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that website for replay for the next 30 days. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. So with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to page 3 in the slide deck. This was another strong quarter for us. Organic growth was 8%, which was in line with our expectations. I'm pleased to see that this growth was broad-based across the regions and industries. Globally, transportation continued to deliver very good growth. In consumer, food and beverage did well. Heavy industries were also up in the quarter, including good growth in semiconductor. Overall, the macroeconomic environment remains solid. From a regional perspective, the U.S., our largest market grew 8%. We saw growth in most verticals led by strong performance in transportation. EMEA was flat year-over-year, as expected. The timing of projects is driving some quarter-to-quarter variability in our growth rates. Asia grew over 20%. We saw growth in most verticals led by semiconductor. Most countries in the region were up including China, which grew about 20%. Latin America grew 12% with strong growth in Mexico. I'll make a few additional comments about the quarter. Acquisitions add 1.2 points of sales growth. ACP and MAVERICK are contributing technology innovation and domain expertise, and are accretive to earnings. Our process business improved and was up 8% year-over-year organically. Including MAVERICK, process was up double-digits. Architecture & Software had another strong quarter with 10.5% organic growth. Within this segment, Logix was up 10% compared to last year. This was the third consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth. Patrick will elaborate on Q3 financial performance in his remarks. We are pleased with our sales and earnings performance in the quarter. Let's move on to our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2017. As I said earlier, the macro outlook remains solid. Recent projections of industrial production growth are largely unchanged from a quarter ago. We expect continued growth in transportation and consumer. We expect heavy industry in total to be up low single-digits for the year, consistent with our April guidance. We are still not counting on growth from oil and gas and mining for full year fiscal 2017. Turning to guidance, considering the macro outlook and our results through three quarters, we continue to expect fiscal 2017 organic sales growth of approximately 6%. We now project fiscal 2017 sales of approximately $6.3 billion, slightly higher than prior guidance due to currency. Based on our third quarter earnings performance, we are increasing the adjusted EPS guidance range. The new range is $6.60 to $6.80. At the midpoint, this represents 13% adjusted EPS growth for the year. Patrick will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks. Before I turn it back over to Patrick, let me add a few comments. Our Connected Enterprise strategy is working and positions us well for the future. The pilots continued to deliver tangible results across multiple industries, and we are seeing customers expand pilots to more lines and facilities. We will remain focused as a single integrated business, helping our customers succeed in the global market by enabling them to be more productive and therefore, more competitive. Our extent of industry knowledge and domain expertise help us deliver value based on each customer's needs. I want to highlight a couple of items. First, an important announcement we made in June. We will be working in partnership with ManpowerGroup to upskill military veterans, investing in the future workforce and creating a pool of certified talent for in-demand advanced manufacturing roles across the United States. According to a recent survey, most U.S. employers think automation will increase, not decrease, manufacturing head count, but at a higher skill level. No matter how much you automate, people remain our and our customers' most important asset. Second, I'd like to remind you that Automation Fair is in Houston this year, and we'll be holding our Investor Meeting on Thursday, November 16. Although Automation Fair is a customer event, it's a great opportunity for investors and analysts to deepen their understanding of automation and learn more about our capabilities as well as those of our partners. We will show how we are bringing the Connected Enterprise to life and delivering more value than ever before to our customers around the world. So please mark your calendars, and we hope to see you all there. Finally, I would like to thank our employees, partners and suppliers for their continued commitment to serving our customers. With that, I'll turn it over to Patrick. Patrick? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you, Blake and good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide 4, third quarter key financial information. As Blake mentioned, we had a good sales performance in the quarter with reported sales up 8.5%. As expected, organic growth was 8.2%. Our two acquisitions from last September contributed 1.2 points of sales growth. MagneMotion which was acquired in March 2016 is now included in organic growth. Currency translation reduced sales by 0.9% in the quarter. Segment operating margin of 21.1% was flat compared to last year. A margin tailwind from strong organic growth and good productivity performance was offset by the restoration of incentive compensation and increased investment spending. General corporate-net expense of $17 million was also flat year-over-year. Adjusted EPS of $1.76 was up $0.21 compared to the third quarter of last year, an increase of 13.5%. The increase in adjusted EPS is primarily due to higher sales, good productivity and a lower tax rate, partially offset by higher incentive compensation and investment spending. As I mentioned, the tax rate in the quarter was lower than last year. The adjusted effective tax rate was about 270 basis points lower, as a result of some favorable discrete tax items contributing about $0.06 of adjusted EPS. We are pleased with continued good free cash flow performance. Free cash flow in the quarter was $285 million, or 124% of adjusted income. 12 month trailing return on invested capital was 38.8%. A few additional items not shown on the slide, average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were $129.9 million, down $900,000 or less than 1% compared to last year. And we repurchased about 740,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $116.1 million. Through three quarters, we're basically on track to spend $400 million on share repurchases this fiscal year. At June 30th, we had $643 million remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. Moving on to slide 5, sales and margin performance of the Architecture & Software segment. This segment had another very good quarter with 9.8% sales growth. Organic sales were up 10.5% year-over-year, currency translation reduced sales by 1% and acquisitions contributed 0.3%. Segment margin improved 0.3 points from 27.6% to 27.9% year-over-year. Operating leverage associated with the sales growth and good productivity were partially offset by higher incentive compensation. And as expected, spending was up year-over-year mostly driven by increased R&D. Finally, currency was a bit less than a point headwind to margins in this segment. Slide 6 provides the sales and margin performance overview for the Control Products & Solutions segment. We saw a good pickup in growth in this segment with reported sales up 7.4%. Organic sales were up 6.3%. Currency translation reduced sales by 0.8% and acquisitions contributed almost 2%. Solutions and services organic sales growth turned positive in this segment, up over 4%. The product businesses in this segment were up about 9% on an organic basis. Book-to-bill performance for our solutions and services businesses in this segment was 1.02 in Q3 compared to 1.04 a year ago. As expected, operating margin for this segment improved compared to the second quarter. Segment margin of 15.3% was down 40 basis points compared to Q3 of last year, primarily due to higher incentive comp more than offsetting leverage associated with sales growth. The next slide, 7, provides an overview of our sales performance by region. Blake covered most of this in his remarks, so I will skip this slide, which takes us to the next slide, the guidance slide. As Blake mentioned, we are revising our sales and EPS guidance for fiscal 2017. We now project sales of about $6.3 billion compared to $6.25 billion in the April guidance, an increase of less than $50 million due to a smaller headwind of currency translation. Based on currency rates, the full year headwind from currency is expected to be about 0.5 point. We continue to project organic sales growth of about 6% and our outlook for the sales contribution from acquisitions remains unchanged at 1.5%. We expect segment operating margin to be a little below 20.5%. We believe the full year adjusted effective tax rate will now be closer to 21%, mainly a reflection of the lower tax rate in the third quarter of this fiscal year. This would imply a Q4 tax rate of around 25%, which is closer to our underlying tax rate. The adjusted EPS guidance range is now $6.60 to $6.80. At the midpoint, this reflects a $0.10 increase from the April guidance. The increase in EPS guidance at the midpoint mainly reflects a lower expected tax rate. A modest EPS benefit associated with the smaller currency translation headwind is offset by higher incentive compensation associated with the EPS guidance increase. We now expect free cash flow conversion to be over 115% of adjusted income for the year. And a couple of other items, general corporate-net is expected to be a little below $75 million for the full year. And finally, consistent with our April guidance, we continue to expect average fully diluted shares outstanding to be $129.9 million. With that, we'll move to Q&A. Steve. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Okay. Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get as many of you as possible on the call, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Operator, let's get on to our first question. Operator : Certainly, sir. Your first question comes from the line of John Inch with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. John. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, guys. How did China do \u2013 China was up 20%, how did China fair, heavy industry versus consumer-facing industries and could you comment on the trend of sustainability in China? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yes. I'd say, John, the growth we had in China was broad-based. We saw growth in some heavy industries, particularly semiconductor but also mining and metals, growth in infrastructure as well. We saw good growth in transportation, particularly in tire, and actually auto was up which was better than what we expected in that country for the quarter. Finally, food and beverage within consumer was also up a bit. So I'd say broad-based in China, including in some heavy industries, but you didn't hear me mention oil and gas. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So I mean, historically or at least in recent years, China consumer has been sort of the bright spot as heavy industry has been negatively pressured. Are you suggesting that there's balance in growth or is consumer still significantly ahead of heavy industry, but heavy industry is catching up? I mean, just a little more color would be great, Patrick. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: I'd say it's more balanced than before. Before, it was mostly driven by transportation and consumer. This quarter we see significant growth in some of the heavy industry verticals in China. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. I think what we are seeing in a positive sense is diversification. So we haven't talked as much about semiconductor in the past, but that was significant. And that also is a big part of the automation market and metals has actually been positive for us in China. We still look at China as fundamentally a two-speed economy where consumer, transportation, life sciences are growing faster in general, but some of the areas of heavy industries other than oil and gas are picking up. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: No. Thanks for that. Is Rockwell hiring? And the context of my question is we've obviously been through this multi-period lull and now obviously growth is much better. And if you are hiring, that would sort of speak to, I guess, just sort of your own conviction in the outlook. I mean, are you hiring and does this pose any kind of incremental headwind the way, say, comp is this year? And sort of the corollary of the question is are there any headwinds that you would call out as we head into 2018 that are going to be noteworthy to say the way compensation was, or anything that just we should \u2013 as we sort of think of our modeling, should be sort of cognizant of? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: No, is the short answer. I mean, at mid-single digits growth in fiscal year 2018, that would \u2013 the return to incentive comp would cease to be a headwind to us in the fiscal year. Regarding whether we're hiring or not, we are but we're balancing. So, my staff is looking for areas that bring us additional growth, but also looking at areas that aren't as important anymore. And so while the net increase is not large, we're constantly dynamically rebalancing where we need people, whether it's customer-facing employees, whether it's software developers. And so we are in the market and actively hiring, but we're also balancing to make sure that we don't create additional headwinds. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, Blake, all else equal, you return to mid-single digit, kind of your scenario where we would expect to go back to kind of a 30% to 40% variable contribution under that framework just based on your comments? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yes, John. 30% to 35% is the range we've shared before. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: That's right. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you, John. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Oh, thanks. Good morning, guys. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just wanted to kind of just I guess a follow on \u2013 on back to John's question there. So I think you called out FX as a one point hurt to A&S margins. I think you mentioned that, Patrick. Can you maybe just describe what impact FX is having? Is this mainly just due to the hedge movements or is there some geographic mix on sales? Any help, that would be good. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: I don't think that this is an ongoing headwind. We had some significant changes during the quarter related to currency. That is impacting that. And then of course, benefit from the hedges year-over-year for this segment was a little bit less. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. So the hedge impact will sort of normalize over the next couple of quarters or so? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. From an overall company perspective, the impact of hedges was about $1 million which was about neutral year-over-year. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. That's great. And then as I think about the investment spending, obviously, you've been talking about investment spending for some time now, but as you're launching your cloud analytics layer, is the investment spending a little bit heavier than normal or is it still very much in the run rate? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: It really is in the run rate. And as I mentioned before, as we're hiring people, we're prioritizing. So there's always a longer list of developments whether it's building out that information platform or it's our core developments in Logix and our intelligent motor control platform. There's always going to be a longer list than we're going to get to in terms of development. So we're asking our teams to prioritize. There is additional spend that's going to the information side, including the cloud but not just that. And as we talked about in the past, there's going to be a mix of organic development. It's a focus area for acquisitions and also leveraging the technology from our partners to make sure that that development burden on Rockwell doesn't become oversized. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's great. A quick modeling question. You've described the tax rate of 25% normalized. Is that the rate we should use for next year, Patrick? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: I think that will be in the range for next year at 25%, 26%, in that range. Yeah. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, guys. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you, Nigel. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yes. Good morning. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning, Rick. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Blake, could you speak to the transportation vertical in the quarter, but specifically to the auto? And I'm curious, if we could have a growth rate on the auto and the influence geographically of auto. I presume it's Mexico and U.S. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. I'll make some comments, and then Patrick will follow up with some additional color. One of the things that we're particularly proud of with auto, which is over 20% in the quarter, is the diversity of where that's coming from. So powertrain is actually performing a little bit better than our expectations. EV, so electric vehicle around the world is a material contributor including in Asia. And so those are very encouraging to us. In terms of traditional internal combustion automotive, that's fairly well balanced around the world, and it's a mix of the brand owners seeking to expand into new geographies, as well as the more frequent model changeovers that we've talked about in the past. And so that diversity has contributed significantly to our growth year-to-date. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: So, Rick, Blake mentioned that auto is up over 20% year-over-year in Q3. Actually, we saw double-digit growth in auto in every region except in Latin America in this quarter. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: So it's broad-based across different regions. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And just out of curiosity, you mentioned EVs, but is the \u2013 I know Rockwell has some content on the automation side at Tesla and the Model 3, in addition to the battery assembly operations, kind of the gigaplant they have. But is there any pull forward, if you will, of automation spend given the timing on their launch with that model? Is that a noticeable blip in the third quarter and perhaps even the second quarter for auto? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: I don't think we can really attribute that growth to that specific brand owner. What we're seeing is a lot of activity at the tier suppliers for EV around the world, not just for Tesla. And so it's broad-based. There's a lot of new companies seeking to participate in that business, and we're serving a lot of them. So, I would not attribute it exclusively to the model rebuild now. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And just last question and a follow-up. Within the CP&S business, when I look at the quarter-to-quarter incremental profitability for CP&S, what would you attribute that to? Is that to the product growth there being greater than the solutions or... Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Rick, you're looking year-over-year? Or you're looking sequentially? Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: I'm looking from the second quarter to the third quarter, the step up in profitability. I mean, incremental was like 85%. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. There's a couple of things. One is volume is up, right? So that is helping, we get leverage from volume. But also in the second quarter, you may recall we had the year-to-date adjustment related to incentive compensation. So we had an unusually high incentive compensation expense. We don't have that high of a headwind in the... Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: In the third. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: ... in the third quarter compared to the second. So think about volume leverage and then lower bonus incentive compensation. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: In the third versus second. Okay. Thank you. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Correct. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Rick. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Good morning. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Hi, Steve. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Can you maybe just talk about kind of what's going on in the U.S. automotive, specifically in the context of the current production schedules and then just what your customers are telling you on CapEx. I know Ford's cash was a little bit weak today, and they've been spending pretty heavily. Any kind of insights that they're giving you on \u2013 and there's also been some management changes. Any kind of insights that they're giving you on their plans for the next couple of years? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: We've talked before about a relatively good visibility on automotive programs that goes out for a period of years and confirming the intention of continuing to spend on those programs with the brand owners, with the tier suppliers. We see that as continued strong for the foreseeable future. So certainly through the end of the year, but also beyond. And, again, the spend with us is primarily on some of the items that I mentioned before about model changes and expansion geographically. Over time, a reduced SAAR is going to impact us, but we continue to see strong revenue for the foreseeable future. The other thing I mentioned about the U.S. market is that's been a particularly a fertile ground for us in the information and Connected Enterprise pilots. So a lot of these brand owners are already using our smart products, our Logix and so on, but they're adding the information on top in some of the associated services. So that's additional customer share that we're seeing even in existing operation. So even when they're not going through a model change or capacity expansion as they seek to get better visibility into their production, reducing unplanned downtime, and some of the other key drivers of that new value. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. When you mix this kind of all-in and you think about the \u2013 you're guiding to kind of 6% now for the year. It looks like the fourth quarter is in that kind of 5.5% to 6% range. Does that feel like the type of economy we're in? Is your ability to kind of sustain \u2013 I guess, if I look at just general industrial activity at least across my sector, the organic seems to be in kind of the 3% range in maybe a 2% to 3% economy. Does this 5% to 6% growth rate kind of seem like, hey, this is sustainably what we can do given this market outgrowth in auto and the consumer dynamics in China, et cetera. Anything unusual about kind of this year's growth rate or this is what you expect going forward? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Well, without guiding to fiscal year 2018 organic growth... Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I didn't say that. I didn't say that. I didn't ask that, by the way. Just kidding. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: The macroeconomic indicators are solid. So PMI continued strong in most spots around the world. Industrial production continue, so largely unchanged from the last quarter. So we do feel like we're in a period of expansion. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I wanted to figure out \u2013 I just want to follow up on some auto, a little different tact here. With European diesel penetration coming in pretty significantly versus expectation, a lot of the plans focused on EV and gas-powered trains. The transition in Europe over the next few years, is that net positive content-wise for Rockwell? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: I don't know that we've modeled the mix between the various transitions. There's some puts and takes in terms of the different parts of the assembly in powertrain process. Some require a little more automation, some a little less. I think the biggest single factor is expansion to new customers. So capitalizing on some of the openings we have within the brand owners, continued coverage in the tier suppliers around the world, release of new products that makes a difference, continuing to add value to our partnership with FANUC and others. I think those will have a bigger impact on our revenue growth than the pure split of automation content between EV and IC assembly. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. So share of wallet is more important than kind of neutral in terms of powertrain mix. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Both customer share and the acquisition of new customers. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Okay. All right. And then as you look through the quarter, anything noteworthy in terms of trends in the U.S. market, in terms of the months and how things trended versus expectation? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: No, Rich. I'd say it was a typical quarter. We always start the quarter a little bit slow, and then it picks up during the quarter, and that's what we saw in Q3. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And just a finer point on the guide for the balance of the year, typically your EPS in FQ4 is fairly similar to FQ3. You have a little bit tougher year-over-year organic growth rate in FQ4 versus FQ3, but seems like the FQ4 organic growth rate is somewhere around 5%. So just trying to gauge whether it's mix in there, conservatism, what kind of wouldn't keep you from getting close to FQ3 EPS? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. So in Q4, we expect a little bit of a benefit compared to Q3 related to volume. Some of that \u2013 typically in Q4 is a pickup in our solutions business which tends to have somewhat of a negative mix impact. One of the items that's impacting Q4 is we expect our spending to be up sequentially and year-over-year in the fourth quarter. And so that is impacting the Q3 to Q4 performance from an earnings perspective. And then of course from an EPS perspective, we expect a somewhat higher tax rate in the fourth quarter which has a negative impact on EPS. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Okay. Thanks. Thanks for the color. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Rich. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Maybe first just to pick up on that point, Patrick. So it did sound like when you were talking about the guide raise, you were talking about some offsets and incremental spend. It sounds like it's in the fourth quarter. But, I mean, Blake said earlier, it's in the base. But relative to what you were expecting, say, a quarter ago, is there now an elevated level of spending in the guide for 2017? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: No, Jeff. There is not. The only, call it, increase we have is really related to incentive compensation. We increased the guide at the midpoint by about $0.10, and so there's a little bit more incentive compensation associated with that. And basically, that is being offset by the tailwind we get from a lower headwind of currency translation. Those two kind of net out. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And similar to Q2, although there's less year left to catch up on, is there \u2013 the Q3 then reflect kind of a catch-up year-to-date then on the higher incentive comp number? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. But it's a much smaller number, Jeff. So last quarter, I said that for the full year, the year-over-year increase is about $110 million, $115 million. Now it's about $5 million higher for the full year. And of that, $3 million was reflected in Q3, a little bit over $3 million, and the rest was reflected in \u2013 will be booked in Q4. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: So much smaller numbers. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then just thinking about A&S specifically, give us a read on how A&S performed in the U.S. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: So A&S, we said, was up organically 10.5% year-over-year. In the U.S. it was above that. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And in Europe, these projects that you're talking about that have caused some timing influence, a little bit of color on what's going on there and how you see that playing going forward? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. I think there's a little bit of movement between the different OEMs, for instance, in Europe. We continue to see very good adoption and good growth in our CompactLogix platform at a broad range of OEMs. The variability was really customer-specific. Some of our traditional customers may have purchased a little bit less in the quarter while we're building at some of the newer machinery builders. So that's really the majority of the variability. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And then just one last one for me. At the midpoint of your range in your free cash flow conversion, you actually have raised your free cash flow per share $0.80 for the year, roughly. What is driving that? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Well, we have \u2013 first of all, from a free cash flow performance, what's helping us from a conversion point of view is the fact that we are accruing bonus which won't be get paid out till the first quarter of fiscal 2018. So that's worth about 10 points or so of conversion. And then the other thing that's helping really from a cash flow generation point of view, not the conversion, is that we're increasing our net income \u2013 our earnings performance for the year. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Right. But on incentive comp, you only went up $5 million from Q2 to Q3. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Oh. Yes. I think you're referring to going from 105% to 115%? Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yes. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: I think, it's having another good quarter of cash flow conversion behind us. That's the main driver, Jeff. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Good morning. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Morning. Just a first question on A&S globally. You saw the organic sales growth. It was very good again in Q3, a little bit slower than Q2 off a tougher comp a year ago. So when you're looking at revenue growth outlook in that segment, should we expect that just to drift off as your comps get a lot tougher into the calendar fourth quarter and just looking out over six months, or is there any actual improvement in real end demand going on, or is end demand all-in pretty stable and it's just a function of comps driving your growth rate now? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Julian, I think we see continued strength and growth, but the year-over-year growth rates will moderate because, as you say, the comps get tougher. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. I would also say we do feel confident that we're gaining share in core platforms. So at the growth we're seeing and comparing it against what external measures are available, we think we're taking share in A&S products. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. And looking at your sort of fourth quarter, should we expect that CP&S can hold the organic growth rate it saw in Q3 at about 6%? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: It might be a little less than that. Yes. I would say similar, maybe a little. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Understood. And then lastly, a quick one. This is normally an issue for Rockwell, but so many electrical companies have mentioned some challenges around price or price cost in the last 10 days or so. I wonder if you were seeing any change in pricing dynamics in any particular region or product category right now? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: No. We're in an intensively competitive market. I think we're guiding to a little less than a point of price because we're an asset light business, and mainly trade on intellectual capital, cost headwinds are not a significant new headwind for us. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Understood. Thank you. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning, Blake and Patrick. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Can you guys touch a little bit about what you're seeing in Europe? So in fiscal second quarter, you saw some good acceleration and I fully appreciate that the comps were tougher in fiscal 3Q. But maybe just a little bit more color on the slightly negative growth that you saw in Europe this quarter? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. I think as Blake mentioned earlier, actually, the growth in EMEA came in as we expected. And I would say that what we are seeing in the region is the timing of projects is driving some variability in our quarterly growth rates. We're not seeing an underlying trend that's different than what we expected. It's more related to timing of some of the projects we have throughout our businesses. We still expect to grow in EMEA for the full year. It's going to be below the company average. So that has not changed. And there are areas in EMEA where we continue to do well, for example, with machine builders and our mid-range controller family. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: We also continue to see growth in the emerging parts of Europe. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And were there any particular areas within Europe that were weaker than you expected this quarter? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Well, every quarter, there is some variability. In this case, we saw good growth in emerging Europe, and some of the Western European countries were a little bit less than what we expected. But I wouldn't read too much into that. I think that's normal quarterly variability that we see all the time. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then you typically \u2013 you mentioned earlier on the call that you typically don't talk about the semiconductor space. I think it's a relatively small piece of your business. So maybe to the extent that you can quantify what percentage of sales semis is for you guys? And then more specifically, one of the trends we've seen this year is just electronic CapEx has been up a lot. So to the extent that you can just comment on cyclical versus potentially sustainable or structural growth in that industry, that would be helpful. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. So first of all, semiconductor and electronic manufacturing and assembly are roughly 5% of our sales. And as you pointed out, they are in a period of investment. That's the chip production, that's the glass panel fabs. We have a particular strength in the facility management control system. So the environmental controls that are so important to those kinds of advanced manufacturing processes are an area that we're quite strong in. Characterized growth centered in Asia, in the U.S. especially, and they are in a period of good spend that's predicted to continue for a while, but there will be a certain cyclical element of that. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And you mentioned, just maybe follow-on there, you mentioned that China was up about 20%. What was your semiconductor business up this quarter? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: You mean, specifically within China? Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yes. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: It was a little bit more than that. Actually, it was \u2013 yes, it was more than that in China. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: One of the things that contributes to the growth as well is for a lot of that business, it involves value add as well. So engineering services, panel fabrication. So it's not just the loose products, but it's also the value add that increases the value of those sales. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you, guys. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Joe. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Your line is now open. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Solutions and services, which went down 3% last quarter, I think up 4% you said this quarter. We know solutions is big in heavy industries. You already mentioned that you still expect heavy industries to be up low-single digits for the year. Is there any evidence though that it is accelerating a little? I mean I know you mentioned nothing really going on in oil and gas. What about mining or some of the other segments of heavy industries? What contributed to that sort of inflection in the solutions business? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. It's still variable around the world. So we mentioned last quarter that we are seeing a bit of a improvement in mining in Asia, for instance, but we're not ready to call it broad-based around the world. We still see pressure from lower commodity prices like copper still below $3 a pound, and we're still dealing with overcapacity in steel, that's putting pressure on that. That being said, we've got some bright spots. So metals has been relatively strong as customers modernize and, in some cases, consolidate facilities but adding automation. In North America, the lower cost of feedstock in natural gas is giving us good growth in chemical. So it's spotty around the world. We're not ready to call a general recovery, but there are spots that have contributed to that relatively improved performance in solutions and services. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Andy, obviously, what's helping us is that some of those heavy industries are not as a significant drag now than they were a year ago or several quarters ago. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful, guys. And, Blake, maybe somewhat related, process was up 8% in the quarter, which continued to improve from last quarter. Would you say that pickup in growth is more Rockwell-specific based on things like your hybrid control offerings, or is it just the process markets themselves are improving? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: I think it's both. I mentioned before the chemical market. Certainly, the continued evolution of our PlantPAx control platform has helped. It's going to continue to help. We've got a lot of developments lined up over the next few years that are going to increase our competitiveness there. But at least is important is the domain expertise. So we're better able to serve, for instance, the chemical market because of the MAVERICK acquisition. And that domain expertise is absolutely critical to foster the trust in those customers that we know how to address their mission critical applications. So I'd really say it's a mix of our improved ability to serve the market, as well as a recovery in some areas and some diversification in terms of our ability to address additional process control applications. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: All right. Thanks, guys. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Andy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. This is Kristen on for Noah. Good morning. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: So, you mentioned in the release, you have been seeing some significant results on the Connected Enterprise pilot programs. I'm just wondering if you can give us any sort of specific examples or maybe quantify the tangible results that you're seeing? And how are you seeing those pilot programs as they transition to full-scale deployment? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Sure. Happy to do that. As we've talked about, we're very pleased with the evolution of these pilots. We have a couple dozen that we're formally tracking across different industries and different parts of the world. We've made some public announcements about a few of those, Metso, in the mining world as we partner with them, in conjunction with Microsoft, to be able to enhance their ability to add value to end user customers in areas like remote monitoring. Great Lakes Brewing, craft brewery located in Cleveland, is using some of our device-level analytics and some of our reporting tools to get better production visibility. Again, that's one that we're working with Microsoft to deliver that value for them. It's a great story. It's giving value to that individual customer, but it's also something that will, no doubt, expand to other similar operations. It's an easy way to get started and to get the value from the Connected Enterprise, from that integrated control and information without having to send all the data to the cloud in a very expensive and high-risk type of application. In oil and gas, we've talked about companies like Shell in the past that continue to expand their use of our information solutions and connected services. So really across industries and across geographies, we're happy with the evolution. In terms of quantifying the specific value, we think it's contributing to our very strong product growth as customers put that foundation in place. That's where the data comes from. But also we still believe that we're on track to deliver double-digit growth from some of the areas of new value in the Connected Enterprise, the information solutions, and the connected services that customers turn to as they try to integrate that control and information. Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: No, that's very helpful. And then just sort of as my follow-up, we saw another great quarter of cash generation, continuing to generate just tremendous amount of cash on the balance sheet. So in light of that, how are you thinking about capital deployment priorities at this stage? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. That has not changed. So we'll fund our organic growth, that's priority number one. We continue to look for acquisitions that have a very good strategic fit and that will help us grow faster organically as well. And then after that, we continue to target a dividend with a yield and payout that's at the median of our peers. And finally after that, we return cash through share repurchases. So that remains very consistent. Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you so much. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Bergner with Gabelli & Company. Your line is now open. Justin Bergner - Gabelli & Company: Good morning, everyone. Nice quarter. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Justin. Good morning. Justin Bergner - Gabelli & Company: First question relates to oil and gas. I guess, I'm not sure if you broke out how oil and gas performed in the quarter. And then secondly, was that really the only market that maybe didn't do as well as you expected in the June quarter or were there other markets that sort of fell short of your expectations? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. Actually, I'd say that oil and gas for us in the quarter, just like mining, they were actually up a little, call it low single-digit. But we think it's more maybe some hovering around the bottom than anything more than that. We're not seeing a big turnaround yet in those verticals. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. And so the ones we typically talk about and we've talking about together over the last couple of quarters has been oil and gas and then a broad-based mining recovery. And going back a few years, we were used to outsize growth in those areas. And even though we did see low single-digit growth in mining and oil and gas in the quarter, we're not ready to call a general inflection point across the world. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: That's why we continue to believe and our guidance continues to assume no year-over-year growth for the full year for both of these verticals. Justin Bergner - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Second would be on the question of currency tailwinds. I mean, you mentioned that you're going to have about $5 million of incentive comp, and that will be more or less offset by the FX tailwinds over the quarter just completed and the September quarter. I mean, should we think about the FX tailwind sort of picking up as we get into fiscal year 2018 if exchange rates stay at current levels? And sort of what will be the puts and takes to think about how the changing currency environment will affect profitability going forward? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: So we're not necessarily known for being good forecasters of currency. But at the current levels of currency, instead of having a tailwind, it could be a small \u2013 instead of having a headwind like we have this year, it could be somewhat of a positive. It's still early. Currencies move around, and we'll share with you in November what our assumptions are for fiscal 2018. Justin Bergner - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Thank you. And then finally, just \u2013 Latin American strength has been exceptional. I mean, it continues to be exceptional. I know, it's something a lot of people take for granted, but it's really a strong point of the company in this quarter in particular. Is there any dynamic there that is worth highlighting given the strong comp? And obviously, Brazil is not particularly rosy now so the strong results stands out even further. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Well, I agree. It is remarkable. It's a source of traditional strength for the company. A lot of that growth has been centered recently in Mexico as Brazil and Venezuela, among others, deal with continuing political uncertainty. And we enjoy in Mexico and in some countries diverse space. So it's not just the heavy industry, but it's automotive, it's food/beverage, tire manufacturers are locating in Latin America. So those would be a few additional comments about that growth. But it's a source of pride for us. So we have that relatively strong share in Latin America. Justin Bergner - Gabelli & Company: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Operator, we'll take one more question. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Your line is now open. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Thanks for fitting my questions in, or questions. I guess, the first question is maybe following up on capital allocation. I mean, obviously, we haven't gotten much in the way of policy traction for the Trump administrational on tax and there's the limited visibility there, particularly with respect to repatriation. But at some point, is there urgency to kind of come up with new framework for your capital allocation given the prevailing environment? I mean, do you think you have to, just to put a finer point on what kind of your priorities are or sizing the priorities in terms of capital allocation or bringing back cash? I mean, could we talk about that for a little bit? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. I think, the answer is, Rob, that we \u2013 obviously, we look forward to potential tax reform including the lower rates, including an opportunity to repatriate cash, including moving towards a territorial tax system. But absent that, we can continue doing what we have been doing for the last several years. There is no need for us to repatriate the cash that's overseas. It's permanently reinvested there. And as our cash needs in the U.S. are larger than our cash generation, we continue to gross up the balance sheet. And so there is no need for us to change it at this time. The one item that could change that is if for some reason our credit rating would come into play, but I think we're still far away from that. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then as a follow up, in terms of the acquisition opportunity and landscape, this is kind of two questions tied together. I guess, Blake, where do you see the most opportunity to structurally improve some of your businesses from a domain expertise standpoint or from distribution or geographic distribution? Where do you see the biggest opportunities for M&A or collaboration? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Sure. Well, just to reiterate, when we look at acquisitions, we look at their ability to accelerate our technology innovation, our domain expertise and/or our market access. And the best ones bring us benefits in multiple of those dimensions. On the technology side, information solutions is a particularly interesting area for us. In domain expertise, process continues to be an important opportunity for us. And then market access, as you would expect in some places, Asia, Europe where we have lower relative share, there are opportunities there as well. We're looking at our acquisition pipeline which is robust, first, in terms of the strategic fit in those dimensions, and we're satisfied and optimistic that what we've talked about before as our ability to grow on top line, have accretive acquisitions, but most importantly have them contribute to the strategy in areas like information management, analytics and so on. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I'll leave it there. Congratulations on a good quarter. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Rob. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Okay. That concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining us. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. Later in the call, we will open the lines up for questions. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Steve Etzel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Etzel, please go ahead. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's fourth quarter fiscal 2017 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our President and CEO; and Patrick Goris, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that website for replay for the next 30 days. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. So with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to page 3 in the slide deck. This was another good quarter for us. Organic growth was about 6%, which was slightly above our expectations. I'm pleased to see that, once again, this growth was broad-based across both industries and regions. Transportation had another good quarter, led again by automotive, which was up about 10%. In consumer, food and beverage continued to do well. Heavy industries were also up in the quarter, including good growth in semiconductor, chemicals and metals. Importantly, we saw oil and gas return to meaningful growth in the quarter. We had a strong finish to the year in orders, which were up high-single digits in the fourth quarter for the overall company. From a regional perspective, the U.S., our largest market, grew almost 6% organically. We saw growth in almost all verticals, including strong performance in semiconductor, automotive and metals. EMEA was up 5% in the quarter, a nice finish to the year. We continue to make progress with OEM machine builders. Asia grew 5%, led by growth in semiconductor. China was up 6%. Latin America grew 2%, led by heavy industries. I'll make a few additional comments about the quarter. Acquisitions added 1.3 points of profitable sales growth. Logix was up 8% compared to last year. Our process business improved, and was up 9% year-over-year organically. Including our MAVERICK acquisition, process was up almost 20%. We also had two specific items in the quarter that were not in our previous guidance. First, we sold a small product distribution business that was part of our Control Products & Solutions segment. Second, we initiated restructuring plans related to manufacturing re-footprinting, as well as general cost reductions to redirect spend to our highest Connected Enterprise priorities. These actions accelerate our ongoing efforts to sharpen our focus on the Connected Enterprise strategy and further enhance the competitiveness of our products, services and solutions. We will continue to balance investments with our commitment to delivering profitable growth. Patrick will elaborate on our fourth quarter and full-year financial performance in his remarks. Moving to the full year, overall, fiscal 2017 was a very good year for us. Here are some key points. Continuing several years of good growth, automotive had another strong year, including the contribution from our powertrain initiative and electrical vehicle activity. Consumer verticals were up mid-single digits led by food and beverage. After a few down years in heavy industries, fiscal 2017 was a year of low-single-digit growth. We saw very strong performance in semiconductor and oil and gas improved over the course of the year. Logix grew 10% in 2017 and process also returned to growth. We saw good growth in revenue streams related to new value from the Connected Enterprise. Our pilots are progressing well and expanding in all industries. We'll talk more about this next Thursday at our Investor Day. Our customers and our management team will provide specific examples of how the Connected Enterprise is helping companies successfully compete by becoming more productive. With respect to financial performance this year, we continue to make investments in the Connected Enterprise, including core offerings, information solutions and connected services. We had another good year of free cash flow conversion. We continued to return cash to share owners, over $725 million during fiscal 2017. Just last week, we announced a 10% increase in the annual dividend. This reflects our confidence in sustained free cash flow through the cycle. Our recent acquisitions contributed 1.5 points of profitable growth and increased our technology, domain expertise and market access. We have a strong pipeline of both large and small acquisition opportunities and we have recently increased engagement with the start-up community. During the year, we added more resources to focus on acquisition and investment opportunities. We continue to expect acquisitions to generate a point or more of growth each year. We also continue to leverage strategic partnerships, make targeted technology investments and gain access to emerging technologies to complement our own research and development activities. Our employees, partners and suppliers continue to differentiate us, and I would like to thank them for their efforts every day. Let's move on now to the fiscal 2018 outlook. I'll start with market conditions and economic indicators. Global macroeconomic conditions are solid. Current forecasts call for improved global GDP and industrial production growth rates and PMI measures are at high levels. Our strong orders performance in the fourth quarter positions us well as we enter fiscal 2018. Taking all this into account, we expect another year of good growth in fiscal 2018 with continued growth in consumer and transportation and a meaningfully higher contribution from heavy industries, including oil and gas. We expect our fiscal 2018 organic sales to be up 5% year-over-year at midpoint of guidance. The absence of the business we sold in Q4 will reduce growth by a little more than 1 percentage point, while currency is expected to add 2.5 percentage points to growth. Including the impact of currency, our fiscal 2018 sales guidance did sales of about $6.7 billion and adjusted EPS of $7.20 to $7.50. Patrick will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks. Before I turn it over to Patrick, let me add a few comments. I look forward to seeing many of you next week at our annual Investor Day. As usual, we will hold Investor Day at Automation Fair, our main customer event, which will be in Houston, Texas this year. This is a great opportunity to see how we are bringing the Connected Enterprise to life for our customers. We will showcase our latest innovations, acquisitions and information solutions for thousands of worldwide customers, highlighting how the powerful combination of Rockwell Automation and our partners brings the Connected Enterprise to life. The opportunities for integrating control and information are greater than ever, and the value of the Connected Enterprise is being demonstrated across all of our verticals and around the world. I believe we are best positioned to deliver this value to our customers, because we are already on the plant floor, with a large installed base we have differentiated technology and domain expertise, and we have a long history of successful partnerships. The value we provide is in high demand as every day customers are pulling us into their plans to connect their enterprise to become more competitive. We'll continue to invest in technology and domain expertise to expand this value and profitably grow share, more next Thursday during Investor Day. Finally, I want to briefly address our announcement from last week regarding Emerson Electric's unsolicited proposals. As you saw, we issued a press release on October 31 confirming that Rockwell Automation had previously rejected two unsolicited proposals from Emerson. As we noted in the release, the Rockwell Automation board of directors carefully reviewed and evaluated each of the proposals in consultation with its financial and legal advisors, and unanimously determined that the proposals were not in the best interest of the company and its shareowners. Rockwell is uniquely positioned as the world's largest company dedicated to industrial automation and information. We deliver applications across all industries and process hybrid and discrete on a single platform and one software environment, which is very attractive to both our customers and our distribution channel. We believe the company is well-positioned to create substantial additional value for our shareowners by continuing to execute on our strategic plan. Over the past week, we have talked with many shareowners and analysts who are equally confident in the company, this team, and our ability to deliver additional upside and execute on our plan. Our fiscal 2017 results and guidance for fiscal 2018 demonstrate the strength of our business and reinforce confidence in our strategy and that is where our attention is focused. The purpose of the call today is to discuss our results and next year's guidance. Now, let me turn the call to Patrick for a deeper dive on our results. Patrick? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide 4, key financial information fourth quarter. As Blake mentioned, we had good sales performance in the quarter with reported sales up 8.4%. Organic growth was 5.6%, a few million dollars better than we expected. Currency translation contributed 1.5 points to sales growth, also a bit better than expected. Our two acquisitions from last September contributed 1.3 points of growth. Before I cover the other elements on this page, let me provide more detail on the restructuring charges in the quarter, as well as on the sale of the business Blake referred to in his comments, neither of which were included in our July guidance. We booked $43 million of charges in the quarter, all of which impacted segment earnings and margin. About half of these charges relates to a re-footprinting of our manufacturing operations. This includes the announced closure of our manufacturing facility in Aarau, Switzerland. This large re-footprinting will take several years to execute and is expected to yield attractive incremental earnings once finalized. We have successfully executed similar projects in the past. The other half of the $43 million in pre-tax charges relates to general SG&A cost reductions in order to redirect spending through our highest priority areas, particularly Connected Enterprise-related investments. We expect fiscal 2018 gross savings associated with the $43 million charges to be about $20 million. After taking into account further implementation costs for our re-footprinting, the net benefit to fiscal 2018 should be about $10 million. The net annualized run rate benefit is expected to be over $50 million once the manufacturing re-footprinting is finalized. With respect to the sale, the business we sold was a product distribution business in the Control Products & Solutions segment. The business has no Rockwell intellectual property and includes products sold outside of our core channel and under different brands. We sold the business for $94 million with a potential earn-out on top of that. In the quarter, we booked a pre-tax gain of approximately $61 million associated with the sale. Let me cover one other item that was not reflected in our July guidance and relates to the voluntary pension contribution we made during our fourth quarter. We decided to make a $200 million pre-tax contribution to the U.S. pension plan. A reduction in PBGC premiums made this financially attractive. With potential U.S. tax reform in the works, we decided to make the contribution now. Based on our most current projections, we do not expect mandatory contributions to the U.S. pension plan for at least five years. With that, let's move on to the other elements on this page. Segment operating margin of 17% was down 280 basis points compared to last year. A margin tailwind from strong organic growth was more than offset by higher restructuring charges, increased incentive compensation and higher investment spending. Adjusting for the restructuring charges, which as I mentioned were not part of our prior guidance, segment margin was a bit lower than expected due to currency. Currency translation was a slight tailwind to sales, but represented the headwinds to both margin and EPS in the quarter compared to our expectations. General corporate-net expense of $24 million was a little higher than expected and about flat year-over-year. Adjusted EPS of $1.69 was up $0.17 compared to the fourth quarter of last year, an increase of 11%. The gain on sale and the restructuring charges combined yielded a $0.04 net adjusted EPS benefit. The remaining year-over-year increase in adjusted EPS is primarily due to higher sales, offset by higher incentive compensation and investment spending. The adjusted effective tax rate of 25.9% was up 3 points compared to last year and includes U.S. taxes related to the gain on the divestiture. Excluding the $200 million pre-tax pension contribution, free cash flow in the quarter was in line with our expectations. 12-months trailing return on invested capital was 39%. Let me add a few additional items not shown on the slide. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were $129.8 million, flat to last year. We repurchased about 200,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $34.6 million. For the year, we repurchased 2.3 million shares at a cost of $336.6 million. This is a bit short of our $400 million target. At September 30, we have $608 million remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. Moving on to slide 5, key financial information for full year of fiscal 2017. In short, we had a good year with 14% adjusted EPS growth on 7% higher sales. We talked all year about higher incentive compensation being a headwind to margin and adjusted EPS. For the full year, incentive compensation was about $115 million year-over-year headwind. The higher incentive compensation and restructuring charges represented more than a 2-point year-over-year headwind to segment margin and had a significant impact on earnings conversion. Adjusted EPS was $6.76. Excluding the Q4 gain on sale and restructuring charges, adjusted EPS of $6.72 ended up slightly better than we expected. The full-year adjusted effective tax rate of 21.5% is a bit higher than the 21% rate we provided you last quarter, primarily due to the gain on the business sale. Free cash flow was 102% of adjusted net income. Excluding the Q4 items and the pension contribution, free cash flow conversion was 120%, which compares to the 115%-plus guidance we shared with you in July. Moving on to slide 6, sales and margin performance of the Architecture & Software segment. This segment had another good quarter with 8% sales growth. Organic sales were up 6.2% year-over-year. Currency translation increased sales by 1.6%, and acquisitions contributed 0.2%. For the quarter, segment margin decreased 210 basis points year-over-year. Operating leverage associated with the sales growth was offset by higher incentive compensation and restructuring charges. And as expected, spending was up year-over-year, mostly driven by increased R&D. Slide 7 provides the sales and margin performance overview for the Control Products & Solutions segment. We saw another good pickup in growth in this segment with reported sales up 8.7%. Organic sales were up 5.1%, currency translation contributed 1.4%, and acquisitions contributed 2.2%. We had a second consecutive quarter of solutions and services organic sales growth up over 3%. The product businesses in this segment were up about 7% on an organic basis. Operating margin for this segment contracted 330 basis points compared to Q4 last year, primarily due to higher incentive compensation and restructuring charges, more than offsetting leverage associated with sales growth. The majority of the restructuring charges and higher incentive compensation affected this segment. Book-to-bill performance for our solutions and services businesses in this segment was 0.98 in Q4 compared to 0.92 a year ago. This is a bit stronger than usual performance in Q4. As Blake mentioned, overall company orders were up high-single digits in Q4. The next slide 8 provides an overview of our sales performance by region. Blake covered most of these details in his remarks. So I will just point out that growth was broad-based across geographies for both the quarter and full year fiscal 2017. This takes us to slide 9, guidance. We project sales of about $6.7 billion, an increase of about $400 million compared to fiscal 2017. Organic sales growth is expected to be within a range of 3.5% to 6.5%. Consistent with currency rate projections for the next 12 months, we expect a tailwind from currency translation of about 2.5 points, and the sale of the business in Q4 is expected to be a little more than a 1-point headwind. We expect segment operating margin to be a bit below 21.5%. Excluding the impact of the sale of the business and the fiscal 2017 restructuring charges, this implies earnings conversion of about 35%. We believe the full-year adjusted effective tax rate will be about 24.5%, a 3-point increase, mainly resulting from the discrete tax items we benefited from in fiscal 2017. Included in our 24.5% tax rate is an estimated impact of excess income tax benefits from equity-based compensation. Note that the 24.5% tax rate does not include any potential impact from potential U.S. corporate tax reform. The adjusted EPS guidance range is $7.20 to $7.50. At the midpoint, this reflects a 9% increase compared to fiscal 2017 on 6% higher sales despite the significant headwinds from a higher tax rate. Free cash flow conversion is expected to be about 100%. I'll add a couple of other items. General corporate-net is expected to be about $75 million for the full-year and we are targeting about $500 million in share repurchases and expect average fully-diluted shares outstanding to be about $129.3 million. Page 10 shows an adjusted EPS bridge. My comments will be from the left to the right. As I mentioned earlier, reported fiscal 2017 adjusted EPS of $6.76 includes a $0.04 net benefit from the Q4 gain on sale and restructuring. Excluding that, we came in at $6.72 compared to our guidance midpoint of $6.70. On 5% organic sales growth in 2018, we expect EPS contribution of about $0.70. And as we mentioned on prior calls, incentive compensation is not a headwind at the midpoint of fiscal 2018 guidance and instead represents a tailwind of about $0.10. Currency is expected to yield a benefit of about $0.20. The sale of the product distribution business in the CP&S segment represents a loss of earnings of $0.05, and as expected, we see a significant headwind from a higher adjusted effective tax rate. Finally, there is a modest benefit from lower pension expense, a couple of pennies, and lower share count. We project a smaller-than-typical EPS benefit from share repurchases, given the significant increase in our share price, which impacts the number of shares we repurchase. Let me add that while we expect another good year of sales and EPS growth in fiscal 2018, we do not expect year-over-year EPS growth in the first quarter. We had an unusual low tax rate and lower spending in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and while for overall fiscal 2018 incentive compensation is a year-over-year tailwind, for Q1, it will be a modest headwind. With that, I'll turn it over to Steve. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible. So please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Operator, let's take our first question. Operator : Certainly. Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning. Boy, a bunch of things. I guess I'll try to keep it tight. First, just to better understand the quarter, it would be helpful to get some color on how the restructuring's set in the segments and how the FX played through the segments. Patrick you gave us a directional comment there, but to quantify that would be helpful. And then maybe more importantly, I'll avoid the Emerson question, but not showing growth in the first half of 2018 even with the high tax rate sounds peculiar to me. Is there something other than investment spending that we should be thinking about in that regard? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Okay. Jeff, with respect to the restructuring charges, you can think of the charges being a 60/40 split, so 60% of the charges going to the CP&S segment, 40% of the charges impacting Architecture & Software, and so that's about a 3-point headwind to the CP&S segment margin in the quarter and a little over a 2-point headwind for the Architecture & Software segment in the quarter. With respect to the question you had about fiscal 2018, my comments about no year-over-year EPS growth was with respect to Q1, not the first half of the year. So it's only for Q1 that we expect adjusted EPS to be down year-over-year for the items \u2013 because of the items I mentioned, but that is not for the first half. For the first half, we do expect EPS growth. With respect to currency compared to the prior year, currency was about a 0.5 point hit to segment margin for the company and it was a little bit more than that for A&S and a little bit below that for CP&S. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great. And then just as a follow-on, Blake, just to hit really kind of the strategic direction of the company and your push-back on Emerson and more importantly your view of the company going forward, do you, in fact, expect a much higher level of investment spending to execute on that? Is there anything unusual and what you plan to spend in 2018? And maybe just a little more \u2013 I'm sure we're going to hear a lot next week. But, just a little more about maybe what your customers are saying about your position and your business proposition. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with the last. Customers are voting with their wallets and that's why we're gaining share broad-based across regions and in industries. The Connected Enterprise and bringing it to life remains our strategy and that means that we integrate control and information across the enterprise to help industrial customers and their people be more productive, and that is what we do. We're a single integrated business, exclusively focused on that. We're the biggest company in the world that's devoted to industrial automation and information. And customers are telling us it's the right strategy. I would add that it's very compelling to them to have such a tightly integrated business because it brings efficiencies to them as well as to us. Having a single platform within their enterprise to solve different types of applications is a huge productivity benefit to them. They can get lots of different products from different companies. But having a single platform with a common software environment is something that customers tell us, over and over, brings them a lot of benefit. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Inch from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by asking, so we had this $0.28 gain and the $0.24 of charges. Patrick, what amongst these charges would have been normally run through anyway? Like in other words, I'm trying to understand, did you pull forward intended spending, or would you have spent this if you haven't had the gain? Like what \u2013 I'm trying to sort of \u2013 just kind of what's ultimately sort of a normalized versus unusual to kind of decipher how ultimately your business has fared? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. You can think of normalized restructuring charges for our company being in about $10 million per year, and we have, every quarter we have some charges. The charges that we just called out now would be on top of the normal $10-ish million we do. And so, obviously, a couple items played a role here. Obviously, we had the sale and the large gain who we've been looking for a while now at our supply chain and potential re-footprinting there. So we decided to pull that trigger. And as we mentioned in our comments, the other item is we're constantly looking at where we can redirect spending through our higher-priority areas related to the Connected Enterprise, and these restructuring charges enable us to do both. One is a long term re-footprinting; the other one is shorter term, redirecting some of our spend. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. Let me also add and this goes back to the question that Jeff asked as well. Do we expect dramatically higher, unusually higher development spending going forward? And the answer to that is no. We continue to increase, as modestly as a percentage of total revenue, our development spend by working with the best partners in the business. By making acquisitions as well to complement our organic strategy, we're able to continue to keep spending at managed levels. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So, is it fair to say for the Swiss facility, et cetera, does the $43 million ring-fence this? Because I had sort of thought like you had intimidated that there was still going to be more of these initiatives that bleed into 2018. So, just to be clear and maybe you said it, but is 2018 back to the normal $10 million spending or is there a still incremental spending that's occurring without offsetting gain? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: The normal $10 million, John. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So 2018 is the normal $10 million. Okay. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yes. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Why did China slow to mid-single digit? It actually seems that was probably the primary driver of your overall organic growth which you described as broad-based. It wasn't a bit better because, obviously, this was a strong industrial quarter, right, for \u2013 I mean Parker-Hannifin put up 7% core growth, et cetera. So, strong industrial quarter comes around the world. But in your situation, China was slower. What's going on there and what do you expect it to be doing in fiscal 2018? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. I would say that we always see some quarterly variability in our growth rates, especially in some of the emerging markets where there's some (33:18) more of the larger projects. We're pleased with our growth in China this year. China did about 12% of growth in fiscal 2017. And for next year, we expect China to be close to 10%, a little bit below. So I wouldn't just look at one particular quarter. I would expect some continued variability in those growth rates going forward as well. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. I would also add. As some of the projects that get lumped into heavy industries come back, you're going to see some of that natural variability. So for some additional color, in Q4 in China, semiconductor remains at very high levels. Transportation continues strong, metals and mining. So a lot of that is project-based business and you're going to have some variability there. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: The good news, John, is that as Blake mentioned, it's many different industries in China that are supporting growth. And so it's not only consumer, but some of the heavy industries are now contributing growth as well. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So basically, lumpiness. This is not some sort of a trend or some sort of share loss event or something like that. No. That's fine. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: We think we've taken \u2013 John, we think \u2013 John, we think we've taken share in China. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Well, especially in consumer, I think that makes a lot of sense. Let me ask one last one here. Yesterday afternoon (34:43), Emerson laid out, I would say a strategic rationale for why they would really like to buy you. Basically, if you kind of read between the way they presented it, it was to plug their lack of discrete and hybrid offering. And they commented more than once that customers want this full automation solution across discrete, hybrid and process. I mean, I guess I'm wondering like you sort of answered Jeff's question by talking about how customers want sort of a singular provider. But the differences between true process and true discrete in terms of customer subset and skill sets are obviously pretty different. I'm just curious if you concur with Emerson's statement that increasingly the market is looking for a singular solution provider across all of these three disciplines, and if that were so, I mean your process business really isn't that big in the big picture. So I'm wondering if this strategically prompts you to in turn try and drive higher process penetration. Blake, I think you're on record as even saying you'd be interested in doing deals up to $1 billion or at least stepping up M&A kind of over time versus Rockwell's historical trend. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. So, John, again starting with the appetite for acquisitions. We've talked about information solutions and connected services being priorities for acquisitions. And we've got a pipeline with some smaller ones and some big ones that get up to that $1 billion plus level. So we're looking at that. We start first with the strategic fit and then we look at the financial return for making those acquisitions. In terms of what the market is looking for, customers are looking for a single platform that they can deploy across their enterprise and a lot of customers have a mix of discrete and batch/hybrid and continuous process applications and the attraction of being able to build on our Logix platform to be able to solve all that different type of logic so that they only have to train on one platform their operations people. And from a parts standpoint and from a learning and an integration standpoint, that's very attractive to them. So while we sometimes get caught up in looking at what pieces of the overall automation market can be used, what matters is the outcomes that you bring to a specific customer and that specific customer is looking for a single platform. That's why a lot of our investments are based on continuing to add functionality to Logix, to a common software environment and that's what customers, even continuous process customers are telling us that we're on the right path looking at. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So you don't feel the need to step up the penetration incrementally based on kind of either the Emerson events or other events in the market to gain kind of more of a balance in process versus your discrete offering? I think that's what you're saying. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: We continue to see process as a great growth opportunity. We combine what we have in terms of process control with our domain expertise because that's an important part of the equation, that was part of the rationale behind what has been a very successful MAVERICK acquisition. And something that we talked about a lot in the past is intelligent motor control. When you're talking about handling fluids, then the variable speed drives and the power control is an important part of that and we have as good a portfolio as any in the business and we're taking significant share there as well. So combining that with our improved process control capabilities is something that's allowing us to see the kind of growth we reported in Q4 in process. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thanks. See you next week. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, John. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Blake, so another good year expected for auto. Just curious with the re-footprinting that's going on in the powertrain side across global OEs, shifting away from internal combustion, particularly diesel to hybrid and electric applications over the coming years, how do you see that playing out in terms of enhanced growth opportunity for Rockwell, and should we think of that as a potential more structural step-up to company's growth rate within that vertical? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Rich, we see it as very positive. When you combine the powertrain business that we've been talking about for the last few years as $20 million of additional revenue each year and you add the activity going on at many of those same-tier suppliers with electric vehicles, in 2018, we expect the contribution from powertrain and EV to be $100 million worth of business in our automotive segment. So it's big enough to be meaningful and we continue to see those high growth rates. We're competing and winning around the world at those customers. And that's definitely providing a boost to the traditional internal combustion assembly business that we've enjoyed for a long time in automotive. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And that's incremental on top of what you would normally get, say nothing was really going on from a powertrain... Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Absolutely. I mean, three or four years ago, that was a zero. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah. Okay. All right. Thank you. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Rich, our guidance for automotive \u2013 so continued strong growth in powertrain and EVs as Blake mentioned. Our overall auto business, we expect to grow below the company average in fiscal 2018. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Low single-digits. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Does that apply to consumer as well? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: No. Consumer will be at about the company average and heavy industry would be a little above. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then, as we think about the mix of sales just on an organic basis, as we think about heavy industry coming back and growing faster and that would imply more solutions-oriented revenues. As we think about that mix and the impact on incrementals as we go through the year, is there something we should be thinking about where maybe the early part of the year, stronger incrementals and the second half of the year moderates a bit? Any guidance there? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. So Rich, our guidance assumes that our solutions and services will grow just a little faster than our product businesses. And when I say faster, it's like within a point or so of our product businesses. In terms of conversion, I would expect year-over-year earnings conversion to be stronger in the second half than in the first half, with some of the reasons I mentioned earlier impacting or related to the comparisons for Q1. So stronger earnings conversion in second half than first half year-over-year. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So mix is not a big issue and it's really a comp issue in the first half? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Correct and yes. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Got you. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Rich. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius. Please go ahead. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : Give us a sense of why you felt like you had to take investment spending up in Q4 and was it the strong order book that you saw and you just said you got to get ahead of this and add sales marketing or other kind of investments. Or was this \u2013 I'm just trying to get a sense of what was planned and what wasn't planned, because clearly it wasn't in most of our models? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Actually, Scott, the overall spending came in basically where we expected it to be. If we adjust our \u2013 first of all, our sales came in within a few million dollars. Our segment margin \u2013 adjusted for the restructuring charge of $43 million which was not in our guidance, segment margin came in where we expected, currency was a little headwind but basically was in line with where we thought we would end up being. And the net of it is that EPS was about $0.02 better than our midpoint of guidance. So there was no \u2013 let's put it this way, there was no decision during the quarter to just ramp up spending above and beyond what we assumed for Q4. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : Okay. Yeah. was a little light (43:21) versus our models, maybe we just had it wrong. And then just getting back \u2013 and I don't want to beat the dead horse on Emerson, just trying to get some closure here. I mean is this kind of done at any price with \u2013 I mean if Emerson came back at a different price or a different structure, would there be a new process of \u2013 or is this just you guys have decided this is not the right partner and you just want to move forward? Just to be a little clearer on that. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah, Scott, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're here today to discuss our results and fiscal 2018 guidance. We're very confident in the company's strategic direction and in our ability to continue delivering superior levels of growth and value creation, and that's demonstrated today in the strength of our results and our confidence in our strategy and that's where our attention is being focused. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : Okay. Yeah. I was just trying to figure if this is something we're going to be talking about through 2018 or if this is something that's kind of a dead horse and just move on. That's all. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah, Scott, we're not going to speculate on what Emerson Electric or anybody else might do. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : Okay. Fair enough. Okay. I'll pass it on. We'll see you next week, guys. Thank you. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you. See you then. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research : Hey. Good morning, guys. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning, Andy. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research : Blake, so you mentioned oil and gas markets improved pretty materially in the quarter. What do you think changed? Was it larger projects started to come back, and you mentioned that heavy industries can now grow clearly higher than the company average in 2018. Is that across the board including mining, chemical? I know you mentioned semicon and oil and gas. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. In general, we do see broad-based recovery in heavy industries, and we already saw pieces of that this year. We talked about the strong performance in semiconductor. We saw metals. Pulp and paper, while it's a small vertical, saw a significant growth. And now we're seeing oil and gas returning and it's a mix of MRO, as well as some larger projects. Obviously, natural gas continues to be an interesting part of that segment. And we see mining \u2013 we're seeing some renewed activity in Latin America, for instance, in the mines in Chile and so on as copper prices get up above $3. So we really do see that as a broad-based recovery across heavy industries, and we think we're very well positioned to take advantage of that. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research : Okay. That's helpful, Blake. And then, Patrick, I think you mentioned that solutions was going to grow faster than products in 2018. When I look at your two segments though, you have tough compares in both, but obviously strong order momentum going into the year. The CP&S actually grow faster than A&S as you go throughout the year given that solutions is pretty late cycle. And I think you mentioned 0.98 in book-to-bill and that might have been a little lower in solutions than you thought. But, obviously, there does seem to be a momentum there, so maybe you talk about that. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. So, actually, we would expect \u2013 we expect both segments to grow at about similar rates in fiscal 2018. Solutions and services within Control Products & Solutions will grow a little bit faster than the products part within that segment. And then, what was the other part of your question, Andy? Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research : Did you say book-to-bill was 0.98 and a little bit... Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research : ...weaker than normal seasonality. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: No. Actually... Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research : Any color there? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. It was 0.98. That is actually a little bit stronger than typical for Q4. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research : Felt stronger than typical. Okay. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. It is. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research : Led by oil and gas and the heavy businesses? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. And as Blake mentioned, generally speaking, we had a good Q4 order intake. Our orders were up high-single digits for the overall company in the fourth quarter. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research : Great. Thanks, guys. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Andy. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Andy. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Please go ahead. Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Just wanted to start, if we could \u2013 I think you might have said this in the last question there, Patrick. But look, when I look at A&S growth trajectory into next year, kind of framing it with your guide, we're going to start getting into some pretty tough, like, I think in the first quarter you guys grew 8% and then 14% in the second quarter. So how does A&S kind of look through kind of as we pace out the year relative to your total guidance? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. So as I mentioned to Andy, we expect A&S to be about in line with the overall company in terms of organic growth. So that's about 5%. And you're right, the comps will get more difficult, but that's what we project for A&S. We expect continued growth as we said in consumer. Don't forget A&S also has exposure to heavy industries. Our Logix platform is sold in process industries and other heavy industries. And so we expect continued good growth associated with that. Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And then you mentioned the $100 million \u2013 Blake, you mentioned a $100 million contribution from powertrain and EV next year. Is that an incremental $100 million or what is that off of? Like, what was it in 2017? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: The way you can think about it is that number about three years ago was probably close to zero. And so it is not an incremental 2018 versus 2017, but it is the growth that we have seen over the last two, three years and expect in fiscal 2018 that by the end of fiscal 2018, we think that EV and powertrain combined will be a $100 million business and basically, that's business that we didn't have three plus years ago. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: And maybe with a little bit more detail on that. So when we started talking about powertrain explicitly as we reentered that market, we talked about around $20 million of incremental business a year from powertrain. As EV has grown very fast and it's many of the same customers, that's an additional boost to, again, a business that we didn't participate in that is basically growing market and our share over the last few years. And now, it's at that $100 million figure. Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. And Patrick just one quick clarification. On your tax rate guidance for next year, does that include or exclude, I couldn't hear before like the impact of or some estimate for stock option exercise? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: It's inclusive. Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks guys. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Justin Bergner from Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead. Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company: Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. My first question just relates to the effective currency. Could you explain why currency was a headwind to margins in the fourth quarter and how it will affect your guidance in 2018? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yes. So every time we are in a quarter where we see significant currency swings, we get into balance sheet remeasurements, which may impact the performance of the OE impact of currency compared to what the top line of currency is doing. And that's why in Q4, whereas from a sales point of view, currency was a small tailwind. The margin and earnings impact was actually a modest headwind. For fiscal 2018, we're projecting a 2.5% sales contribution for currency and based on the currency rate as we see \u2013 and we used projections 12 months out, based on those currency projections, we expect about a 20% earnings conversion on the sales contribution from currency. And so that's why you get to the tailwind and EPS associated with currency that we show on the EPS bridge. Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company: Great. Thank you. And my second question was just relating to Emerson if I may. I mean, are there assets within Emerson's automation portfolio that are attractive to Rockwell? And could an alternative transaction structure be of interest, versus the one proposed? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. Justin, we're not going to comment on that. We're going to continue to focus on the Q4 results and the outlook for 2018. Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Thank you for taking my questions. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Operator, we're going to take one more question. Operator : Okay. Your next question comes from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you so much for taking my question. It's not an Emerson question, I promise. Connected Enterprise investments, I understand you're going to give a lot of detail on this next week at Automation Fair. But can you help us just understand a little bit those investments, how much investment we're talking about, really kind of thinking about this split between, say, R&D and growing the sales footprint? In other words, just kind of what do you need to accomplish to get Connected Enterprise growth on your target structuring (53:03)? Thanks. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Sure. Well, Noah, let me start by saying the Connected Enterprise and bringing it to life for our customers is focused on producing outcomes for them that make them more productive. And so that's a combination of the technology and the domain expertise, and an overall approach to working with them as they go on their journey to add that additional level of productivity. It starts by putting the foundation in place where the data is born, so that's the smart products, that's Logix, which are fundamental parts of the Connected Enterprise. And so the investments that continue are to add more performance to Logix, to add more predictive analytics to PowerFlex drives, to more tightly integrate visualization with our logic-solving platform. All those things are fundamental parts of the Connected Enterprise, and that's where a lot of our spending has and will continue to go. But it's also about the new value that we deliver from the Connected Enterprise. And so as we integrate control and information across the enterprise, we've got home field advantage. The data is born on our smart products that can be turned into useful information that helps these customers become more productive. So it's investments in information software, our own as well as the ability to integrate with other applications, because nobody has all the software under their own roof that's necessary, and because the technology moves too fast. And that's where our partner strategy is so valuable. It's also a focus area for acquisitions for us. And as I mentioned, it's not just about the technology, it's also about the domain expertise and the support. All of the Connected Enterprise pilots that we're engaged in, that you'll hear about next week, and there's over four dozen of those that we're tracking, all of those involve engineering to complement the technology. And so investments in consulting services, in project management, all the things that are so important to make sure that the project goes right and that the value for the customer is maximized, those are parts of our investments as well. So all of that together, that overall approach is what customers are responding so favorably to as we bring the Connected Enterprise to life. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you very much for the color. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. Operator : And at this time, we'll now turn the call back to Mr. Etzel for closing remarks. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Okay. That concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining us. Operator : At this time, you may now disconnect. Thank you very much.",

Vladimir Bystricky - Citigroup Joshua Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co. Tristan Margot - Cowen and Company Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities Operator : Thank you for holding, and welcome to Rockwell Automation's Quarterly Conference Call. I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Steve Etzel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Etzel, please go ahead. Steven Etzel : Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Patrick Goris, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that website for replay for the next 30 days. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. So with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck. We had a good start to fiscal 2018. Organic growth was just above 5%, which was in line with our expectations. Continuing the trend we saw last quarter, growth was again broad-based across the regions. From a vertical perspective, Heavy Industries performed well and were up high single digits in the quarter, including good growth in oil and gas, chemicals, semiconductor and metals. Consumer was about flat. Transportation was weaker than we expected with Automotive down about 5%. From a regional perspective, the U.S., our largest market, grew over 5% organically. We saw good growth in Heavy Industries, partially offset by softness in the Automotive and Consumer verticals. Oil and gas grew double digits. EMEA was up 5%, a continuation of the good growth we saw in the fourth quarter. Sales to OEM machine builders remained strong. In Asia, we saw a double-digit growth in China. India was about flat, and Japan and Korea were down. Recall that Asia was up 20% in Q1 last year, so certainly a tough comparison. Latin America grew 8.5% led by Heavy Industries and Consumer. I'll make a few additional comments about the quarter. Logix was up 6% compared to last year. Our Process business continues to do well and was up 12% year-over-year organically. This includes the results of our MAVERICK acquisition, which is now included in organic sales. Adjusted EPS was up 12%, reflecting solid operating performance. Patrick will elaborate on our first quarter financial performance in his remarks. Let's move on now to our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2018. Global macroeconomic conditions remain solid based on PMI measures and the latest forecast for global GDP and industrial production. Obviously, U.S. tax reform is an important event, but we are optimistic that the impact of U.S. tax reform on our customers' investment decisions could provide an additional tailwind to our future performance. It is too early to quantify the benefits. An immediate benefit of tax reform for us is a lower effective tax rate in Q1 and going forward. The lower tax rate will drive improved profitability, thus, giving us the ability to make additional investments. Another benefit of tax reform to Rockwell is that we will have much more flexibility to deploy capital. That said, I want to emphasize that our investment and capital deployment priorities remain the same, as summarized on Slide 4. Our first priority is investing in our business to drive organic growth. A new guidance for fiscal 2018 includes incremental investments to accelerate profitable growth and other long-term objectives. Examples include accelerated software development, investments to help our employees be even more engaged and productive and, importantly, spending to enable customer innovation and complement our existing workforce development initiatives. Our next priority is strategic acquisitions. We are actively engaged in the evaluation of inorganic opportunities to accelerate our connected enterprise strategy. We will then return remaining excess cash to share owners through dividends and repurchases. Turning to guidance. We still expect our fiscal 2018 organic sales to be up 5% year-over-year at the midpoint of guidance and expect full year reported sales to be about $6.7 billion, including the impact of currency. Compared to our expectations back in November, we now see slightly better growth in Heavy Industries and a weaker Transportation vertical. We continue to expect Consumer to grow at about the company average. We are adjusting our EPS guidance to include the expected impact of U.S. tax reform on our full year results. Our new adjusted EPS guidance range is $7.60 to $7.90. Patrick will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks, including more specifics on the impact of tax reform on our Q1 financial results and fiscal 2018 guidance. Before I turn it over to Patrick, let me add a few closing comments. At Automation Fair in November, we showcased how we are bringing The Connected Enterprise to life for our customers. We continue to make progress executing this strategy, and the new value from The Connected Enterprise continues to grow at a double-digit rate. You've heard before from us how we practice what we preach, and I'm glad to say that we are being recognized for our efforts. Our Twinsburg, Ohio plant recently received the 2017 Plant Engineering magazine top plant award for its innovative use of technology to enhance work or productivity. We've deployed our own manufacturing execution software and analytic tools to optimize productivity, improve quality and increase sustainability. Congratulations to the team. Finally, I would like to thank our employees, partners and suppliers for their contributions to another successful quarter.  With that, I'll turn it over to Patrick. Patrick? Patrick Goris : Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our quarterly results, let me make a few additional comments about U.S. corporate tax reform. The new tax law not only leads to a lower expected -- effective tax rate going forward, but also provides us with greater flexibility to deploy the cash we have, regardless of where it is generated. Like many other U.S. companies, we've had a large amount of excess cash held outside the U.S. We have initiated the repatriation of that cash, a process that will go beyond the current fiscal year. As Blake mentioned, our priorities for capital deployment remain the same. Funding accelerated organic growth remains priority #1 followed by acquisitions, then the dividend and, finally, share repurchases. In Q1, we recorded provisional charges associated with tax reform totaling about $480 million. These charges include $386 million for the deemed repatriation and $94 million to reduce the value of net deferred tax assets. We excluded the $480 million charges related to tax reform from adjusted EPS, And updates in future quarters to our estimates of these charges will also be excluded from adjusted EPS. With that, let's move to Slide 5, Key Financial Information, first quarter. As Blake mentioned, we had a good first quarter of the fiscal year with reported sales up 6.5%. Organic growth was in line with our expectations at 5.3%. Currency translation contributed 2.5 points to sales growth, a bit less than we expected. And the fiscal 2017 Q4 divestiture reduced sales by 1.3 points. Segment operating margin was very strong at 22.4%, up 120 basis points compared to last year. A margin tailwind from good organic growth was partially offset by higher investment spending. Margin performance in the quarter was a bit better than we expected, as overall operating performance was very strong, but also because spend was a bit light.  General corporate net expense of $16 million was up slightly compared to last year. You will note on our financial statements that we excluded about $11 million of third-party advisory costs related to the Emerson proposals from general corporate net and from adjusted EPS. These costs were not included in our November guidance and are unrelated to the operating performance of the company. Adjusted EPS of $1.96 was up $0.21 compared to the first quarter of last year, an increase of 12%. The year-over-year increase in adjusted EPS is primarily due to the benefit of higher sales, offset by investment spending. Last quarter, I mentioned during our earnings call that we did not expect our Q1 EPS to exceed last year's. However, our actual Q1 results came in better than expected, mainly as a result of the much lower-than-expected tax rate and, to a lesser extent, better-than-expected segment operating margin performance. Free cash flow was $179 million in the quarter or 70% of adjusted income. During the quarter, we paid the annual incentives that our employees earned in fiscal 2017. There was no such payment in the first quarter of last year. A few additional items to cover not shown on the slide. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 130.1 million, up 0.4 million from last year. And we repurchased about 1.1 million shares in the quarter at a cost of $208.6 million. This is ahead of pace to get to the $500 million full year target we shared with you last quarter. More on that in a little bit. At December 31, we had $400 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Slide 6 provides the sales and margin performance overview for the Architecture & Software segment. This segment had another quarter -- another good quarter with more than 7% sales growth. Organic sales were up 4.6% year-over-year and currency translation increased sales by 2.7%. For the quarter, segment margin remained pretty flat year-over-year at a very strong 30%. Operating leverage associated with the sales growth was offset by higher investment spending. Moving on to Slide 7, Control Products & Solutions. Reported sales were up 5.8% for this segment. Organic sales growth was 5.9%, currency translation contributed 2.3% and divestiture reduced sales by 2.4%. Growth in our solutions and services businesses in this segment picked up nicely in the quarter and came in at over 6%. The product businesses in this segment were up more than 5% on an organic basis. Operating margin for this segment increased 200 basis points compared to Q1 last year, primarily due to higher sales. Very good margin performance for this segment. Book-to-bill performance for our solutions and services businesses in this segment was 1.20 in Q1 compared to 1.11 a year ago.  The next slide, 8, provides an overview of our sales performance by region. Blake covered most of this slide in his remarks, so I will just reiterate that, like last quarter, growth was broad-based across geographies. Also we saw good growth in emerging markets, which were up just under 10% compared to last year.  This takes us to Slide 9, guidance. We continue to project sales of about $6.7 billion with organic sales growth within a range of 3.5% to 6.5%. We updated our currency assumptions, and we now expect that tailwind from currency translation to be closer to 2%, rounding really. And the sale of the business in fiscal '17 will, of course, remain about a 1-point headwind. We continue to expect segment operating margin to be a bit below 21.5%. We believe the full year adjusted effective tax rate will be about 21%, 3.5 points lower than our November guidance and mainly as a result of tax reform. Our current estimate is that for fiscal '19 and beyond, under the new law, our adjusted effective tax rate will be in the range of 19% to 21%. We're now targeting about $1.2 billion in share repurchases for fiscal '18, up from $500 million per our November guidance. To support this increased share repurchase activity, our board recently approved a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization. We now expect average fully diluted shares outstanding to be about 128.4 million for fiscal '18. We are increasing adjusted EPS guidance range to $7.60 to $7.90. At the midpoint, this implies a $0.40 increase compared to our November guidance. The lower tax rate accounts for about $0.35 of this increase and a lower expected share count for the remaining $0.05. The incremental investments Blake referred to in his comments and somewhat unfavorable mix are, for the most part, offset by stronger-than-expected core performance. A couple of other items to close. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion to be about 100% and general corporate net is still expected to be about $75 million for the full year. With that, we'll move to Q&A. Steve? Steven Etzel : Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Operator, let's take our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Richard Eastman : Blake, could you kind of maybe elaborate, if you would, on maybe the abrupt deceleration on the expectations around the Transportation, if you could just speak to maybe whether it's geographically or other? Blake Moret : Yes. I don't think we would call it isolated to a single geography. Although we certainly saw weaker-than-expected performance in the U.S., it's not purely projects, some of which have been pushed out. It's also the MRO spend. We have a very large installed base and so that's a significant portion of our Automotive business in any given quarter. We continue to see new program commitments, particularly in EV. And you've seen some of the news from some of the big brand owners about their large investments in that area. But it's hard to predict the timing of whether some of the business that we're already tracking will come in, in 2018 or push out to 2019. So I would call it, mixed results, but it's -- it includes some MRO as well as program softness. Richard Eastman : Okay. And then just as a follow-up question. Patrick, could you just kind of speak to -- you had mentioned in the segment profit commentary that investments in the first quarter came in a little bit light of expectations, could you just perhaps maybe put a number on the shortfall there to plan? And then also does that come back in the second quarter and actually increase a bit with your commentary around more cash flow, more flexibility on investments? Patrick Goris : Rick, it was a few pennies of EPS. And our assumption is that some of that will come back in the balance of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Vladimir Bystricky : This is Vlad Bystricky on for Andy. So you highlighted growth led by Heavy Industries, including oil and gas. So can you talk about, within oil and gas, how that market is evolving, whether you're seeing larger projects start to come back in oil and gas specifically and then more broadly in Heavy Industry, whether you're seeing accelerated large project activity? Blake Moret : Yes. So in oil and gas, the strength and growth is a mix of what we might characterize as more flow business as well as some large projects starting to hit. So I think we are seeing that across segment profile of the various types of business. There are other parts of Heavy Industries that are also strengthening. So we're seeing it in metals, for instance. Pulp and paper in several industries. We include semiconductor in Heavy and that continues to be at high levels of spending. Vladimir Bystricky : Okay, that's helpful. And then can you maybe just give us a little more color on orders during the quarter? Did you generally see a continuation of, I think, you talked about high single-digit order growth in 4Q? And did you see any change in order trajectory as the quarter progressed? Blake Moret : We saw a little bit of softness at the very end of December. I will say that January orders -- or business has started in line with guidance. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Wolfe Research. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Yes. So I missed part of the initial comments. I'm on another conference call. But I guess, any comments or any feedback from customers so far on how accelerated depreciation or a write-off there drives more spending? It sounds like if through January, your order rates are in line with guidance, you're not really seeing that acceleration. Is there any pause or kind of pipe -- a pipeline of project accumulation that's still ongoing? Maybe try to calibrate that for us. Blake Moret : Sure. I think there's a substantial amount of optimism in the market, particularly among U.S. manufacturers, but broad-based across many verticals. And that optimism, whether it's in the treatment of capital investments or lower tax rate to be more competitive worldwide, there's a lot of things to be optimistic about. It's too early to quantify those benefits. So we need a couple of points to be able to draw a line and to be able to come up with a magnitude of the potential impact on additional spend on the part of our customers. But the mood is definitely optimistic. Joshua Pokrzywinski : And just a follow-up on the order commentary from last quarter. I think, even the last question, I think high single-digit order rates coming out of Q4, unusual for Rockwell as a company to talk about kind of consolidated order rates, but I've always thought of you as a shorter-cycle business. And clearly, organic growth was less than high singles, Is there some pipeline building here or backlog that get you -- gets you guys particularly excited? How should we think about that high single-digit pacing out to the business? Blake Moret : So when we talk about the strengthening in Heavy Industries, Heavy Industries is biased more towards our solutions business, services and solutions, which is a longer-cycle business. So in that business, some aspects of it may have, on average, a 5- or a 6-month lead time. So we get a little more visibility for that. And because Heavy Industries are up and we talk about a strong book-to-bill in the quarter, we are seeing increased backlog. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Kristen Owen : This is Kristen on for Noah. Just wanted to follow up on some of the conversations that you're having with customers, particularly with your auto customers. Are you talking with them about what's going on with NAFTA? And do you see any risks to your customers from that point of view? Blake Moret : No, we're not hearing our U.S.-based manufacturers talk about spending with us being impacted as a result of that. Obviously, we're seeing some very large spending being announced by some of our good U.S. customers. I think Ford made an announcement a week or 2 ago, and we'll continue to see that biased around EV. Outside of North America, I can say that earlier this month, I was in China meeting with automotive customers and I was very encouraged. I was talking to indigenous Chinese companies. So these weren't JVs or U.S. companies servicing the China market, wanting to talk to us, a lot in the EV space, both in terms of brand owners as well as Tier suppliers. And there's obviously a lot of activity going on there, a lot of new players. And I'm happy to see that we're covering all of them. Kristen Owen : That's helpful color. And then just wanted to follow up on the A&S margins, really impressive there. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on some of the puts and takes. What's the natural leverage of that business off of organic growth versus how much are you really allocating toward reinvestments there? Patrick Goris : Yes, so you're correct. The margin is at 30%, and that's a very high level. We expect it actually to be the high point for the year for this segment. It's really a function of organic growth offset by investments. As we intend to increase some of the investments during the balance of the year, we think that the segment margin there for the balance of the year and the full year will be a bit below the margins we saw in Q1. In terms of incremental margins for that segment, I would recommend you look over a longer period of time over several quarters as to what the incremental earnings has been or the earnings conversion for that segment. If we talk from an overall company perspective in incrementals of 30% to 35%, earnings conversion at mid-single-digit organic growth, we would usually expect earnings conversion a little bit better than that within Architecture & Software. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Tristan Margot : This is Tristan in for Joe. I just wanted to go back to the incremental CapEx in software that you mentioned in your prepared remarks. Is that for a specific product or specific industry? Could you just elaborate on this? Patrick Goris : You refer to the incremental investments that Blake mentioned in his comments? Tristan Margot : Yes, specifically in software where you're investing. Blake Moret : Sure. So in software, a couple of the main areas of software investment and these aren't new, so these are strengthening existing investments. We talked a lot about the new value from The Connected Enterprise as including information software. And so we certainly see increased investment there, but also in our core. In our core would be the control, the configuration tools as well as the visualization software. That's an important area for us, as we have a common software environment for all the different types of control, whether it be discrete or process or hybrid. And we continue to invest heavily in those areas to simplify the experience throughout the life cycle. So whether it's in the design part of a control project, they operate or the maintain, those are important areas that, we think, we provide differentiation and we intend to continue that. Tristan Margot : That's very helpful. And then if we could just shift on Logix. It looks like it was the slowest growth since 4Q '16, if I'm not mistaken. Is there any reason for this? Any comments there? Patrick Goris : I would start out by saying that Logix still grows above the A&S average. The other thing I would point out is that we've had a really good year in Logix last year. It was up 10% year-over-year for the full year. And in Q1 of '18, we grew 6% on top of 8% organic growth, which we delivered in Q1 of fiscal '17. So I think continued good growth in Logix becomes -- become a little bit tougher. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities. Richard Kwas : Yes. I jumped on late, but just a couple of quick follow-ups on the order slowdown in December. Any particular verticals that you would cite as being more significant than expected? Patrick Goris : Rich, this was at the very end of December, the last week or so of the year. It was just slower than what we expected. It was in the U.S. No particular vertical. Richard Kwas : No particular, okay. And then on the auto commentary, Ford is changing their plans around electrification and devoting a lot more investment and CapEx to electrification over the next few years. In terms of your thoughts on what you're seeing in terms of the slowdown, anything attributable to kind of just shift in plans and that maybe there's a push or delay? Or do you think it's maybe early stages of something more fundamental? Just curious. Blake Moret : Yes. I think we continue to see the basic backdrop of softened SAR, so there is certainly a reduced growth in the overall units. On the other hand, we see the mix of the brand owners continuing to be strongest in their highest-profit products, so the trucks and so on. And that's good for us, as well. EV and the number of new suppliers, the number of new models envisioned, that's an offset to the general reduced growth in the raw number of units being produced. It's hard to say how those will end up balancing, but what we're guiding to is about flat for auto for the full year. Patrick Goris : And maybe to add to that, that's compared to fiscal '17 where auto globally was up over 20%. Richard Kwas : Right. So some of it's comp-related, right? Patrick Goris : Yes. Auto was up over 10% Q1 last year. Operator : If there are no more questions, I'll turn the call back over to Steve Etzel. Steven Etzel : Okay. That concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining us. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. Later in the call, we will open up the lines for questions. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Steve Etzel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Etzel, please go ahead. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's second quarter fiscal 2018 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Patrick Goris, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that website for replay for the next 30 days. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. So with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll start with some key points for the quarter. So please turn to page 3 in the slide deck. This was another good quarter for us. As we expected, organic growth was up 3.5%. From a vertical perspective, heavy industries performed well and grew above the company average in the quarter, led by growth in oil and gas, mining, metals and semiconductor. Consumer grew above the company average as well. Transportation declined in Q2 on tough year-over-year comps. Through the first half of the year, automotive was down a little more than 5%. Sequentially, our global automotive business was up in Q2. Revenue associated with Information Solutions and Connected Services, which represent new value from the Connected Enterprise once again grew double-digits. From a regional perspective, growth was again fairly broad based. The U.S., our largest market, grew 3.6% organically. We saw a good growth in heavy industries partially offset by softness in automotive. Oil and gas grew double-digits in the U.S. for the second quarter in a row. EMEA was down about 1% in the quarter. Asia grew about 4%. China sales were up in line with the company average. China had very strong orders performance in Q2. Latin America was up over 15% led by strength in Mexico and Brazil. I'll make a few additional comments about our performance. Logix was up 5% organically in Q2 compared to last year, including strong growth in CompactLogix, which has grown double-digits six quarters in a row. Our Process business delivered another good quarter and was up about 9% year-over-year. We are pleased with our financial performance in the quarter. Adjusted EPS was up 22% and free cash flow was very strong. In the first half of the fiscal year, organic sales grew 4.4%, adjusted EPS grew 17%, segment operating margins were up 150 basis points year-over-year and free cash flow conversion was 108%. This is very good financial performance for the first half of the year. Patrick will elaborate on our second quarter financial performance in his remarks. I want to spend a minute talking about our investment and capital deployment priorities. Our first priority is to invest in our business to drive organic growth. In January, we described the types of investments we would be making to accelerate profitable growth and increased long-term differentiation. We're ramping up a number of these investments. For example, software development and commercial resources to fuel the growth of our Information Solutions and Connective Services offerings, accelerated investments to expand our Process capabilities, a new electric vehicle center of excellence to be co-located with one of our software development teams based in San Jose, California, and investments in facilities as well as technology, training and benefits to enhance employee engagement globally. On the topic of capital deployment, I'm pleased to report that this morning we announced a 10% dividend increase. This is the second increase in the last 12 months. This increase reflects our confidence in the Connected Enterprise strategy and our ability to deliver sustainable cash generation. Let's move on now to our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2018. The global manufacturing environment remains favorable and macroeconomic indicators are positive. We believe that we are in the early stages of a manufacturing expansion cycle and we will benefit from the very broad array of industries that we serve. Our customers are focused on driving productivity in their operations, which quite simply is our mission. Turning to guidance. We continue to expect our fiscal 2018 organic sales to be up 5% year-over-year at the midpoint of guidance and expect full year reported sales to be about $6.7 billion. Consistent with our January guidance, we expect that heavy industries will be the largest growth driver followed by consumer. Transportation will be flat to down a little for the fiscal year. Taking into account our strong first half results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to $7.70 to $8. Patrick will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks. Before I turn it over to Patrick, let me add a few closing comments. As I mentioned before, we grew double-digits in Information Solutions and Connected Services in Q2. On Monday of this week, we announced significantly enhanced capabilities in our FactoryTalk analytics platform. This is software that turns production data into actionable information that drives productivity, a sizable part of the investments that I mentioned earlier are targeted in this space. This offering is enhanced by a very strong network of partners. We are expanding our Academy of Advanced Manufacturing, which is training veterans for smart manufacturing jobs. The second class graduated this week and graduates are going to work at manufacturers throughout the U.S. For example, five of these veterans will be starting work at an electric vehicle startup in Illinois. I also want to highlight an important recognition we received this quarter. As you have heard me say many times, the dedication of our employees, partners and suppliers makes a different set of customers and is the key to our success. It's not only what they do, but how they do it that helps drive business results and value for our stakeholders. That's why I was so pleased when we, for the 10th time, received the Ethisphere Award naming Rockwell Automation as one of the world's most ethical companies. This recognition is a testament to our strong culture of integrity. With that, I'll turn it over to Patrick. Patrick? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you, Blake, and good morning everyone. I'll start on slide 4, which provides our key financial information for the second quarter. As Blake mentioned, we had a solid quarter of the fiscal year with reported sales up 6.2%, organic growth was in line with our expectations at 3.5%, currency translation contributed 3.9 points of sales growth and the fiscal 2017 Q4 divestiture reduced sales by 1.2 points. Segment operating margin was 20.9%, up 190 basis points compared to last year. A margin tailwind from organic growth, good productivity performance and lower incentive compensation was partly offset by higher investment spending. General corporate net expense of $18 million was down $3 million compared to last year. That's normal variability and timing of corporate costs. Adjusted EPS of $1.89 was up $0.34 compared to the second quarter of last year, an increase of 22%. The year-over-year increase in adjusted EPS is mainly the result of strong operating performance. Free cash flow was very strong in the quarter, $359 million or 148% of adjusted income. A few additional items to cover, not shown on the slide. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 128.5 million, down 1.8 million from last year. We repurchased two-and-a-half million shares in the quarter at a cost of $465 million. Through March 31st, we are a little ahead of pace to get to the $1.2 billion full year target we shared with you last quarter. At March 31st, we had $935 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. And finally, our second quarter fiscal 2018 GAAP results reflect an $11.5 million adjustment to the provisional tax charges that we took in our first quarter related to the Tax Act. As I mentioned on the call last quarter, we are excluding tax charges related to the Tax Act from adjusted EPS. Slide 5 provides the sales and margin performance overview for the Architecture & Software segment. This segment had about 7% sales growth. Organic sales were up 2.5% year-over-year and currency translation increased sales by 4.4%. You will recall that last year, this segment had an exceptional second quarter with about 14% organic sales growth, so certainly a tough quarter to lap. For the quarter, segment margin expanded 190 basis points year-over-year to 28.4%. Margin tailwind from higher sales, good productivity and lower incentive compensation was partially offset by higher investment spending. Moving on to slide 6, Control Products & Solutions, reported sales were up 5.7% for this segment. Organic sales growth was 4.4%. Currency translation contributed 3.6% and the 2017 divestiture reduced sales by 2.3%. Organic growth in our solutions and services businesses in this segment came in at 6%. Growth in the product businesses in this segment was similar to the Architecture & Software segment growth on an organic basis. Operating margin for this segment increased 180 basis points compared to Q2 last year, primarily due to higher sales, good productivity and lower incentive compensation expense; another quarter of good margin performance for this segment. Book-to-bill performance for our solutions and services business in this segment was 1.08 in Q2 following an exceptionally strong 1.2 in Q1 and 1.17 a year ago. The next slide, 7, provides an overview of our sales performance by region. Blake covered most of this slide in his remarks. So I will just point out that for Q2, emerging markets organic growth was up about 7% and for the first half of fiscal 2018 we saw broad-based growth across all regions. Before I turn to guidance, let me make a couple of comments about the recently announced tariffs, some of which have little to no impact on our business and some of which we're still reviewing. With regards to Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum enacted in March 2018, we do not buy large quantities of commodities including steel or aluminum. While we have seen increases in the price of steel and aluminum in anticipation of these tariffs, the impact of these tariffs on our input costs is immaterial to our overall results. Similarly, the tariffs implemented by China in early April do not impact our products. The other group of tariffs relate to certain goods imported into the U.S. from China that have been proposed by the U.S. following the Section 301 investigation as well as the additional tariffs that China has proposed on U.S. goods imported into China. As you know, these tariffs have not been enacted yet and there remains a lot of uncertainty about the particulars of what may be implemented including any exemptions. We're analyzing the potential implications to our business including opportunities that may be available to mitigate impacts of these tariffs, should they get enacted. Given the fluid nature of the matter, however, it is too soon to discuss any specifics. This takes us to slide 8, the guidance. We continue to project sales of about $6.7 billion with organic sales growth within a range of 3.5% to 6.5%. Our assumptions for currency remain largely the same. We continue to expect the tailwind from currency translation to be about 2% and the sale of the business in fiscal 2017 of course will remain about a 1 point headwind to sales. Our organic growth guidance of about 5% of the midpoint implies that the organic growth in the second half of fiscal 2018 will be about 5.5% compared to 4.4% organic growth in the first half of fiscal 2018. The expected increase of organic growth in the second half compared to the first half of the fiscal year is driven by higher expected growth rates in our solutions and services businesses, and to a much lesser extent, by higher backlogs in our product businesses at the end of Q2. We continue to expect segment operating margin to be a bit below 21.5%. First half segment margin was a bit above that and as we increased investments, we expect segment margin in the second half to be about 21%. This implies full year core earnings conversion of about 35%, consistent with our November and January guidance. General corporate net expense is expected to be between $75 million and $80 million for the full year. We believe the full year adjusted effective tax rate will now be closer to 20.5%. 0.5 point lower than our January guidance. We continue to target about $1.2 billion in share repurchases for fiscal 2018 and now expect fully diluted shares outstanding to be about $127.5 million for fiscal 2018. We are increasing the adjusted EPS guidance range to $7.70 to $8. At the midpoint, this is a $0.10 increase compared to our January guidance. This reflects our strong first half performance and the favorable tax rate and share count compared to our January guidance. At the midpoint, this represents 16% year-over-year EPS growth on 6% higher reported sales, primarily due to strong operating performance. And finally, we now expect free cash flow conversion for fiscal 2018 to be about 105%. In summary, we had another solid quarter and we expect fiscal 2018 to be another year of good financial performance for us. With that, we'll move to Q&A. Steve. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible. So please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Operator, let's take our first question. Operator : Your first question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, everyone. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Blake, on auto, so flat to down a bit here in the first half, expect flat for the year, flat to slightly down for overall transportation. What kind of visibility are you starting to build for 2019? It looks like from a launch standpoint at least in North America, a number of launches for the Detroit based manufacturers goes up pretty significantly in calendar 2019. So just wanted to get your thoughts on when you would start to see some of the revenue benefit from that? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. I think the outlook for 2019, for both traditional automotive as well as electric vehicle, continues to look positive. So we saw a return to MRO spend in the traditional business in Q2. We had mentioned some comments of concerns at the end of Q1, and we saw those more traditional levels restored. And then from some of the commitments that we've received in the quarter, 2019 is shaping up to be generally positive for us. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And would that apply both to tire and auto, or how would you...? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: There's been some good activity in tire as well. If we talk about North America, I would say, the particular area of activity for 2019 has been in the electric vehicles side, in terms of new commitments and that's really around the world. We've seen some important projects that we've been named on in China as well as in the U.S. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then on Europe, so down and look like project timing, how should we think about kind of cadence of organic growth here for the next couple of quarters, face some tougher comparisons in the second half, anything, I guess maybe Patrick, you could help on with regards to cadence of organic growth? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Rich, is that specific to Europe or just in general? Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Well, in general and then just a comment on Europe would be helpful. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. I'll start with Europe. So Europe was down about 1 point in the second quarter, and obviously, we had a tough comp in Europe. Europe was up about 12% last year and what we see is the timing of some of the projects that create some noise. With respect to timing of organic growth for the balance of the year for the whole company, we think that the year-over-year growth will be somewhat similar in Q3 and in Q4, maybe little bit more weighted in the fourth quarter of the year, but I don't expect big differences in overall growth rates Q3 versus Q4, maybe a little overweighed in Q4. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yes, Rich, if I can add as well. We did see some moderate sequential growth through the quarter, and then from Q1 to Q2 as we mentioned, the automotive shipments did see sequential growth. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Rich. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Good morning. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Morning. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Can you talk about the competitive environment a bit. There's been some \u2013 obviously ABB kind of moved in and stoked up their discrete presence. Are you seeing anything there globally where there were B&R or some of the smaller guys are becoming more effective; any change there? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Not really. I mean as we've talked about before, B&R was a good competitor when they were independent. ABB will be continue to be a strong competitor with B&R, but we're not seeing any wholesale change in terms of the competitive environment based on the combination. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then I guess with the start to the year, I mean to get to high end of the range it seems like you need a pretty significant pickup in the second half. How should we about that? I mean was there any thought to kind of taking off the high end of the range on sales given the start to the year even though the EPS moves up obviously because of better margins and little bit of tax. It just seems like that's \u2013 or is that what you're seeing in your business. You still think there's a shot at getting to that high end of the range? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: As the mix is biasing towards heavy industries, heavy industries has greater exposure to projects and those are going to come in in a more lumpy fashion. We've seen good book-to-bill over the last couple of quarters. If we see some projects large for us, that could come any time. And so when those projects come and when we start to recognize revenue from those projects, could have a significant impact on the end of the year. So that's why we have that baked into the high-end of that range. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. One last one. What is your auto guidance for the year on growth, organic, for auto global? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Flat to slightly down, Steve. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot for the detail. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Just back a little bit, maybe a different take on kind of the competitive environment question. Obviously, you've invested a fair amount in Connected Enterprise, and you'd mentioned a couple of things today, but I wonder if you \u2013 just kind of re-evaluating the landscape, you know the approach of kind of us and our friends are, are you leaving too much of your growth upside to your friends and partners? Do you need to tweak what you're doing or how you're doing? I'm sure this is an evolutionary process, something you don't wake up in the morning and say, yeah, we need to shift gears, but is there, Blake, any evolution in your thinking on how to competitively address the market? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Jeff, I think it's a good question and I think evolution is the way to look at it in that. We're constantly evaluating given the pace of the technology changes, what we need to do, what is core to us versus what we can provide a more robust solution to our customers by partnering and obviously acquisitions are a part of that as well. So things that maybe 10 years ago we thought would be something best left to partners or things that we might be looking at more as a part of what our core capabilities need to be going forward in terms of technology as well as expertise. And so we're constantly looking at that. What that doesn't mean is that we think we need to have a single monolithic closed approach to having every application that our customers might need and every bit of expertise because we don't think anybody is going to have best-in-brand top to bottom there. So to be able to provide the best solution, to provide an open framework for our customers to be able to accommodate existing installed base as well as what they might need in the future to take advantage of small nimble companies that have good ideas that can fit into our framework, that's still very much a part of our strategy but we're constantly evaluating what we need to own versus what we need to partner with and those partners again are going to be a combination of big well-known names like Microsoft as well as smaller companies that have good ideas that can fit into our system and can take advantage of our market access. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Will it follow from that that the size of your M&A would increase though, that you have a small vertical bolt-on even I'd put MAVERICK in that category, right gives you chemical, is that still the game plan or do you think the size of what you need to do or want to do is increasing? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: I'd say if you look at our funnel, it's increased both in terms of the range including some larger, larger acquisitions than we might have thought about before as well as the number and in particular our focus areas. So we talked about our priorities for acquisition, the Information Solutions, Connected Services, increasing access in some of the emerging markets. We're looking first at the strategic fit and then we're looking at the financial impact and we're very active in that area of the company. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Line is open. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : Blake, you made a comment, just said in your prepared remarks that we're in the early stages of the manufacturing cycle. How is this playing out? I mean, based on your experience at least, things seem a little bit weird or a little bit slow for this time in the cycle, meaning I know auto will probably hurt you 100 basis points or so, but even if you back that out growth maybe 4.5%, doesn't really feel like an up cycle in a traditional way. And I think as Steve Tusa noted, you need to pick up in the back half of the year to hit your growth numbers. So my question really is, do you see it in your order books in a real way, in your customer commentary that this indeed is an up cycle or are your comments more based on macro data? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. I think there's a combination of factors that we triangulate to arrive at that outlook. First of all, our business, over a long period of time ever since I've been in business, is correlated to industrial production. And obviously industrial production forecasts will change when you get to the actuals, but if you look at the actual IP over decades, it's correlated pretty well to our growth where our growth is a multiple of that. IP, particularly in the U.S. is that the highest rate that it's been at in years. Now, the mix by vertical is certainly changing. There's no question that auto has moderated from what growth rates we saw last year, but again we're seeing a positive program commits, as the industry transforms to one that's more weighted to EV, then it's going to be volatile. And everybody starting from a small base so run rates and growth quarter-to-quarter is going to be less meaningful than in a mature business. So from a macro standpoint, we see positive signs. In terms of our order book and our backlog, Patrick mentioned before, we had a historically high book-to-bill in Q1. We had good book-to-bill in this quarter. We're chasing projects, we think that are very reasonable, that are good fits for our capabilities, but the mix is changing. And so you're going to see more on the heavy industry side, amidst the fundamentals of consumer and then I've talked before about transportation. From a regional standpoint, emerging markets, high-single-digits, we still see that, that piece is playing out as the growth of the middle class creates demand for things that we're good at helping manufacturers produce, consumer, automotive and then there's obviously semiconductor and other heavy industries that are strengthening. So from a variety of directions, that gives us confidence that we are in the early stages, but I agree with you Scott about the weirdness of this. I mean capital with our customers has still remained on the sidelines compared to some of the historic ratios. And where we think that our fundamental mission of helping them increase productivity whether they have in their minds large capital projects or not, we're still in our wheelhouse to be able to help them be able to save money and time. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : Yeah. Makes sense. And then just as a follow-up and it doesn't need to be a long follow-up, but electric vehicles from what you sell, particularly given that you're not huge in the drive train historically. I mean, they don't seem to be that different from a Rockwell perspective. So, what do you think requires you to kind of separate out in a center of excellence and plop yourself in the middle of kind of the action, if you will. And do you think it really is a different market for you that you need to approach differently in some way shape or form, or is this just a way to showcase your capabilities a little bit closer to maybe some of the upstarts or startups, et cetera? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: You know, Scott, a lot of the manufacturing processes are the same. I mean assembly, paint, trim and chassis, those are very similar. Whether it's traditional automotive or it's EV, obviously you have the battery, fabrication, the winding that's different. I think what prompts us to create a center of excellence is the nature of the companies. These are startup companies. And while a lot of them have veterans that they've poached away from traditional manufacturers, these are smaller companies and they know that they have to differentiate not only in their technology, but in their business models. And to be able to embed ourselves in that flow of ideas is a big part of what prompted us to open this center of our excellence. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : Okay. Very fair. Good luck, guys. Thank you. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from Steven Winoker with UBS. Your line is open. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks, and good morning all. Hey, I just wanted to follow-up on the \u2013 given the Process and other growth and heavy industry growth you're talking about versus auto, et cetera, can you maybe just once again quantify the impact of that as you're looking into the second half on margin, just the margin mix impact of the relative vertical growth? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Steve, your second half compared to the first half or second half? Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. So in other words, just as Process continues to outgrow the other areas in heavy industry, my understanding is that that profit weighs a little bit more there and I know you've got solutions and services picking up. So just looking for kind of the margin mix impact of the various growth rates within the segment, sort of all rolled up. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: For the back half of the year, you can think, it might be a few tenths of a point negative from the overall company perspective. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: As we've modeled out longer-term the growth process to be sure it has additional labor content in it which is going to be a little less margin rich. On the other hand, when those customers are buying hardware and then they're doing the integration or the VARs are doing the integration into complete solutions, it tends to use a lot of large processors. And so the margin contribution of that when it's sold as products is actually pretty good. So we see, as Patrick said, some dilution if the mix were to change completely over, but there's some puts and takes there. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. And Steve to Blake's point, it's one of the reasons that within the Architecture & Software segment which was up 2.5% in the quarter, Logix did actually much better than that. It was up about 5%, because it has a much better exposure across industries including heavy industries. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then as a second topic on the follow-up. Just getting back to kind of your overall kind of capital deployment, you mentioned the second dividend increase in the last 12 months, but still sitting on that cash, still obviously a lot overseas, but tax changes, you talked with Jeff about increasing M&A to some extent, but I would still \u2013 even if it's number and size of deals, I would make the assumption, it's not outside kind of the long-term Rockwell capital deployment approach. So what can you do or maybe if not feel a need to, but to maybe take up capital deployment especially, if you feel like we're at the early stages of an industrial expansion? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. I think Steve, a couple of things. One, Blake mentioned that in the pipeline, we have larger type deals than what we have done in the past. We have \u2013 in terms of capital deployments in January we did increase substantially the target per share repurchases for this year from $500 million to $1.2 billion and as we just announced today, we're increasing the dividend. And so, I think it's fair to say that we've already significantly increased the amount of capital we're deploying. We've already said that if there is tax reform, we have access to the excess non-U.S. cash, then we would redeploy that over a period of 18 months to 24 months. And I think that we're in the process of doing so. And we want to be careful because if we see an attractive opportunity to deploy capital, we want to keep all the flexibility and doing the share repurchase over a period of time provides us that flexibility. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. We still remain primarily an organic growth story. We think that the Connected Enterprise value proposition which really brings strengths from all parts of the company together remains as vibrant as ever, but we're going to use all of our strengths and some of that is going to be our strong financial position as well. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : All right. But it sounds like based on those numbers that you wouldn't be surprised in a year from now certainly to just be well within a kind of you know normal net debt position from here given all of that? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: I think over a period of say 18 months to 24 months that is not unreasonable. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great thanks. I'll hand it off. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you, Steve. Operator : Next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you and good morning. I just wanted to circle back to this notion that you're sort of ramping up investments because I guess the SG&A is down year-on-year in Q2. Your CapEx I think in the first half is down high-teens year-on-year and your incremental margins moved up a bunch in Q2 even with the top-line slowing. So I realize there's a lot of moving parts in each of those buckets, but could you maybe quantify it all, how much let's say R&D is going up or what kind of higher investment spend in dollars you're referring to? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. So Julian you mentioned SG&A. When we talk investments, a lot of our investments go towards research and development. Our R&D expenses are not part of SG&A. They sit in gross profit. And if you look at our at our gross profit performance, you see that there's not been a big change there in the gross profit margin and one of the reasons is, is that our R&D spending has actually gone up in that area. From an overall spend point of view, you may have heard us talk in the past about a $2 billion-ish base of overhead spending. For the full year, we're targeting about a 3.5% increase, which is about $70 million. We've seen a $70 million increase year-over-year. Of that $70 million, we've seen about a third in the first half of the year and so the other two-thirds we projected that's included in our guidance will happen in the back half of the year. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Understood. Thank you. And then my follow-up, I guess, would be around what you're seeing in China. A bunch of your discrete automation peers, I think, had really high growth numbers there in the March quarter. You all have slowed down, I think, despite an easier comp. So maybe just talk a little bit about what you saw there in revenues and then also orders. Is that where some of those large projects that you think may hit your P&L in the second half coming in, is it in China? Maybe just some color on that market. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Sure. Some of those big projects are in fact in China. So, in Q2 the growth that we saw was driven by a diverse range of industries that included consumer, semiconductor, water treatment, chemical, metals. So it was across the spectrum. I would say maybe the most important story in China was the very strong order development there and that included projects as well as flow business. A couple of examples that we can talk about is a particular electric vehicle manufacturer gave us a pair of multimillion dollar orders; one for their Chinese operations, one for new facility in the U.S. with our MES software. So this fits squarely in that new value from the Connected Enterprise and our software orders that obviously have associated maintenance and support along with that and that really differentiates us from some of those other discrete suppliers in the industry that we can link the real-time control hardware with the information software and services that helps them get even greater productivity. There's some other projects that we're chasing in heavy industries in China and so, I would characterize the outlook of our people in China as quite positive and again it's across a variety of industries. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. And so in China, you think you should grow what's slightly above the company average this year then? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yes. A little below 10% for the full year. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you, Julian. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Hey, good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning. So heavy industries as you know a lot of different end markets within heavy industries. Would you say what gives you confidence in the second half pickup in organic growth that you talked about? Is that you're seeing broad-based growth in heavy industries, whether it's oil and gas, semicon, mining? Maybe you could give us a little bit more color on different markets within heavy industries, and if any of those markets are actually picking up, as we speak? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yes. Andy, in my comments, I referred to the higher growth second half versus the first half of the year. And I referred to higher growth rates particularly in our solutions and services businesses. One of the reasons why we have a good level of comfort with that is that a lot of that already sits in our backlog at the end of March. As you know our solutions and services businesses tend to run at about a six months backlog and so we have a little bit more visibility in those businesses for the back half of the year. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: That's helpful. And then, obviously there is some concern regarding short cycle growth momentum slowing down. So, maybe Blake or Patrick, you could tell us what your distributors are telling you. Have they seen any slowdown in orders with the cadence of the month within the quarter. Did you see generally steady growth. Are they doing any sort of destocking, any color you can provide would be helpful. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: I think the feedback from the distributors matching what we're seeing in our results is general sequential improvement through the quarter. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: And looking for another good year. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Easy enough guys. Thank you. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Noah Kaye, your line is open. Next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks very much. Thanks very much. Good morning. And a nice performance on the operating line. At the same time, we had FX as a pretty significant contributor to revenue. So I was wondering what the impact to margins was from FX. Was it dilutive, accretive, how to think about that? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: It had no impact on segment margins, Noah. It had an EPS benefit, but it had no impact on segment margin in the quarter versus prior year. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Okay. So that's pure operational improvement. Great. And then you know I think you've been asked about the M&A pipeline a couple of different ways, but I guess we would just like to understand. What is sort of a reasonable expectation for full year acquisition spending amount. Obviously, a little bit like to start the year, but you commented to a very healthy and expanding pipeline. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. We targeted in our overall sources of revenue growth, 1 point or more a year from acquisitions. And then obviously, as I mentioned, it's going to be predicated first on the strategic fit, and then we'd look at the financial impact. So over a period of time, 1 point or more of growth. You'll see some years that might be less than that. You'll see other years that will be considerably more as we move forward, but it's an active pipeline. I've talked about the diversity of what's in that pipeline. There's also diversity in terms of what's getting close and what's a little bit further out. So you have now near and far planning out, and that's what we want. We want to charge that pipe so that there's a steady stream of opportunities that are maturing going forward. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Joseph Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey good morning, guys. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So, my first question. I know it's not a huge end market for you, electronics, but I'd be curious to hear any commentary that you have on just intra-quarter what you're seeing on trends. It's been an end market that some other folks have flagged as being pretty choppy. So I'm curious to hear your commentary there. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Sure. Well, starting with the headline; we expect double-digit growth in semiconductor for the year. They're investing a lot. We have a good solution there, particularly when you look at the software, that's being used for overall supervisory control, building management type of applications. It's been big for a long time in Asia and some of the orders we saw in China were associated with the semiconductor facilities in the last quarter, but the impact is beyond Asia as well. And so we're seeing Europe, for instance, having contribution from semicon as well. It's about 5% of our business, but at those growth rates, I look at it as somewhat similar to life sciences. And that when you have those large growth rates, they can have an impact on our overall results and we have some highly differentiated solutions there. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Sure. That makes sense, Blake. Maybe following on, one for Patrick. Just in thinking about the repatriation timing, Patrick maybe you can give us an update on what you're seeing on being able to repatriate the cash that's abroad and should we be thinking about roughly a $2 billion number that will ultimately come back to the U.S.? Any color there would be helpful. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yes. So far this year we have repatriated about $900 million of cash. That's why you see a reduction in our short-term debt and of course some of that we've redeployed through share repurchases. By the end of this fiscal year \u2013 or no, later than the end of this fiscal year, we expect our short-term debt to be close or at zero. The $2.4 billion of excess non-U.S. cash is going to take us, what we said in January, a little bit over a year to bring it all back home. And so some of it will take us into early 2019. And as I said earlier on the call, our expectation is to redeploy it over an 18 months to 24 months period because it provides us a lot of flexibility to do it over the period of time. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got you. Thanks, guys. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Your line is open. Tristan Margot - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning. This is Tristan in for Joe. Thanks for taking the question. I personally believe that it's difficult to identify historic changes if you live through them. So with that in mind, how do you know \u2013 how will we know when Industrie 4.0 evolution is complete? Would be interested in your take on that. Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. I would say for Industrie 4.0 or a customer's journey to their Connected Enterprise, China Manufacturing 2025, all these different terms for integrating control on information. Important principle to keep in mind is that a customer is never done with that. They all embark on that journey at different stages of maturity. So some still needed to put basic automation building blocks in place or update decades old technology. Others have that fundamental real-time control on information and they're looking to integrate additional productivity tools in their enterprise, but wherever they start, that journey doesn't end. There's low-hanging fruit to be sure. I mean we see when we're providing for instance remote monitoring for customers that they can reduce unplanned downtime by as much as 50%, others have more modest goals. So they might be around more rapid startup and so on, but you're never done. Now, looking at the maturity and how it impacts our results in terms of those concepts, we are seeing the move that we talked about before as we go from pilots to more enterprise customer engagement. So people have tried, let's say, pilots. They've gotten confidence that they can save money with some of these concepts and they're moving it out to larger deployments. And so we're seeing the number of customers that are looking at multi-site rollouts of these technologies and services increasing. Tristan Margot - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks. And then if I can follow-up on this and your investment in The Hive, what do you think is the biggest barrier to manufacturers adopting AI? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: So well in terms of taking advantage of AI, I think because manufacturing is largely installed base, very few manufacturers have the luxury of starting with a clean sheet of paper. So they're dealing with older technology that's running their facilities and as they upgrade, they have opportunities to implement new, new techniques. I think that another challenge is the way that the effective use of artificial intelligence spans multiple organizational silos within a company. So you have the expertise on the plant floor that knows how the operation should run, it knows the traditional sources of downtime and lost productivity in those operations and then you have the IT world that understands these new tools. And being able to bridge that world to converge IT and OT is really the biggest opportunity for these companies to take advantage of both the technology as well as the expertise. One is not effective without the other. Tristan Margot - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Operator, we'll take one more question. Operator : Next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Your line is open. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning, Rob. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So, two questions. First just maybe you can talk a little bit about your regional sales. I mean obviously the organic growth in LATAM was strong and off at a reasonable base. But, could you talk about like areas where you're probably getting some share gain versus some share challenge? And maybe you can overlay it with a comment about the Logix growth rate? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. So we see in general a continued path to share gains in our core products and we've talked about products like Logix and our View, Stratix network switches, Kinetix Motion Control and PowerFlex drives, those have been on a pretty steady upward tick in terms of the shares we triangulate what we report, what our competitors report, what the industry reporting companies tell us. While we watch that fluctuations on a quarterly basis, obviously share is fairly volatile in that respect. It's also a lagging indicator. So you don't get a real good information in the real-time, but we think our share is improving. When we see the kinds of growth that we're seeing in places like Latin America, we think there's no question that we're taking share. Indicators tell us that we're continuing to notch up the share in the U.S. So we feel comfortable that what we are selling and the market access is differentiated. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And there's a follow-up. I just want to kind of turn kind of the excellent capital allocation questions up to 11% here. I mean you've got a pretty significant market break in your stock. You've turned down a pretty material bid, higher from another company. You have a view of what your peak earnings could be and what your stock is worth and that at these prices given the market break, it could be 40% to 50% higher. Why wouldn't you consider being more aggressive deployment of capital on an accelerated basis to maybe buy back 10% of the company? Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. So Rob, we're going to see fluctuations over near-term in the stock price, but I'll go back some of the comments from last fall that remain true today, a few months later. First of all, our strategy is working. The Connected Enterprise strategy and bringing that to life for customers is bringing them value and we're seeing growth from that. Second, as you point out, we do have the strength to use our balance sheet to create additional value for shareholders, and as Patrick said, there's a variety of ways that we can do that. Our first priority is around improving the long-term differentiation of the company and to support the organic growth. We have an active acquisition pipeline and we do expect to use more of our capital than we have in the past in that respect. And then we've already increased the share repurchase. We just increased the dividend today and so we do intend to do that, but we're not going to lurk into a new strategy because the strategy is working and we're bringing long-term value. And we think that's borne out by the superior value creation that we've provided over a variety of past looking measures. Thanks a lot. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for your time. All right. Thank you. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Okay. That concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining us. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. At this time you may disconnect. Thank you.",

Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company Operator : Thank you for holding, and welcome to the Rockwell Automation Quarterly Conference Call. I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. Later in the call, we will open the lines up for questions. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Steve Etzel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Etzel, please go ahead. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's third quarter fiscal 2018 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Patrick Goris, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that website for reply for the next 30 days. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. So, with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake. Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to page 3 in the slide deck. This was a very good quarter for us. Organic growth was up almost 6%, above expectations. This included 10% Logix growth and 8% Process growth. From a vertical perspective, heavy industries performed well and grew above the company average in the quarter, led by growth in semiconductor, metals and chemicals. Consumer also grew above the company average, led by strong growth in food and beverage. Automotive was down about 10% in the quarter. Revenue associated with Information Solutions and Connected Services, which represent new value from The Connected Enterprise, once again, grew double-digits. Commenting on regional performance, the U.S., our largest market, grew over 6% organically. We saw very good growth in all industries except transportation. EMEA was up about 1% in the quarter. Good growth in consumer was partially offset by transportation weakness and we have not yet seen a pick-up in heavy industries in this region. Asia grew about 6%. China's sales were up double-digits. Latin America sales were up 11% and growth was broad-based. I'll make a few additional comments about our performance. I'm very pleased with our financial performance in the quarter. Segment operating margin expanded over 1 point to 22.5%. Margins improved in both of our operating segments. Adjusted EPS was up 23% and free cash flow was again very strong. Patrick will elaborate on our third quarter financial performance in his remarks. Let's move on now to the macro environment and our outlook for full year fiscal 2018. Global industrial production and other production indicators remain strong. We are experiencing growth across the regions and industries that we serve. Customers are asking for the value that the Connected Enterprise brings to them as they continue to drive productivity in their operations. Turning to guidance. Taking into consideration our year-to-date results of growing backlog and the macro outlook, we are raising our fiscal 2018 organic sales growth guidance to about 5.5% and continue to expect full year reported sales to be about $6.7 billion. We expect that heavy industries will continue to be the largest growth driver followed by consumer. The tough comps for auto get easier for the balance of the fiscal year. We are increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to $7.90 to $8.10. I'll turn it over to Patrick to provide more detail around our Q3 results and guidance in his remarks. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide 4, which provides our key financial information for the third quarter. As Blake mentioned, we had a good third quarter with reported sales up 6.2%. Organic growth of 5.7% was better than expected. Currency translation contributed 1.8 points of sales growth, a little less than expected given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The fiscal 2017 Q4 divestiture reduced sales by 1.3 points. Segment operating margin was 22.5%, expanding 140 basis points compared to last year. A margin tailwind from organic growth and good operating performance was partially offset by higher investment spending. Through three quarters, segment operating margin is up 150 basis points year-over-year. General corporate net expense of $28 million was up significantly compared to last year, mainly as a result of higher corporate development related expenses. Adjusted EPS of $2.16 was up 23% compared to the third quarter of last year. The year-over-year increase in adjusted EPS is mainly the result of higher sales and strong operating margin performance. A lower tax rate and lower share count also contributed to the year-over-year adjusted EPS increase. Free cash flow performance was also very strong in the quarter at $321 million or 118% of adjusted income. A few additional items that are not shown on the slide. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 125.8 million, down 4.1 million from last year. We repurchased 2.5 million shares in the quarter at a cost of $430.8 million. Through June 30, we're on pace to get to our $1.5 billion full year target for share repurchase. At June 30, we had $504 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. And, finally, as we entered into the PTC agreements during the third quarter, our third quarter GAAP results include two adjustments related to our investment. One adjustment is a $7 million mark-to-market loss on investment based on PTC's closing share price on June 30, the last day of the quarter. On a quarterly basis, the mark-to-market adjustment we record depends on PTC's share price at the end of the quarter. For reference, at yesterday's closing price, we would have an unrealized gain of approximately $14 million. The second adjustment is a temporary $70 million valuation adjustment, pending registration of the PTC securities as the accounting rules require us to discount the value of our investment in PTC until the shares are registered. We expect that the registration statement for the PTC securities will be filed by the end of the calendar year 2018, after which we will no longer carry this valuation adjustment. We are excluding both the mark-to-market and the temporary valuation adjustment from adjusted EPS. Slide 5 provides the sales and margin performance overview of the Architecture & Software segment. This segment had about 9% year-over-year sales growth. Organic sales were better than expected, up 6.7%, and currency translation increased sales by 2%. For the quarter, segment margin expanded 210 basis points year-over-year to 30%. Margin tailwind from higher sales was partially offset by higher investment spending. The 10% growth in Logix also contributed to the very strong margin performance in this segment. Moving on to slide 6, Control Products & Solutions, reported sales were up 4.1% for this segment. Organic sales growth was 4.9%. Currency translation contributed 1.6%, and the 2017 divestiture reduced sales by 2.4%. Operating margin for this segment increased 60 basis points compared to Q3 last year primarily due to higher sales, another quarter of good margin performance for this segment. Book-to-bill performance for our solutions and services businesses in this segment was a strong 1.12 in Q3. The next slide, 7, provides an overview of our sales performance by region. Blake covered most of this slide in his remarks, so I will just point out that for Q3, emerging markets' organic growth was up about 8%. Before I turn to guidance, let me make a couple of comments about tariffs, specifically the tariffs imposed by the U.S. on certain goods imported into the U.S. from China, which came into effect on July 6. Some of our products and components are sourced from China and are impacted by these tariffs. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we estimate the net unfavorable impact of these tariffs will be less than $0.05 of adjusted EPS. We have been and are in the process of implementing mitigating actions to further reduce the impact of these tariffs. As to tariffs that have been proposed but not yet implemented, as you know, there remains a lot of uncertainty and we're analyzing potential implications to our business, including opportunities to mitigate their impacts if they are enacted. This takes us to slide 8, guidance. As Blake mentioned, we are increasing our expected organic sales growth guidance to about 5.5%. Given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we now expect currency translation to contribute less than 2% of growth. And the sale of the business in fiscal 2017 Q4 will, of course, remain about a 1 point headwind. All-in, we continue to project sales of about $6.7 billion. We expect segment operating margin to be about 21.5%. This implies Q4 segment margin of a little below 21%. General corporate net expense is expected to be about $90 million for the full year, about $10 million to $15 million higher than our April guidance and mostly as a result of higher corporate development related costs. We believe the full year adjusted effective tax rate will now be closer to 20%, 0.5 point lower than our April guidance and mainly as a result of the favorable outcome of a recent tax audit. In June, we raised our fiscal 2018 share repurchase target to $1.5 billion and we now expect fully diluted shares outstanding to be about 127 million for fiscal 2018. We are increasing the adjusted EPS guidance range to $7.90 to $8.10. At the midpoint, this is a $0.15 increase compared to our April guidance. The increase is mainly a result of increased organic sales growth and margin performance, and to a lesser extent, a lower tax rate. Our guidance also reflects the modest headwind we expect as a result of tariffs that I covered earlier. Finally, a slightly lower share count offsets higher net interest expense resulting from the PTC transaction. At the midpoint, this represents 18% EPS growth on 6% higher reported sales, primarily due to higher sales and strong operating performance. And we continue to expect free cash flow conversion of about 105% of adjusted income. In summary, we had a good quarter and we expect fiscal 2018 to be another year of good financial performance for us. With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake. Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Patrick. This has been an exciting quarter. I'd like to make some additional comments about our progress in executing our strategy. Please refer to slides 9 and 10. With the world's largest company focused exclusively on making industrial companies and their people more productive, we are focused on delivering profitable, above-market revenue growth to drive long-term shareowner value. Slide 9 is one you've seen before, which summarizes the three components of our growth strategy, which are share gains in our core platforms, double-digit growth in Information Solutions and Connected Services and a point or more of growth per year from acquisitions. We are delivering in each of these areas. As mentioned earlier, we grew almost 6% this quarter, with strong performance in Logix and Process. Our performance in Process includes the contribution from MAVERICK Technologies, which we acquired a couple of years ago. This acquisition is performing well and is helping us expand in process industries. Information Solutions and Connected Services grew double-digits in Q3 and these revenue streams together are approaching $300 million annually. Additionally, a strategic partnership with PTC creates the most comprehensive and flexible information software offering in the industry. This partnership enhances the differentiation of Rockwell's total portfolio and will accelerate revenue growth in Information Solutions and Connected Services. We're off to a great start with PTC, with technical and commercial teams from both organizations fully engaged. Slide 10 summarizes our balanced approach to capital allocation. As mentioned on the prior slide, driving growth through acquisitions and strategic partnerships is a key part of our strategy. We are executing on well-defined priorities, which haven't changed. We have an active pipeline of opportunities in the key areas of information software, Connected Services, Process and regional share expansion. At the same time, we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareowners, through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, enabled by our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation. Twice in the last year, we increased our dividend by 10%. We've also increased our share repurchase target by $1 billion since the beginning of the fiscal year. In total, we are planning to return over $1.9 billion to shareowners this year. We are keenly focused on balancing strategic inorganic investment with consistent and transparent capital return. And quarters like this one give us tremendous flexibility to continue on this path. With that, I'll turn it over to Steve to start the Q&A. Steve? Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible. So, please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Operator, let's take our first question. Operator : Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Blake, just a question on auto. So, the downturn, I imagine that was worse than what you expected. Just what do you see in \u2013 what happened in the quarter versus expectation? And then as you think about 2019, you mentioned comps are easier, but how do we think about the reemergence of growth there? Are you seeing anything structural there in terms of spending for your customers? Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: So, auto \u2013 Rich, our auto spend has been stable for the last few quarters against in particular the last two quarters a very difficult comp. So, we get some help as those comps fade in Q4. We continue to see a lot of activity in some of the new areas of expansion for us like EV and powertrain. Particularly with EV, the number of startup companies around the world that we're engaged with as well as their tier suppliers is expanding. So, there's a fairly optimistic outlook in terms of new programs in that particular area. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Would you expect to see some growth next year? Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Well, we'll talk about our guidance in November for 2019. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then just real quick on projects. A couple months ago, you're talking about seeing larger projects or customers being more detail with their project activity. I mean what's the update there in terms as we think about growth into the end of the calendar year? Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: So, Rich, if you're talking about general project activity, including heavy industries, we are seeing some of that activity actually result in orders. We talked a little bit earlier about NioCorp which was a big mining project, and we're happy to announce that we also received a major order from Codelco, again, in mining in Latin America. They're the largest copper producer globally located in Chile. We're going to be the main automation contractor for the Chuquicamata underground mine expansion. It's a significant order. It involves a lot of our new value from things like network services and remote monitoring. So, we are seeing some of that project activity convert into orders. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. I'll pass now. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Rich. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Good morning. Can you talk about how you're managing your supply chain with all these tariffs on whether it's electronic components and things like that? And then maybe touch on what your customers like some of these machine builders \u2013 do you have kind of a look into what their supply chain looks like? And is there any kind of disruption to the customers that they may be kind of rethinking bids or anything like that, given all the moving parts around maybe parts that they're sourcing from China? Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: I'll make a couple of comments on that and then Patrick might have some additional color. Rockwell has the worldwide supply chain and a manufacturing footprint and they're flexible. And a lot of our customers enjoy similar amount of flexibility in their supply chain. So at this point, speaking about Rockwell, we don't expect significant disruption to our internal operations and we don't expect a material financial impact. But the uncertainty is certainly not helpful to us or our customers. And so proactively, getting in front and looking at not only mitigation factors for the tariffs that have been enacted, as well as looking at others that are being considered, I think, it's the key thing to give us as much lead time as possible to move around things, if necessary. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: We would also say, Steve, that we haven't seen any material changes yet at our customers. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then one last one, just on electronics. Been a lot of noise around CapEx there and varying degrees of weakness at some of the more \u2013 the heavier robot suppliers. You guys have kind of a small presence, but I think it's been growing. What did electronics do in the quarter and what's your outlook and just remind us of what percentage of the business that is? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: So, Steve, semiconductor, as we call it, was up double-digits in the quarter, was up in every region. And at this point, it's about 5% of our global sales. Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. That takes the fabs and the foundries as well as the actual downstream electronics manufacturing and it continues to be strong for us around the world. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker from UBS. Please go ahead. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks, and good morning, all. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. I just wanted to make sure, as I look to your kind of implied fourth quarter organic growth, it looks like somewhere around 7.5%, so certainly some kind of acceleration. Given all the comments you've made around heavy industry and some of these other areas, I mean, what would you say is sort of the biggest component of driving kind of acceleration in the growth rates? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. Steve, Patrick here. So we've seen good growth in heavy industry in Q3. Consumer actually did quite well as well in Q3. The big change in Q4 \u2013 and Blake alluded to that \u2013 is what's happening in automotive. Automotive has been about flat, and I call this plus or minus 5%, 6%, for three, four quarters in a row. And in Q4, we basically lapped an easier comp. And so a headwind on auto growth that we've seen of about a point, actually a little bit more than a point in Q3, goes away in Q4. And so our organic growth from 5.7% in Q3, add a little bit more than a point to that and you get close to what the implied growth rate is in Q4. So a key element is we expect easier comps in auto. Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. I think the other comment is that we have meaningfully increased our backlog. And while some of that will go into fiscal 2019, that'll have some impact on Q4 as well. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And just a quick comment on the mix \u2013 margin impact from mix as your mix is shifting now. Can you just give us a little more color on \u2013 there are a lot of puts and takes not just at the full segment level, but intra segment, given consumer, auto, everything else you've got going on? Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. Just one comment, and then Patrick will add some detail. But amidst the higher growth in heavy industry, so we saw a pretty good quarter in terms of margin expansion. So we're pleased with our ability to continue to have high levels of core conversion as well as margin expansion, even with a little heavier contribution from Process and heavy industries. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Steve, your question, was that related to Q3, the outlook for the year? Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Oh yeah, outlook. No. No. No, the outlook for the year. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: For the... Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : For Q4. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: ...outlook for the \u2013 yeah. So for Q4 compared to our prior guidance, we expect a little favorable impact from mix, again, versus our prior guidance, mostly related to higher expected growth in A&S, also in Logix, part of which we've seen in the third quarter, which also explains our very strong margins in the third quarter. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. That's helpful. I'll pass it on. Thanks. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Baird. Please go ahead. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yes. Good morning. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning, Rick. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Just two questions. Blake or Patrick, could you throw some color around that book-to-bill, just on a couple fronts? One is you mentioned some heavy industry projects that came in around mining. But I'm curious maybe what that book-to-bill looks like by industry, where the strength was? And then also, Blake, is there any cycle commentary around that book-to-bill and where that strength is or was in bookings? Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. I can make some comments about the book-to-bill. As Patrick mentioned, it was strong. It was certainly helped by some of these mining orders that we've talked about. It's going to be weighted towards heavy industries with the large Process component in there. We don't have the specific breakdown by vertical for that, but as we've been talking about, there's been a lot of activity in the planning and budgeting stages for some of these major capital projects in heavy industries. And some of them are starting to come to fruition and resulting in orders. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And any cycle commentary in terms of macro investment cycle commentary around the book-to-bill and where you're seeing that strength? Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: We've seen some of the mining companies announce long-planned projects that are expected to have a multiyear impact on their capacity. And even though we've seen copper dip a little bit recently, they've made decisions to increase productivity or capacity in some of these mines. So I think we're seeing really at the starting phase of some of these projects converting into orders. In general, the macro conditions are favorable. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And then just as my follow-up, around Logix growth at 10%, I'm a little bit curious the strength there maybe by end market, if you can see that. Given that auto was on the softer side, that's pretty impressive Logix growth. Just curious what your take is there? Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Well, one of the strengths of Logix is that it does a really good job across a wide variety of industries. So, of course, Logix is used in automobile and truck assembly around the world. But it's also being used in Process around the world. And so, the good growth in oil and gas in the U.S. will spur additional Logix growth, particularly with the larger processors. And so, we think that there's a healthy mix of oil and gas that's spurring some of that Logix outgrowth. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: I see. Great. Very good. Thank you. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Rick. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. So, just sticking to the two questions. I guess my first one would be around any update on the investment or overhead spending. I think you talked before about $70 million increase for the year and sort of $45 million of that coming in the second half. Is that still the case? And, Patrick, you had called out a couple of times that the corporate cost moving up maybe as a result, so any kind of detail on that please. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Okay. Julian, we expect our overall spend to be up between $70 million, $80 million for the full year. And for Q3, our year-over-year spend was up a little less than $25 million. We expect the Q4 spend to go up sequentially and it will be up year-over-year also by about $25 million. So basically in line with what we shared before with you. As to general corporate net, the increase there is mostly related to some of the transactions or to the large transaction that you have seen us announce in the third quarter. So specifically the PTC transaction, that's the majority of the increase in GCN. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much. And then my second question would just be around the top line. As you said, the quarter did come in better than you saw it on organic sales. It doesn't sound like it was automotive or process industries that came in above. So, was it really driven by consumer? And if you could give any color, is there demand changed as you went through the quarter in any meaningful way? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. Julian, the three verticals that came in somewhat better than what we expected, one is food and beverage. I mentioned earlier that consumer had a good quarter in Q3. Food and beverage was the main driver there. And then metals and semiconductor were a little bit better than expected as well. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Good morning. I just want to circle back to Steve's question on some of your Japanese discrete peers. I recognize that there are more indexed smartphone, electronics and auto. But what does that tell us about the cycle? And the spirit of the question is around the FY 2019 outlook. And you've got mid-teens growth in your systems business within CPS. So, you're not seeing overall weakness or anything like that that they are? But just under the covers, are there any concerns that you're seeing for FY 2019? And I'm just wondering is this just an end-market mix issue. Is it a geographic mix issue? Any color there would be great. Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Looking at the general outlook, it remains positive with broad-based underpinning across industries and geographies. We had a strong sales quarter. We also had a very strong orders quarter, as represented by that 1.12 book-to-bill. And across regions, we're seeing optimism for the future. I think one of the particular areas around semiconductor is this continues to be a strength for us. And again in terms of actual sales as well as orders looking forward, we continue to see strength there as we expand our capabilities in that particular industry. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Okay. That's fine. And then just going back again to auto and transports, it sounds like we're hitting easier comps in 4Q, so we get that year-over-year lift. And you remain optimistic in terms of your commentary. So, if you think about all of the work around EV, self-driving, flying cars and all that stuff, and then the legacy OEMs, are we seeing pressure from sort of legacy spends offset by upticks in these new areas? And again we're seeing the OEM profitability under pressure, tariffs, et cetera. So, any additional color in terms of what you're seeing in the end market between maybe legacy versus new would be useful. Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Let me first say that we don't expect significant revenue from flying cars in the foreseeable future. I will say that the uptick in transportation should be balanced between the projects both in our traditional internal combustion engine customers as well as EV and between projects as well as the MRO spend. So, we see it both contribute \u2013 the project as well as the MRO spend both contribute to a healthy business. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks, guys. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks. Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Just one additional comment on the auto side. We've talked about the opportunity to increase our share of the customer's spend with the new value from The Connected Enterprise. And so, in addition to the basic automation, the controller-based projects that affect both EV as well as traditional automobile manufacturing, the opportunity now accelerated with our relationship with PTC to add additional value through the information software and the associated services, that's come into fruition as we have discussions with those automobile manufacturers. So in the past, we might expected to have projects that included the controllers and the drives and the industrial components. But now, the opportunity to dramatically increase the monetization of the value we're providing at those automobile manufacturers and their tier suppliers with the software to be able to track production, to be able to monitor quality, all those things is an exciting additional opportunity that we have at customers even if they were already standardized on all of our basic control equipment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research : Hey. Good morning, guys. Hello. How are you doing? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research : So can I ask you about China in the sense that it grew 10% in the quarter? We know you said that China will grow slightly less than 10% for FY 2018. Maybe you can talk about visibility at this point into China growth. Obviously, there's been a bunch of questions about tariffs. But China just announced a stimulus plan here earlier this year. So, do you still see broad-based growth in China and any sort of early visibility into 2019? Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Let me start with a couple of comments about the current contributors to growth in China, and then Patrick might have some additional comment. So, the strength in China includes semiconductor, which we'd talked about before; oil and gas, particularly on the refining side; life sciences, which although it's still relatively small as a standalone vertical for us, continues to contribute high growth; and then water and wastewater, as China continues to build out infrastructure in that. And that obviously contributes to some of our Process as well. So, those are some of the industries that are important to us currently in China. We have not seen a dampening effect from the tariff discussion at this point. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Andy, I would just add that through three quarters, most of our verticals in China are up. And for the full year, we still expect growth in the high-single-digits, a little less than 10% in this country. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research : Okay. That's helpful, guys. And then responding to your comments on Europe, it did turn positive again in the quarter, but still somewhat lethargic, up 1%. You mentioned that heavy industries haven't come back yet there. What do you think that is? And do you worry a little bit more about that region here towards the end of this fiscal year and as we go into 2019? Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: The primary story in EMEA for us has been the weak automotive growth and we continue to look at strength in consumer in Europe as encouraging. We're pleased that our performance in the emerging European markets continue to show higher than average growth, but automotive is still the primary story in Europe. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: I would just add, Andy, that for oil and gas, we haven't seen the pickup yet in the North Sea, where it's more expensive to extract. And so, we haven't seen that pickup there as we've seen, for example, in the U.S. for oil and gas. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research : That's helpful, guys. Thanks. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, guys. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So, my first question I guess maybe just focused on the implied 4Q guidance, and I'm really kind of thinking about how you get to the high end of the range for 4Q. It looks like, to Steve's comment earlier, you've got about 7.5% organic growth in there. The restructuring actions that you took last year should reverse I would assume in this fourth quarter. And then on top of that, are you guys thinking a 40% to 50% type incremental margin? Just any color on that would be helpful. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah, if you exclude the restructuring charges, Joe, for the fourth quarter, we expect earnings conversion of about 30%, 35%. And so another way you can think about it is Q4 margins versus Q3. I mentioned early that for Q4, we expect segment margin to be a little less than 21%. We expect the benefit of higher sales versus Q3. You heard me say earlier that spend is going to be up \u2013 our investment spending, I should say, will be up. Mix is always sequentially a slight negative in the fourth quarter, given the typical pickup we see in solutions and services. And then I mentioned earlier that we'll see a modest headwind related to some of our input cost, the tariffs that I referred to earlier as well. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. That's helpful, Patrick. And maybe if I can just touch on that point. I know you'll give a lot more color in November on 2019, but is there anything you can tell us about what you expect the tariffs impact? And also, is there incremental spending that you're expecting as well for 2019, just given how good growth has been? Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. Just one comment, and I think it's the obvious one. And we're an American company, and America is by far our largest market. And we do think that we and our customers can compete and win around the world. So, when government action is necessary, we favor a strategic approach that aligns us with our allies. But to your specific question, America is by far our largest market, and we certainly don't expect any of this to have a dampening effect on the number of facilities in America that require our offerings. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Joe, I'm not getting into fiscal 2019 and what tariffs might amount to or spending. That's something that we'll share with everyone in November. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you both. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you for taking our questions. This is Kristen on for Noah. I just wanted to ask a little bit about the PTC relationship. Forward-looking, how does that change your views on planning investments in software and analytics? And where do you see any gaps in that portfolio now? Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Well, as we mentioned before, Kristen, that we believe that we have the most comprehensive, flexible information software offering in the industry. So we're very happy with what we can offer customers today. We were already growing at double-digits in the Information Solutions and Connected Services area. This will accelerate that growth to help customers unlock even more productivity. We continue to invest in these areas. We've had artificial intelligence offerings for a while. Those will be incorporated with additional enhancements into the combined offering that we'll offer customers that will take the best of what PTC and Rockwell have. So we continue to invest organically in these areas as well. But this brings us at speed to having such a strong offering that we can provide today because it's a fast-growing area and we think we have the opportunity to be a first-mover at many of these customers and in many of these industries. Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: And then if I could follow-up on that, Steve, I think you mentioned that some of the incremental corporate expense is going towards the development from that relationship. Can you shed a little bit more color on that? Is that sales? Is that technology development? Just a little color on that. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah, the expenses I was referring to in general corporate net are really related to the actual transaction rather than ongoing expenses. We will have some ongoing expenses associated with PTC. We're adding some sales resources. We also shared with investors that we're working on a common technology roadmap. So, we're making some investments there. But that is not part of GCN. That is part of ongoing investments that we're making now and we'll be making next year. Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. I think the additional comment about our spend is with the relationship with PTC, it allows us to focus our spend on the differentiated value. And an example that we've used before is augmented reality. We think augmented reality has a lot of good valuable applications in production environments. But having the relationship with a top supplier with a strong offering keeps us from having to invest resources and having another offering that may or may not be differentiated. So, it allows us to focus on areas that are the most prioritized in terms of differentiating the combined offering. Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: That's very helpful. Thank you. I will pass it on. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Operator, we'll take one more question. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Justin Bergner from Gabelli & Co. Please go ahead. Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company: Oh. Good morning, Blake. Good morning, Patrick. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company: In regards to the strength in your Architecture & Software business, I mean you spoke about the consumer strength in food and beverage and seems like the fourth quarter anticipates the carry forward of that strength. Maybe if you could just provide a little bit more color on what's driving the strength in Architecture & Software and the sustainability of that strength versus sort of your expectations earlier in the year? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: I think some of it goes back to what Blake referred to earlier, our largest business in that segment, includes our Logix business. And you will find our Logix product and software across all industries, where they are discrete or Process. And so, with the pickup in some of the heavy industry that we're seeing, besides good growth in consumer, we see that reflected in Architecture & Software. And that business is more exposed to heavy industries within Architecture & Software than, for example, motion or our sensing business in that segment. And so, it also leads to a somewhat favorable mix that you see reflected in the margins of that segment. Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: I think the additional comment is that all of our products and offerings really contribute to bringing The Connected Enterprise to life. And so, as that strategy continues to find favor with customers, it's going to raise the overall offering because those products from A&S and from CP&S all contribute the data that ultimately is turned into useful information and supports the growth of some of the new areas of value, the information software and those high value services. So, it brings it all up as customers endorse that idea of connecting their enterprise. Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on that. I mean the Information Solutions and Connected Services revenue, that $300 million, is that disproportionately weighted towards Architecture & Software versus CP&S? Or is it split pretty much pro rata versus the sales split? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Today, it's a little bit split more towards Control Products & Solutions than it is Architecture & Software. Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company: Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions. Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you. Your... Operator : I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Steve Etzel for closing remarks. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Actually, Blake is going to make a few comments, and then we'll wrap up. Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: So just to summarize, we're very happy with the progress that we've made in the quarter to bring The Connected Enterprise to life. We saw a strong growth in all areas and we're also happy with the strong operating performance that gives us a lot of excitement about our future. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Okay. With that, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining us. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. At this time, you may disconnect. Thank you.",

LLC Operator : Thank you for holding, and welcome to Rockwell Automation's Quarterly Conference Call. I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. Later in the call, we will open the lines for questions. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Steve Etzel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Etzel, please go ahead. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's fourth quarter fiscal 2018 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Patrick Goris, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that website for reply for the next 30 days. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. So, with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake. Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to page 3 in the slide deck. I'm pleased with our results for the quarter. As we expected, organic growth was above 7% with growth across a very broad range of industries. From a vertical perspective, consumer and heavy industries performed well, both growing above the company average in the quarter. Consumer growth was led by food and beverage and life sciences. While heavy industries growth was led by mining and semiconductor. Within transportation, automotive was down 10% in the quarter, weaker than expected and tire was up high single digits. In the quarter, Logix grew 7% organically and Process grew 11%, demonstrating our continuing progress in this key initiative. Commenting on regional performance in the quarter, the U.S. grew almost 8% organically, despite softness in automotive. We saw very good growth across a wide range of industries. EMEA was about flat in the quarter with growth in consumer verticals offset by continued weakness in automotive. Asia grew about 10% with China sales up double-digits. Latin America sales were up over 20% with most countries in the region contributing to growth. I'll make a few additional comments about our Q4 results. Adjusted EPS was up 25% and free cash flow was very strong. Importantly, we finished the year with healthy backlog. Moving to the full-year. Fiscal 2018 was an important year for Rockwell Automation, marked by strong operating and financial performance, as well as actions that set the stage for our continued success. First, some highlights of our financial performance. Our diverse industry exposure enabled us to deliver 5.5% organic growth, even though one of our larger verticals was down 10%. Following growth of over 20% in fiscal 2017, automotive was down year-over-year, but we continue to gain share in this market, both in traditional and electric vehicles. Heavy industries was the largest growth driver this year, with almost all verticals contributing. We saw particularly strong performance in semiconductor, mining and metals. Consumer verticals grew at about the company average, led by food and beverage and life sciences. We are executing well on our key initiatives. Revenues from Information Solutions and Connected Services, which represent new value from The Connected Enterprise, profitably grew double-digits for the year, reaching $300 million. Logix grew 7% in 2018 and Process grew double-digits. Our segment operating margin expanded, adjusted EPS was up 20% year-over-year. And we had another good year of free cash flow conversion. Patrick will elaborate on our fourth quarter and full-year financial performance in his remarks. We had several other key accomplishments this year, including our partnership with PTC, which will accelerate future growth. In the wake of U.S. tax reform, we significantly increased our capital deployment to deliver long-term shareowner value. In fiscal 2018, we made $1 billion equity investment in PTC. We repurchased $1.5 billion worth of our shares, and we increased the dividend twice during the fiscal year. Each increase was 10%. We continue to invest for the long-term success of our company, customers and our employees. Let's move on now to the macro environment and our outlook for full-year fiscal 2019. While global trade tensions create uncertainty, we have not seen an impact on customer demand as industrial companies continue to focus on productivity. Internally, we are taking actions that are expected to mitigate the impact of tariffs on our operations. Macroeconomic indicators remain favorable across most geographies, with PMI metrics above 50 and continued industrial production growth. Economic growth in the U.S., our largest market is strong. We have balanced exposure across a broad range of industries, and we expect heavy industries and consumer verticals to continue to be the strongest growth drivers. Taking into account, what we know about the macro environment, our industry outlook, our backlog and what we are hearing from our customers. We are expecting another good year of growth and financial performance in fiscal 2019. We expect our fiscal 2019 organic sales to be up 5.2% year-over-year, at midpoint of guidance. This growth rate includes a 30 basis point expected headwind from our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard in fiscal 2019. Currency is expected to reduce growth by about one percentage point. Including the impact of currency and the new revenue recognition standard, our fiscal 2019 guidance is sales of about $7 billion and adjusted EPS of $8.85 to $9.25. Now I'll turn it over to Patrick to provide more detail around our Q4 and full-year results and our 2019 sales and earnings guidance. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you, Blake and good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide 4, which provides our key financial information for the fourth quarter. As Blake mentioned, we had a good fourth quarter with reported sales up 3.7%. Strong organic growth of 7.3% was in line with our expectations and was our best organic growth quarter of fiscal 2018. Currency translation reduced sales by 2.2 points, about 1.5 points worse than we expected. The fiscal 2017 Q4 divestiture reduced sales by 1.4 points. Segment operating margin was 20.8%, up 380 basis points compared to last year. Excluding last year's Q4 restructuring charges, segment margin expanded 120 basis points. A margin tailwind from organic growth and good operating performance was partially offset by higher investment spending. General corporate net expense of $14 million was down $10 million compared to last year and about $15 million lower than we expected. We had a favorable settlement of a longstanding legal case during quarter, we'll see the cash benefits of this settlement in future periods. Adjusted EPS of $2.11 was up about 25% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The year-over-year increase in adjusted EPS is mainly the result of higher sales strong operating margin performance and the benefit of a lower tax rate and share count. The fiscal 2018 legal settlement benefit and last year's restructuring charges and gain on disposal about net up (10:10). Free cash flow performance was again very strong in the quarter at $316 million or 121% of adjusted income. A few additional items that are not shown on the slide. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 123.5 million, down 6.3 million from last year. We repurchased 2.2 million shares in the quarter at a cost of $396 million. For the full-year fiscal 2018, repurchases amounted to $1.5 billion. At September 30, we had about $1.1 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. And finally, you will note that just as last quarter, our fourth quarter GAAP results include adjustments related to our investments in PTC and the Tax Act. Moving on to slide 5, key financial information for full-year fiscal 2018. We had a good fiscal 2018. Organic growth was 5.5%, segment margins expanded 210 basis points or 140 basis points excluding Q4 fiscal 2017's restructuring charges. Adjusted EPS was up 20% and free cash flow conversion was 114%. Core earnings conversion, excluding the impact of restructuring the divestiture in currency of a little over 40% was stronger than we expected at the beginning of the year. The increase in adjusted EPS was mainly a result of stronger sales and operating performance as well as a tailwind from a lower adjusted effective tax rate and share count. The net effect of the non-recurring items was immaterial on a year-over-year basis. For fiscal 2018, research and development expense grew about 7% and increased to 5.6% of reported sales. U.S. corporate tax reform was, of course, an important event during fiscal 2018. It not only helped reduce our adjusted effective tax rate, but also provided us access to our non-U.S. cash. During fiscal 2018, we repatriated about $2.3 billion of non-U.S. cash. As Blake mentioned, we redeployed this cash to our investment in PTC and increasing our fiscal 2018 share repurchases to $1.5 billion. Slide 6 provides a sales and margin performance overview of the Architecture & Software segment. For the quarter, this segment had about 5% year-over-year sales growth. Organic sales growth of 7% was offset by 2.3% headwind from currency translation. Segment margin expanded 420 basis points year-over-year to 27.9%, higher sales was the main contributor to margin expansion. Lower restructuring charges contributed a little less than 200 basis points of margin tailwind. For the full-year, organic growth was up a little over 5% and reported sales for this segment reached $3 billion for the first time. Segment margins expanded by 210 basis points, primarily due to higher sales. Lower restructuring costs contributed about 0.5 point to segment margin expansion. Moving on to slide 7, Control Products & Solutions. Reported sales were up about 3% for the segment. Organic sales growth was 7.5%, currency translation represented a 2.1% headwind and the 2017 divestiture reduced sales by 2.5%. Operating margin for this segment increased 330 basis points compared to Q4 last year, primarily due to higher sales and lower restructuring charges, offset by higher investment spending. Lower restructuring charges contributed about 250 basis points to margin expansion. Book-to-bill performance for our Solutions and Services businesses in this segment was 0.93, pretty typical for a fourth quarter. For the full year, organic growth was 5.7% and margins expanded 200 basis points to 15.2%. Higher sales were the primary driver of margin expansion. Lower restructuring charges drove less than half the margin expansion. The next slide 8 provides an overview of our sales performance by region. Blake covered most of this in his remarks. So, I will move on. Before I get to guidance, I'll provide you with a few comments about the impact of tariffs and mitigating actions. I shared with you in April that Section 232 tariffs, have an immaterial impact on our company. During the Q3 earnings call in July this year, I mentioned that we are impacted by Section 301 List 1. The net impact to fiscal 2018 Q4 results was in line with what we expected and shared with you back in July, a little less than $0.05 of adjusted EPS. Since our July earnings call, Section 301 Lists 2 and 3 as well as additional retaliatory actions by China have been implemented. We estimate the gross annual impact of all tariffs enacted to-date to be about $90 million. The majority of this relates to products and components we purchase from partners and vendors rather than our own internal production. We expect the net impact on fiscal 2019 results to be neutral as a result of comprehensive mitigating actions. We expect to offset about half of the gross impact through implementing supply chain alternatives and negotiations with vendors. The remaining actions to offset the gross impact include selected price adjustments on effective products. Given the timing of these selected price increases, we expect the first quarter of fiscal 2019 to have a net unfavorable impact. As I mentioned earlier, we expect the impact of full-year fiscal 2019 earnings to be neutral. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and take additional mitigating actions as appropriate. This takes us to slide 9, guidance. As Blake mentioned, we're expecting sales of about $7 billion in fiscal 2019. We're adopting ASC 606, the new revenue recognition standard, effective fiscal 2019. This creates a 30 basis point headwinds on organic sales, most of which we estimate will impact the first quarter of fiscal 2019. For the full-year, we expect organic growth to be in a range of 3.7% to 6.7%. Consistent with currency rate projections for the next 12 months, we expect the headwinds from currency of about 1 point. We expect segment operating margins to expand to 22%, general corporate net is expected to be about $85 million. The increase over fiscal 2018 is primarily driven by lower interest income. We believe the full-year adjusted effective tax rate will be about 19.5%, similar for fiscal 2018. We're dialing in $1 billion of share repurchases and assume average diluted shares outstanding of $120.1 million. We will share more details with you on our capital deployment and structure plans at our Investor Day next week. Our adjusted EPS guidance range is $8.85 to $9.25, at the midpoint, this represents 12% adjusted EPS growth on about 4% higher reported sales. From a calendarization viewpoint, we do not expect EPS growth in the first quarter, as a result of higher year-over-year investment spending, the timing of pricing adjustments related to tariffs, and the impact of ASC 606. And finally, we expect full-year 2019 free cash flow conversion of about 100% of adjusted income. This includes $150 million of capital expenditures. Note that during fiscal 2019, we will make our first payment, about $30 million, related to the deemed repatriation tax liability as a result of tax reform. Next slide 10. This slide provides an adjusted EPS walk from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019. Going from left to right, you will see that the main contribution in EPS growth comes from our poor performance on higher organic sales. Currency is expected to be a headwind of about $0.10. Incentive compensation for fiscal 2018 was above target due to strong performance, so this represents a tailwind for us as we enter fiscal 2019. We expect higher net interest expense as a result of our cash deployment. As I mentioned earlier, interest income will be lower. In addition, interest expense will be about $10 million higher in fiscal 2019. The tax rate is expected to be about the same. And finally, we expect a large tailwind from the lower share count. Including the adjusted EPS impact related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, we get to $9.05 of adjusted EPS at the midpoint. So, with that, I'll turn it back over to you, Blake. Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Patrick. Before we move on to Q&A, I want to make some additional remarks. This quarter was a strong finish to a great year. I mentioned several of our key accomplishments in my earlier comments. Looking to fiscal 2019, we have another exciting year ahead of us. We will continue to provide new value with The Connected Enterprise, which gives us more ways to win. As a pure-play, our entire focus is on helping industrial companies and their people be more productive. We have no competing priorities. Our capital allocation will continue to balance strategic inorganic investment with consistent capital return. Our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation give us tremendous flexibility to continue on this path. Acquisitions made in recent years continue to perform well and the pipeline remains active. Our key areas of focus are information software, Connected Services, process expertise and regional share expansion. While the size, amount and timing of deals can never be predicted with certainty, we continue to target a point or more of annual growth from acquisitions. Last week, we again increased our dividend, which will bring our annual payout to over $450 million. In 2019, we are planning to spend $1 billion on share repurchases. So, in total, our targeted return of cash to shareowners is about $1.5 billion. Our strategy generates strong sustainable cash flows that we will continue to direct the value creating opportunities. I look forward to seeing many of you next week at our Annual Investor Day. As usual, we will hold Investor Day at Automation Fair, our main customer event in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania this year. This is a great opportunity to see how we are bringing The Connected Enterprise to life for our customers. We will showcase our latest innovations, investments and Information Solutions for thousands of customers from around the world, highlighting the powerful combination of Rockwell Automation and our partners. Among other innovations in a particularly eventful year, customers will see our software combined with PTC technology to create powerful Information Solutions, an important new Logix processor and additional high performance drive releases for Process applications. All of these offerings increased customer productivity by converging real time control with information and analytics that drive positive business outcomes. The opportunities for integrating control and information are greater than ever, and the power of our Connected Enterprise vision to increase industrial productivity is being demonstrated across all of our verticals and around the world. We are best positioned to deliver this value to our customers because we are already on the plant floor with a large installed base, we have differentiated technology and domain expertise, and we have a long history of successful partnerships. The value we provide is in high demand as every day customers are pulling us into their plans to connect their enterprise, to become more competitive. More next Thursday during Investor Day. Finally, I'd like to thank each of our employees and partners for their efforts to bring The Connected Enterprise to life, within Rockwell and add our customers. With that, I'll turn it over to Steve to start the Q&A. Steve? Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible. So, please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Operator, let's take our first question. Operator : Certainly. Our first question comes from Steven Winoker from UBS. Please go ahead. Peter Lennox-King - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning, gentlemen. This is Peter Lennox-King on for Steve. The first thing, I'd like to focus on is the Process business, which is clearly picking up on a nice comp even. Is that driven by large project? Or are they more distributed by size, type and really what are the main drivers there by vertical, if you could parse that out for me? Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: So, Peter, the Process business is really a nice balance of project as well as more flow business. And remember for us a big project is in the mid-single digit millions of dollars, so very little of what we do is truly mega projects. It's distributed across a good balance of industries. So, while we had good growth in oil and gas in the U.S., we also saw significant growth in orders in mining, especially in Latin America that will result in shipments during fiscal year 2019. But it's really a balance of both projects that we've talked about in the past like NioCorp and Codelco as well as flow business, where we might be providing Control Products that are integrated by someone else into well head and other applications. Peter Lennox-King - UBS Securities LLC : That's great. And then maybe since you mentioned it, the growth in Latin America was obviously very strong. How much of that growth was mining-related versus other process versus other verticals? And within the Process business areas, is that mainly greenfield project or retrofit an overhaul? And is that driven by a large project or again more of a mix? Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: So, we're really happy with the growth in Latin America. I think it's been a pretty consistent story for us and complementing the strong growth in mining, we also saw a consumer growth. It was one of the regions that we actually saw some growth in transportation in Latin America as well. Within the mining vertical, most of that is upgrades to existing mines. So, these aren't brand-new operations. In the case of Codelco, this was providing a supervisory control and data acquisition system with a good deal of services to make sure that the data transfer from the mine to a central control room was done securely, but it was an existing mine that that upgrade was being performed at. Peter Lennox-King - UBS Securities LLC : That's helpful. Thanks very much. I'll pass it on. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Scott Reed Davis - Melius Research LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Morning. Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Morning. Scott Reed Davis - Melius Research LLC : Sounds like CapEx isn't dying, as the market might imply it is, with what you guys put up, but what was soft, as you guys noted, it was just auto and that's not a surprise at all. But what's the cadence of that picking back up? Is it a function of waiting for some of these EV facilities to be built? Is it just really a function of obviously weaker SAAR? I mean, I guess part of what I'm asking is, as you break down between CapEx and OpEx, and really how you see the cadence of that getting better over the next several quarters or how long you think it's going to take? Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Hey. I think it's helpful to look at our general automotive business as having a few components. So, obviously, the ongoing MRO business from an installed base, particularly in the Americas, is an important part of that. We did see a softer than expected result from that in the last quarter. The other piece is the EV and power transmission business, which remains at around $100 million for us. And then third is the programs in traditional internal combustion engines. And for new project activity, for IC engines as well as EV, there continues to be a lot of vigorous activity. In most cases, these are delays, but there's still the expectation that we're going to see those programs in 2019 and beyond. Scott Reed Davis - Melius Research LLC : Are they \u2013 well, you know and I'm \u2013 I'll ask this offline, but I still struggle sometimes, guys, and maybe it's my fault, not yours, to see where the real tangible synergies are with PTC. And again, maybe it's my fault. But can you give us some tangible examples of maybe how you guys have gone to market together or what you're doing and how you're both benefiting from this? Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Sure. Scott, I'll talk about a couple of recent successes that have resulted in orders, subscription-based orders that we don't think we would have maximized without the relationship with PTC. To begin with, for a long time our growth has been driven by the automation of basic processes to remove repetitive physical labor in those operations. But we and our customers are recognizing that there's a whole new level of productivity that comes from the Information Solutions, taking the data as a byproduct of those control processes and turning it into insights that allow additional productivity. So, making the workflows more efficient, being able to provide traceability to improve quality, there's a whole host of applications that provide cost savings to our customers. And in the first example, in a major automotive, we have a great position on the plant floor with that customer. But they were also looking at PTC software, because PTC has some good tools. When we came in together and said we're going to combine our knowledge of the plant floor with our software, things like our FactoryTalk Analytics with ThingWorx from PTC, it was game over. And we beat some big competitors to win the pilot for that project, which is going well and we expect that to move into a rollout over the next year. In the second example, in a large mining company, they were looking to create a digital twin for their operations. PTC, again, has a good portfolio of design tools that fit nicely with the real-time control and visualization hardware and software that we're already providing to that mining company, and together we have the most powerful combination in the world. It's that simple. Scott Reed Davis - Melius Research LLC : That's encouraging. Thank you. Good luck, guys. Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Deepa B. N. Raghavan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. This is Deepa Raghavan for Rich Kwas. Blake, a question for you on automotive growth expectations for 2019. What's embedded in your forecast as you look at the midpoint of the organic growth guidance? And how should we think about which regions help the most? I think EMEA, there was a comment in the presentation that said it was a little weak. Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Sure. So, at the midpoint of guidance, we're looking for continued growth to be driven by heavy industries as well as consumer. And in consumer, food and beverage and life sciences are the largest contributors of that. At the midpoint, we're expecting a flat automotive vertical, so any growth in automotive would be upside, all other things being equal. Operator : Our next question comes from John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead. John G. Inch - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors : Yeah. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Morning. Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Hey, John. John G. Inch - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors : Morning, guys. So, I guess, there've been quite a few \u2013 like there's been quite a few management changes of late. There was recently, I guess, John McDermott's going to be retiring. Can you just maybe talk to \u2013 obviously Ted's left. I mean, can you talk to how these changes or these actions, how they kind of dovetail with the positioning of the company and where you tend to sort of take things going forward? Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Happy to. Let me start by saying that Ted's not gone yet, so we continue to benefit from Ted's wise counsel and his involvement. But thanks for asking that, because we've had a couple of leadership changes that we talked about, beginning in June and then most recently in our sales and marketing organization, and they are all about accelerating our ability to bring The Connected Enterprise to life. So, when we moved Frank to Control Products & Solutions, it was to recognize the growing importance of combining the technology and the expertise, and as you know CP&S has a high component of services and solutions, which are going to be critical to ensure positive customer outcomes as we deploy our technology. We also created a Connected Enterprise consulting function led by Bob Murphy, who previously have been running a worldwide operations, brings unmatched credibility when talking to customers to help them better define their business problems. Most recently, in the sales and marketing changes, we provided additional focus to our most strategic enterprise accounts as well as our largest investment, which is, of course, PTC by dedicating a member of my staff to growing in those areas. And we also recognized, the continuing importance of growing share in Europe and Asia. And so, our sales leader who has responsibility for the marketing as well as the regional selling functions is going to remain based in Brussels. And I think it's important for me to begin to globalize my team, so that we get that perspective from the needs of customers around the world. John G. Inch - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors : I appreciate that. Thank you. Like you mentioned PTC, can we just talk a bit about what kind of investments Rockwell is going to have to make to actually drive revenue and other types of synergies from this partnership? Is it material and maybe you could just less, perhaps, on the dollar side, but more what operationally, you're going to have to do? Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Well, deeper in the organization, we've made sure that in addition to the selling focus that I talked about, we're also taking care of the back office and so that's creating the necessary IT infrastructure, so that we take subscriptions at a higher rate than we have in the past. That's obviously important to decrease the susceptibility of our business to economic swings over time. That's going quite well to have a subscription portal in place, it's making sure that we have the right delivery resources within our Solutions business, to ensure that when a customer needs help in applying the software that we have experienced people ready to go. And they are, in fact, involved in some of those early engagements, I mentioned to Scott's question. It's also the converged roadmap for the information software technology to make sure that ThingWorx and our FactoryTalk Analytics and our MES offerings, fit together really well and are simpler for our customers to deploy than any other alternatives that they might have. John G. Inch - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors : So, it sounds like these are organizational changes versus sort of hard dollar investments. Is that a fair statement? Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: It's really both, John. I mean, we were already investing a significant amount in the information software, prior to this, with MES, with FactoryTalk Analytics and so on. This allows us to continue at a similar rate of investment, but then getting the benefit of the considerable investments that PTC has and continues to make in the IoT area. So, it's both. John G. Inch - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors : Yeah I know I understand. I mean, just lastly, your EV initiatives, are the players that you're partnered with your traditional customers, I mean, there's an awful lot of startup Chinese EVs and other things. I'm just curious, I mean, some of those are likely going to go out of business, right? So, I'm just \u2013 could you talk a little bit about your EV footprint and is it more traditional with your established customers or is it more kind of growth year with the new startups or how should we \u2013 just a little bit of more color would be helpful. Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Sure. Well, it's a nice combination. I mean there are somewhere close to 100 startups that we're engaging with for cars and trucks and other vehicles in the space. And as you said, not all of them are going to make it. But there's also what the established brand owners are doing, and we have heavy involvement there. And then it's the suppliers. So, the powertrain suppliers are a mix and many of these are established companies, but they may not be companies that we were working with as much in the past. And when we re-entered the powertrain space, we became familiar to them again. And as we've talked about the basic manufacturing process for an EV powertrain is, we have a higher readiness to serve there than we do in the traditional IT side. So, it's quite a nice opportunity for us with some of those traditional players as well. John G. Inch - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors : Got it. Thanks very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys good morning. Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Morning, Steve. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : How are you? What are you guys seeing on the food and beverage side, just globally? Company we cover, JBT, talked about some delays, some merger activity, stuff like that. And anything you're seeing on food and beverage into 2019 that's concerning at all? Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: People around the world, as more people are entering, the middle-class people are still looking for a wider choice in what they need, flexible packaging and quick changeover to different packaging styles, to maximize shelf space. Those are still some of the key focus areas for the machinery builders as well as the users as well. One of the important innovations in that space that relates to the ability to quickly change different packaging styles is the Independent Cart Technology that we launched over the last couple of years, and if you go to PACK EXPO most recently, and Interpack, you'll see almost every major supplier showcasing that technology, and we're right in the middle of that. I would also say, now that a lot of the big multinational food companies have addressed some of their cost issues, expansion and growth becomes a little bit more of the focus for them. But in either case, they're looking for doing that as quickly and as productively as possible. And so, we're right there with them, the consumer, and particularly, food and beverage companies are some of the earliest adopters of this whole Connected Enterprise concept of integrating control and information to get that next level of productivity. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. And I'm not sure, if I caught this, and I'm not a math guy. Patrick, what is the incremental margin you're thinking about for next year? I mean, I can do the calc, but just curious, if you mentioned, there's a decent amount of moving parts. So, what's kind of the core incremental you're looking for? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: So, Steve, the reported incremental margin will be about 35% for the full-year. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And that includes all the stuff you talked about. I mean, it seems like it's relatively clean, as there's a lot of moving parts, but a lot of them offset. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. The way you can think about that, the 35% is the reported earnings conversion. Bonus gives us a tailwind of about 5 points, but then we talked a little about tariffs, we get revenue, but not necessarily earnings. And this gets us back to core conversion of about 35%. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot for the color. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. Thanks, good morning. Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Morning. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : According to \u2013 hey, just wanted to dig into Logix plus 7% for this quarter. And we tend to see Logix grow in above the average and didn't this quarter. So, maybe just address that. I understand auto was down 10%, but it was down more this year. And I'm just curious, I mean, the gist of my question really is, are we going to see some dollar spending moving from Logix to maybe the IS connected layer? And then machine tool, we've heard the machine tool is weak globally. And I'm wondering, if that was a factor as well? Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: So, within Logix, we continue to see really good growth of our mid-range offering with CompactLogix. But you also see at the upper end of the Logix range, particularly in heavy industries, you see the ControlLogix sales encouraging as well. And as I mentioned before, we continue to invest in a very contemporary platform, we have been showing a new processor at Automation Fair, which I think \u2013 I think you'll find interesting as well. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Nigel, also for full-year 2018, Logix was up about 7%, which is a couple of points, above the A&S average. And for 2019, we expect Logix to be a little bit above the A&S average as well. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, so nothing with (44:48) Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Nigel, I'm just going to add, one additional thing is the Information Solutions and Connected Services fit really well with Logix. One doesn't replace the other, the Logix creates the data and aggregates the data that come from the basic control processes that feed those Information Solutions and provide the opportunity for those higher value services. So, they really \u2013 they fit together well and they're both fundamental parts of The Connected Enterprise value proposition. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Great. And then just on the leverage. Even with the $1 billion and the dividend increase, I think your net leverage is going to be about 0.7 times by the end of this year. Gross leverage, maybe 0.9 times EBITDA. Can you just remind us, what types of ratios you imagine to going forward from here now that you've got tax reform? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yes. Nigel, we'll talk a bit more about that next week, but the way you can think about it is, we end this fiscal 2018 with about $0.7 billion of net debt. We think by the end of fiscal 2019 that will be about $1.7 billion. And so, the way we'll get there is, we'll expect to reduce our cash and investment balance, which was $1.1 billion at year end, to close to about $0.5 billion. And at the same time, total debt will increase by about $400 million that's what we target now. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Great. And then just, I mean, just want to say, but it sounds like 1Q is going to be impacted by ASC 606 and tariffs, so maybe a little bit of color on 1Q would be helpful. But, I know you don't guide quarterly, but just want to know about that? Thanks, guys. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. What I mentioned Nigel is that in the first quarter, we don't expect EPS growth and you mentioned two of the elements, but the main element will actually be the timing of our spending, the investment spending. Q1 last year was particularly like, we had really high segment margin. And as we released (46:54) some investments in fiscal 2018, the year-over-year increase in our first quarter of 2019 will be the largest of the year from a spend perspective. So, there really \u2013 the tailwinds in the first quarter, of course, we expect some organic growth. There is a tailwind from some lower share count, but there are three main, I'd say, headwinds for the first quarter. The first one we just talked about, the investments that will be the largest one. Then the second one is the impact of ASC 606, which will be mostly impacting the first quarter. And then lastly, the timing of the pricing on the tariffs. And so, we think the net of that means that we won't see EPS growth in the first quarter. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Nigel. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Good morning. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Maybe just the first question for Patrick, following up on your comments on investment spend. I think you had a placeholder for last year of $70 million to $80 million of increase. Just wondered where that came in, in the end. And what sort of magnitude of increase do you anticipate for fiscal 2019 overall? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: So, what we \u2013 basically the spend increase in 2018 was in line what we have shared with you. The fiscal 2019, I mentioned earnings conversion of about 35%. That embeds spending growth at a little bit lower of a rate than our organic growth. And so, think about that 3.5% to 4% spending growth in fiscal 2019. And again, the biggest increase will be in the first quarter. It will be significantly more than that in the first quarter. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Understood. Thank you. And then my quick follow-up would just be around... Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Julian, maybe one \u2013 maybe just one other thing, related to spending. We do expect to increase R&D again faster than our other spend in fiscal 2019. And so, you saw our R&D as percent of sales pick up in fiscal 2018. Our current projections are that will again increase in fiscal 2019. So, our priorities for spend, R&D and then some of the commercial investments that Blake was also referring to including, related to PTC. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Very helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just switching to the demand side again, China I think you'd said in the prepared remarks grew double-digits. Wonder if you could give a little bit more detail on what your expectations are for the fiscal 2019 in China, and any major differences by end market within China? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yes. So, fiscal 2018 was actually a good year for us in China. We were up double-digits for the year. But fiscal 2019, excluding the impact of ASC 606, will be above the average we think in China. So, mid to high single-digits. The ASC 606 revenue rec change impacts Asia and China more than the other regions. So, on a reported basis, we think we're \u2013 on an organic basis, we think that China will be up a little below the company average in fiscal 2019, but that includes a headwind of a couple of points, we estimate related to the rev rec change. Again from a vertical perspective, it's pretty broad based, in terms of what we expect for growth next year in China. We see upside in life sciences as we did this year; chemicals, food and beverage, and we think that oil and gas and transportation might be about mid-single digits next year. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Julian. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, guys. Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Morning, Josh. Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just wanted to follow-up on the 1Q comment. Should we expect to see all of that normalize into 2Q? Because I think for the full-year 35% EPS, or earnings conversion, it kind of implies the next three quarters need to jump up a lot. I just want to make sure that 2Q wasn't more of a ramp or is it an abrupt change 1Q to 2Q on getting over some of those margin headwinds? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: It will be a ramp with the largest year-over-year benefits in Q3 and Q4 from an EPS growth point of view. Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then, just thinking about some of the heavy industry and bigger projects, the book-to-bill at 0.93, I think kind of lines up with the last few years on average, not as big as last year, but that was probably an outlier. I guess, given that it seems pretty typical, is there something outside of project orders or solutions orders that you're seeing that gives you that, kind of, quantitative confidence? Because otherwise, it just seems to be good but not accelerating? Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah. I think I'd start with backlog. So, backlog in Solutions and Services is up double-digits so that's a nice start to the growth. And what orders we have seen with some previous strong Q2 and Q3 book-to-bill have built that. Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. That's helpful. I'll leave it there. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks, Josh. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Hey, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Blake or Patrick, U.S. growth continued to accelerate in Q4. Basically, did that every quarter for you in FY 2018, so can you talk about how you're thinking about the U.S. in 2019 in the sense that, can it sustain that sort of mid to high single-digit growth rate that you've seen lately and have you seen more evidence of onshore and/or just simply higher investment in the U.S. helping your business, given all the increased protectionism out there? Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yeah, we continue to see good opportunities in the U.S. and that's coming of course from the basic metrics that continue to be strong. What we're hearing from customers, the industry outlook as well. I mentioned before that oil and gas is strongest in the U.S., as we look around the world. We talked earlier in the year about even mining activity and so that heavy industries growth as well as the continuing expansion of consumer led by food and beverage and life sciences are important signs for the future. And we continue to think that we're taking share. We have a great position in the U.S. Good products, good market access and we think that, that march is continuing. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then alternatively, Europe does look relatively weak over the last few quarters. I know auto is dragging that down a little bit. I would assume that Europe continues to be relatively lethargic in FY 2019, are you seeing any signs that heavy industries are starting to come back in Europe and that could pull up Europe in 2019 at some point? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: We think Europe next year will be low single digits for us. We think that it will be the region with the lowest growth. In terms of the verticals next year in Europe, we don't expect any growth in transportation, but we do expect in some heavy industries, we do expect some growth next year, as we do in consumers. So, low-single digit growth. Automotive is clearly still a headwind rather than a tailwind in that region. Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: I would also add that, while it's a smaller vertical for us, life sciences continues to be strong in Europe, and that's an area where I mentioned before the Independent Cart Technology for single use, pharmaceuticals as well as the MES system, so that we have a very strong position and help us there with some of the new value from The Connected Enterprise. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: So, Andy you think of life sciences and mining being the two verticals in Europe, where we do expect the strongest growth in fiscal 2019. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks, guys. That's helpful. Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thanks Andy. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Operator, we'll take one more question. Operator : Our final question from \u2013 for today comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys. And I appreciate you fitting me in. Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So my first question, maybe you could provide a little bit more color around what you're doing specifically to offset the $90 million in tariff headwinds? And so, I know you mentioned select pricing actions and also actions along your supply chain. But are there certain guideposts that we should be looking at throughout the year to make sure that the progress is being made? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Yes. So, maybe \u2013 being a little bit into more detail on the $90 million. As I said, we expect to offset half with supply chain alternatives and negotiations with vendors. Of that, I'd say that two-thirds is in the execution phase now, one-third of that is in, I'd say, the planning phase. Then the other half of the gross impact of the tariffs is addressed by selective price increases on the top \u2013 on the products that are impacted by the tariffs. The price increase has gone into effect October 21 and the second one will get into effect \u2013 will come into effect in a couple of weeks, that's why we're saying that there's a little timing from a Q1 perspective; although for the full-year, we expect to be neutral. I'd also add that the gross impact on the tariffs, it's only maybe 20% of that is related to our own manufacturing. The balance is with what we buy from vendors, whether they are components or whether they are some branded products. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. That's helpful, Patrick. And my one follow-up, so clearly some headwinds in 1Q, a lot of the benefits seem to be coming through in the second half, I know you guys don't love giving quarterly guidance; but on 2Q, should we expect a seasonally more normal 2Q, typically you guys do about roughly 23% of your earnings in 2Q, or is that going to be lighter as well as these benefits come through? Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: I'll stick to my earlier comment that most of the EPS growth will be in the second half of the year, and 2Q will be around. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Wonderful. Thanks, guys. Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Thank you. Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: So just to summarize, fiscal 2018 was a very good year with growth in key areas for us. We delivered strong operating and financial performance, we had several important strategic accomplishments this year, and we're looking forward to another good year in 2019. Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.: Okay. That concludes today's call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call. At this time, you may disconnect. Thank you.",

I need to remind everyone that today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. Later in the call, we will open the lines up for questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Steve Etzel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Etzel, please go ahead. Steve Etzel : Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2019 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Patrick Goris, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that website for reply for the next 30 days. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. So, with that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I\u2019ll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck. I\u2019m pleased with our results for the quarter. Organic sales were strong up almost 6% and well above expectations. From a vertical perspective growth was led by consumer and heavy industries. In consumer, food and beverage and Life Sciences were strong. Heavy industries growth was led by mining, open paper and metals. Oil and gas, grew slightly above the company average. Within transportation, automotive was down about 10% in the quarter weaker than expected and Tire was up low single digits. In the quarter, Logix grew 7% organically and Process grew 5%. Revenue from Information Solutions and Connected Services, which is a measure of adoption of new value from the Connected Enterprise, once again profitably grew double digits. Commenting on regional performance in the quarter, North America, which for us is the combination of the U.S. and Canada, grew 6% organically. We saw good growth across a wide range of industries with the exception of Automotive, which was weak. EMEA was down slightly in the quarter. Growth in consumer verticals was offset by declines in heavy industries. Asia grew 4% with most countries in the region contributing to growth. China sales were up mid-single-digits. Latin America sales were up 20%. We saw good growth in Brazil. And Chile was strong due to increased mining activity. As you may recall last year, we won a big order with Codelco and we are starting to see this in our results. I\u2019ll make a few additional comments about our Q1 results. Adjusted EPS was at 13% and segment operating margin was up 40 basis points year-over-year. Book-to-bill performance for our solutions and services businesses was the strong 1.12 in Q1. We grew backlog in the quarter. Patrick will elaborate on our first quarter financial performance in his remarks. Let\u2019s move on now to the macro environment and our current outlook for full year fiscal 2019. We see continuing uncertainty due to trade tensions and geopolitical risks. However, forecast continue to call for industrial production growth. We had a good first quarter and project quoting activity was strong. With one quarter behind us our full year outlook for organic sales growth and adjusted EPS guidance remains unchanged. We continue to expect our fiscal 2019 organic sales to be up 5.2% year-over-year at midpoint of guidance. Currency is now expected to reduce growth by 1.5 percentage points. Including the revised impact of currency, our fiscal 2019 guidance is sales of about $6.9 billion. Our guidance for adjusted EPS remains a range of $8.85 to $9.25. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Patrick to provide more detail about our Q1 results and our 2019 sales and earnings guidance. Patrick Goris : Thank you, Blake and good morning everyone. Before I go through our results and outlook, I want to mention that we made some reporting changes starting the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We outlined these changes in today\u2019s press release and I will cover them briefly when I get the Slide 9 in the deck. For compatibility purposes fiscal 2018 numbers have been recast to confirm the fiscal 2019 reporting. With that said, we\u2019ll start on Slide 4, key financial information first quarter. As Blake mentioned, we have good first quarter of the fiscal year with reported sales up 3.5%. Organic growth was 5.7% about 200 basis points better than we expected. Currency translation was about a two point a headwind to sales growth, worse than expected. Segment operating margin was very strong at 22.8% up 40 basis points compared to last year. A margin tailwind from good organic growth was partially offset by higher investment spending. Earnings conversion, whether you include or exclude the impact of currency was between 30% and 35%. General corporate net expense of $22 million was down $2 million compared to last year. Adjusted EPS of $2.21 was up $0.25 cents compared to the first quarter of last year, an increase of 13%. The year-over-year increase in adjusted EPS is primarily due to the benefit of higher sales and lower share accounts, partially offset by higher investment spending. As expected the net impact of tariffs was a small headwind. First quarter adjusted EPS performance was significantly better than we expected, given stronger than expected organic sales growth and somewhat lower than expected investment spending. Free cash flow was $170 million in the quarter, or 63% of adjusted income. During the first quarter, we paid the animal incentives that our employees earned in fiscal 2018. A few additional items to cover not shown on the slide, for adjusted EPS average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 121.5 million, down 8.6 million or about 7% from last year. We repurchased about 1.8 million shares in the quarter at a cost of $292.8 million. This is slightly ahead of pace to get to our $1 billion full year target. At December 31, we had $816 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Slide 5 provides the sales and margin performance overview for the Architecture & Software segment. This segment had 2.4% reported sales growth. Organic sales were up 4.6% year-over-year, currency translations decreased sales by 2.2%. For the quarter, segment margin increased 100 basis points year-over-year to a very strong 31.5%. Operating leverage associated with the sales growth was partially offset by higher investment spending. Moving on to slide 6, Control Products & Solutions, reported sales were up 4.5% for the segments. Organic sales growth was 6.6% and currency translation reduced sales by 2.1%. Growth in our solutions and services businesses in this segment was strong at about 8%. The product businesses in this segment were up about 5% on an organic basis. Operating margins for this segment was up slightly compared to Q1 last year, primarily due to higher sales offset by higher investment spending. As Blake mentioned, book-to-bill performance in our solutions and services businesses in this segment was 1.12 in Q1. Next slide 7 provides an overview of our sales performance by region. Blake covered most of this \u2013 in this slide in his remarks. So as I just mentioned our growth was broad based across geographies with the exception of EMEA, also we saw good growth in emerging markets which were up high single digits compared to last year. This takes us to slide 8, guidance. We now project sales to about $6.9 billion. Our organic sales growth range remains unchanged that 3.7% to 6.7%. We\u2019ve updated our currency assumptions and we now expect the headwind from currency translation to be closer to 1.5%. We continue to expect segments operating margin of about 22%. Our expected adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 remains about 19.5% and as Blake mentioned we are maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance range of $8.85 to $9.25. With respect to tariffs, we still expect to offset the incremental cost through supply chain changes and negotiations with vendors as well as targeted price increases on effective products. Our supply chain and pricing folks have done tremendous work in this area and we remain on track to neutralize the impact of tariffs for fiscal 2019. We continue to project free cash flow conversion of about 100% of adjusted income. As to general corporate-net, we now project it to be about $95 million. As a reminder general corporate-net now excludes interest income. Net interest expense for fiscal 2019 is expected to be above $90 million. Before I turn it back over to Blake, let me add a couple of comments on slide 9. As I mentioned at the beginning of this call, we made some reporting changes effective the first quarter of fiscal 2019. As you can see on this slide, these changes include the adoption of ASC 606 revenue recognition as well as the new standard that defines operating and non operating pension and post-retirement benefits costs. We transferred some business activities from one segment to the other and we also combined U.S. and Canada into North America consistent with the way we run this region. Finally we removed interest income from general corporate-net. Our press release provides additional detail related to these changes. In addition, slide 10 and 11 of this deck provide a summary of the changes as well as a walk for fiscal 2018 first quarter results. Today updated data books will be available on our website that will include prior year financial results. Recap, the new reporting format. After our earnings call, Steve will be available to cover any additional details and questions you may have about the reporting changes. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to you Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks Patrick. I\u2019ll make some additional remarks related to the execution of our strategy. We are performing well in our key focused areas. There were three components of our growth strategy which are, share gains in our core platforms, double digit growth in Information Solutions and Connected Services and a point or more of growth per year from inorganic investments. Core platform performance in the quarter was highlighted by 7% Logix growth. Our strategic partnership with PTC continues to gain momentum. We\u2019ve had wins across all regions and in our key industry verticals and the pipeline of opportunities is growing every day. We\u2019re also working well with PTC to converge our IoT technology roadmaps. Our pipeline for inorganic investments remains robust. Yesterday we announced the acquisition of Emulate3D, a UK based software company whose products digitally simulate and emulate industrial automation systems. This software enables customers to virtually test machine and system designs before incurring manufacturing and automation costs and committing to a final design. Emulate3D was a member of our partner network and we\u2019ve seen customers benefit by combining their solutions with our technology. Emulate3D software will become part of our FactoryTalk design suite. Turning to the components of our growth strategy, we have the financial flexibility to execute, all within the capital deployment framework described during investor day. An industry where this strategy is delivering tangible results is Life Sciences, where we\u2019ve had several years of good growth. Pharmaceutical companies benefit from our multidiscipline Logix control platform, which addresses discrete, batch and continuous process applications. Customers are implementing our Independent Cart motion technology for greater throughput. And our software offerings such as MES and FactoryTalk innovation suite are important competitive differentiators. Our Connected Services offerings also provide us another way to win. Recently we received another order from Pfizer to help them increase cybersecurity at their global manufacturing facilities. We will plan, implement and support security technology and solutions along with key strategic partners across Pfizer\u2019s global manufacturing supply chain. We\u2019re becoming more important to customers in every industry on their individual journeys to become more productive. Finally, I want to thank our employees, partners, and suppliers for their contributions to a good start to the fiscal year. Our entire organization is energized and excited about our new offerings and the opportunities that are ahead of us. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve to start the Q&A. Steve? Steve Etzel : Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Operator we\u2019ll take our first question Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Your next question comes from John Inch with Gordon Haskett. Your line is open. John Inch : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Steve Etzel : Gordon, can you hear me? John Inch : Yeah. Good morning guys. Hey, so just in terms of the quarter versus the flat EPS expectation, and your results. I think Patrick you mentioned it was driven basically by higher sales. Where did you actually see the surprise to the upside? And do you think those trends continue for the rest of the year? Patrick Goris : Yes, so for the first quarter all regions except EMEA came in better than expectations, particularly the Latin America, which was up 20%. From a industry perspective, some of the heavy industries were better than we expected. In those we include metals, pulp and paper, oil and gas was a little bit better as well. And then consumer was better, particularly life science, which has very strong growth. So I\u2019d say across multiple regions, and particularly Heavy and Life Sciences. John Inch : And Patrick the reason for not changing your guidance given the beat is because you expect things to soften, still given sort of uncertain international markets are there any other clues? How did January do as part of the cadence toward the rest of the year? Patrick Goris : January is consistent what we have in our guidance for the full year. I think one of the ways you can think about this John is we have one quarter behind us. John Inch : Meaning you\u2019re not anticipating a slowing or you\u2019re just not sure. I mean, I\u2019m\u2026 Patrick Goris : No, if we went one quarter behind us, which was a little bit better than we expected then we see no reason at this time to change our guidance for the full year. John Inch : I got it. And then my follow-up is really on the cadence of investment spending. If I remember, I think, you said you spent $70 million to $80 million in fiscal 2018 and you are going to spend $3 million to $4 million more with much of that focused in the first quarter. Are you still on track for that? And what actually did you spend in the first quarter with respect to investment spending? And did that help margins anyway versus kind of heading into the quarter versus your thoughts around investments spending? Patrick Goris : Yeah. So you remember well, John. What we said was that we expected our investment spend to be up about $70 million, seven zero for the full year. Most of that we expect in the first half of this year, we still expect that. The timing is just a little bit different. Q1 was light by about $10 million. Q1 spend was up about 5% year-over-year, that\u2019s about 25%. We expect the first half of the year to \u2013 of the $70 million we think about two thirds of that will happen in the first half of the year. John Inch : Got it. Patrick Goris : Q1 was just lighter than we expected. Blake Moret : By about $10 million. Patrick Goris : Yes. John Inch : Okay. Thanks very much. Appreciate it. Patrick Goris : Thanks John. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Hi good morning guys. Patrick Goris : Good morning Scott. Scott Davis : Starting to get a little bit concerned about earnings after Caterpillar yesterday, but you guys came up with a pretty strong number. I mean what \u2013 some of the folks out there have seen real weakness in China and some haven\u2019t, but you guys clearly haven\u2019t seen much. I mean, can you give us a little local color? Patrick Goris : So China is a mid-single digit up. And some of the industries that contributed to the growth are mass transit. So the metro system continues to be an area where we differentiate and have had good wins and this year continues that Life Sciences, as we mentioned before, globally was good. And China is adopting a lot of the new value that we provide in Life Sciences to compliment the basic control. And then there were other industries, so chemical, metals, still growth in semiconductor and even automotive in China for the quarter. Scott Davis : Interesting. So, Auto is going to be my next question. Help us understand the divergence between SAAR, and CapEx and OpEx obviously. I mean SAAR in China is struggling and inventories arising so that can be a really tough year. But capital spending seems to be on some sort of a solid footing. Is that correct or how would you view the outlook there? Patrick Goris : Yes I would say globally for auto CapEx is flat and there are challengers for the uses of CapEx beyond just plant expansions and capacity as they\u2019re devoting some of that CapEx spend to new technologies like electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles. And in China, we continue to see gains in the electric vehicle market. One of the recent wins was with house and providing a power train for a local, indigenous Chinese brand owner. And remember we essentially re-entered that power train market just a few years ago. And China is one of the places where we\u2019re winning, not only for the joint ventures that involve American companies, but for indigenous Chinese manufacturers as well. The SAAR count if it\u2019s weak will eventually have some impact on our business, but of course the model changes are the direct influence on our growth in automotive. Scott Davis : Yes, fair enough. Thank you guys. Keep up the good work. Patrick Goris : Thanks Scott. Operator : Next question comes from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Hey guys, good morning. Blake Moret : Hi Steve. Steve Tusa : Can you just talk about what you\u2019re seeing in kind of a global machine tool industry, whether it\u2019s some of those guys that operate out of Europe and into China? Whether it\u2019s on the packaging side or elsewhere? Seems to us to follow-on Scott\u2019s question, that there is a lot of foreign component suppliers that sell into that chain that are seeing pronounced weakness and de stocking. So I\u2019m just curious as to kind of what your guys are seeing on that front? Blake Moret : Yes, I\u2019ll make a couple of comments on that, then Patrick may have some to add. We think that the moderation, let\u2019s say in China is contributing to some extent to the weaker results that we see in EMEA. That being said, when we talk about machine tool, there\u2019s a high component of that, that\u2019s going to be CMC oriented versus ELC or logics oriented. And so we may be relatively less exposed in the metalworking areas. Patrick Goris : Yes. Steve, I\u2019m going to add that our OEM business globally was up a little bit less than the company average, so low-single-digits in the quarter, and EMEA was one of the weakest regions there. Steve Tusa : Okay. And just to be clear for kind of the rest of the year, can you maybe give us a bit of a rundown on the major \u2013 what do you expect for the major segments? And how those are trend? I know that you guys talked about at last call, auto accelerating. If I missed that in the beginning, but is that still expected to be up this year \u2013 transportation? Maybe just give us a little color on what\u2019s embedded by vertical in the guidance now and get any calibration there? Blake Moret : Sure. So what we said last quarter, Steve, that we expect the Auto to be flat of fiscal 2019. Given the first quarter and our current outlook, we think that auto will be down mid-single-digits for the year. We think, at this point that that will be offset by some of the better growth we\u2019ve seen in some of the heavy industries that I just mentioned in \u2013 about the first quarter but also Life Sciences. Within Consumer, Life Sciences and Food and Beverage are doing quite well. So versus our, I\u2019d call November guidance, Automotive now expected to be down mid-single-digits for the full year. The heavy industry, a little bit better, and then also strong Consumer, particularly, Life Sciences, and after that, Food and Beverage. Steve Tusa : Thanks. Great color as always. I appreciate it. Blake Moret : Thanks Steve. Operator : You\u2019re next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Blake Moret : Good morning. Julian Mitchell : May be just \u2013 good morning. May be just the first question around process markets. Your grow rate, I think, on sales slowed to about 5%, having been at double-digits in the prior quarter. Are you starting to see any impact from oil, or just a broader macro uncertainty starting to weigh on project activity? And maybe any updated thoughts on how you see process industries growing this year versus the group average? Blake Moret : So in the quarter oil and gas was up slightly above the company average. We continue to make progress in process industries, and of course, that\u2019s concentrated in the [indiscernible] that we call heavy industries. Just as a reminder, that metric of process really measures the adoption of our process control technology, and it\u2019s not that metric the other thing that we sell the industries, like oil and gas, and pulp and paper, and metals, which would have a lot of intelligent motor control as well. So we continue to see good growth in those industries, and we expect that to continue with heavy industries contributing to our growth for the balance of the year. Patrick Goris : And Julian for the full year, we expect a process as we defined it to be up or slightly above the company average. Julian Mitchell : Understood, thank you. And then just circling back on the geographic basis if you could talk a little bit about the EMEA region, I think you talked about low-single-digit growth. You had a slight decline organically in the first quarter. So how quickly do we think that that recovers really? Is it solely to do with China as you talked about? Or do you think there\u2019s some domestic aspect which should drive up EMEA growth over the balance of the year in certain verticals? Patrick Goris : We think obviously, it\u2019s a little bit broader in EMEA than just China, Julian. Obviously growth in EMEA generally from a macro point of view has slowed. We\u2019ve seen that over the last three, four quarters. From a vertical perspective, what we see in that region is that Consumer is still doing pretty well. It\u2019s up mid-single-digits. Heavy industry was down, as was Auto, and Consumer growth not strong enough to offset the weakness in Heavy and in Auto. Actually, our order intake in the first quarter in EMEA was actually pretty decent. And we expect EMEA for the full year to be up, but low-single-digits. Blake Moret : Yes, I think that order intake helped to build backlog. Patrick Goris : Yes. Blake Moret : Which also informed our outlook in the region. And just within transportation, Auto was down and was somewhat canceled down by actual growth in the Tire vertical. Julian Mitchell : Understood. So we should see EMEA improving in fairly short order than in terms of your sales growth? Blake Moret : Our expectation is that we see some year-over-year growth in that region in the back half of the year. Julian Mitchell : Fantastic. Thank you very much. Blake Moret : Thanks Julian. Operator : Next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Rich Kwas : Hey good morning. I\u2019m sorry. I juggled in a couple of things here this morning. I might have missed this, but in Auto in North America, was that down year-over-year within the context of that being done overall for the quarter? Blake Moret : It was Rich. It was down. So Auto was down about 10% globally, and similar for North America in Q1. Rich Kwas : Okay. And I think that was\u2026 Blake Moret : Yes, we think that although, we see some weakness in MRO, in Auto we\u2019ve seen some project delays generally. But at the same time, we see easy and powertrain, as Blake was mentioning, continues to be strong. We still expect double-digit, we see and expect double-digit growth there. It\u2019s just not big enough yet to offset weakness elsewhere in that vertical. Rich Kwas : Just on the North America with the choice based OE is a decent launch cadence this year, year-over-year. So is that just something where you\u2019re not seeing as much wallet of that in terms of the mix, or is there something that we\u2019re missing when we\u2019re looking at the broader numbers? Blake Moret : No. We do expect to participate, actually even more broadly in some of those cadences. So with some of the new value, particularly, in Information Solutions and Connected Services, we actually expect on some of those launches to expand what our traditional content may have been. Yes. Rich Kwas : Okay. Patrick Goris : And I believe some of that goes back to the MRO comment that I was making. Rich Kwas : Okay. Okay, and then last one on, I think, John\u2019s earlier question around the guide. So what gets you to the top end of the guide, in terms of 6.7% organic? What has the work in terms of the various verticals or assumptions that you have got in here? Patrick Goris : The loss variables here, if you can think about some of the trade uncertainties being cleared up, and then a little bit better performance in Automotive. Blake Moret : Okay, so those are the keys to trade in Auto. Rich Kwas : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question come from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks, good morning. I just wanted to come back to, I think, Patrick, your comments on investment spending. I think you said it\u2019s about $10 million lighter than your plan in the first quarter. And then, I think, you said two thirds of the $70 million happens in the first half. So just doing that math and trying to back into 2Q, is the headwind about $30 million or so? Patrick Goris : You mean from a year-over-year point of view in the second quarter? Nigel Coe : Yes. Patrick Goris : Probably a little less than that. Not far off, but a little less than that. Nigel Coe : Little less than that. Patrick Goris : Yes. Nigel Coe : Okay. Actually \u2013 got it. And then\u2026 Patrick Goris : No, the only thing I would add to that. Some of that year-over-year increases investments that we\u2019ve released fiscal 2018, and we see the \u2013 call it the annualization impact of that. It\u2019s not all incremental in fiscal 2019. Nigel Coe : Okay. Patrick Goris : It\u2019s just carried forward. Nigel Coe : And then just one more clear up, and then I\u2019ve got a broader question on PTC. But I think you were talking about 120 bps of impact from the ASC 606 all in 1Q. Did that play through? And then, maybe just talk about the PTC, how that\u2019s progressing so far? And how much sales impact you do have baked into your FY2019 guide from the PDC resale? Patrick Goris : Okay. I think Blake wants me to take ASC 606, and he\u2019ll take PTC. Actually, the impact from ASC 606 was as expected in the first quarter. The EPS impact was several cents negative. So as expected there and no material impact on sales. The reasons for the beat on sales was not related to ASC 606. Nigel Coe : Okay. Blake Moret : Yes, regarding PTC, it was a good quarter. We had some interesting wins in the quarter. We\u2019ve talked before about the quarter at the Investor Day, where we provided value actually in our power transmission facility. And then, at a Asia-Pacific region, a mining company. But since then a couple of additional ones in food and beverage, Labatt Food [indiscernible] company that specializes in processing and providing fresh fruits and vegetables. An Indian tire manufacturer where we had an order over $1 million that included PTC, as well as our MES offering, Dusen Bobcat in the EMEA region, they make loaders and excavators, you\u2019d probably recognize the name. And they were looking at additional analytics and visibility of their operations. And then, in China, another metals and mining account. And those are just a few of these examples. I particularly like the diversity of where we\u2019re winning across geographies and industries. First, it says that the value that we\u2019re offering together is real. And second, it shows that our sales force is energized. They\u2019re out there talking about this and it\u2019s a way to make us more important to customers. There\u2019s also discussions going on in a parallel path to converge our technology road maps and so creating that tighter alliance as time goes on. Nigel Coe : Thanks, that\u2019s great color. And Blake what do have baked into your sales guide from PTC product? Blake Moret : Yes, so PTC falls in the FactoryTalk Innovation Suite, which is also a part of the bucket that we look at as Information Solutions and Connected Services. So we continue to talk about double-digit growth on top of the $300 million base that we talked about last year and with the contribution of PTC, we expect that to double over the next four years. Nigel Coe : Okay, thanks. That\u2019s a great color thanks. Patrick Goris : Thanks, Nigel. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch your line is open. Anna Kaminskaya : Good morning this is Anna Kaminskaya on behalf of Andrew Obin. For me most of the questions have been asked already, but would you be able to provide any additional details on the announced acquisitions? Just how impactful it is to your P&L for the rest of the year? Patrick Goris : Yes. Emulate3D won\u2019t have a material impact on the results in fiscal 2019, but strategically and for customers, it\u2019s really an exciting addition because this is software that works along with our core configuration tools to help customers simulate and emulate the operation of their system. So the simulation allows them to model the physical movement of their production system before they actually have to try it out with hard tooling on the line. And then the emulation capability allows them to look at the performance of the configuration tools, again to make sure that it\u2019s working smoothly and with the correct timing that\u2019s required. We\u2019ve worked with them in the past. We have mentioned that they were part of our former partner program and now we\u2019re going to be able to achieve even tighter integration with them. So again as with PTC we had customers asking for us to get closer before we made this additional step. So we\u2019re excited about it. We think our customers are as well. Anna Kaminskaya : And then any numbers around how much you paid for it or any revenue contribution? Patrick Goris : We\u2019re not disclosing that Anna and as Blake said the impact on fiscal 2019 will be immaterial. Anna Kaminskaya : Got it. And then with some of the changes to accounting and I mean strong 1Q any other moving parts as we think about 2Q outlook, 2Q EPS is it in line with historical seasonality? Anything you would like to call out besides high investment year-over-year that we already talked about? Patrick Goris : Not really, Anna. I think the only thing I would say that we would expect the year-over-year growth to be somewhat balanced \u2013 year-over-year to be somewhat balance first half versus second half of the year. Anna Kaminskaya : Great. Thank you very much. Patrick Goris : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Joshua Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Josh, you\u2019re line is open. Breindy Goldring : This is Breindy Goldring on for Josh Pokrzywinski, good morning. So looking at Q2 guidance within moving investment, we come up with earnings down very slightly EPS. Is that the right way to think about it? Blake Moret : I\u2019m not going provide any additional color than I already did with respect to timing of spend and year-over-year growth rates first half and second half. So I\u2019m not going to provide more detail in the second quarter. Breindy Goldring : Okay. That\u2019s fine. Thank you. Blake Moret : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Richard Eastman with Baird, your line is open. Richard Eastman : Yes. Good Morning. Patrick, could you just speak to there was a $90 million of tariff headwind kind of heading into the year and I think the commentary was half price \u2013 offset would be half price and half supply chain improvements. In that price commentary, I believe Rockwell took a second price hike, I think in November. Could you just speak to maybe the stickiness of that hike and also the price capture at the top line in the first quarter? Patrick Goris : Yes Rick. So our price realization in the first quarter was about a point and so we were on track to get close to 0.5 with the full year, which is what is in our guidance and our expectations. You\u2019re correct, so the 90 million was the gross annual impact. Half of that we expect to offset with supply chain changes and negotiations with vendors, the other half offset with pricing. We had the annual price increase in August of each year as we always do. We had an off cycle price increase in October and then we had an off cycle price increase in December and those last two price increases all related to tariffs. We realized that the price increase that we were targeting associated with those last two price increases and so that\u2019s why I said, we were at about a point in the first quarter, we expect a little bit more than that for the full year, just given the timing of those last two price increases. Richard Eastman : Okay I understood. And then just one question, it probably relates to the illness of margin \u2013 the incremental layer was quite high, there wasn\u2019t a great deal of incremental sales growth, but at the end of the day, is that more of a mix around software sales, did they increase at a faster rate than Logix, is there a mix in there or is that price capture in ANS? I\u2019m curious how we delivered so much margin there? Patrick Goris : The way you cannot think about it there Rick is that our spent was light as I mentioned earlier and it was particularly light in that segment. From a mix point of view within that segment Logix did actually quite well. So there was not a big mix driver within that segment. Richard Eastman : Okay. Because when you talk about \u2013 and Blake you had mentioned this Information Solutions and Connected Services, my guess is the Information Solutions base probably outgrew Connected Services, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s easy enough to parse through, but again that seems like that would have help the software FactoryTalk suite products sales within ANS? Blake Moret : Yes, I think on balance, the margin is between that bucket is at or slightly above the company average over a period of time. Richard Eastman : Well, again I was just looking at the mix being more software friendly in ANS as the PTC agreement expands is that going to be noticeable? Blake Moret : I think it will be, but it\u2019s going to take a while because when we sell some of that software or we add some of our software on top of that it\u2019s on a subscription basis Rick and so therefore it will start out to be small and so obviously we\u2019d like to grow it a fast as possible, but it being description and not license sales it\u2019s going to be slow and it\u2019s going to take some time before you\u2019ll see it have a mixed effect. Richard Eastman : I understand, because this is a different component. Okay, very good thank you. Blake Moret : Thanks Rick. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citi, your line is open. Vladimir Bystricky : Good Morning guys its Vladimir Bystricky on for Andy. Blake Moret : Good morning. Vladimir Bystricky : So, can you guys talk a little bit more, I know you talked about Latin America, the strength in Latin America, so can you just give a little more color on really what\u2019s driving that strength, any particular countries and more about how you\u2019re thinking about the sustainability of the LatAm strength in 2019? Blake Moret : Yes, few comments in terms of the growth drivers in Latin America. Latin America for a long period of time has been a strong region for us. So there\u2019s lots of diversity in the region in industries that we serve well. One of the key starting points in Latin America is the backlog in mining. And so we talked last year about the big Codelco mining project as one example. We\u2019re starting to see some of that order come out in quarterly results and so that\u2019s a strong contributor for us. We also see continued growth in oil and gas particularly in Mexico. And then finally, we\u2019ve seen several quarters of good growth in Brazil as well and so I think those would be three of the key contributors to the continued performance in Latin America. Vladimir Bystricky : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just to circle back on the tariff impact for a moment, I know you talked about the pricing that you\u2019ve put in. I think last quarter you said about two-thirds of the supply chain adjustments were already in the execution phase, can you talk about all of the supply chain adjustments and vendor negotiations sort of now underway or in execution or do you still have more to do there to get to the net neutral on tariffs? Blake Moret : I think everything is being worked on the business need everything is buttoned up. But as I mentioned, we are on track and our teams have done tremendous work on making that happen, which is why we continue to expect that this fiscal year the net impact will be zero. Vladimir Bystricky : Okay, perfect. And then maybe one last one from me, I know you aren\u2019t disclosing financials on Emulate3D but can you just talk more broadly about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of valuation multiples in the pipeline? Have you seen any movement there? Have you seen any valuations start to come in all with the recent market volatility? Blake Moret : I think there\u2019s been, in general across our broad portfolio of names out there, there will be some contraction based on the macro. Vladimir Bystricky : Okay. Thanks very much guys. Blake Moret : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank your line is open. Nicole DeBlase : Yes, thanks. Good morning. Patrick Goris : Good morning. Nicole DeBlase : So a couple of piggybacks on questions that have already been asked, first on China, I know you guys saw him mid-single-digit growth for the quarter. If you could kind of frame out what you expect for the full year? Patrick Goris : Yes, we see China growing mid\u2013single-digits for the full year as well. And we talked before about Life Sciences which is really a macro trend across the world, but the Chinese companies are particularly vigorously adopting some of the new value, some of the software again that sits on top of it basic control systems. We see growth entire in China in the full year. We see growth in oil and gas in China and then a little bit of growth in food and beverage as well. Nicole DeBlase : Okay, understood that\u2019s helpful. And then piggy backing on the question on process, so I know you guys went through kind of what drove the growth this quarter, what happened within the oil and gas but growth did decelerate and I think it was up about 10 organically in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s now at five, if you could just talk a little bit about the moving pieces from 4Q to 1Q? Patrick Goris : Yes, I would look at the majority of that as quarterly variability. We\u2019re not seeing a meaningful slow down in any one area of that versus another. And again, this is one component of what we\u2019re offering to those process applications, the other main piece being the motor control as well. So I wouldn\u2019t look at that as a trend at this point. Nicole DeBlase : Okay, understood. Thanks, I\u2019ll pass it on. Blake Moret : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs, your line is open. Ashay Gupta : Hi, good morning, this is Ashay Gupta on for Joe. Patrick Goris : Good morning. Ashay Gupta : Hey, Patrick you mentioned that investments spent was $10 million lighter than expected in the quarter, over the other due items that you mentioned on 4Q that was supposed to be headwinds like ASC 606 and the impact of pricing, can you just comment on how those two items came in versus your expectations going in? Patrick Goris : Yes, so as I believe I mentioned earlier on the call the earnings impact of ASC 606 \u2013 as we expected also few cents of negative impact. And then with respect to tariffs, in November we mentioned that we expected headwind in the first quarter associated with tariffs and that is exactly what we saw in the first quarter. So the net of price and cost was a small headwind in that Q1 and we expect the net impact of tariffs to be zero for the full year, so current tariff and ASC 606 came in as expected basically in the first quarter. Ashay Gupta : Understood and just secondly, I think in the beginning you guys commented that semis was a strong area in the quarter, which is just surprising given some of the commentary we\u2019ve heard from semis players and some of your competitors, so like what\u2019s different like, are you taking share and what\u2019s your outlook for semis for the rest of the year? Thank you. Patrick Goris : Yes, I think our comment about semi was specific to China, where semi was up from a global basis. Semi was about flat for the first quarter. We\u2019ve seen several years of good growth in semi. We expected this year in our guidance with a slower growth and in semi about mid-single-digits and first quarter was about flat, but with some growth in China as Blake mentioned. Ashay Gupta : Great, thank you. Operator : Next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. John Walsh : Hi. Good morning. Blake Moret : Good morning. John Walsh : So, I guess maybe just one question here to piggy back off some of the earlier price questions if I just kind of go through your K and look at what price has done the last couple of years per your commentary, it looks like it was a little bit less than a point in 2017 and then about 50 basis points in 2018 and if I do the rough math here on what you\u2019re talking about comes from tariff versus organic price it looks like we\u2019re going to tick up a little bit above that 50 basis points you probably realized in 2018. So wondering if this is all just rounding or if you\u2019re actually starting to see some real underlying price traction outside of kind of the tariff impacts where you\u2019re just pushing the price through the channel? Blake Moret : Yes I would say it\u2019s both, you\u2019re right last year we realized about half point in price. We did mention I believe that we were targeting for a somewhat higher price increase in fiscal 2019, given generally increasing input cost leave alone the impact of tariffs. And so we targeted a larger price increase given higher headwind from input costs. And on top of that, that is of course the tariffs and some of the price increases that we haven\u2019t met as a result of that. And so in total we will realize more price this year that\u2019s our expectation than last year, as I said about 0.5. This includes not only the price from the tariffs but also come with our base price increase, the base price realization will be a little bit higher than what it was last year. So it\u2019s both, we realize a little bit more price from annual price increase and on top of that there is the selective price increases related to the tariffs. John Walsh : Got it on that, I guess I was trying to get at maybe some value pricing as you move the portfolio more into your Connected Enterprise and what you\u2019re able to realize on that front kind of absent the general inflation and tariff. What kind of the value add pricing you were getting if you were starting to see any kind of tick up in that relative to where you\u2019ve been historically? Patrick Goris : As we come out with new products, software and capabilities, obviously we try to price it appropriately, knowing that there\u2019s still some competition out there. John Walsh : Got it great, appreciate the color. Thank you. Patrick Goris : Thank you. Operator, we\u2019ll take one last question. Operator : Your last question comes from Scott Graham with BMO, your line is open. Scott Graham : Hi, good morning. Like I think others had a number of earnings this morning, so I\u2019ve jumped often on the call. So forgive me if I am trouble asking a question here. On the EMEA, organic down seven-tenths of a percent, would you be able to split for us Europe versus Middle East and Africa there? And the driver of what happened in Europe? Blake Moret : Yes, I believe that if we think about this matured markets in EMEA generally no \u2013 emerging companies in EMEA generally performed better than the matured companies in that region. Scott Graham : Remains down mid-single-digit? Blake Moret : Say Again? Scott Graham : Would you say that the matures were down mid-single-digit or may be low-single\u2026 Patrick Goris : There is a raise there, the way I would say that some of the mature companies would be below the EMEA average and so the emerging companies would be a little bit better. Obviously mature companies still account for the majority of our business in that region. Scott Graham : Understood. Thank you. And on oil and gas, I know that you\u2019re a little bit more tilted towards the upstream, I was just wondering, what your customers were saying given North America, first half of the year kind of look a little wise where capital spending does with some of these upstream guys? What are you seeing in North America and elsewhere in your upstream business in oil in next six to nine months? Blake Moret : Yes. So we continue to see growth in oil and gas, mid-single digits growth for the year. You\u2019re right, a little more than half of our business is upstream with the remainder split between midstream and downstream. We continue to see strength in the Permian and one of the important comments because we\u2019re not as dependent on the big mega projects, regardless of the price of oil. People are going to be looking for productivity in their operations, that\u2019s really our sweet spot either with the solutions or with individual products as people find ways to make even more efficient into their production operations. And so we continue to see that as a source of growth for us including the U.S. Scott Graham : Right, thank you. Blake Moret : Thank you. Steve Etzel : Thanks. Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Blake for a few final comments. Blake Moret : Thanks for everyone\u2019s questions. I just want to summarize. The first quarter was a great start to the year. We delivered strong operating and financial performance. We\u2019re executing on our key initiatives and our strategy is working. Steve? Steve Etzel : Okay, that concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for joining us. You may disconnect. Operator : And that concludes today\u2019s conference call. At this time you may disconnect. Thank you.",

Later in the call, we will open up the line for questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Steve Etzel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Etzel please go ahead. Steve Etzel : Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's second quarter fiscal 2019 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Patrick Goris, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that website for replay for the next 30 days. Before we get started I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. So, with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks Steve. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to page 3 in the slide deck. Our results for the quarter reflect profitable growth in all regions led by strong process industry performance. We saw accelerating growth in Information Solutions and Connected Services reflecting adoption of the Connected Enterprise. Our growth was tempered by weaker than expected automotive sales which were down about 20% year-over-year. This impacted our product sales in the quarter, particularly in North America. In this region, we saw a strong product growth in January. February was weak with orders picking up in late March. Globally, organic sales were up 3.6%. From a vertical perspective, growth was once again led by Heavy Industries which grew high-single-digits and Consumer which grew mid-single-digits. Heavy Industries' growth was led by oil and gas, pulp and paper, and mining. Oil and gas grew double-digits. In Consumer, Life Sciences was very strong. I already mentioned Automotive, but within Transportation, Tire grew nicely up double-digits. Our KPI for process sales grew 10% organically. The weakness in automotive drove the 2% decline in logics. Commenting on regional performance in the quarter. North America, which for us is the combination of the U.S. and Canada, grew 2% organically. While Automotive weakness significantly impacted the overall growth rate for this region, growth was broad-based across a wide range of industries. In pulp and paper, we won a significant process and power control order this quarter with Green Bay Packaging. EMEA was up over 5% in the quarter led by Consumer and Tire. Asia grew about 4% led by Heavy Industries and Automotive. China grew 6.5%. Latin America sales were up 13% led by Heavy Industries. I'll make a few additional comments about our Q2 results. Adjusted EPS was up 8% and segment operating margin expanded 40 basis points year-over-year. Book-to-bill performance for our Solutions and Services businesses was 1.09 in Q2. Backlog remains high. Patrick will elaborate on our second quarter financial performance in his remarks. Let's move on now to guidance for full year fiscal 2019. Forecast continue to call for industrial production growth. We continue to see broad-based growth with strong financial performance. However, given the weakness in Automotive, we are reducing the high end of our guidance range for organic sales growth and adjusted EPS. We expect our fiscal 2019 organic sales to be up 4.5% year-over-year at mid-oint of guidance. Currency is now expected to reduce growth by two percentage points. Including the revised impact of currency, our fiscal 2019 guidance is sales of about $6.8 billion. Mid-point of the updated adjusted EPS guidance range is now $9 compared to $9.05 in previous guidance. As Patrick will discuss in a few minutes, this guidance does not include the impacts of the Sensia joint venture. Moving onto slide four. I'll provide an update on two recent strategic investments to increase long-term value for our customers and share owners. Our strategic partnership with PTC is progressing well. We're winning profitable new business across all focus industries and geographies and some of our engagements are expanding to multisite rollouts. Even in Automotive where overall spending is down, customers are excited about our FactoryTalk InnovationSuite. Recently, Ford decided to expand this new offering to additional locations. Another customer, ECARX, an affiliate of Geely Auto Group, chose the FactoryTalk InnovationSuite to improve production management and quality. In Consumer, Rockwell Automation is partnering with Stanley Black & Decker to bring the Connected Enterprise to life through their Manufactory 4.0 digital manufacturing division. As shown on the right side of this slide, in February, we announced that we will be forming the Sensia joint venture with Schlumberger, creating the oil and gas industry's first fully integrated automation solutions provider for the digital oilfield. The announcement has been well received by target customers. Activities to form the joint venture are well underway. Now, I'll turn it over to Patrick to provide more detail around our Q2 results and our 2019 sales and earnings guidance. Patrick Goris : Thank you, Blake and good morning everyone. I will start on slide five, key financial information second quarter. Reported sales in the quarter were about flat year-over-year, with 3.6% organic growth mostly offset by currency translation of 3.2%. Organic growth was lower than we expected, driven by weaker automotive sales in North America. Segment operating margin remained strong at 21.3% and was up 40 basis points compared to last year. A margin tailwind from organic growth was partially offset by higher investment spend. General corporate net expense of $27 million was up $2 million compared to last year. Adjusted EPS of $2.04 was up $0.15 compared to the second quarter of last year, an increase of 8%. The year-over-year increase in adjusted EPS is primarily due to the benefit of higher sales and lower share count, partially offset by higher investment spending and higher net interest expense. Free cash flow was $105 million in the quarter, about 45% conversion and weaker than normal for us in Q2. There are several elements that contributed to this. First, our tax payments are overweight to the first half this year and specifically in Q2. We paid about half of what we expect to pay for the full year in Q2, including the first installment on the repatriation tax that is owed as a result of Tax Reform. Overall, tax payments were about $140 million in the quarter, about $65 million higher compared to Q2 last year. Second, we issued $1 billion of long-term debt in the quarter. In advance of this transaction, we entered into interest rate hedges. We closed out the hedges at the time we issued debt which resulted in us paying about $36 million to settle the hedges. Even though this relates to the debt financing and this amount gets amortized to interest expense over the length of the debt term, this payment gets reported as an operating cash outflow, which reduced free cash flow in the quarter. Working capital was another factor particularly inventory. We've talked in the past about activities related to our supply chain, including some manufacturing re-foot printing in Europe and the relocation of our U.S. distribution center. We have built safety stock to facilitate these activities and we expect to reduce this inventory by fiscal year-end. I will talk about full year free cash flow when I discuss guidance. A few additional items to cover not shown on the slide. For adjusted EPS, average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 120 million, down 8.5 million or about 6.5% from last year. We repurchased about 1.4 million shares in the quarter at a cost of $236 million. Through March 31st, repurchases amount to $529 million and are slightly ahead of pace to get to a $1 billion full year target. At March 31st, we had $580 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Slide 6 provides the sales and margin performance overview for the Architecture & Software segment. Year-over-year sales declined 2.2% in this segment. Organic sales were up 1.2% year-over-year. Acquisitions added one-tenth of a point currency translation decreased sales by 3.5%. For the quarter, segment margin contracted 30 basis points year-over-year, yet remains very strong at 28.4%. Moving on to slide 7, Control Products & Solutions. Reported sales were up 2.5% for the segment, organic sales growth was 5.7%, currency translation reduced sales by 3.2%. Growth in our Solutions and Services businesses in this segment was strong at over 8%. The Product businesses in this segment were up about 2% on an organic basis. Operating margin for the segment was up 140 basis points compared to Q2 last year, primarily due to higher sales largely offset by higher investment spending. The next slide 8 provides an overview of our sales performance by region. Blake covered most of this slide in his remarks, so I'll just mentioned that growth was broad-based across geographies. Also, we saw a good growth in emerging markets, which were up high-single digits compared to last year. This takes us to slide 9 guidance. Before I cover what is on the slide, I will make some comments about Sensia the JV that we and Schlumberger announced in February this year. JV formation activities are underway and regulatory approvals are pending. As Blake mentioned, the impact on our financial statement is dependent on timing of close, and we have therefore not included the estimated impact of Sensia in our fiscal 2019 guidance. Assuming a close by the end of our fiscal year September 30, we continue to estimate a $0.05 EPS headwind for fiscal 2019. With that, let me move to guidance. We now project sales of about $6.8 billion for full year fiscal 2019. We reduced the high end of our organic growth range to reflect continued expected weakness in Automotive. Our organic sales growth range is now 3.7% to 5.3% with the midpoint of 4.5%. Currency translation is now expected to be about at two point headwind. We continue to expect segment operating margin of about 22%. Our adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 is now about 19% compared to 19.5% in our January guidance. We're also lowering the upper end of our adjusted EPS guidance range. Our new range is $8.85 to $9.15. Compared to prior guidance, volume and mix headwinds are partially offset by reduced spending, and the benefit from the lower tax rate. We are assuming 119.5 million average diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2019. With respect to tariffs, we remain on track to neutralize the incremental costs through supply chain changes and negotiations with vendors, as well as targeted price increases on affected products. We continue to project free cash flow conversion of about 100% of adjusted income. General corporate-net is now projected to be about $95 million to $100 million. As a reminder, general corporate-net now excludes interest income. Net interest expense for fiscal 2019 is expected to amount to about $90 million, consistent with our January guidance. In short, we expect another year of strong financial performance. Our updated guidance at the midpoint projects 11% adjusted EPS growth on 4.5% organic sales growth and the year-over-year increase in operating margin of about 0.5 point. With that, I'll hand it back over to Steve. Steve Etzel : Thank you. Before we start the Q&A, I just wanted to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible. So please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Operator let's take our first question. Operator : Thank you. And your first question here comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Scott Davis : Hey good morning guys. A \u2013 Blake Moret : Good morning. A \u2013 Patrick Goris : Good morning. Q \u2013 Scott Davis : I can't remember a quarter where process was in that double digit, but everything else was a little bit slower. And help -- I know your business is lumpy, so quarter-to-quarter sometimes isn't the best way to look at things. But help us understand really the CapEx versus OpEx that you're seeing out there and maybe the type of visibility that you see on projects of various sizes. A \u2013 Blake Moret : So continuing the theme that we've talked about in the past few quarters, Heavy Industries continues to be strong and Heavy Industries are biased towards process application. So we had a really strong quarter in oil and gas. Mining continues strong due in part to high backlog that we entered the year with. And within those, we're seeing a mix of both capital projects as well as ongoing small projects and servicing the installed base. I mention as well in my prepared remarks, I've talked about Information Solutions and Connected Services growth accelerating and there was a fair part of that that was in process industries. So for instance, we received our largest ever MES order at the European Pharma Company Lonza and that is encouraging because it's new value in these process applications. Q \u2013 Scott Davis : No that's helpful. And maybe this is a little bit picky again, but in auto, I mean we know auto sales are relatively weak, but is there any visibility on Auto CapEx coming back? I mean I know there is -- seem to be a crap ton of EV launches coming in the next two years and just help us understand the cadence of when that spend may start to really kick in? A \u2013 Blake Moret : Yes. We're already seeing the very front end of what we do expect to be increased spend for CapEx in EV. It's still a small part of our overall total in Auto, but EV is set to double this year for us. It's just that it's -- we'll see some of that in the balance of this fiscal year and then we do see continued increases into '20. I think within the given CapEx spending for the general auto market, the capacity and the model changes have to contend with spending at the brand owners for investment in EV and autonomous vehicles. So they're new contenders for that CapEx spend regardless of the size of it. Q \u2013 Scott Davis : Okay. That\u2019s helpful Blake. Good luck. Thank you. A \u2013 Blake Moret : Thanks Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Steve Tusa : Hey guys. Good morning. A \u2013 Blake Moret : Good morning Steve. Q \u2013 Steve Tusa : What are you seeing over in China? And how do we kind of read or maybe link what's going on with some of the robotics guys and some of the Japanese suppliers in there to kind of what's happening in your business? So I know that there's definitely capacity being added, but a bit of slowing in that end market. I know you guys don't do anything kind of directly for the robot, but like, how do we kind of reconcile what you guys are seeing versus what you're seeing from those customers? A \u2013 Blake Moret : So we did have a reasonably strong quarter in China with 6.5% growth. That included a growth in automotive. And I think one of the reasons for that is China, the percentage of investment in EV is probably a little bit ahead in some of the other markets. And as we've talked about, we have a really good readiness to serve in the EV portion of the auto market. So I think that was part of it. We've also heard that some of the stimulus spending in China has helped prompt growth in metro and water projects and those are both good industries for us as well. Steve Tusa : So how much do you think EV for you guys? How much was Auto in China up? And then how much of -- how much was EV if you can break that up at all? And then also from order timing perspective, would they order all like the robots first and then order your stuff? Or does it all come at the same time? Blake Moret : So Auto was up mid-single digits in China for us. I don't know the split of EV versus traditional internal combustion projects other than to say it would be a higher weighting towards EV than in other parts of the world. And then in terms of the spend in the cycle for robotics, a lot of it has to do when our orders are released to the tooling suppliers and then when they decide to enter the orders to us, but I don't know that there's going to be a strict sequence when the robot orders are placed and when orders are placed for our products. Steve Tusa : Okay. Thanks a lot. I appreciate the color. Blake Moret : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from John Inch with Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead. Your line is open. John Inch : Thank you. Good morning everybody. Blake Moret : Good morning, John. John Inch : Good morning, guys. So the down 20% in Auto, is that the new run rate embedded in your guidance like Patrick for the year? And -- or are there things that you think moderate that cadence improve it so to speak towards the back half or into next year? Blake Moret : Yeah. John I'll make a couple of comments and then Patrick will add a little bit. So we mentioned that we were down in the quarter around 20% in Auto and we're expecting the full year to be down about 10%. We do have line of sight for some projects that have already started to make purchases. We expect some of that will show up in the year. And with that Patrick maybe some additional comment. Patrick Goris : We don't expect year-over-year growth in any quarter Q3 or Q4 in Automotive, John. Sequentially we expect Q3 and Q4 to pick up just a little bit low single-digit. Flat to slightly up and that refers to some of the larger projects that we know are in flight that Blake was referring to. John Inch : Okay. That's helpful. Switching actually just to the JV with Schlumberger, Sensia. How are you guys going to gauge success in this business? And I don't think I saw what financial targets you would establish but is there anything you could share with us? Blake Moret : Yeah. It's a double-digit profitable growth. When you look at the digital oilfield markets, which is already over $5 billion, we believe the market itself is growing double digits. So we, obviously, expect to grow above the market. And so it is a very simply profitable growth in the upstream oil and gas business. From a financial target point of view, John we talked about one. We expect to achieve our financial criteria through acquisition so 10% free cash flow yield in year\u2019s three to five. The other thing is for fiscal 2019, assuming a close at the end of this fiscal year, which is not completely in our control given the regulatory approvals, we expect $0.05 EPS headwind. For fiscal 20, we expect it to be above EPS neutral including about $0.10 of fees and intangible amortization John Inch : And Patrick not to get nitpicky what's the nature of dilution. Is that because you're giving up profit to the JV, but don't you capture that back or is it investment spending? Patrick Goris : There are setup costs and deal fees and transaction fees associated with that in fiscal 2019. And if we close it by the end of this fiscal year, we would see some of the setup costs but wouldn't see any of the revenue that comes with the JV. John Inch : Got it. Busy morning. I\u2019ll leave it at that. Thank you. Blake Moret : Thanks, John. Patrick Goris : Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning. Patrick Goris : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Just two quick things from me. Just first on investment spending. Patrick, I think you said you're expecting lower investment spending. Are you just bringing that down in concert with the change in the revenue guide? Or is there some other kind of posture you're taking on investment spending here? Patrick Goris : No Jeff. You're right. During the -- during our second quarter, and as Blake mentioned we saw, weakness starting in February. We decided to push out some of our increased spending for the full year. Last year we talked -- last quarter we talked about $70-or-so million. We're thinking about $20 million less, increase for the full year. This is going to be focused on lower discretionary spend. We're protecting, our most important investments of course. And of that $50 million $55 million increase we're talking about now we still expect about two-thirds of that we would have seen in the first half of the year. So we've seen most of the call it ramp up and spend. Jeff Sprague : And in terms of process Blake, could you just provide a little bit more color on what you're seeing upstream versus downstream? Is there any pause at all in your upstream activity, as you're prepping for Sensia to happen? Just any other color there would be helpful. Blake Moret : Yeah. We continue to see, oil and gas activity continues strong. We had double-digit growth in the quarter. And as you know, we're a little bit heavier exposed on the upstream and midstream. So we think it's a good time for Sensia. Besides, oil and gas and process, I mentioned in my prepared remarks about Green Bay Packaging. That was a significant paper machine project with all the ancillary equipment that'll be worth over $10 million to us. So we are seeing CapEx spend in different parts of the process market. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Blake Moret : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Maybe just starting off with the North America business, you talked about the sharp slowdown there in organic growth in Q2, but a better or there's some sort of exit rates? So just wondered what should we expect for, North America growth in the second half, versus what you did in Q2. And were there any specific verticals that have seen that pickup? Patrick Goris : Yeah. So Julian for the second half of the year, we expect actually somewhat similar growth rates as we've seen in the second quarter for North America. And so in general we expect continued above-average growth in our Solutions and Services business which are most -- more exposed of course with some of the heavy industries that we're talking about, but our product business is we expected about similar growth rates in Q3, Q4 than what we've seen in the second quarter. Julian Mitchell : Thank you very much. And then my second question, would be around, if you'd experienced much or any inventory adjustments for some of your particularly products obviously, at any particular clusters of OEMs or distribution? Or whether you felt that inventory adjustments have been in line with kind of normal seasonality? Patrick Goris : Julian there is nothing that we've seen that indicates that inventory moves were of significant impact one way or the other on our quarterly results. Julian Mitchell : Great, thank you very much. Patrick Goris : Thanks, Julian. Blake Moret : Thanks, Julian. Operator : Your next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Nigel Coe : Yeah. Good morning. Patrick Goris : Good morning. Q \u2013 Nigel Coe : I'm having some problems here with the mute button. So a quick question. Your peers Seimens and Schneider have been quite cautious on The Street market commentary in general ABB as well. And obviously you called out automotive down 20%, that's about a two-point drag to your guidance initially. But I'm wondering, how was the health of your other three markets. And then, in particular I'm thinking about semis and just general manufacturing. How would you describe the health ex-auto industry? Blake Moret : So when we look at the other, let's say clusters of more discrete industries than Consumer. We continue to see good growth there. There is a mix of discrete and process applications there. But through the year I mentioned just a few minutes ago about the big project in pharma, Life Sciences continues to be a very strong growth vertical for us. And there's growth in other parts of Consumer as well. We also mentioned that Tire was a bright spot in this quarter. Tire is a great fit for our offering, because it has elements of process as well as discrete. And Tire is strong in the worldwide picture as well. Nigel Coe : Okay, great. And semi. I think you were talking about that being up mid single-digits. Is that playing out the way you expected? Patrick Goris : Semi for the quarter Nigel was down about mid single-digit. Blake Moret : After a couple of years of strong double-digit growth semiconductor has moderated. We continue to participate in projects largely around the environmental control a lot of software-based projects, but we have seen a moderation in semi. Nigel Coe : Okay. No surprise. I know that there's a lot of people in the queue. So I'll leave it there. Thanks guys. Blake Moret : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Richard Eastman with Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Richard Eastman : Yes. Good morning. Blake, could you just speak to the Information Solutions and Connected Services business? I think you mentioned was plus double-digits. Can you just maybe sift out if any the PTC contribution actually in dollars and pushing that growth rate up. Is there -- can you better define may be how PTC and some of the early wins there have maybe pushed the growth rate up there a bit? Are we seeing that? Blake Moret : We are seeing that. And while in terms of showing up as revenue, it's still early given the subscription nature of these. It allows us to have richer conversations with customers across really all of our target industries and in multiple geographies. And so PTC's offering, whether it's the ThingWorx or the Kepware or even the Vuforia augmented reality those add to our portfolio. And in addition to the offerings that we internally have been working on the analytics and so on it allows us to bring what is really the industry-leading portfolio to these customers. And the best proof is what customers are buying. Customers who've had exposure to all of our competitors, our traditional competitors, new competitors are picking us, because our offering and our focus on outcomes is carrying the day. And I would say, it's not just a traditional decision-makers that we're talking to. CIOs are in these discussions. CFOs. In some cases, we're seeing people leading the IoT programs, if these customers actually report to the CFOs and we're happy to have those discussions, because of our focus on business outcomes. Richard Eastman : And just my follow-up question is just around given the mix of business and where we're seeing strength whether on the Heavy Industries process businesses, which typically have a bit -- a longer tail to them. The business feels later cycle in general, when I look at the end markets, the growth in the end markets. How do you assess that? When you look at your front log, the book-to-bill here at 1.02 is -- it's better than 1, but it seems to be a little bit softer than where it's historically run in the second quarter. And any thoughts about kind of length of cycle or what you're seeing from a front log standpoint relative to where you're showing growth in your -- in Rockwell's business? Blake Moret : Sure. So first of all book-to-bill in the quarter for Solutions and Services was 1.09 and so we thought that that would help for the second quarter. And we believe that the quarter does point to success and increasing our exposure to additional industries some of which are traditionally looked at as more life cycle. So we talk about strength in oil and gas and in mining. We see even in some of the more traditionally short cycle businesses adding the new value through the Information Solutions and Connected Services. Taken together they really are part of our very deliberate attempt to find more ways to win and to increase recurring revenue because in each of these areas there's a high component of subscription-based software and recurring service revenue. Richard Eastman : Okay. Thank you much. Blake Moret : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead, your line is open. Deepa Raghavan : Good morning guys. Blake Moret : Good morning. Deepa Raghavan : Your commentary -- just to suggest that things were pretty much in line with what you were expecting with perhaps the exception of Automotive. Outside of organic, probably currency was a bigger headwind. But my question is with regards to 2019 organic growth guide up higher end at 5%, what kind of gets you there at this time? I mean Automotive you seems to -- you've obviously slashed your expectations there, but what are the other industries that could get you to that high end of organic growth guide? Blake Moret : Yes. So, in Heavy Industries, it would be the continued strong growth in Heavy Industries through the year that takes us to that high end and then Automotive meeting the expectations that we talked about earlier. Deepa Raghavan : Okay. So, you're not necessarily assuming Automotive's get -- I mean you're assuming there's some -- it gets better from comps and stuff, but you're not necessarily expecting it to bounce back to positive on a year-over-year basis. Obviously, you're seeing it down 10%, but it's not-- Blake Moret : We think we've taken a realistic approach to Automotive as were factored in the guidance for the year. Deepa Raghavan : Got it. Got it. So, you're pretty strong in Europe especially with the OE machine builders. I mean that region is weakening and looks like your outlooks probably contemplate that slow down. But can you right-size us on what your regional expectations are within that full year guide now organic growth? Thank you. Patrick Goris : So, we think that for EMEA, we think it will be about the company average in terms of organic growth. Yes for the full year. We strengthened in Tire and in Consumer. Deepa Raghavan : How about the other regions too? Blake Moret : You mean for the--? Deepa Raghavan : No, China, Americas, et cetera? Patrick Goris : Sure. For the full year we now expect North America to be a little bit below the company average at the midpoint, EMEA at above the company average, Latin America we expect to be our strongest region, double-digit growth, Asia we expect to be at above the company average, and same for China, above company average for China for the full year. Deepa Raghavan : Great. Thank you very much. Patrick Goris : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stephens. Please go ahead, your line is open. Robert McCarthy : Good morning. If you could just review your Auto performance in the context of A&S and CP&S and talk about what you saw in terms of your bridging year-over-year for the operating profit decline on a dollar basis? Is there anything -- any kind of color you can give us there just so we get a sense of kind of the mix headwind? Patrick Goris : Yes, the way I would answer that question Rob is that our Automotive business would be overweight in Architecture & Software versus Control Products & Solutions. So, the largest impact of Automotive would be on Architecture & Software including logics compared to the Control Products & Solutions segment. Robert McCarthy : All right. Thank you for that. And then in terms of PTC, could you talk about how that relationship is going? And then in particular should we expect any kind of further product enhancements or launches around there for confab in Boston in June the ThingWorx? Blake Moret : Sure. So, Rob you may have heard last night when PTC announced they talked about good bookings growth in IoT and satisfaction probably more than satisfaction with the relationship and we agree with that. We're seeing good success. We've had -- this really energized our salesforce with 1,500 people in the organization trying on the PTC products and how they add to the overall solution. And the best proof is that customers in all industries and in all geographies are voting with their wallets that this is a great solution. So, we think it's going well. It speaks well to the future and the additional value that we can provide from financial standpoint. This contributes to our ability to more than double the $300 million of Information Solutions and Connected Services business that we had last year. In 2022, that's profitable growth with a high element of recurrent revenue from subscriptions and services. So, we're very happy with the progress of the relationship. Rob McCarthy : Thanks for your time. Blake Moret : Thanks, Rob. Operator : Your next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Vladimir Bystricky : Good morning, guys. This is Vlad Bystricky on for Andy. Blake Moret : Morning. Vladimir Bystricky : So shifting back to the regions a bit. EMEA's strength in the quarter is a little surprising just given some of the headlines we've seen out of Europe. So can you talk about what changed versus 1Q, 2019 when EMEA was down to now mid single digit growth and the growth that you're talking about seeing for the remainder of the year? Blake Moret : I'll make a couple of comments and then Patrick might have some as well. As we mentioned, in EMEA, the growth was led by consumer. And tire was especially strong. As I mentioned before tire is a good industry for us and a lot of the tire builders are in Europe and there was some significant purchases that contributed to those results. Patrick Goris : Yeah. I would also say the last quarter we said that our backlog looks good and were a little bit higher that we expected some organic growth in the balance of the year which is what we started seeing in the second quarter. So, we expect some modest growth in EMEA for the balance of the year as well. Vladimir Bystricky : Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the free cash flow outlook. I know you mentioned some of the headwinds that impacted F2Q. But can you talk about, one, whether the weakening in auto and -- was any incremental drag on free cash in the year and then just given the unchanged guidance your level of confidence in driving that acceleration in the back half of the year. Patrick Goris : Yeah. So, we don't believe that auto has a significant impact on free cash flow other than, of course, a drag on sales that we've been seeing. In terms of our confidence, obviously, we have high confidence. We're going to be able to deliver 100% free cash flow for the year. That's why our guidance remains unchanged compared to the one we provided last quarter. And obviously that guidance is second half weighted. Vladimir Bystricky : Great. Thank you. Patrick Goris : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. John Walsh : Hi. Good morning. Patrick Goris : Good morning, John. John Walsh : Hi. So a lot of ground covered, but I wanted to go back to your comment around acceleration on the Information Solutions and Connected Services. Continues to grow double-digit. That can mean a lot of things. Can you kind of talk about the order of magnitude of the acceleration you're seeing? And then I guess as a follow-up to that one of the things we picked up over at Hannover is that payback periods are shortening on some of these investments. What's actually driving that acceleration in your mind? Is it quicker paybacks? Is there something else as people prepare for 5G kind of anything you think? Blake Moret : Sure. Well, we are seeing acceleration and its strong double-digit growth in the quarter which is helped by the PTC relationship complementing our own internally developed offerings. I think the biggest factor towards the growth of our business and really of the whole market is the ability to deliver positive business outcomes. So, you have to start with the ability to quantify what savings you're providing for that customers. Everything else is really just talk. And so by focusing on helping those customers get to market faster being able to increase the OE with operational productivity, the predictive maintenance, we understand those areas and the specific ways that we can help in our target industries. And so payback periods of less than a year should be realistic as company invest in that first pilot, quantifies, the results and then moves on to multisite rollouts. I would also mention that, our success has been putting the software and the services on top of a wide variety of control systems. In some cases, some part of our logic space systems. Other times, it's on top of the competitors, where we'd come in and added that new value. So it's an exciting area for us to be. John Walsh : Great. And then maybe just one quick follow-up on that. So when you do put your \u2013 when you come in and do the integration side of the work if it's not on top of logics, I mean, how does the mix on that project look for Rockwell? Because I would think \u2013 maybe not \u2013 there's obviously going to be multiple projects and they're all going to look differently, but can you just talk about the mix impact that you see in some of those projects? Blake Moret : Sure. In general, it's going to be around the Rockwell average. And so the software is very profitable. When there's the delivery that's more labor-intensive that's going to be a little bit below our average. But regardless of whether we're providing the logics and the drives and so on along with the software and the services, just like bucket the Information Solutions and Connected Services has profitability about the Rockwell average and it has a higher degree of recurring revenue than the Rockwell average. John Walsh : Got you. Appreciate it that. Thank you. Blake Moret : Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Scott Graham : Hi. Good morning. Blake Moret : Good morning, Scott. Scott Graham : Kind of a question on tariffs, I know that, you commented that you still fully expect to offset them for the year. I think the number coming into the year was something like $90 million. The plan at the time is as I remember was half price half supply chain, I believe. And I was just kind of wondering if you could sort of A, kind of tell us, where pricing sort of landed in the quarter. B, is there any changes to the buckets? And C, back to B, I guess, with the likelihood of moving up to 25% seemingly much dimmer now does that change the $90 million? Patrick Goris : Yes, Scott. So with respect to pricing our overall price realization in the quarter was about 0.5 which is consistent with what we expect for the full year. With respect to changes in the tariffs, we still project to have a neutral impact on our financials. The cost versus what we realized through price and negotiations with vendors, if the 10% on this three does not go to 25 the full year impact or the annual impact of nine headwinds will be closer to 70, 75. But then again it wouldn't have an impact on our overall financials because we're targeting it to be neutral for our fiscal year. Scott Graham : So you \u2013 Patrick Goris : I would say in \u2013 in short it is playing out \u2013 Scott Graham : Sorry. Patrick Goris : Scott? Scott Graham : Please. Well I was just asking then you would pull back on your supply chain initiatives to balance that off? Patrick Goris : No. The way you could think about this is if the $10 million does not go to $25 million there won't be a need for us to be implement another price increase associated with tariffs. Scott Graham : Fine. Okay. Great. Thank you. I want to maybe go back to Auto and beat that horse a little better I guess. So first quarter Auto was down 10 and this quarter you're saying it's down 20. Yet, you're projecting full year minus 10. On a situation, it looks like it actually deteriorated further this quarter. And I know you said, you've outlined the side on some things and also I think you're facing minus 10 comps in the second half. But I'm just kind of hoping you could give us a little bit more on kind of how we get there into the minus 10 in the second half of the year? Blake Moret : Yes, Scott. So the way you can think about this whereas Q2 was down about 20% year-over-year, it was pretty much flat compared to our first quarter. And so for the balance of the year, we expect Automotive in Q3 and Q4 to be slightly up low-single-digits related to some of the larger projects that we know are in flight. And so, call it, flattish to slightly up for the balance of the year. From a year-over-year point of view, we still expect Auto to be down, just not as much as 20% year-over-year in Q3 and Q4. Scott Graham : So Auto rest of year, flat to slightly up from the first half, but down year-over-year? Patrick Goris : Correct. Scott Graham : Got it. If I could just sort of sneak one last question in here, and it's kind of more to do about what your customers are saying out there. And you've given us great color, and I certainly appreciate that. But I was hoping maybe a little bit more from the customers' standpoint away from the PTC agreement, which I know is working the whole thing. But when you're doing the portion of CapEx of your sales, customers kind of know now where they're going to be by the end of the year. So I was just wondering if you can sort of give us some flakes of what the customers are saying maybe in Heavy Industries. We've talked about Auto maybe in the consumer areas, what the customers specifically are saying, and if possible maybe loop in how orders in those businesses are. Blake Moret : Right. So, we've mentioned before that in process, we continue to see CapEx being released, and it's reflected in some of the projects that we're talking about. We talked previously in Life Sciences, Pfizer. Today we talked a little bit about Lonza in Europe. Green Bay packaging was $0.5 billion CapEx project, in which we're playing a major role here in the U.S. In Automotive, I mentioned that the CapEx that they are releasing has contenders for the uses of that CapEx with some of the electric vehicle, autonomous vehicle development in addition to capacity moves and model changes, and that has resulted in some of the delays of the projects in Auto. Our machinery builders and consumer continue to report healthy backlogs in their business, particularly in food and beverage. I mentioned Life Sciences. And so in general, there remains growth and there remains spending across the broad base of industries, automotive being a bit of the outlier particularly in North America. Scott Graham : That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks a lot, guys. Blake Moret : You\u2019re welcome. Thank you. Steve Etzel : Operator, we\u2019ll take one last question. Operator : Great. Thank you. And your last question here comes from Justin Bergner from G. Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Justin Bergner : Good morning and thank you for taking question. In addition to the Auto guides sort of bringing down your organic full year guide by about 50 basis points, are there any... Patrick Goris : Hello? Justin, you've cut out. Operator : And Justin Bergner, if you can press star 1 again to re-queue. Justin Bergner : Hi. Hopefully, I'm live again. I was asking outside of Auto bringing down your full year organic guide by about 50 basis points. Are there any end markets that look materially better or worse with implicit in your full year outlook versus how they looked a quarter ago? Patrick Goris : Justin, I would say no. There's always some puts and takes that move a little bit, but it's really Auto that was the big mover of all our verticals. Justin Bergner : Okay. And on the segment margin performance the strong increase in the margin in Control Products & Solutions seem to absorb a mix headwind in terms of Solutions growth versus Products growth. Any sort of comment there on how you delivered such a good margin improvement while absorbing that mix headwind? Patrick Goris : Yeah. So there was the modest headwind of mix between Control Products & Solutions. The main driver of the segment margin expansion was strong year-over-year organic sales growth, partially offset by higher spending. Those were really the big movers within that segment. Justin Bergner : Okay. Thank you. Patrick Goris : Thank you, Justin. Steve Etzel : Thank you. I'll turn it over to Blake for a few final comments. Blake Moret : So just to summarize, we delivered 8% adjusted EPS growth driven by top line growth in all regions and in key verticals other than Automotive. Two of our larger strategic investments, PTC and Sensia are progressing well. We are accelerating the execution of our strategy. I'm very encouraged to see employees and partners embrace our new ways to win, expanding value for customers and share owners. Steve Etzel : Okay. That concludes today's call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : And that concludes today's conference call. At this time, you may disconnect. Thank you.",

Later in the call, we will open up the line for questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Jessica Kourakos, Head of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Ms. Kourakos please go ahead. Jessica Kourakos : Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's third quarter fiscal 2019 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Patrick Goris, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that website for replay for the next 30 days. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. So with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks Jessica and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Before I start, I first want to thank Steve Etzel, who has transitioned from Investor Relations back to his Treasury duties full time. He served as well in the IR role for the last few years. I also want to welcome Jessica Kourakos as our new Head of Investor Relations. Jessica brings a wealth of experience from both the sell side and buy side and we\u2019re excited to have her onboard. With that let me start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to page 3 in the slide deck. Globally organic sales were up 0.5% lower than we expected. In general, we saw a strong growth in our longer cycle end markets, while shorter cycle end markets weakened. Organic sales growth was led by heavy industries including oil and gas, pulp and paper, and mining as well as Life Sciences, each of which grew double-digits. In oil and gas we saw a strong growth in all regions as our customers are focusing on productivity, improvements and digitization initiatives. Pulp and paper continued to do well for us with most of the growth this quarter coming from North America. Strong growth in mining was driven by CapEx investments in iron ore and copper, electric vehicle related commodities and investments around digitization. Life Sciences was another stand down vertical for us this quarter. Our offerings align well the industry trends including personalized medicine and cyber security. Offsetting the longer cycle growth in the quarter was weakness in shorter cycle end markets including automotive, semiconductor and food and beverage. Automotive was down about 10% year-over-year and slightly up sequentially versus Q2 in-line with our expectations. Semiconductor in the quarter was weaker than expected impacted by an overall slowdown in the global semiconductor market. Food and beverage was down low single digits, although the industry continues to focus on modernization to drive productivity, we saw some project delays. Logics was down 3% organically largely due to automotive weakness. Process control sales grew 3% organically led by strength and longer cycle end markets. Information solutions and connected services continue to do very well from double-digits in the quarter. This is a measure of the new value being delivered to customers in all industries. This business increases recurring revenue streams and includes FactoryTalk InnovationSuite and MES software as well as high value services such as remote monitoring to enhance cyber security and optimized production. Commenting on regional performance in the quarter, North America was about flat organically. Pulp and paper and oil and gas had strong double-digit growth while automotive, semiconductor and food and beverage declined. EMEA was up 2% in the quarter led by Life Sciences, oil and gas and tire. While Asia declined 1%, China grew low single digits. Latin America sales were up 6% led by mining and oil and gas. I\u2019ll make a few additional comments about our Q3 results. Adjusted EPS was up 11% and segment operating margin expanded a 130 basis points year-over-year. The increases in adjusted EPS and segment operating margin included benefit from lower incentive compensation expense. Patrick will elaborate on our third quarter financial performance in his remarks. Let\u2019s move on now to guidance for full year fiscal 2019. We believe that uncertainty with respect to global trade is impacting some customers\u2019 investment decisions, particularly those related to the timing of capital investments. Taking into account our year-to-date results, we now expect our fiscal 2019 organic sales to be up about 1.5% year-over-year. Including the impact of currency translation, we now expect reported sales to be $6.6 billion. We\u2019re reducing the adjusted EPS guidance range to $8.50 to $8.70 which includes aligning spending for the current market environment. As Patrick will discuss in a few minutes, this guidance does not include the impacts of the Sensia joint venture. Before moving on, I want to mention that yesterday, our Board authorized an additional $1 billion for share repurchases. A strong financial position allows us to deploy capital in-line with our priorities, organic growth and organic investments, dividends and share repurchases. Let\u2019s talk a little more about our organic and in-organic investments. Regardless of what is going on in the macro environment, we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re executing well and we see evidence that we\u2019re gaining share and making the right strategic investments to drive profitable growth. Beginning with our core business, we continue to invest in our logics architecture and connected smart products. These enable us to capture a broader set of opportunities across the discrete, hybrid and process end markets. Customers are telling us that our latest generation logics processor outperforms our biggest competitors. It is also the industry\u2019s first certified secure controller adding a whole new level of security on the plant floor. In high performance motion control utilizing our highly differentiated independent cart technology, we work with [CUCA] to secure our multimillion dollar order in Q3 from a large global automotive manufacturer. In European competitors that lack this capability. We\u2019re also increasing our penetration within process oriented end markets like oil and gas which continues to show strong growth for us and is the largest automation market. We\u2019re going after this market organically by building up our process capabilities both within logics and our FactoryTalk analytics platform as well as inorganically through our Sensia joint venture with Schlumberger. The new value from information solutions and connected services is another way to win across all industries. We\u2019re already seeing this acceleration in markets like Life Sciences where we\u2019ve grown strong double-digits over the last two years and are gaining significant market share. Our differentiation in PharmaSuite, MES, cyber security and FactoryTalk analytics have resulted in many recent deals going our way including a recent win with a very large medical device company against the traditionally strong process competitor where our offering was seen as the best technology to increase overall equipment effectiveness. Our analytics and MES differentiation also drove a key automotive win in Asia where our software will be used on top of a competitive control platform. We won because our solution was more reliable, we had deeper domain expertise and our digital roadmap was better. EMEA and Asia are highly strategic regions for us and we plan to invest both organically and inorganically to strengthen our reach. These and other wins give us confidence that no one is better positioned to benefit from the global convergence of IT and OT than we are and we\u2019re actively directing spending in our operations and to the capital deployment to the areas of highest return to make that happen. We look forward to speaking in greater detail about these initiatives at our upcoming Investor Day in November. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Patrick to provide more detail around our Q3 results and our 2019 sales and earnings guidance. Patrick Goris : Thank you, Blake and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll start on slide 4 which provides our key financial information for the third quarter. As Blake mentioned, sales slowed down in Q3 with reported sales down 2%. Organic growth of 0.5% was weaker than expected and currency translation reduced sales by 2.5%. Segment operating margin was 23.8% expanding a 130 basis points compared to the last year. The increase in segment margin was mainly due to lower incentive compensation expense partially offset by higher investment spending. Our incentive compensation plan reflects our strong paper performance culture and track record. We have a companywide incentive plan that covers most of our employees globally with bonus earned being very aligned with financial performance of the company. To reflect the revised outlook for full year fiscal 2019 financial performance, we lowered our estimates for bonus expense. The total adjustment booked in the third quarter was about $30 million which represents about a 170 basis point to segment margin. About two-thirds of the $30 million is booked in the Control Product and Solutions segment, the balance in the architecture and software segment and general corporate net. Looking at our performance through the first three quarters of the fiscal year, segment operating margin is 22.7% at 80 basis points year-over-year. Earnings conversion ex-currency is 35% and adjusted EPS is up 11%. General corporate net expense in the quarter of $24 million was down $9 million compared to last year mainly as a result of lower functional expenses including lower incentive compensation expense. Adjusted EPS of $2.40 was up 11% compared to the third quarter of last year. The year-over-year increase in adjusted EPS is mainly the result of lower incentive compensation expense, higher organic sales and the lower share count partially offset by higher net interest expense. The lower tax rate also contributed to the increased year-over-year adjusted EPS. Free cash flow performance was $323 million in the quarter or a 114% of adjusted income, a few additional items that are not shown on the slide. With respect to tariffs, the net impact on financial results in the quarter and through three quarters is neutral with the higher cost being mitigated through combination of supply chain actions, negotiations with vendors and targeted price increases on effective products. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were $118.6 million, down $7.2 million or about 6% from last year. We repurchased 1.5 million shares in the quarter at a cost of $246.3 million. Through June 30, we are on pace to get to our $1 billion full-year target for share repurchases. At June 30, we had $333 million remaining under our previous share repurchase authorization. As Blake mentioned, our Board has approved an additional $1 billion share repurchase authorization. Slide 5 provides the sales and margin performance overview for the architecture and software segment. With a 1.9% organic sales decline, this segment had a weaker organic growth performance compared to the company average as it generally is overweighed on shorter cycle end markets and does not include any of our solutions and services business. For the quarter, segment margin decreased 60 basis points to year-over-year and remains about 30%. A margin tailwind from lower incentive compensation is more than offset by the impact of lower sales and higher investment spending. Moving on to slide 6, Control Products and Solutions. This segment had 2.7% organic growth in the quarter. The product businesses in this segment declined about 2.5% year-over-year similar to the architecture and software segment. While the solutions and services businesses in this segment grew about 6% organically. Operating margin for this segment increased 320 basis points compared to Q3 last year primarily due to lower incentive compensation and high organic sales partially offset by higher investment spending. Book-to-build performance for our solutions and services businesses in this segment was 0.98 in Q3, reflecting an increase in project delays. The next slide at 7 provides an overview of our sales performance by region. Blake covered most of this in his remarks. So I'll move on to slide 8, guidance. As Blake mentioned, we are reducing our full-year expected organic sales growth guidance to about 1.5%. This implies a Q4 organic sales decline of about 3% to 3.5%. We now project fiscal 2019 sales of about $6.6 billion. We continue to expect strong segment margin of about 22%. General corporate net expense is expected to be $95 million to $100 million for the full year similar to our April guidance. We believe the full-year adjusted effective tax rate will now be about 18.5%, 0.5 point lower than our April guidance and mainly as a result of favorable discrete tax items and a change in a geographic mix in global pre-tax income. We continue to target $1 billion in share repurchases and we now expect averaged fully diluted shares outstanding to be about 119.3 million for fiscal 2019. We are revising our adjusted EPS guidance range to $8.50 to $8.70. At the midpoint this is a $0.40 decrease compared to our April guidance. Our updated range reflects the impact of lower organic sales growth partially offset by additional spend reductions, lower incentive compensation expense and a somewhat lower tax rate. Compared to fiscal 2018, the full year midpoint represents the 6% adjusted EPS growth on slightly lower reported sales and we continue to expect free cash flow conversion of about 100% of adjusted income. Before I turn it over to Jessica, I'll make some comments about Sensia. We are waiting for some customary regulatory approvals and continue to expect Sensia to close this calendar year. No impact associated with Sensia is included in our current guidance. Assuming the transaction closes this fiscal year and including an associated tax benefit, we now expect the adjusted EPS impact to fiscal 2019 to be about neutral. With that Jessica? Jessica Kourakos : Thanks Patrick. Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible. So please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Operator, let's take our first question. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Your line is open. John Inch : Good morning everybody. Blake Moret : Good morning. John Inch : The down 3% core growth for the fourth quarter, are you guys assuming that this is just a function of projects being further pushed out or are you actually assuming there's embedded deterioration, say in both distribution and projects in terms of the cadence? Blake Moret : So looking at the different industries John, we're expecting that for the full year that automotive overall is going to be down about 10%. We see some sequential improvement as we had seen some purchases beginning in some of the projects that we've been tracking, but we're still looking at about 10% for the full year. I think the stories in Q3 that inform our outlook for Q4 are that in the quarter while automotive performed about as expected, we did see weaker than expected performance in the areas like semiconductor, food and beverage weekend a little bit and then chemicals, power; some of those areas. So those weaker than expected performances in Q3 inform the outlook implied with Q4. John Inch : I think like you had talked about, you'd thought -- there going to be some automotive turnaround projects or model changes coming through in the second half, is that still part of the calendar year, is that still part of the expectation or does that look like in deferred as well? Blake Moret : No, actually purchasing has started on a lot of those projects that we were tracking. The ones that we've been talking about that included some line-of-sight we've seen early purchases there. So we won the ones that we expected to plus a little bit more. It's just not clear whether the majority of the volume from those purchases is going to happen in Q4 around into 2020. John Inch : Just lastly China stepped down a little bit. It's still pretty decent given the overall sort of macro, but is there any color you could give us viz-a-viz end markets in China say heavy industry, infrastructure, auto, consumers and stuff like that? Blake Moret : Sure. We've talked previously about the impact of some of the stimulus in China and we saw it again in Q3. So mass transit, wastewater which would be most impacted by government stimulus, those were strong performers for us in China in the quarter. John Inch : And was anything incrementally weaker that you would call out? Blake Moret : Auto was a little bit weaker in China in the quarter. We had some wins in different areas and we'll talk about that when we talk about our information solutions and connected services, but overall auto in China weakened. John Inch : Got it, thanks for the color. Blake Moret : Thanks John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi good morning. Blake Moret : Good morning. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just give us a little bit of color as to your guiding for organic sales to dip into the September quarter. How does this environment feel today compared with when you've gone into other sales downturns in the past? And you taking much mitigating action on the assumption that this sales decline could last several quarters if it's consistent with history? Blake Moret : Yes Julian, we haven't assumed that this is the beginning of something that's going to last multiple quarters. What we've also seen historically is even during continued periods of expansion, we have seen times where that growth has leveled off for a quarter or two. However, we have taken cost reduction measures and you saw the impact of that in Q3 and we're actively looking at other ways both to match our spend with market conditions as well as take the opportunity to more rapidly reinvest and look at ways to direct resources to the areas that are going to be most important in the future. So we have taken cost reductions. We're looking at areas that would be opportunities going forward and we're watching the development of this quarter Q4 very closely. Julian Mitchell : Thank you very much. And then my quick follow-up would just be around the process business. I think your revenue growth in that slowed to about 3%, you've been running at 10% growth in the March quarter. Should we assume that also dips into negative year-on-year territory in the September quarter? And any color associated with that on the backlog in solutions and services? Blake Moret : Yes. So solutions and services backlog remains slightly up year-over-year and we do continue to see growth in some of the key areas driving process such as oil and gas and mining. Some of the project delays that we saw in Q3 impact process, I would say the project delays that we saw were split between the longer cycle that typically makes up most of those projects, but it was also colored by a fairly significant portion of delays in shorter cycle businesses as well. Julian Mitchell : Fantastic, thank you very much. Blake Moret : Thanks Julian. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Thank you, good morning everyone. Blake Moret : Good morning Joe. Joe Ritchie : Blake, could you maybe just talk about any discernible trends that you saw as the quarter progressed, for example, we've been hearing from a lot of companies that June had turned out to be worse than expected and so anything on the trends that you can tell us about? Blake Moret : Yes. But not that actually for us April and May were weak and June got a little better sequentially. So in the quarter we saw it finish a little bit stronger. Joe Ritchie : Were there any specific end markets that were driving that? Blake Moret : I can't pick any in particular except perhaps chemical may have followed that a bit where it started the quarter out to a weaker and obviously since chemical is kind of sits a bit in the middle in terms of the applications that we play in, we watch that fairly closely and that started to improve a bit as the quarter went on. I would make the other comment that for our quarter it doesn't progress in a linear fashion. So the last month the quarter is always the strongest and so we can't extrapolate the way that a quarter has started out and just run it out and make predictions about the full quarter. Joe Ritchie : And then maybe my follow-on question there is on just looking at the CP&S margins, clearly really strong and you guys called out incentive comp as a big driver. Was there anything else that impacted the margins favorably this quarter and then how should we be thinking, I know that you're stepping down incentive comp as well in 4Q. But what should we be thinking about it like a normalized number I guess from an incentive comp standpoint on the go forward? Patrick Goris : Joe, Patrick here. So with respect to CP&S segment margin, the largest part of the year-over-year increase is related to incentive compensation. The segment of course had some organic growth in the quarter, which helped as well and then currency was just a slight tailwind less than 0.5 point of margin for that segment. In terms of incentive compensation, the way that you can think about it is a fully funded incentive compensation plan for Rockwell Automation is about a $100 million and the current guidance for fiscal 2019 is about 60% of that. Joe Ritchie : Got it, thank you both. Blake Moret : Thanks Joe. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Hi guys good morning. Blake Moret : Good morning Steve. Steve Tusa :  I just wanted to talk about the food and beverage is kind of a broad way to characterize that end market kind of vertical. Does that include some of the packaging machinery types of guys that are out there? Is it like a lot of the machine tool like the bottling guys and that kind of stuff or is it more enterprise business with the crafts set of worlds and things like that. Can you maybe just kind of like break out the food and beverage dynamics a little more? Blake Moret : Sure. So food and beverage includes both. So it certainly includes the global end users. So the crafts and the Mondelez, Nestle that would be an example of a few of those AVI. It also includes the packaging, the machine rebuilder. So, you're looking at the packaging OEMs around the world, that's a fair part of our business in Europe for instance as well as in the U.S. and it includes that part of the business as well. They both worked together and we have a strong focus at both ends of it; what kind of performance we can provide to the machine rebuilders as well as how it works together in an integrated system at the user. Steve Tusa : But I guess, when you talk about the performance this quarter kind of exiting the year. I guess just simply, how is the how the OEM business do, I know you guys kind of characterize the OEM business and within that this kind of packaging food and beverage the vertical where I think you served a lot of these small and medium size machine builder so well. How did that business do? Blake Moret : Yes. So Steve, the way you can think about it, our global OEM business was down about mid-single digits and within that packaging was down high-single digits in the quarter. Steve Tusa : And how fast did that grow in '18? Blake Moret : Probably in mid-single digits because consumer was adopting it this last year. Steve Tusa : Yes, okay, that's great. Blake Moret : That's from me. Steve Tusa : Thanks as always for the color, I appreciate it. Blake Moret : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just two from me, actually. Just thinking about food and beverage also being kind of broadly consumer oriented. I'm wondering if you could speak to anything else that you're seeing in consumer related markets whether those happen to kind of track in line with the segment averages? Blake Moret : Sure. I'll make a couple of comments and then Patrick here might have some more. When we talk about consumer broadly, we think of three areas underneath that typically. So, food and beverage, its home and personal care so I think of tissue and so on and then Life Sciences. Food and beverage and home and personal care performed roughly similarly and I think our outlook is similar. But Life Sciences is really the stand down in terms of strong double-digit growth. Patrick Goris : Yes, so within consumer, Jeff, as Blake mentioned Life Science is good double-digit growth, home and personal care up mid-single digits in the quarter and so it's really food and beverage which represents about 20 points out of the 30 of consumer which is dragging down our performance in consumer. Jeff Sprague : Right, thank you for that. And just on the comp expense, so it sounds like Q3 you have a year-to-date true up, there's another $10 million in Q4. My question would just be then on kind of the investment spend. Those investment spend on a year-over-year basis actually increase or decrease, could you give us a little bit of color on that? Patrick Goris : The way you can think about our investment spending and we exclude incentive compensation for that metric. In our current guidance, our investment spending grows about 2% year-over-year; a little less than that so a little bit more than our revised organic growth rate for the full-year. In Q4, we expect it to be down year-over-year. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Blake Moret : And at the same time, I would say that where we are making adjustments in spending is more on discretionary items, not on the R&D side. For example, in Q3, R&D was full-up 8% year-over-year. Jeff Sprague : Okay, thank you very much. Blake Moret : Thank you. Patrick Goris : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Baird. Your line is open. Richard Eastman : Yes, good morning. Blake, could you just speak for a minute or two to the book-to-bill at .98 that's significantly less than the seasonal book-to-bill would suggest it should be. I presume a lot of that is in heavy industries and I'm curious you referenced project delays impacting the book-to-bill but you line a sight on those projects in other words they weren\u2019t booked in the quarter but you have a healthier view of the line of sight and projects that are out there. Is that how we kind of interpret your comments? Blake Moret : I'd say, we continue to have good visibility to those projects that didn\u2019t close in the quarter. And as we look at the reasons why, the obvious question is this just a precursor to the them getting pushed out further or cancelled or with their unique plausible reasons why they didn\u2019t go in the quarter but they could come back in the near future including some in Q4. And the latter was our based on our review, that was the sense of the majority of those that they were delays but they were unique plausible reasons in each case that cause them to push out in the quarter and not necessarily being gone. I mentioned before that there's a little higher component in those project delays of the shorter cycle businesses. So, think of it this way the percentage of delays of shorter cycle business in that book-to-bill was higher than the total bookings of the solutions in services business. Richard Eastman : So, again you're feeling as we track into the first half of fiscal '20 is that some of this could drop in higher percent short cycle. It doesn't necessarily mean that again your caution, you're cautious but it doesn't necessarily mean that you're planning on a first half of '20, fiscal '20 that is down. Blake Moret : That's right. Richard Eastman : And just -- yes, okay. Blake Moret : And why would it? Richard Eastman : Okay. Blake Moret : And while we don\u2019t wait for November to give the guidance, we're watching Q4, but our front log our quoting activity remains healthy. Richard Eastman : Okay, that's what I was getting in, okay. And just one last one, could you just define or Patrick could you give us kind of a pricing number here, is it just gross priced capture in the quarter? Patrick Goris : We're at about 1.5% price realization, good three quarters and for Q3 about the same. It's about 1.5% which includes, Ric, the price we get associated with the tariffs. And so, you may recall that we implement a targeted price increases on products impacted or effected by the tariffs. Richard Eastman : Yes. Patrick Goris : And so, the price realization this year 1.5% is a little bit larger than prior years but includes the price associated with the tariffs actions. Richard Eastman : And that's not a surcharge, correct, or is it? In other words, will that come off part of it? Patrick Goris : Yes. The intention whether the price increase was to neutralize the impact of tariffs, so not to make money out of that. And so, the expectation is that if tariffs would be eliminated that at some point those price increases would also be adjusted. And the object being to neutralize the impact of tariffs. Richard Eastman : Got you. Okay great, thanks again for the questions. Patrick Goris : Thanks, Ric. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks, good morning. Put a little color as always. I got to say I'm starting to get to the to your 4Q EPS guidance at the low-end the range and the only way I could get that would be is at A&S significantly weaker than the 3% to 4% organic year-over-year you point to for 4Q. Is that how you're thinking that A&S could be down mid-to-high single digits, organic with CP&S probably flat? So, is that sort of how you're building up 4Q? Patrick Goris : Nigel, to get to the low end of our current guidance, that's not an unreasonable way to look at it. Nigel Coe : Okay. So, there actually that'd be accurate. And I think Blake you mentioned so down quarter is not unusual within the context of the upcycle and you said you saw that in FY'16. Are we in that sort of situation where we have several quarter of negative growth cycle through before we get back to growth. So, or do you think that that's something here like snap us back to growth quicker. I appreciate your thoughts there. Blake Moret : Well, as we talked about, the continued uncertainty that we've been mentioning for quite a while, we think it is impacting investment decisions at this point. And so, a reduction of that uncertainty some stability in the outlook would certainly help. In terms of the fourth quarter, it would have to be in short cycle business, right. So, some improvement in longer cycle outlook might impact orders but it would take a while for that to flush on as revenue and profits. In terms of the duration of what we're seeing currently, again we're going to be looking very closely at the development of the quarter, we're going to be looking at the macro progress on trade, would certainly help but we're not counting on that at all. Nigel Coe : And just touching that your that last points. Channel clearance would be a factor that might snap things back quicker. Can you just maybe comment on within A&S how you're selling this all through sales and tracking right now? Blake Moret : State, say again, Nigel, please? Nigel Coe : I'm just curious if you're seeing any I guess make a question a little bit clearer, are you seeing inventory headwinds in your A&S channels? Blake Moret : No. we as you may know we have really good visibility into what our distributors carry of our product, that's particularly the case in North America. Inventory changes have not been a material impact to our results including whether it's A&S or the other segments on the product side. Nigel Coe : Okay. Blake Moret : Yes. We are closely aligned, we're closely involved with our distributors as they replenish inventory and there's nothing different that's being done there. Nigel Coe : Okay gents, thank you very much. Blake Moret : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy from Stephens. Your line is open. Robert McCarthy : Good morning. Can you hear me? Blake Moret : We can. Patrick Goris : We can. Blake Moret : Hi, Rob. How are you doing, is there any --. Robert McCarthy : Yes. I guess the first question is just expanding on some of the questions around fiscal '20 and I know you don\u2019t want to give guidance for fiscal '20 as much as we're going to try. Could you just talk about maybe the compares across auto and some of your other businesses where you might think that you kind of you could get closer to bottom here and how do we think about -- how do we just think about some of as we step into '20, some of the comparisons where you feel better versus more limited visibility : better versus worse? Blake Moret : So, let's start with auto. I mentioned we saw a little bit of sequential growth and importantly the results were stable with our expectations, which what would give us more concerns is if projects that we've been talking about through the year went away. That's not what happened and in fact we're starting to see a little bit of purchases associated with those the EV companies while we continue to see that as a relatively small of our overall business, they're going to bring vehicles to market and they're going to need automation to do it competitively and we continue to be highly engaged there as well as we're traditional vehicles as I look at new models and maybe places to build them. So, we see that continuing and as I mentioned before, the front log is fairly healthy. For other longer cycle businesses where we would have visibility that might go on across multiple quarters; things like oil and gas and mining, there continues to be good activity there and you saw that reflected in our current results. And so, through the fiscal year, we don\u2019t see changes there. The shorter cycle business, of course it's more difficult to look at the outlook and we'll have more details on what our view is informed by the quarter in November. Robert McCarthy : Okay, that's helpful. And I rather light a candle than curse the darkness. So, why don\u2019t we talk about the continued strong double digit growth that information and solution for the connected services. And it looks like PTC last night while having a challenging quarter in the relationship with you actually have a pretty decent quarter. Maybe we could talk about the metrics and key wins there and how you're feeling about that collaboration? Blake Moret : Happy to and glad to see you're lighting a candle, Rob. It's been good and we are probably a little more excited even about the relationship then we started a year ago on this journey. So, we continue to see good wins come in across industries and across geographies. There was a wind and PTC talked about it last night with Euphoria [indiscernible] a big tire company in Korea. We like Euphoria because it's a differentiator. Very few of our competitors have any sort of augmented reality offering and we're selling it in somewhere around a third of our FactoryTalk InnovationSuite wins currently. We continue to see wins in Life Sciences. I talked about the double-digit growth there and the combination of our basic control in Life Sciences. The software that we have had for sometime specifically MES plus the new FactoryTalk analytics that were brought to market, the PTC offerings really puts us in an open field in an industry that continues to grow very strong. So I'm happy with it. We're going to talk, and one last comment, we're going to talk a lot more in November about the comprehensive things that we're doing as an organization to accelerate our move to more recurring revenue streams and more proficiency in managing a growing software component of our overall business. It's certainly not just sales it's about our business model. It's about our IT infrastructure and we're going to talk a lot about that in November. Robert McCarthy : Well, I'll leave it with this, you think you won something would [indiscernible] I don't think they believe in this, the IT of the PLC so I think that's a very notable win for you. Blake Moret : Yes. Thanks Rob. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deepa Raghavan from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Deepa Raghavan : Hi good morning. Blake Moret : Good morning. Deepa Raghavan : Two questions for me. First, can you please update us on your regional growth outlook and just talk about how your views have changed into quarter based on what you're seeing across region? Blake Moret : So, we continue to see Latin America as providing growth in the year. We also see EMEA for the full year of seeing growth in the low single digits. In Q3, North America and Asia were the regions that were a little weaker than we expected. Patrick Goris : Yes the way you can think about it Deepa is, for our current guidance for the full year all regions are a little bit lower than the prior guidance. North America went from mid single digits, a little bit below the company average to low single digits. So did EMEA and Asia and Latin America is still teens, it's still about 10% rather than the mid teens that we were expecting before. So our outlook in every other region has come down a bit. Deepa Raghavan : Got it, thanks for the color. Follow-up from me, Blake you talked about short cycle weakness a few times now. What are some of the conversations you're having with your client in those markets with regards to what the trepidation is or what their recover expectations are and curious if you are surprised based on your discussions, if you're surprised by the duration or magnitude of the current weakness? Thank you. Blake Moret : Sure. I think in some part we're seeing the continued certainty over trade and tariffs that is starting to weigh on investment decisions particularly around capital. We see these customers even short cycle businesses that are continuing to look the ways to improve productivity on top of their basic production and I think that's part of what's contributing to the continued strong growth of information solutions and connected services. But in terms of capital, as these customers weigh the prospects for near-term demand on those shorter cycle products that's what we're seeing and again as we went through and looked project-by-project at the delays, the reasons that are being given are specific and plausible as opposed to some general precursor to further push outs and cancellations. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew [indiscernible] from Citi. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. It's Vladimir Bystricky again for Andrew. Blake Moret : Good morning Vlad. Unidentified Analyst : So, just following up on that last question on delays and your comment that they're specific and plausible drivers of the delays versus not necessarily precursor to more push up to cancellations. I guess what are you hearing from your customers in the context of tariffs and uncertainty that gives you confidence that these are sort of transitory delays versus something that could linger and be more widespread? Blake Moret : I think these companies are doing things similar to what we did and continue to look at coming into the year. They are looking at restacking their supply chains to deal with the information we have in terms of tariffs. And so, there is a movement of where products are being built, who are the sub-suppliers of those various products as people are trying to get to where we are and that is to neutralize the impact of those tariffs on their cost inputs. And so that's a lot of work. These things, the decisions aren't made overnight and so being able to react to the current environment by doing in a way that won't have to be undone in some short-term off time horizon that's the kind of uncertainty that we're talking about that we've dealt with and that our customers are dealing with. Unidentified Analyst : That's helpful. And then, just if I could shift to CP&S for a minute. You talked, I think you said solutions and services within the business was up 6% organic in the quarter. Obviously you guys have had some very good momentum there. So can you remind us one help big that business is within CP&S and also just your visibility to continued mid-single digit growth there? Patrick Goris : The way you can think about Vlad is, within control products and solutions, the solutions and services business is about two-thirds of that segment. Blake Moret : And I think, just to peel it back a little bit further so that includes the longer cycle projects for us, the average duration of some of the oil and gas projects for instance might be five or six months from the time we get the order to the time that we ship it. It also includes the services which would include that say shorter cycle repair operations things that track product businesses, but also importantly the growing connected services portion of that as well that often attends those projects things like remote monitoring, network consultation and things like that. So it's a mix of those defined scope projects as well as high-value services and then also the engineer to order business, so motor control centers and things like that. All of that contributes to that two-thirds number that Patrick gave of the overall CP&S segment. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. I will hop back in queue. Jessica Kourakos : Operator, we will take one more question. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nicole DeBlase : Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Blake Moret : Good morning. Nicole DeBlase : So I just want to dig into 4Q organic a little bit more. So you said that things actually got a little bit better in June sequentially. I guess does July corroborate that 3% to 3.5% organic decline? Could there be some conservatives baked into that? I'm just having a hard time understanding why things get so much worse in the fourth quarter given the 3Q organic trend and the comment that you made about the quarterly progression? Blake Moret : Yes. Nicole I will make a comment and then Patrick might want to add as well. As much as we would like to be able to extrapolate out performance through the quarter that we're reporting on and then take a peek at the first days of the next quarter. We can't apply a linear correlation to that. As I mentioned before, June is the strongest quarter. Typically we were encouraged as we looked at the development of Q3, but we can't draw conclusions that inform our outlook based on that and looking at the early July performance that helps inform the outlook. It's one of the factors that we take into account as we look at Q4, but we just can't draw a straight line with it. Nicole DeBlase : Got it, Blake that's helpful, thanks. And then, just a clarification question on the investment spending. So Patrick, I know you said up a little bit less than 2% for the full year. Just in dollar terms can you clarify I think previously you were saying up 50 million to 55 million for the full year. What does that mean in dollar terms versus the prior guidance that it's on a clear apples-to-apples basis? Patrick Goris : About 35 to 40 now. Nicole DeBlase : Got it, thank you. Patrick Goris : Thanks Nicole. Operator : There are no further questions. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the presenters. Blake Moret : So just to summarize, the quarter saw a sharp difference in performance between shorter cycle business and longer cycle project-oriented business. I'm happy with how the market is embracing the Rockwell offerings that add innovation and new expertise to help our customers be more productive. This is important regardless of the macro environment. We also continue to look for ways to be more productive in our own operations by using all of our strengths and directing resources to the initiatives that best accelerate our strategy. That begins with our highly engaged employees and partners who have committed to their roles in this journey. They bring the connected enterprise to life every day at our customers and in our own operations and I thank them all. Jessica Kourakos : That concludes today's call. Thank you for joining us.",

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jessica Kourakos, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jessica Kourakos : Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal 2019 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Patrick Goris, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that website for replay for the next 30 days. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. So with that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I\u2019ll start with some key points for the quarter. So please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck. Organic growth of 1.4% was better than expected, with growth seen across a broad range of industries and across all of our core platforms despite a challenging macro environment. Going a little deeper into our vertical sales performance, oil and gas and mining each had another strong double-digit growth quarter. Life sciences continued to show solid momentum with sales growing mid-single digits and very strong bookings. Our offerings in cybersecurity, modular control and PharmaSuite MES, coupled with FactoryTalk InnovationSuite are extremely well positioned and aligned with industry trends. Food and beverage was slightly up, led by strength in EMEA that was partially offset by other regions. Automotive grew mid-single digits with growth in all regions except Latin America and with some important competitive conversions. In the quarter, we also saw increasing activity within electric vehicles, including a strategic win in North America that we look forward to talking more about at our Investor Day on November 20. Semiconductor, which is about 5% of our sales, was down over 10%, but flat sequentially. Our Logix business grew 3% even against a tough comparison last year where it grew 7%. Logix growth was broad-based across most regions and end markets. Adjusted EPS was $2.1, including a $0.14 impact from a restructuring charge and a $0.04 impact from Sensia setup costs in the quarter that were not included in our July guidance. Finally, free cash flow was very strong. Turning to Slide 4, and our regional sales performance in the quarter, North America declined 1%. Continued strength in oil and gas and mining was offset primarily by softness in semiconductor and power generation. Auto improved sequentially and was up year-over-year. EMEA sales were up 4% versus prior year, with strong growth in life sciences, food and beverage and mining. Asia was flat and China sales were down 4% versus last year. China weakness in semiconductor, metals and automotive was partially offset by continued strength in infrastructure spend. Latin America was up 17% in the quarter, a great finish to a strong year. Most countries in this region, including Mexico, contributed to growth, very strong oil and gas and life sciences sales performance more than offset weakness in automotive in this region. Now moving to the full year, let\u2019s turn back to Slide 3. While fiscal 2019 was marked by uncertainty related to trade, it was a year of progress for Rockwell, with strong operating performance and strategic investments, setting the stage for our continued success. Here are some highlights of our financial performance. Our diverse industry exposure enabled us to deliver 2.8% organic growth even with automotive and semiconductor down over 10%. Segment operating margins of 22% expanded 40 basis points and adjusted EPS was up 7% year-over-year. We had another good year of 100% free cash flow conversion and we deployed $1.5 billion to dividends and share repurchases. We also continued to make solid progress in our long-term growth initiatives. These include share gains in our core platforms, faster growth in process, double-digit growth in Information Solutions and Connected Services and growth in EMEA and Asia. For example, we saw core platform growth with strong contribution from products like PowerFlex drives and Stratix network switches. This makes sense when you consider that industrial companies can\u2019t transform their operations without data from smart secure devices. This is also Rockwell\u2019s home field advantage. We saw double-digit growth in process industries like oil and gas, mining and pulp and paper. Recurring revenue streams grew double digits with increases in project size and enterprise rollouts of our Information Solutions and Connected Services contributing approximately one percentage point to organic growth for the year. We capped off the first year of our alliance with PTC by delivering a very strong sequential increase in new deals in Q4. And for the full year, our alliance enabled strategic wins around the world across a broad range of vertical markets. Importantly, many of these wins were on top of competitive control platforms. Finally, we grew faster outside the U.S. Patrick will elaborate further on our fourth quarter and full year financial performance in his remarks. Let\u2019s move on now to the macro environment and our outlook for full year fiscal 2020. Our outlook balances geopolitical uncertainty with confidence in our differentiated portfolio and ability to gain share. Global trade tensions continue to create uncertainty and industrial production is decelerating heading into fiscal 2020, which we expect will have some negative impact on customer CapEx. However, we are excited about new product introductions across our portfolio. Also, given our pipeline of projects for our customers\u2019 digital transformation plans, which are often funded kind of OpEx budgets and not CapEx. We believe we will have another good year in Information Solutions and Connected Services. Taking all this into account, we\u2019re expecting flat organic sales at the midpoint of our fiscal 2020 guidance. We expect our reported sales to be up approximately 3.5% year-over-year at the midpoint of guidance. This includes approximately 4 points of inorganic growth coming from our investments in Sensia and MESTECH, partially offset by currency. Turning now to earnings, as you\u2019ve seen in our fourth quarter results, we took restructuring actions to help drive $40 million in [Audio Dip] allow us to both reinvest in our highest growth initiatives and help deliver earnings growth in this environment. Including the impact of acquisitions and currency, our guidance for sales is about $7 billion. Our adjusted EPS guidance range is $8.70 to $9.10 with the midpoint of $8.90. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Patrick to provide more detail around our Q4 and full year results and our fiscal 2020 sales and earnings guidance. Patrick Goris : Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll start on Slide 5, which provides our key financial information for the fourth quarter. As Blake mentioned, fourth quarter reported sales were flat. Organic growth of 1.4% was better than expected, largely benefiting from better performance in automotive and food and beverage. Currency translation reduced sales by 1.5 points. Our fourth quarter results include a $20 million restructuring charge, as well as $6 million of Sensia setup costs, neither of which were included in our July guidance. The restructuring charge is split about evenly between both segments, with about 25% in cost of goods sold and the remainder in SG&A. We are reinvesting the majority of the $40 million savings associated with the restructuring charges towards our highest priorities, including commercial resources and increased software development. We continuously look for ways to streamline processes and drive internal simplification and productivity, enabling us to increase investments to fund profitable growth. Segment operating margin was 20.2%, down 60 basis points compared to last year primarily due to the restructuring and Sensia setup costs that I referred to. General corporate net expense of $36 million was up $18 million compared to last year. As you may recall, we had a large favorable insurance settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Adjusted EPS of $2.1 was down about 4% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding the restructuring charge and Sensia setup costs, adjusted EPS was up about 4% compared to last year. As Blake mentioned, we have very good free cash flow performance in the quarter, $451 million or over 190% of adjusted income. Reduced working capital contributed $150 million in the quarter. A few additional items that are not shown on the slide; average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were $117 million, down $6.5 million from last year. We repurchased 1.4 million shares in the quarter at a cost of $224.9 million. For full year fiscal 2019, repurchases totaled $1 billion. At September 30, we had about 1.1 billion remaining under existing share repurchase authorizations. Slide 6 provides key financial information for full year 2019. After a good start to the fiscal year, our rates of organic growth slowed in the second half as a result of the weakening macro environment, particularly for industrial companies. Organic growth for the year was 2.8%. Blake covered most of what is on the slide, so I\u2019ll just provide a few additional comments. Growth in segment margin and adjusted EPS was mainly due to higher organic sales. The full year adjusted effective tax rate of 17.9% reflects the full year benefits of U.S. Tax Reform passed during our fiscal 2018. We had another year of 100% or more free cash flow conversion and return on invested capital remained above our target of 20%. The year-over-year reduction in return on invested capital reflects the mark-to-market adjustment of our investments in PTC. Turning to tariffs, I\u2019d like to recognize the great work done by many of our colleagues. We neutralized the impact through supply chain actions, including negotiations with vendors and targeted price increases on affected products. Slide 7 provides a sales and margin performance overview of our two operating segments. Architecture & Software organic sales were up 2.3% in the quarter. Segment margin of 26.2% was down 190 basis points compared to the same period last year mainly due to restructuring charges and lower volume leverage affecting the segment. Control Products & Solutions organic growth was 0.7%. Our product businesses in this segment were about flat year-over-year and our solutions and services businesses were up about 1%. Segment operating margin expanded 40 basis points mainly as a result of good margins in our solutions business. The restructuring charge was about 1 point headwind to segment margin. The book-to-bill performance in our solutions and services businesses in the quarter was 0.93% and our backlog for solutions and services was up about 1% compared to last year. This takes us to Slide 8 guidance. As Blake mentioned, we\u2019re expecting sales of about $7 billion in fiscal 2020. We expect organic sales growth to be in the range of minus 1.5% to plus 1.5% and flat at the midpoint of our range. The Sensia and MESTECH inorganic investments, both of which closed in early October are expected to contribute approximately 4 points of revenue growth. And we expect the headwinds from currency of about 50 basis points consistent with currency rate forecast for the next 12 months. We expect segment operating margin to be approximately 21.5%. Excluding the impact of Sensia, we expect segment margin to be about flat year-over-year. We believe the full year adjusted effective tax rate will be about 16% which includes 200 basis points discrete tax benefit from Sensia. Our underlying adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be about 18%, the same as fiscal 2019. Our adjusted EPS guidance range is $8.70 to $9.10, and the midpoint \u2013 at the midpoint, this represents about 3% of adjusted EPS growth on about 3.5% higher reported sales. A few additional items about fiscal 2020; general corporate net is expected to be about $100 million. Net interest expense is also expected to be about $100 million. We\u2019re dialing in about 400 million of share repurchases and assume average diluted shares outstanding of about 116 million shares. We will share more details with you on our capital deployment and capital structure plans at our Investor Day next week. And finally, we expect full year 2020 free cash flow conversion of about 100% of adjusted income. This includes $100 million of capital expenditures. From a calendarization point of view, we expect first half revenue to be down low single digits compared to fiscal 2019, followed by a stronger second half, mainly due to easing comps. The next Slide 9, provides an adjusted EPS walk from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020 guidance midpoint. Going from left to right, core performance contributes about $0.20. We benefit from the savings generated from the fiscal 2019 restructuring charge, about $15 million of the $40 million savings is dropping through the bottom line. Fiscal 2020 also benefits from the absence of the fiscal 2019 restructuring charge and incentive compensation at the midpoint of our fiscal 2020 guidance is a bit lower than the prior year. We expect Sensia to contribute about $0.05 of adjusted EPS. Within that, the benefit of the discrete tax item I referred to earlier and incremental earnings are partially offset by nonrecurring setup costs and transaction fees as well as intangibles and non-controlling interest adjustments. Sensia is expected to have an EBITDA margin profile of about 20%. It will be closer to low teens in fiscal 2020, given nonrecurring setup costs. Net interest expense, operating pension expense and currency are all expected to be headwinds. Net interest expense is expected to be higher as a result of the capital deployment activities in fiscal 2019 and those planned for fiscal 2020. The lower interest rate environment is increasing our operating pension expense and currency forecast project a stronger U.S. dollar. Finally, a lower share count is expected to contribute about $0.25 to adjusted EPS. In summary, the net impact of Sensia is about neutral year-over-year, and we are offsetting pension and currency headwinds with productivity and the benefits of our lower share count to deliver adjusted EPS growth. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you, Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks, Patrick. Before we move to Q&A, I want to make some additional remarks. In fiscal 2019, we executed well and made good progress on our long-term initiatives. Looking to fiscal 2020, we have another exciting year ahead of us. We will continue to provide new value with the Connected enterprise, which gives us more ways to win. As a pure play, our entire focus is on helping industrial companies and their people be more productive and sustainable. We have no competing priorities. And our relentless focus allows us to grow revenue and efficiently deploy our resources to deliver high margins and increased earnings. Our strategy also generates strong, sustainable cash flow that we will continue to direct to value-creating opportunities. An example is Sensia, our joint venture with Schlumberger. Sensia officially opened for business on October 1 and is off to a great start. This joint venture is positioned to be the most innovative provider of process automation, measurement and IoT solutions to the oil and gas industry, and we are very excited by initial customer reception. In its first month of operation, we have already secured several large project wins from around the world, as oil and gas customers look to drive additional operating efficiency. In addition, we announced the acquisition of MESTECH last month, which augments our delivery capabilities for Information Solutions and Connected Services implementations, particularly in the automotive and life sciences industries. As we look ahead, our acquisition pipeline continues to be very robust. Our key areas of focus for inorganic investments remain Information Solutions and Connected Services, Process Expertise and Market Access in EMEA and Asia. While the size, amount and timing of deals can never be predicted with certainty, we continue to target a point or more of annual growth from acquisitions. In fiscal 2020, we will exceed that goal. Turning now to Slides 10 and 11. We are making some changes to the way we segment our served industries. Going forward, we will be focusing our commentary on our performance in discrete, hybrid and process industries, and we\u2019ll continue to provide color on individual end markets like food and beverage and automotive. Slide 12 provides the end market growth assumptions that align to the midpoint of our fiscal 2020 organic revenue guidance. This industry segmentation more effectively reflects our performance and progress we are making in executing our strategy. For those of you coming to our Investor Day next week, I look forward to seeing you there. As usual, we will hold Investor Day at Automation Fair, our main customer event, which is in Chicago this year. Customers from around the world will see how we are bringing the Connected Enterprise to life. We will showcase our innovation and that of our partners in what will be an especially important event. We are on track for this to be our biggest and most exciting automation fair yet. Finally, I\u2019d like to thank each of our employees and partners for their efforts to bring the Connected Enterprise to life within Rockwell and at our customers. I\u2019m especially grateful for the way our employees are embracing change in demonstrating our company\u2019s values every day. We are truly converging IT and OT and have added new talent at all levels of the organization who are contributing to the innovation we\u2019ll be featuring at Automation Fair. With that, let\u2019s turn the call over to Jessica to begin Q&A. Jessica? Jessica Kourakos : Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible. So please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow up. Thank you. Marcela, let\u2019s take our first question. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Melius Research. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Hi. Good morning, Blake, Patrick and Jessica. Blake Moret : Good morning. Patrick Goris : Good morning. Jessica Kourakos : Good morning. Scott Davis : Thanks for the update in the new segmentation. It seems to make a lot of sense, too. But I just want to talk a little bit about China. I mean China has been a pretty volatile market. I think some of your competitors have seen results meaningfully worse than yours, and so you\u2019re doing reasonably well. But what\u2019s the visibility that you think you have into 2020? I mean just some of these infrastructure projects fall off and then they need to be replaced by other things more substantive? Or are there other infrastructure projects that come in right after them? And maybe just give us a little bit of color on China. Blake Moret : Yes. So Scott, from a broad sense, I mean China is obviously the world\u2019s largest manufacturing economy, and we have low share in China. And so we are relatively less impacted by the ups and downs of their volatility on the surface because there\u2019s so much more that we can pick up. We serve a broad range of the industries, and there\u2019s a lot of infrastructure to be built in China. So we expect that to continue. But also importantly, a lot of the spend in China is on the Information Solutions and Connected Services, drawing insights from the basic automation. And that\u2019s relatively less impacted by CapEx spending. That\u2019s more operational spending, and we expect to continue to grow there. So the long-term trends are still positive in China. Scott Davis : Okay. And you guys didn\u2019t mention anything about the GM Strike in your comments. Was there any negative impact this quarter? Or should we build in for the first quarter of 2020? Blake Moret : Scott, there was a little bit of a delay in MRO spend from GM, but not a lot, and we expect that to recover. Scott Davis : Okay. Very good. Thank you. See you guys next week. Blake Moret : Exactly, Scott. See you then. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Your line is open. John Inch : Good morning, everybody. Blake Moret : Hey, John. Patrick Goris : Good morning. John Inch : Hi, guys. Blake, in the guide \u2013 Blake and Patrick, in the guide process, you\u2019re expecting to sort of soften to flat. How would that translate into sequential trends? And maybe you could sort of give us a sense of what\u2019s happening kind of regionally in process? And I make the comments and the context, but Honeywell and Emerson, they had pretty good results actually in process, pretty good project activity in Asia Pac and so forth. What are you guys seeing? Blake Moret : Well, I\u2019ll make a couple of comments and then Patrick will add to that. In North America, we continue to see strength in oil and gas, mining and pulp and paper. We do see some moderation in the coming year. I should point out that when we talk about oil and gas, that\u2019s excluding Sensia, which we expect as we\u2019ve talked about before, to grow double digits, which is a smaller part of the overall oil and gas market focused primarily at the digital oilfield, which we think will continue to grow double digits, and we obviously expect to grow faster than the market. In terms of the sequential performance, I\u2019ll ask Patrick to make some comments there. Patrick Goris : Yes. We don\u2019t expect big swings by quarter, John, from a process point of view. And within process \u2013 John Inch : Relatively stable. Patrick Goris : Say again. John Inch : I\u2019d say relatively stable in, Patrick. Is that how you\u2019re thinking about it? Patrick Goris : That\u2019s what we believe, yes. John Inch : Okay. I\u2019m sorry, you were saying something? Patrick Goris : No. John Inch : Okay. And then just out of that in that sort of \u2013 it\u2019s part of this discussion. Oil and gas, how are you guys actually putting up such strong results? Do you think in oil and gas \u2013 especially on the land side, I mean peers, depending on sort of their activity interactions with oil and gas, we\u2019re seeing insignificant pressures there, but you guys are not seeing that. Is it specific program share wins? What do you think is going on here? Blake Moret : Yes, we do think, and particularly with Sensia, we think that there\u2019s big opportunity to continue to gain share. Remember, a lot of our participation is with more exposure to OpEx. So our exposure is not as much in drilling new wells as in getting efficiency from the wells once they\u2019ve started producing, and so they\u2019re not going to be as affected by volatile CapEx spend. And then, again, with Sensia, we think we have an opportunity to meaningfully accelerate our gains in oil and gas, particularly onshore upstream. John Inch : Just last, Blake. How would you characterize your level of conservatism in this guide? I think it caught a number of us \u2013 I mean to your credit off guard based on how sort of strong it is. If you go back a year ago, right, you were guiding for a midpoint of 905 and you did 867. So maybe you could \u2013 people sort of view Rockwell as a conservative company, particularly your guidance. You missed your guidance last year. How do you sort of put in a context to conservatism? And what makes you sort of comfortable that this range isn\u2019t also going to potentially be a repeat of fiscal 2019? Blake Moret : Yes. I mean, John, I think, fundamentally, Rockwell Automation remains a conservative company. But there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty out there, and we\u2019re balancing that with what we know within our own four walls we\u2019re producing and what we\u2019re hearing from customers around the world in terms of their plans and the ability that we have to participate there. So we think that the flat organic growth is an appropriate balance between those two broad opposing forces. John Inch : Got it. Thanks very much. We\u2019ll you see in a week. Blake Moret : See you soon, John. Operator : Your Next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Blake Moret : Hey, Jeff. Patrick Goris : Good morning. Jeff Sprague : Good morning. Just a couple for me, please. First, just kind of level set on kind of the exit rate here on 2019. Did the dial back in investment spend and compensation in the fourth quarter occur as you should suggested and kind of what is the exit rate on those items? Patrick Goris : Yes. So Jeff, from a spend point of view, we ended the year where we expect it to be a little less than \u2013 up a little less than 2% year-over-year. The fourth quarter was down a little compared to last year, again, as expected. From an incentive comp point of view, compared to what we shared with you in July, incentive comp expense was higher in fiscal 2019, given that we outperformed our expectations. And so the expense in fiscal 2019 was closer to $75 million compared to the $60 million that I shared with you in July. Jeff Sprague : Okay. And then you\u2019re suggesting from that $75 million, you are stepping down modestly in 2020. Patrick Goris : Yes, at the midpoint, about $10 million, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Okay. And just looking at Latin America a little bit more closely, obviously, an extraordinarily strong quarter. How do you see that playing out over the balance of the year? Was there anything in particular unusual in the quarter there? Patrick Goris : Actually, Latin America was strong in some of the consumer verticals, but particularly, oil and gas was very strong. Mining, pulp and paper, water \u2013 wastewater, all up double digits in the quarter. We do expect some of that to moderate in fiscal 2020. You may recall, Jeff, we also had a large Codelco mining project in Latin America. So we\u2019ll have some tough comps next year. And so for next year, we expect that growth in Latin America to moderate a bit. Blake Moret : I would also say that earlier in the year, we saw continued growth from Brazil, and that continued to have positive growth through the year. But Mexico picked up partway through the year, and we saw a strong contribution as we exited from Mexico, which has good exposure to a broad range of the industries that we serve. It\u2019s obviously oil and gas, but it\u2019s Food and Beverage, Automotive really across-the-board. Jeff Sprague : And just one last one to clarify. The first half, down low single digit, that\u2019s an organic number or a reported number? Patrick Goris : That\u2019s organic, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : All right. Thank you. Patrick Goris : Thank you. Blake Moret : Thank you. See you soon. Jeff Sprague : See you next week. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Blake Moret : Good morning. Patrick Goris : Good morning. Julian Mitchell : Maybe \u2013 good morning. Just wanted to circle back on this notion of perhaps conservatism in the revenue guide and how you\u2019re thinking about that sales guide because, I guess, three months ago, you\u2019ve guided organic sales to be down low to mid-single digit in Q4, you just printed slight growth. Now you\u2019re guiding for the first fiscal half to be down low single digits. So just trying to think, versus three months ago, do you genuinely feel worse about the macro environment? Do you view the Q4 performance is just a bit of a blip because of some movements in the Automotive sector? Maybe just try and characterize why you\u2019re guiding for a decline now, if it\u2019s just because of low visibility or there\u2019s genuinely something you\u2019ve seen that deteriorated in the last month or two. Blake Moret : I think there\u2019s \u2013 as we talked about before, there\u2019s a balance between what is undeniably continued uncertainty. We continue to see decelerating macro indicators, industrial production and so on. But then on the other side, we\u2019re very optimistic about our ability to gain share regardless of what those numbers are. But we\u2019re informed by, to some extent, what we saw in the fourth quarter, but also what we\u2019re expecting the year ahead to show. Backlog, a little bit up, but not a tremendous amount, and we think it\u2019s a balanced outlook on fiscal 2020. Patrick Goris : Julian, I would just add that we\u2019ve had one quarter of better-than-expected sales performance in Q4 after two quarters where we had weaker performance than we expected, and the macro indicators that we track PMI and IP are still weakening. And so we think that we\u2019re balancing all of these things out. Blake Moret : I\u2019d also say that we\u2019re happy with the ability to have inorganic growth contributing to the year. It fits very well with our strategy, and it\u2019s a meaningful contribution to our reported growth in the coming year. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s helpful and thanks also for the color in the slides. My second question would be on the segment margin guidance. So I think it\u2019s guided to be flat ex Sensia in 2020 for the year as a whole on the segment margin line. That\u2019s despite flattish sales not down, lower restructuring costs and net restructuring savings of $15 million coming in. So maybe just beyond incentive comp, talk about any other moving parts in that margin bridge. For example, it looks as if you\u2019re dialing in a mix headwind perhaps because discrete is losing as a share of the total pie. Is that a fair summary? Or is there something else moving around in the margins in 2020? Patrick Goris : I think the way you can think about it is, on the margin side, there is no organic growth, but there is some pricing that\u2019s being realized. So there is some uptick there. As you mentioned, mix is somewhat of a headwind next year. Then the restructuring and then bonus expense clearly is a little bit of a tailwind. But our spend next year, our overall spend increase is not flat. Actually, we\u2019re investing some next year and so our spend is up low single digits. A couple of points next year, a little bit less than that. And so the net of that is flat margins. So tailwind from price, headwind from, as I mentioned, some of the reinvestments that we\u2019re doing in mix. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Hey, guys. Good morning. Blake Moret : Good morning. Steve Tusa : So given the kind of better-than-expected performance in the quarter, I totally acknowledge that your business is \u2013 the majority of it \u2013 vast majority is short-cycle in nature. How much kind of came towards the end of the quarter? And then to the extent you have a backlog or a front log, how much was like more of the kind of the quickest turn short cycle, if you will? Patrick Goris : Yes. Steve, Patrick here. Actually, we \u2013 the sales improved through the quarter. September was our strongest month, but that is not unusual for September. Steve Tusa : Right. Patrick Goris : And so I\u2019d say, improvement through the month, and as always, particularly September, tends to be the strongest month of the quarter. Steve Tusa : So you were already kind of \u2013 you saw the trends through August and you were already kind of at the high end or above kind of the range at that stage of the game? Patrick Goris : No. September was the strong month. Steve Tusa : Okay. Were there any targeted pricing measures with regards to any of the business projects, et cetera, where you pushed a little harder to get the install on a price basis in the quarter? Patrick Goris : No, I wouldn\u2019t say that, Steve, at all. Our annual price increase went into effect in August as we ever see a little bump in volume due to price like pre-buys that nothing unusual there at all. And we don\u2019t \u2013 rough price to get volume. Steve Tusa : Got it. What is your price expectation for 2020 now? What kind of \u2013 what\u2019s embedded? Blake Moret : About 1 point, Steve. Last year, we did a little bit less than 2 points, including the impact of pricing associated with the tariffs. And so for fiscal 2020, we\u2019re targeting a little less than 1 point, about 1 point. Steve Tusa : Got it. Great. All right. Thanks, I appreciate the colors always. Thank you. Patrick Goris : Thank you. Blake Moret : See you soon. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Baird. Your line is open. Richard Eastman : Yes. Good morning. Patrick, could you just speak to the 4 points of inorganic growth that you forecast for 2020? Could you split that between Sensia and MESTECH, a little bit is about $275 million of revenue. And is there any seasonality to think about with Sensia? Patrick Goris : The way you can think about it is the vast majority of that 4 points, meaning more than \u2013 well more than 3 points comes from Sensia closer to 3.5 points or more, so most of that comes all from Sensia. And then in seasonality, I would probably say a little bit more second half weighted than first half weighted, also because we\u2019re expecting to deliver revenue synergies as a result of the joint venture. So obviously, starting October 1, we\u2019re recording all the sales, but we expect sales to accelerate in Sensia, given the synergies that we expect of the combined offering. Richard Eastman : And that\u2019s captured in the 3 \u2013 call it 3.5 points. That\u2019s captured in there, the synergies? Patrick Goris : Absolutely. Richard Eastman : And then\u2026 Patrick Goris : Yes. I don\u2019t think \u2013 on a go-forward basis, I don\u2019t expect meaningful calendarization of the results of either of those investments. Richard Eastman : Okay. And then, Blake, could you just spend a second just around the dynamics. I think when you mentioned the PTC kind of wins, the dynamic there that \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you said them, majority or many coming on competitor platforms. Just kind of mention the sales strategy around that and if that is going to provide some leverage here down the road onto the hardware side of your business. Blake Moret : Well, yes, happy to. So for many years, our fundamental play was providing an integrated control architecture to our customers. So typically, our Logix control was at the heart of that, and we would have operator interface, smart products like drives and servers and so on that will connect easier than anybody else in that architecture. On top of that, we now have greater capacity than we ever had to add information processing software that allows you to take the data from that control and to turn it into insights to drive additional productivity. And it works great when it\u2019s sitting on top of a Rockwell control architecture, but it doesn\u2019t have to. It takes data very well from our competitors as well. And what we\u2019re finding, really to our delight, is that almost half of the sales are putting that software on top of someone else\u2019s control system. And so it allows us to go into a brownfield, they\u2019re not ready to change out their controllers yet, but it gives us a reason for being there and to add value into their operation. So it gives us more ways to win more customers that have a reason for being in their facility, talking about their business problems. Richard Eastman : Got it. Great. Thank you. Blake Moret : Thanks, Rich. Operator : Your Next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Blake Moret : Hey, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Just want to kind of step back a little bit, Blake, if you don\u2019t mind. I think looking back over the last couple of years, there are points in time when I think people would have said, gosh, old Rockwell, if you want to call it that, might have grown a little faster. And now with this quarter, I think people would have assumed probably a little bit more cyclicality than what you guys put up. So is the case that because of some of these information services pushes and maybe some less cyclical end markets like Food and Beverage, which is obviously your largest end market, is it that the cyclicality is coming down? Or do you think that kind of cycle-to-cycle growth accelerates? Because I guess they are two different elements. I guess what\u2019s the objective there? Patrick Goris : We\u2019re going after both, Josh. And as we\u2019ve talked before and we\u2019ll talk more next week in detail, the ways that we\u2019re increasing our resilience to volatility involves the things that you\u2019ve mentioned. It\u2019s more recurring revenue in the form of subscriptions and as a service business models from Information Solutions and Connected Services. So we get a double benefit there. It\u2019s growing double digits, but there\u2019s also a very high component of that that\u2019s recurring in nature. We\u2019re also decreasing our volatility by greater exposure to process industries, which are typically later cycle than on traditional discrete areas. And then life cycle services being able to provide ongoing services after commissioning the initial projects, and we\u2019re doing that with more urgency than I\u2019d say ever before. And then finally, some of the inorganic investments, as we talked about, in a period of low or no organic growth, it\u2019s nice to have 4 points or more from the inorganic growth. So it\u2019s going to address both. It\u2019s early. We got a lot of work yet to do, but I\u2019m very happy with the results so far. Josh Pokrzywinski : Understood. And then just a follow-up question around Sensia, obviously, that $0.05 in guidance has a lot of moving pieces. If you wouldn\u2019t mind just kind of snapping the line if we were one year forward and all the noise comes out, whether it\u2019s tax or some of the kind of onetime costs, what would that $0.05 look like? Patrick Goris : Okay. Josh, Patrick here. The $0.05, if I look at what\u2019s in there, they\u2019re about $0.05 of fees and setup costs that are in there. And so we would expect that to go away. And the way we\u2019re thinking about it internally is that Sensia is expected to be a 20% EBITDA business. This year overall adjusted EPS impact about neutral. We expect that to start to contribute to adjusted EPS next year. From a free cash flow point of view, it\u2019s contributing to us in fiscal 2020. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. But there\u2019s also, call it, $0.20 of tax in there as well, right? So $0.05 higher for the fees and\u2026 Patrick Goris : The way you can think about the tax, the $0.20 is the overall tax impact. The tax impact to Rockwell Automation shareowners is only 53% of that. So within the $0.05, it\u2019s only $0.11 of tax. You have to adjust out the part that does not go through Rockwell Automation shareowners. And maybe this is an opportunity to provide a little bit more color on the $0.05 of Sensia on the bridge. Within that are obviously incremental earnings associated with Sensia, adjusted for the part of the earnings that no longer go through Rockwell Automation shareowners. So the incremental earnings are a little bit over $0.05, say, between $0.05 and $0.10. We just talked about the tax benefit, that\u2019s about $0.11 benefit in fiscal 2020, but offsetting that are intangibles of about $0.10 and then the fees and setup costs that are about $0.05, as I mentioned. So those are the different moving pieces there. In essence, that tax benefit is offset by intangibles. They\u2019re basically the same. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That\u2019s helpful colors. Thanks for that. See you all next week. Blake Moret : Thank you, Josh. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Your line is open. David Ridley-Lane: Good morning. This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew. What gives you confidence that automotive will be flattish in 2020? And how important are electric vehicles within your automotive trends? Blake Moret : Yes. So we saw \u2013 starting with Q4, we saw some recovery in MRO. We also saw continued spend from some of the projects that we\u2019ve been talking about in internal combustion vehicles where we have line of sight to those projects, and that was a meaningful part of our performance in Q4. But a really bright part of the picture is the continuing importance of electric vehicle drivetrains. And for instance, in Asia, we had some good project activity at OEMs in electric vehicle powertrain, and we expect that to be a larger and larger part of our overall powertrain business going forward as a lot of manufacturers are going straight from internal combustion engines to full EV. It doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s going to be as much demand as maybe was first thought for hybrid. People are going to total EV. And we\u2019re very well positioned to play in that because it\u2019s less subtractive manufacturing processes, REIT, C&C and metal cutting. It\u2019s a really good fit for our current portfolio, and we\u2019re winning some important competitive business there, and it\u2019s growing fast. It grew strongly in the fourth quarter, and we expect it to continue to grow next year. David Ridley-Lane: And then just following up on a comment that you had around digital transformation project. I know that a lot of your clients have set up offices and dedicated staff to those. Roughly what portion would you say your sales are driven by OpEx budgets today versus CapEx? Patrick Goris : Yes, we\u2019ve estimated it. We think about 65% of our sales are mostly driven by CapEx to balance OpEx. And you can think about some of the Information Solutions and Connected Services, some of these sales, we think, will come more out of OpEx budgets than CapEx budgets. Blake Moret : That\u2019s right. A lot of times, the digital transformation that our customers are going through are on top of existing capital-intensive assets in the field. So the lines are out there, they\u2019ve already got the basic automation in place that came with the original equipment, but now they\u2019re looking to drive additional productivity out of those existing assets. And it can be meaningful double-digit increases and OEE and other metrics of productivity by adding this software to be able to analyze what\u2019s going on, on the line. But often, those expenditures can be made out of OpEx and not CapEx. David Ridley-Lane: Thank you very much. Blake Moret : Thank you. Patrick Goris : Thanks, David. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy from Stephens. Your line is open. Robert McCarthy : Can you hear me? Blake Moret : We can, Rob. Good morning. Robert McCarthy : Good morning. Two questions. One that is a little different is can you talk about geography where you\u2019re gaining share because it\u2019s clear from the growth rates we\u2019re seeing abroad that you\u2019re gaining share? And talk about the key verticals where you\u2019re doing that. Blake Moret : We think, Rob, for a long time, hybrid has been a great place for us. It\u2019s where a lot of manufacturers are going. And so when you think about the trend towards smaller, but continuous process lines in Life Sciences where the control is tightly integrated with the software, that\u2019s an area that we continue to have double-digit performance in because it\u2019s just such a great fit for what we\u2019re doing. In powertrain for electric vehicles, that is another area that I just mentioned that we have a very high readiness to serve. And I\u2019ll tell you that there\u2019s some opportunities around the world where we think that we\u2019re gaining share in some of the installed base that might be a little bit older from competitive systems. So GE, for instance, is an area where we\u2019ve had some nice wins in converting out some of that installed base. Robert McCarthy : And could you just comment on the share repurchase in the quarter and the average share price that you already have? And just any hints about 2020, aside from the $400 million in share repurchase kind of the state of play on the balance sheet? Patrick Goris : Yes. Robert, Patrick here. The share repurchase were pretty much the same each quarter of fiscal 2020. I don\u2019t have the average price we paid in the fourth quarter here handy. I think it\u2019s going to come out later today, you\u2019ll see that in the K. In terms of repurchase for next year, again, the $400 million, we expect that to be pretty stable across the fourth quarters. Robert McCarthy : Congrats on a great quarter. Thanks. Blake Moret : Thanks, Rob. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Blake Moret : Good morning, Joe. Patrick Goris : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Can you maybe just touch on Food and Beverage a little bit more? It switched from being slightly negative last quarter to slightly positive this quarter, and obviously, you\u2019re expecting it to stay positive for next year. So any other color around what\u2019s happening in that end market? Blake Moret : Sure. Food and beverage, we continue to see some subdued capital spending across Food and Beverage. On the other hand, it\u2019s one of the verticals that we\u2019re seeing particularly high investment across worldwide fleets in IoT. So they\u2019re going in and they\u2019re looking at benchmarking lines across their worldwide operations and finding ways to bring the lower efficient lines up to higher levels of efficiency, and the software being added on top of existing iron is a good way to do it. Also, interestingly, packaging OEMs in Europe picked up a bit for us in the quarter. And while, again, we need to watch how that plays out, that contributed to some of the good performance in Europe and some of the better-than-expected performance in Food and Beverage in general. Joe Ritchie : All right. Interesting. That\u2019s helpful color, Blake. And maybe just a quick follow-on on Sensia. I know when you guys press released it last month, you referenced roughly $400 million in annual revenue, and now the expectation for 2020 is closer to $230 million to $240 million. What am I \u2013 what\u2019s the disconnect between those two numbers? Is the $400 million a longer-term number? Or what\u2019s the difference between the two? Patrick Goris : Yes, very good question. The way you can think about it is Sensia\u2019s overall revenues are expected to be over $400 million in fiscal 2020. The 4% that we refer to is the part that is contributed by Schlumberger to the joint venture. The part that is contributed by Rockwell Automation is already part of our sales. So that 4% that we call inorganic growth only represents the contribution of Schlumberger. Blake Moret : Yes. So for the one year \u2013 for fiscal 2020 only, it will be the total contribution to the revenue will be split between organic and inorganic. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That makes sense. Thanks guys. See you next week. Blake Moret : Thanks, Joe. Jessica Kourakos : Operator, we will take one more question. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey. Good morning, guys. Blake Moret : Hey, Andrew. Patrick Goris : Good morning, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks for fitting me in. So Blake, last quarter, you had said that you expect the downturn you\u2019re seeing to last that long. And while several of your peers are talking about a more prolonged downturn, your results were relatively strong with your own expectations. So how at this point are you measuring the weakness you\u2019re seeing out there versus previous downturns? You mentioned you were concerned about pushouts in CapEx. But are you seeing as we push out some projects versus what you expected? Or you\u2019re generally seeing projects move forward albeit slowly? Blake Moret : Yes. We did not see the same degree of project pushouts in Q4 as we did in Q3. That being said, the macro indicators show deceleration in fiscal 2020, and we need to see more than one quarter of performance to draw a line between those points. So we remain cautious, but obviously, we\u2019re pleased with the better performance in Q4, and again, our ability to compete and win for the business that is out there. Andrew Kaplowitz : That\u2019s helpful. And I wanted to ask the auto question maybe a different way. You were thinking that auto could be down about 10% for FY 2019, but obviously, up mid-single digit. And auto was a strong result in Q4. We know you\u2019re projecting flat for FY 2020, but are you seeing the core auto markets stabilizing faster than you expected? And could these EV projects that you talked about actually lead to some upside for that flat auto forecast that you have for FY 2020? Blake Moret : Yes. I think over a longer period of time, there\u2019s absolutely upside with EV as you have all of these companies, the traditional brand owners as well as new companies. And they have to bring vehicles to market to get a revenue stream. So we\u2019re working with them. And all the ones that started a couple of years ago won\u2019t make it to the finish line, but there\u2019s a lot of exciting innovation out there that we\u2019re participating in. We\u2019re not expecting the industry as a whole to turn around. We\u2019re not expecting SAAR counts to jump back up, but stabilization may be an appropriate word there. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks, Blake. See you next week. Blake Moret : Yes. See you soon. Patrick Goris : Let me quickly answer the question that Rob had. Rob, in Q4, the average price we paid for our shares was $158. And for full year fiscal 2019, the average share price we paid was $165. So with that, Jessica. Jessica Kourakos : Thanks, Patrick. I think I\u2019ll turn it now over to Blake for a few final comments. Blake Moret : Thanks, Jessica. So just to summarize, fiscal 2019 was a good year. We grew adjusted EPS 7%. We grew our core platforms, and Information Solutions and Connected Services continued to grow double digits. We also made some important investments. With this foundation, we are well positioned for the future, and we look forward to seeing you all in Chicago next week. Jessica Kourakos : Okay. That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Later in the call, we will open up the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Jessica Kourakos, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Kourakos, please go ahead Jessica Kourakos : Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2020 Earnings Release Conference Call.  With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO, and Patrick Goris, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include, and our call today will reference, non-GAAP measures.  Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that website, for replay, for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today\u2019s call. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our Company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings. So, with that I\u2019ll hand the call over to Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks, Jessica, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Please turn to page 3 of the slide deck. I\u2019ll begin by saying that I\u2019m pleased with our execution in the quarter and our start to the year. Despite a tough manufacturing environment, both revenue and earnings were slightly better than our expectations for Q1. Total sales grew 3%, including over 4 points of contribution from inorganic investments primarily related to our Sensia joint venture. Organic sales were down 1% compared to a strong quarter a year ago. Backlog, however, was up year-over-year as well as sequentially.  Organic sales performance continues to include market share gains in core platforms. For instance, Independent Cart Motion Control Technology grew strong double-digits for us in the quarter. It is becoming a game-changing solution across a broad range of industries and applications.  Information Solutions and Connected Services, or IS/CS for short, had another great quarter, also growing strong double-digits. We had notable wins in Life Sciences, Food & Beverage, our first MES win in Luxury Goods, a significant MES win in Mining, and our first-ever augmented reality project in Oil & Gas.  Our broader and more differentiated portfolio gives us more ways to win in a wide variety of industries, including those where we are not the incumbent control platform. Recurring revenue in the quarter grew double digits, led by an increase in software subscriptions. As I mentioned, our earnings performance was slightly better than expected. Segment margins and adjusted EPS include one-time items related to Sensia as well as investments we are making to increase our long-term differentiation.  As we look ahead to the rest of the year, we are reaffirming our organic sales and adjusted EPS guidance for fiscal 2020. While there have been recent positive developments on global trade, and the macro environment is showing signs of stabilization, it is still too early to see that impact on customer spending.  Let\u2019s now turn to slide 4 and go a little deeper into our vertical sales performance for the quarter. Discrete and Hybrid end-market segments did a little better than we expected this quarter while Process was a little weaker than we expected.  Within our Discrete segment, Auto grew mid-single digits, largely related to higher program spend in North America and Asia Pacific, and stabilization in MRO, albeit at low levels. While this higher program spend was better than anticipated, the overall auto market is still relatively weak and we think it is premature to change our flat full year outlook for this vertical.  Semiconductor sales were notably better in all regions, up high-single digits. Historically, our exposure to semis has been largely in facilities management, but we are also seeing new traction in material handling, IOT and cybersecurity applications. Turning now to our Hybrid market segment. Food & Beverage declined low-single digits, reflecting some project delays. However, given what we are hearing from customers, and the activity we have seen at packaging OEMs, we still believe Food & Beverage will grow low-single-digits for the year. In Life Sciences, we had another solid quarter, with sales growing both year over year as well as sequentially. As we\u2019ve said before, this is an industry where our scalable architecture and our differentiation in IS/CS are well aligned and paying dividends. Our Process market segment declined slightly, especially in Chemicals and Pulp & Paper. Organically, oil & gas grew mid-single-digits this quarter and we continue to expect low-single-digits sales performance for the year. Sensia, which had a good start to the year, is expected to grow double digits based on its differentiation in the fast-growing, digital oilfield segment of this vertical. Turning to Slide 5 and our regional sales performance in the quarter. North America was down 3% organically, reflecting a weak manufacturing environment. The weakness in process industries was partially offset by Auto, up double-digits, and strength in Semiconductor. EMEA was up 2% in the quarter, led by Oil & Gas, Life Sciences, and Tire.  Asia Pacific grew by 6%, led by strong demand for Oil & Gas, Life Sciences, and Auto. Auto was up over 10% in the region and included strong gains at EV battery manufacturers where our readiness to serve is high. Our portfolio is demonstrating how well-positioned we are to benefit from the transition to EV. Latin America sales were down 1%, largely due to a tough comparison from last year and weaker performance in Automotive and Mining.  I\u2019ll now make a few additional comments on our other accomplishments in the quarter. Our Annual Automation Fair was held last November in Chicago, and I\u2019m proud to say that we reached a new all-time attendance record. Customers are focusing on outcomes, and sharply increased sales leads from the event indicate we are demonstrating our increased value for a wide variety of industries.  We also had record attendance at our Investor Day in November. There, we highlighted our execution plans to accelerate profitable long-term growth, while at the same time build even greater resiliency in our business through higher recurring revenue streams and a leaner more flexible cost structure.  We also had record attendance at our Investor Day in November. There we highlighted our execution plans to accelerate profitable long-term growth, while at the same time build even greater resiliency in our business through higher recurring revenue streams and a leaner, more flexible cost structure. We also had exciting new partners at the event, including Schlumberger, Accenture, and Ansys, which is a game-changing technology partner for simulation and digital twin applications.  We are seeing our partnerships contribute to many strategic wins and we had some great wins this quarter, including in Life Sciences across all major geographies. In Europe, we signed a major agreement with Roche. Roche will be implementing our PharmaSuite MES platform across 16 plants in their Pharma and Diagnostics divisions. In Europe, we signed a major agreement with Roche. Roche will be implementing our pharma suite MES platform across 16 plants in their Pharma and Diagnostics divisions.  In North America, we entered into a new multi-site, multi-year agreement with a major pharmaceutical producer. They selected FactoryTalk Innovation Suite to drive their Digital Transformation program for a connected plant and supply chain.  It will provide a common platform to drive real-time visibility of analytics to the operator, plant and enterprise levels, predict future events to avoid unplanned downtime and improve energy efficiency, and accelerate knowledge transfer and improve ease of use. Once implemented, this solution will eliminate hundreds of overlapping edge solutions, resulting in significant operational savings.  In China, Ruiying Pharma Group, a large pharmaceutical company, chose Rockwell to transform their factories to become smarter and more predictive, while at the same time assisting them to oversee quality management and ensuring that they comply with regulatory requirements.  From regulatory compliance, to safety and energy efficiency, Rockwell is becoming an increasingly important partner of our customers\u2019 ESG initiatives. In addition to what we are doing in our own facilities, everything we do for customers is about increasing efficiency, reducing energy usage, improving worker safety, and ensuring regulatory compliance, all of which lowers business risk and is good for the environment.  Now, turning to slide 6, let\u2019s talk a little more about our inorganic investments which are becoming an increasingly important complement to our long-term organic growth strategy. Starting with Sensia, this was our first quarter including Sensia as a fully operational joint venture consolidated in our results, and I am very pleased with its performance in Q1.  Operationally, Sensia\u2019s top line grew double digits with strong traction at marquis Oil & Gas customers around the world. Our sales teams have been fully integrated, and we are looking forward to the launch of new solutions and products that will contribute to the double-digit sales performance we expect this year. We also announced the acquisition of MESTECH at the beginning of Q1. MESTECH is an industrial software consulting and delivery services company based in India, and they have already been instrumental in winning key business for us in the quarter.  Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of Avnet Data Security, a cybersecurity provider based in Israel with over 20 years of experience. Cybersecurity is one of the fastest growing parts of our services business. The extensive knowledge and experience of the Avnet team will support our company's strategic objective to achieve double-digit growth in Information Solutions and Connected Services by expanding our IT/OT cyber and network expertise globally. Plus, this acquisition will establish a global cybersecurity Center of Excellence for us in EMEA. This includes a remote managed service center and expands our portfolio of capabilities including a full training curriculum and labs. As you can see, we are actively deploying capital to advance our strategic priorities to accelerate share gains in our core business, continue growing double digits in IS/CS, grow domain expertise in process, and accelerate our market access in Europe and Asia. We are focused on driving value with more intensity than ever before.  Let me now turn it over to Patrick who will elaborate on our first quarter financial performance and fiscal 2020 outlook in his remarks. Patrick? Patrick Goris : Thank you, Blake, and good morning everyone.  I\u2019ll start on slide 7, First Quarter Key Financial Information. First quarter reported sales were up 2.6% year over year. As expected, organic sales were down 1%. Acquisitions, which mainly represent the impact of Sensia, contributed 4.5 points of growth, better than expected. Currency translation decreased sales by 0.9 points, a higher headwind than we expected. Segment operating margin was 20.1%, down 270 basis points compared to last year. About half of the year-over-year decrease relates to the impact of acquisitions and related one-time costs, primarily Sensia. The other half of the year-over-year margin decrease is about evenly split between higher investment spending and unfavorable mix.  General Corporate \u2013 net expense of $32.8 million was up $11 million compared to last year. The increase is due to the impact of mark-to-market adjustments related to our deferred and non-qualified compensation plans and Sensia-related transaction fees.  The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 7.9% compared to 18.7% last year. About half of the reduction in the year-over-year tax rate is due to a Sensia $19 million one-time tax benefit. The remainder is other discrete items, primarily tax benefits from option exercises.  Adjusted EPS of $2.11 was a bit better than we expected, and down $0.10 compared to the first quarter of last year, a decrease of 5%. The year-over-year decrease in Adjusted EPS is primarily due to lower organic sales, particularly in some of our product businesses leading to unfavorable mix, and higher investment spending.  Partially offsetting that is a lower tax rate excluding the Sensia impacts, and the net benefit of a lower share count and higher net interest expense. The net year-over-year adjusted EPS contribution of Sensia in the quarter was one penny.  The Sensia contribution of one penny includes a $0.07 larger-than-expected headwind related to one-time items. Free Cash Flow was $194 million in the quarter, or about 80% of Adjusted Income. During the quarter, we paid the annual bonus that our employees earned in fiscal 2019.  A few additional items not shown on the slide : for Adjusted EPS, average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 116.6 million, down 4.9 million or about 4% from last year. We repurchased about 0.5 million shares in the quarter at a cost of $100 million. This is in line with our full year target of about $400 million. At December 31st, we had $1 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization  Slide 8 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our operating segments. The Architecture & Software segment had modest organic growth in the quarter. Segment margin was very strong at 29.8% and a bit lower than the record margin last year, mainly due to increased investment spending.  Organic sales of the Control Products & Solutions segment decreased 2.5%. Inorganic investments increased sales by 8.2% compared to last year. Sensia accounts for almost all of the inorganic growth. Organic sales for our solutions and services businesses in this segment was down about half a point year-over-year. The higher margin product businesses in this segment were down about 5% on an organic basis. First quarter organic book to bill performance for our solutions and services businesses was 1.12, typical for a first quarter. Operating margin for this segment of 12.4% was down 310 basis points compared to Q1 last year, primarily due to Sensia one-time items, lower organic sales, and unfavorable mix. Segment margin excluding the year over year impact of Sensia was about 14%. In the appendix, you will find two slides with a more detailed overview of the year-over-year incremental impact of Sensia for Q1 and for full year fiscal 2020 outlook. It is the same format we provided to you at our investor day.  As I mentioned earlier, from an operational viewpoint, Sensia sales and earnings were a bit better than we expected. Non-recurring items, including the tax benefit, were $0.07 worse than we expected in the first quarter, primarily due to larger purchase accounting adjustments and a lower tax benefit. For full year fiscal 2020, we now expect the net year-over-year impact of Sensia to be about neutral to adjusted EPS. The financial framework we shared with you at investor day last November remains valid with Sensia. We continue to target 30 to 35% earnings conversion for Rockwell assuming mid-single-digit organic sales growth.  This takes us to slide 9, guidance. Our outlook for fiscal 2020 remains unchanged compared to our November guidance. We are maintaining our sales growth and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. For adjusted EPS, in essence, compared to prior guidance, small headwinds due to Sensia one-time items, currency, and a higher share count are offset by a somewhat lower adjusted effective tax rate. The lower tax rate is the result of a higher excess income tax benefit related to share-based compensation. General corporate net is now expected to be closer to $105 million. Purchase accounting amortization expense for the full year is expected to be about $40 million, up $20 million compared to last year. Net interest expense for fiscal 2020 is still expected to be about $100 million. We expect non-controlling-Interest to be about $10 million, or a $0.10 charge to Adjusted EPS. Average diluted share count is now expected to be 116.5 million for fiscal 2020, and our adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be closer to 15.5%, which includes about a 150 basis point one-time benefit related to Sensia. We continue to project free cash flow conversion of about 100% of adjusted income. Finally, we continue to project a weaker first half of the year, with organic sales down low single digits, followed by a stronger second half of the year. And as is typical for us, we expect weaker 2nd quarter Adjusted EPS performance versus the first quarter. With that, I\u2019ll hand it to Jessica to start Q&A. Jessica Kourakos : Thanks, Patrick. Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you in as possible. So please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Sharon, let\u2019s take our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning everyone. This is Joe on for Julian. Blake Moret : Good morning. Unidentified Analyst : Maybe can we start with diving into backlog trends? Can you maybe just provide some color on what drove the sequential rise and the year-over-year rise? And then, maybe within that, anymore details on Solutions and Services? Blake Moret : Sure, how much more color we can provided except that as we mentioned, backlogs are up both year-over-year and sequentially, and I would say it was broad based including in North America. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you. And then, at the end-market level, kind of on the mid-single-digit growth for oil and gas, was this on kind of company-specific drivers, maybe share gains? Or are you seeing kind of more positives in the end-market as a whole? Blake Moret : On the organic side, there obviously has been a flattish capital spending and we do see a slower \u2013 a slowing of the oil and gas organically. However, on the Sensia joint venture, because the majority of that is focused on producing wells and not drilling new wells, we see it less susceptible to CapEx reductions and that gives us confidence based on our first quarter results and the outlook that double-digits impact part of our overall oil and gas business can take share and grow fast. Unidentified Analyst : Perfect. Thank you. Blake Moret : Okay, thank you. Operator : Next question comes from John Inch with Gordon Haskett. Karen Lau : Hi, good morning. It\u2019s Karen Lau dialing in for John. Blake Moret : Good morning, Karen. Karen Lau : Good morning. So, thank you for the details on Sensia in the appendix. I was just wondering in terms of the core margins, it looks like, you guys were making 18% core margins excluding the one-time items in the first quarter, but then in the full year you are guiding to around 14% margins. What is the driver of that? Patrick Goris : Yes, what you can think about it, Karen, what you see in the appendix is the year-over-year incremental piece of Sensia. It\u2019s the impact of the contribution of Schlumberger, which was higher margin business than what we contributed. Karen Lau : Okay. Patrick Goris : And so, therefore, when we talk about overall margin profile of Sensia, we do expect that the 20% EBITDA business going forward. But this year, we think it will be closer to mid-teens. Karen Lau : Okay. But is it \u2013 I mean, am I reading correctly that the first quarter results were better than what you were expecting for the full year? Or is that like some\u2026 Patrick Goris :  But the piece that was contributed by Schlumberger and the synergy, the answer to that is, yes. I would also say that our spend increased in Sensia, because we are making some investments in technology and commercial resources. They were a little bit lighter in the first quarter than we expected. That\u2019s why you see that margin in Q1 being a little bit better, as well than what you see for the full year outlook. Karen Lau : Got it. And then, just quickly, can you remind us what\u2019s your expectation for investment spending for the year? And kind of the cadence throughout the year? Patrick Goris : Yes, the way you can think about it, Karen is, consistent with what I mentioned to you in November. We think the year-over-year increase will be a little bit less than a 2% and it will be first half weighted. And so, we expect it to be more than that in the first half and in the second half, the increase year-over-year will be minimum in terms of year-over-year spend. Karen Lau : Got it. Thank you. Patrick Goris : Thank you, Karen. Operator : Next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stephens. Robert McCarthy : Hi, it\u2019s Robert McCarthy on for Robert McCarthy. Blake Moret : Hey, Rob. Robert McCarthy : How are you doing? So, in any event, just wanted to first, I mean, obviously wasn\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s very dynamic situation right now. You had the trade deal. You had very encouraging quarter, but obviously you had this rising potentials of pandemic, and then I want to get too much of a Debbie Downer.  But how do you think about kind of your supply chain in China, how do you think about, kind of the trends in spillover? I know it\u2019s very early and you don\u2019t have a lot of information yet, but could you just give us some factors to think about and what sensitivities you are looking at in terms of exposures as you manage to this situation? Blake Moret : Sure. Well, first of all, Rob, the overwhelming first priority for us is to ensure that we are looking after our people in the region. And so, we are paying close attention to that to make sure that we can reduce to the very extent possible their exposure.  Second, and on a parallel path, we are undergoing a detailed review of our own manufacturing footprint, as well as our supply base to gauge the potential impacts. At this point, we don\u2019t expect an impact to the quarter\u2019s performance, but as you said, it\u2019s a very dynamic situation and we are monitoring it hourly and looking for new inputs to help inform how we feel about the business impacts. But it\u2019s the safety and well-being of our employees first. Robert McCarthy : Thank you for that. And then, I guess the follow-up would be, maybe just a little more color around Information Solutions and Connected Services, the continued double-digit growth there. Can you talk about, kind of the continued developments and collaboration with PTC, some of the wins and maybe expand your comments around augmented reality? And I don\u2019t know track and trace is something that\u2019s started to pick-up there or is looking to be encouraging. Blake Moret : Yes, Rob, it\u2019s a great story for us and with our own offerings that we\u2019ve developed ourselves, plus with partners like PTC, the Information Solutions and Connected Services part of our offering continues to grow strong double-digits and we are seeing that it\u2019s a true differentiator in some of the fastest growing parts of the overall automation market like electric vehicles and life sciences.  So, it works perfectly to complement the basic automation that we are providing in those industries whether it\u2019s discrete automotive assembly or it\u2019s process control for pharma, but as they are looking for more traceability, as they are looking for adding the ability to transfer knowledge from older workers to newer workers, augmented reality is a great part of that.  We have mentioned before, about a third of our sales of the software in this space include augmented reality. So it all works together. It\u2019s increasing the hit rate for our MES software, because we have a broader portfolio and it works together well. So, there is a lot of positives in this respect. And I should mention it\u2019s not just for end-users.  It\u2019s also for OEMs, because they are looking for increasing the value of what they are providing and as they look for ways to increase their flexibility getting closer to that zero changeover time for packaging that is hard in the industry today. Then this has a lot of benefit for them, as well. We had a win in the quarter with Harpak, who you heard from us at the Investor Day in November as they are adding that software to the basic logics control and variable speed drives and so on as part of the basic automation of those systems.  And then as a final point, we have seen, probably a higher degree of adoption of this software on top of competitive control platforms than we originally thought would happen. Robert McCarthy : Thanks for your time. Blake Moret : Thanks, Rob. Patrick Goris : Thanks, Rob. Operator : Next question comes from Richard Eastman with Baird. Richard Eastman : Yes, good morning. Thank you for the questions. Blake, could you kind of speak, maybe to the geographic mix, the organic growth by geography in the quarter? And it just \u2013 it seems a bit scattered here. I mean, I presume, Asia was probably better than expected. U.S. maybe a little bit weaker. But how does the incoming backlog being up quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year?  How does that filter into maybe the geographic growth that you expect for the full year against the \u2013 kind of that midpoint of flat expectation for all of Rock? Blake Moret : Yes, let me start with a couple of comments and then Patrick may have got some additional color on that. But as I said, Asia was better than expected. Latin America was worse than expected. North America and EMEA were pretty much in line with expectations. In North America, as we mentioned, we were down by 3% and that was largely due to declines in more process-oriented verticals with the exception of oil and gas.  So, we saw chemical, pulp and paper and metals, and then that was offset by the growth we mentioned in automotive, power and semiconductor. EMEA was up and oil and gas was a contributor there along with a recurrent theme of life sciences. Waste water was a good area for us in EMEA and in Asia, we were up with growth in oil and gas, life sciences, auto, tire and mass transit.  And then, LATAM was down a little bit where weakness in auto and mining was partially offset by growth in power, oil and gas and life sciences. So, that was kind of a rundown of what we saw in Q1. In terms of how the backlog feathers into that, obviously, mainly project, but also with some of the higher value services as well, particularly those included with the Connected Services part of IS/CS. Patrick Goris : Rick, maybe a little bit of color as to our assumptions by region for the full year. So, organic growth at the midpoint is flat year-over-year. We expect both the \u2013 both North America and EMEA to be a little bit below that and we expect both Latin America and Asia to be up a little less than 5%, about mid-single-digits. Richard Eastman : Okay. And \u2026 Patrick Goris : So, what - but that inflected as we expect in essence better than our guidance, we expect second half of the year as I mentioned improvement and that includes the U.S., I would say, North America. Richard Eastman : Okay. And was there any noticeable impacts on the backlog and order flow around passage of the U.S. MCA when you are talking about Latin America and Mexico? Was there any noteworthy improvement in bookings or anything once that uncertainty was more or less lifted? Blake Moret : Not yet, is the short answer. I mean, it\u2019s a positive step and supporting the concept of free and fair trade that we\u2019ve talked a lot about in the past. So we think it\u2019s a good thing. But we haven\u2019t seen the results on outperformance yet. Richard Eastman : Okay. Very good. Thank you. Blake Moret : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : Thank you. t I was intrigued, Blake, because you call out ESG as a potential driving force for your customers to implement your suite of offerings. Conceptually, I think we can understand that, there is a basic efficiency play here that plays in ESG. Could you maybe provide some examples of where you are seeing that make a material difference in customers\u2019 decisions? Blake Moret : Well, as you said, everything we do is about productivity and a huge part of that productivity is efficiency. So, you take our power control offering, variable speed drives, which reduce dramatically the amount of energy that\u2019s required to run industrial processes, tremendous amount of the world\u2019s energy is consumed in factories and simply, not running full across the line when you don\u2019t need it saves a ton of energy and our variable speed drives, low-voltage and medium-voltage continue to be a very strong part of our offering. Specifically, in the new eco industrial segment that we introduced in November, talking about our support of renewable of water and waste water treatment and mass transit, those are all industries that reduce the amount of energy that are required and it was no coincidence that we created that new segment, because we are going to be doing more in that space.  And then finally, safety, that\u2019s something we\u2019ve talked a lot about in the past and in terms of the technology to be able to automate safety, but also the services that we provided, that\u2019s an important part of ESG. We think that we are number one in the world when you pull all the discrete and process safety technology together, and that remains a really important area for us. Noah Kaye : That\u2019s helpful. And then, maybe drilling into auto a little bit, as you said it surprised the upside, and you gave some good color around some regional patterns there in your prepared remarks. But just, the outlook for kind of, soft overall light vehicle demand, is that having any impact as far as you can tell on kind of the backlog the longer cycle business in terms of OEM plans to bring new models to market or planned model changeovers? How are you thinking about that? Blake Moret : Well we \u2013 we are guiding to about flat currently with the auto - overall automotive segment for the year. I\u2019d say the growth is highest in the specific EV drivetrain portion of the segment as people have bring in that capacity online whether it\u2019s the brand owner or it\u2019s the tier supplier, and by the way that contributed a lot to our performance.  That was a little better than expectations and if you want it was battery assembly that was a specific bright spot for there. That\u2019s offset to some extent by the reality of a weaker star count for fewer vehicles than we saw a couple years ago being bought. Certainly, a lot of the brand owners are reducing their Sedan portfolio. But there is still a fair bit of project spend there and in the - particularly in the SUV side of things. And the growth that we saw in the quarter was primarily due to project spend, MRO stabilized, but we didn't see any real growth in MRO in the quarter. Noah Kaye : That's helpful color. Thanks, Blake. Blake Moret : Yes. Thanks, Noah. Operator : Next question comes from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Steve Tusa : Hey guys. Good morning. Blake Moret : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : Can you just talk about a little bit more about what you're seeing on the food and beverage side and OEM? And then on maybe just a bit of color on how you see, kind of quarterly organic progressing maybe move through the rest of the year? Blake Moret : Sure, I'll start with the food and beverage. We did see some delays in food. But one of the bright spots and I mentioned it is, we actually saw mid-single-digit growth in packaging OEMs. And it\u2019s early but that\u2019s sometimes a leading indicator as people are putting packaging in place and we did see that across the regions.  We also heard anecdotally from the packaging OEMs that their backlog is fairly good. And so those are encouraging signs. One area of particular strength for us \u2013 it\u2019s small but it is still noteworthy India packaging OEMs and I say it\u2019s is noteworthy because India maybe the most competitive market in the world and for us to have a success there is a really younger testament to the functionality and the ability to get to competitive levels there.  I was actually there in visit with some customers including some packaging OEMs in December. And I think there is some great opportunities there and we are going to continue to look at what we can do to grow our presence even faster in the Indian market. But in general, packaging OEMs were up. We also saw some strength, specifically in beverage. We had a real nice conversion at a beverage OEM that\u2019s going to a well-known beverage user and so that was also good in the quarter. Steve Tusa : And then you said, quarterly, yes, progression on organic? Patrick Goris : Yes, see, for the full year, we remain at 0% organic growth. Obviously, Q1, we did minus 1. I would say, Q2, low, low-single-digits, meaning it\u2019s close to what we did in Q1. We don\u2019t expect it to get worse than what we did in Q1 and then for the balance of the year, I\u2019d say, Q4 organic growth a little bit better than Q3. Steve Tusa : Okay. So, it seems to me that like, how do you get to kind of the low-end of the range than if that\u2019s the case? I mean\u2026 Patrick Goris : What I was providing was at the midpoint, Steve. Steve Tusa : Yes. Okay, got it. Blake Moret : The trend that I think we have seen in the past with chemical and we did see that is the single largest contributor in the quarter. That was primarily in North America, we actually saw an increase in chemical in EMEA, down in Asia, and slightly down in Latin America. So, is it\u2019s offset?  As we mentioned, we actually saw a growth in oil and gas, but the chemical was down in the quarter and most of that was concentrated in North America. Steve Tusa : Thanks. Patrick Goris : As we said in the earlier, within Process, oil and gas was up. But generally, process industries were weak in the quarter. Steve Tusa : Great. Blake Moret : I would also mention, just for background that, in chemical lot of our exposure in specialty chemical. It\u2019s not as much in the bulk chemical. That\u2019s our traditional focus. There is some overcapacity that we are currently seeing in chemical and some effects from some of the consolidation that\u2019s been going on in the industry over the last couple of years as well. So that\u2019s some additional color that would certainly apply to North America. Steve Tusa : That\u2019s great. Very helpful. And then just a quick one just on EV. I know, you said you had strong gains there during the quarter. I am just wondering if you can talk about China EV specifically and what you have been seeing there? Any changes? Patrick Goris : Yes, so, China \u2013 auto in China has been down Q3, Q4 of last year and we saw that continue into the first quarter of fiscal 2020. And that includes EVs. And so we are seeing some of the support or the subsidies go away in China and generally, and obviously it\u2019s still a little bit lumpy, because it\u2019s relatively small,  But EV and auto in general, we are certainly seeing some weakness in China. Interestingly, auto in Asia was up for us quite a bit and the reason there we are making some progress with some of the EV companies outside of China including some companies in Korea for example. Blake Moret : Yes, and that\u2019s specific application that Patrick is mentioning in Korea was the battery assembly, which is a great application for us. We have mentioned before that, in comparison to the subtractive manufacturing processes for internal combustion engines, now for boring cylinders and things like that that require a lot of CNC content. Battery assembly and motor winding and EV drivetrain, we have a high readiness to serve there and that\u2019s why we think that long-term EV is a great market for us to be in. Steve Tusa : That\u2019s great. Thank you very much for your time. Blake Moret : Yes. Thank you. Patrick Goris : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning all. Patrick Goris : Good morning, Josh. Blake Moret : Hey, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : So, apologies if I missed it earlier on the call. But, Blake, one thing that we talked about at the Analyst Day that I want to see how that is playing out is, it\u2019s kind of the lower cyclicality of Rockwell maybe versus what folks would have been accustomed to five or ten years ago or even more that it does seem like at a point in time whether folks are seeing kind of a more depressed outlook that Rockwell is hanging in there a bit more stable. I guess, one, is that consistent with the way you guys are seeing the world? And two, is there kind of a coiled spring on the back-end where you can see customers have a willingness to spend on projects, but there maybe not executing it. So, have we lost some of that upward mobility in exchange for lower cyclicality? Blake Moret : Yes, I wouldn\u2019t draw that the causality between the two. But as we talked about a lot in November, that greater resiliency to economic cycles is something that we are making very explicit steps to address. And so, in addition to things like Information Solutions and Connected Services providing a lot of increased value to customers and pulling through some of our traditional products.  It does have an impact that we think is already being felt in terms of kind of clipping the trough of some of the normal volatility. Now it\u2019s still a relatively small part of our business, right? But that\u2019s compounding a strong double-digit growth, plus what we do with acquisitions having more recurring revenue makes it more important each year and last year.  We think \u2013 for instance, Information Solutions and Connected Services having about a point of organic growth to what we did and you know in a relatively low growth year overall, that\u2019s meaningful.  So, we are going to continue to work on that in terms of both our organic development, the products and the environment to be able to manage recurring revenue. But it\u2019s also a consideration as we look for companies to acquire and the percentage of recurring revenue. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just a follow-up on investment. Again, apologies if you covered already. It seems like some of that got pulled forward into the first quarter as maybe demand was a little bit better than expected.  How should we think about the sensitivity from here on kind of that full year investment budget? Is it at a healthy level to where if you are at the top-end of the revenue range that the overall bucket doesn\u2019t increase? Or how are you thinking about the sensitivity over the remaining three quarters? Thanks. Patrick Goris : Yes, Josh. So, what we mentioned was that the spending in the \u2013 the year-over-year increase in the first half will be higher than in the second half. Actually, the second half the way we have it dialed in now is the flattish from a year-over-year spend point of view. However, if, depending on what happens with our outlook for the year, and if we end up doing better what we do at the midpoint.  Clearly, we could decide to release more investments. There is a very long list of attractive investments that we are looking through all the time and we could decide to do more. Josh Pokrzywinski : Okay. Thanks for the color. Patrick Goris : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Thanks, good morning. Appreciate the question. I know you covered a lot of ground already. But and I know we tend to focus more on the end-market out. So I am just wondering about the geographies and thinking about how geographically, things are playing out relative to your initial kind of guidance in November. In particular, North America, down 3.3% this quarter and I know that North America has been trending weak for some time now.  But with ISM where it is and IP negative, how does that look in North America specifically compared to your initial kind of outlook? And kind of what\u2019s bouncing against that if it is weaker than you expected? Blake Moret : Yes, so, as you said, the macro can generally be characterized as weak and there was some downward revisions. And our position to that is some of the backlog that was built in the first quarter and some of the things.  Again like the IS and CS, the Information Solutions and Connected Services backdrop aren\u2019t going to be as coupled directly to some of the broader indicators, if in those areas, we can demonstrate a relatively quick return on that investment, which is often from OpEx then we think that that\u2019s going to be more resilient than some of the other more capital-related spending. Patrick Goris : Yes, and then, Nigel, for Q1, we would say that North America and EMEA came in basically in line with our expectations. Asia-Pacific came in better and Latin America came in weaker. And for the full year, compare estimate point, we think that North America and EMEA will be down a bit and we think that Asia-Pacific and Latin America will be up mid-single-digits at a less than 5%. Nigel Coe : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Patrick. And then a quick one on obviously A&S is holding up a lot better through the soft patch than we\u2019ve seen historically. And I know it\u2019s also flowing through the IS layer, but can you just maybe \u2013 is there any way to quantify kind of the relationship with PTC and how that\u2019s helping to \u2013 maybe improve the trough performance of A&S? And any color there would be helpful. Blake Moret : Yes, I made a general comment to that and that is, manufacturing - advanced manufacturing is becoming a much more noteworthy part of a company\u2019s overall digital transformation plans. So we see companies like Stanley Black & Decker, as they talk about fairly significant reductions in cost they're being asked to go a little deeper and explain how they are going to get there and we are finding ourselves apart of those explanations as to how we are going to be able to reduce OpEx for these companies.  By having the relationship with PTC and having that increasingly important in IS/CS offering, we are going to have those broad discussions at a higher level than if we were just talking about programmable controller performance or some of the other elements of basic automation. So it allows us to get higher in the organization and deploy a meaningful part of those overall discussions whereas if we didn\u2019t have that kind of breadth, then we might find ourselves playing a little more deep ends in some of the core components.  So that\u2019s at a high level how a partnership with a company like PTC will pull through some performance in the core products, because they all go together, that basic automation and then the information that sits on top of it to draw insights from the data that\u2019s born in our products. Nigel Coe : Okay. Thanks, Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks, Nigel. Jessica Kourakos : Sharon, we will take one more question. Operator : We have a question from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning guys. Patrick Goris : Good morning, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks for letting me in. Blake, you might have talked about this earlier, but on Sensia, you mentioned that operating performance was better than expected. Maybe you could just talk about \u2013 give a little more color on what that means? Obviously, there is a lot of moving pieces with Sensia in the guide that you gave last quarter for the year.  I think you talked about $0.05 excluding interest. Could it be better than that in 2020? Blake Moret : Yes, I mean, we are pushing the team, obviously to perform as if they are in an open field because we think they are. We think that what they are offering is somewhat unique in the market and our original hypothesis that there was a low level of basic automation in the oilfield, particularly the onshore oilfield is proving to be true. So that things that we are talking about as we are selling the traditional offerings into that space of things like measurement, devices, as well as artificial lift and so on, the ability to commence and to weave that together is really meeting with a lot of interest and some of these are our existing customers, but customers that in the past have bought the products as needed from us.  But now they are saying that we can play a much more significant part in their overall strategy. And I had a chance to talk with some of these customers over the last year in Latin America and in Europe and we are excited and even more excited after the first quarter\u2019s results, because these companies are voting with their wallets.  And again, it\u2019s a solutions-based approach. It\u2019s the measurement devices, it\u2019s the artificial lifts, it\u2019s the software and then it\u2019s the delivery capability to bring this all together to reduce their cost to produce a barrel of oil. Andrew Kaplowitz : And Blake, I just wanted I just wanted to follow-up on your comment on Latin America. A, is the incremental weakness or the moderation that that you saw really focused on mining and/or just tough comparisons, there has been a little bit of unrest down there. You just mentioned oil and gas pretty strong. So, just what have seen down there? Blake Moret : Yes, so, mechanically, we still have some tough comps against that big Codelco project in mining that we've talked about over the last year or so. And that project is going very well by the way. In general, in Latin America, we saw modest growth in Mexico and Brazil, but it was offset by weakness in Argentina and Chile and of course a good component of that would be mining-related.  Mexico was up low-single-digits and Brazil was also up low-single-digits. So, I think you are right that some of it is comps. We expect mining to be about flat for the year in Latin America. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks, Blake. Blake Moret : Yes. Patrick Goris : Thank you, Andy. Operator : And at this time, I will turn the call over to Ms. Kourakos. Jessica Kourakos : Thank you, Sharon. I\u2019ll turn it back to Blake for few final comments. Blake Moret : Thanks, Jessica. As we have been discussing, I am happy to see our new offerings delivering significantly increased value. We\u2019ve never been better positioned with a more differentiated offering as the convergence of IT and OT creates tremendous new opportunities. And our employees and partners they continue to set us apart and we are really excited about the journey ahead. Jessica Kourakos : Okay. That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference call. At this time, you may now disconnect. Thank you.",

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Jessica Kourakos, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Kourakos, please go ahead. Jessica Kourakos : Thanks, Sharon. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation\u2019s Second Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Patrick Goris, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include and our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at the website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today\u2019s call. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings. So with that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks, Jessica, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Before I begin, let me say to everyone listening on this call, thank you for your interest and support and I hope that you and those close to you are safe and healthy. We\u2019re truly in unprecedented times and our first priority is protecting employee health and safety. Our employees are doing outstanding work, keeping our customers operations up and running strong during this crisis. We are an essential business that supports critical infrastructure because our customers cannot build their products at scale without automation. So thank you to our employees, our suppliers, our distribution partners and everyone else who has been working hard to serve our customers and communities. This pandemic will change how we live our lives and operate our businesses in the future. Rockwell\u2019s financial strength positions us well to overcome the current challenges and to be more valuable than ever as our customers learn to operate in this new environment. Let me now review the topics for today\u2019s call. I\u2019ll first offer some color on how our people and our customers are effectively managing through this crisis. Then provide a brief overview of our Q2 performance, including a status report on our operations and supply chain and then focus more time on what we are seeing today in our outlook. Please turn to Page 3 of the slide deck. When I think about how our business is being conducted right now and how we are handling the current environment, I start with our employees and our customers. The safety of our employees is always our first priority. We closely follow U.S. CDC and World Health Organization guidelines. For our manufacturing workforce, we provide health screening, enhanced cleaning measures and use of safety equipment and have implemented social distancing between workstations across our facilities. Our non-manufacturing workforce has been exercising social distancing and working from home for over a month now. And we have restricted nonessential business travel, where we can, we\u2019re using our own technologies and services to keep our people productive and support our customers. For example, we now have 2,500 seats of Vuforia augmented reality activated internally to conduct witness testing as well as customer support and training. Turning to our customers. This health crisis is bringing us even closer to our customers as everyone is rallying to help manufacture more necessary goods than ever before. For example, we have a strong partnership with 3M, as they ramp up respirator production. And we recently collaborated with Han Chang Machinery, a Chinese hygiene products machine builder to increase the production capacity of their high speed mask making machine. Our solution based on Logix and our next-generation motion controllers increase their output from 150 to 500 mask per minute. We\u2019re also supporting AVID Labs another pharmaceutical company to increase testing capacity and with GE Healthcare and others to ramp up their production of ventilators. We\u2019re also supporting companies like Roche and Cytiva, who are working tirelessly to develop treatments and vaccines and are investing in manufacturing capabilities, so that they are ready to scale up production as soon as possible. We\u2019re also helping companies who have repurposed manufacturing assets to now produce mask, ventilators, test kits and other equipment our communities desperately need. For example, automotive and mining OEMs are now making ventilators and food and beverage machine builders are now making masks. Even the Jameson Distillery, which is located near our offices in Ireland, has diverted some of their whiskey production lines to now produce alcohol sanitizing gels for hospitals and medical centers. These are just a few stories showcasing the innovation going on in these difficult times. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 4 for our Q2 performance and some key accomplishments in the quarter. Total sales grew slightly in the quarter, including a 3 point contribution from inorganic investments, primarily related to our Sensia joint venture. Organic sales were flat versus last year and were in line with what we were expecting heading into the quarter despite an 18% decline in China related to COVID-19. Our organic sales performance benefited from strong sales of Logix, which grew 8% versus the prior year, led by strength in North America, particularly in automotive and food and beverage. In addition to Logix, we continue to see strong growth in other core platforms like Independent Cart technology for motion control and network infrastructure. Both of these grew double digits in the quarter and we think we\u2019re taking share. We also had a number of important strategic wins in automotive, food and beverage, life sciences, mining and tire where we were not the incumbent control platform. Information Solutions and Connected Services or ISCS for short was down slightly largely due to a difficult comparison with major projects last year. That said, the pipeline for ISCS remain strong. We built strong backlog in the quarter and we still expect ISCS sales to reach $400 million for the year. Our IoT offering continues to differentiate itself in the marketplace. In the quarter, Rockwell was awarded the Industrial IoT Company of the Year by Compass Intelligence, which adds to our recent recognition in Gartner\u2019s annual Magic Quadrant survey as a leader in IoT software. We also saw very strong orders for Vuforia as we help customers expand their remote engineering capabilities during this pandemic. Turning now to Q2 earnings. Adjusted EPS grew 19% and includes the release of our bonus accrual. And finally, free cash flow grew about 9% in the quarter, underscoring Rockwell\u2019s solid financial health and strong balance sheet position. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 5, where I will provide a few highlights of our Q2 organic end market performance. Our discreet market segment grew high single digits led by auto, which grew by over 20% year-over-year and grew double digits sequentially. Auto performed well above expectations in the quarter in almost every region. We continue to see very good growth in electric vehicle programs, we also benefited from some traditional projects that we\u2019ve been tracking. Our Hybrid market segment was flat in Q2. Our largest segment Food and Beverage grew low single digits, including growth at packaging OEMs. Life sciences declined modestly due to the very tough comparison to last year. Many of our customers, particularly those in consumer focused hybrid industries have been running their operations 24/7 to meet very high demand and have had little opportunity to implement projects that divert resources from current production. Process markets were down mid single digits with oil and gas also down mid single digits. We\u2019ll talk more about our outlook for oil and gas in just a few minutes. Turning now to Slide 6 and our organic regional sales performance in the quarter. Growth in North America and Latin America was offset by an 18% decline in China, which accounts for about 6% of our global revenue. We saw growth in Asia Pacific excluding China, led by EV battery. EMEA was down low single digits, but with relative strength in automotive, food and beverage, life sciences and semiconductor. Turning now to Slide 7. Let me take a few minutes here to discuss how we\u2019re navigating the current environment. I first want to say that I\u2019m very proud of the efforts we have taken to build resiliency in our operations and supply chain over the years. Our plants are operational and meeting current demand. And while the many actions we had taken to mitigate tariffs over the last couple of years reduce the impact from COVID-19 on our Chinese supply chain, segments of our global supply chain are seeing some disruption. Among the biggest challenges have been reworking product flows to implement social distancing and managing shifts to limit the number of employees in a facility at one time. We are actively managing what is a very fluid situation. Patrick will have more details on our operations and supply chain. As part of our actions to mitigate risk in our business and maintain our strong financial position, we announced earlier this month a series of temporary actions to better align our costs with a reduction in demand. The following principles of the foundation for our decision making, keep our customer focus, protect employment as much as possible, protect our most important initiatives and investments to drive long-term differentiation and position our company for success over the long-term. Balancing the near-term with the long-term is extremely important. This is why we have and we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet. Our capital deployment priorities remain in order, organic and inorganic investments followed by dividends and repurchases. Turning to Slide 8. The acquisitions we announced last quarter, ASEM and Kalypso are expected to close in the next couple of weeks and we will continue to look for additional inorganic investment opportunities that advance our strategic objectives. We expect ASEM and Kalypso to contribute about 0.5 of revenue growth this year and over 1 point of growth on a full year basis. Together with our inorganic investments, we expect total inorganic sales to contribute about 4% to 4.5% of top line growth in fiscal 2020. Turning now to our outlook on Slide 9. We\u2019re focused on delivering value to all of our stakeholders through these rapidly changing market conditions. The path of recovery is difficult to predict. As we put together our forecast, we looked at a variety of inputs. Our recent performance in China and Italy, near-term industrial production forecast, our daily sales and order intake through April and what we are hearing from end customers and distributors. We expect that our fiscal third quarter sales will be down approximately 20% year-over-year followed by sequential improvement in the fourth quarter. As a result, these are our expectations for the year. Organic sales down 8% at the midpoint, we continue to expect inorganic investments now including ASEM and Kalypso to contribute about 4% to 4.5% of growth to the year, adjusted EPS of $7.30 at the midpoint and we\u2019re projecting free cash flow to convert at over 100%. As you can see from our organic end market projections for the second half and full year on Slide 10, the midpoint of our projections assumes both automotive and oil and gas will see particularly steep declines in the second half of the year. We were also modeling more modest declines in food and beverage and other industries. We expect most verticals including auto, the bottom in Q3 gradually recover starting in Q4 with the exception of oil and gas that we think will take longer to recover. With that, let me now turn it over to Patrick who will elaborate on our second quarter financial performance and fiscal 2020 outlook in his remarks. Patrick? Patrick Goris : Thank you, Blake and good morning everyone. I will keep my remarks on second quarter results very brief and then switch to comments about our strong financial position, what we see in our supply chain and operations, cost mitigation activities and fiscal 2020 outlook. I\u2019ll start on Slide 11. For the second quarter organic sales growth \u2013 organic sales were down 0.2% compared to last year and acquisitions contributed 3% to total growth. Currency translation was a larger headwind than expected due to a stronger U.S. dollar and decreased sales by 1.5 points. Within the quarter, organic seals were up low single digits through February with a very weak performance in China. Again through February, China was down about 30% more than offset by better than expected North America product sales. Global organic sales weakened in March and were down a little less than 4% for the month compared to last year. Overall company backlog including for products and for solutions and services increased both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis for the quarter. Segment operating margin was 22.1% up 80 basis points compared to last year, primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense. Our incentive programs are highly correlated to financial performance of the company. We no longer expect an incentive compensation payout to be earned for fiscal 2020 and we therefore released our incentive accruals. This represents a little over 200 basis points of segment margin tailwind, which is partially offset by margin headwinds related to currency at a little over 0.5 point of margin and the impact of acquisitions at about 0.5 point. General corporate net expense was lower compared to last year, mainly as a result of favourable mark to market adjustments related to our deferred and non-qualified compensation plans. I\u2019ll cover the adjusted EPS bridge on a following slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter of 12.4% was lower than we expected due to several discrete items. Free cash flow in the quarter of about $200 million, included a $31 million tax payment, which represents the second installments on the repatriation tax that is owed as a result of tax reform. Slide 12 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our operating segments. Architecture & Software had good organic growth in the quarter with strong Logix performance. Lower incentive compensation was a margin tailwind of about 200 basis points for this segment. Currency was about a 100 basis point headwind. Organic sales of the Control Products & Solutions segment decreased 3.6% with the products within this segment down 3%, and the solutions and services down about 4%. Sensia represents almost all of the 5.8% revenue growth from inorganic investments in this segment. Second quarter organic book-to-bill for our solutions and services businesses was 1.10. As I mentioned earlier, we built backlog in the quarter including for solutions and services. But starting in March, we have seen an increase in project delays initiated by customers. Operating margin for the Control Products & Solutions segment was down 70 basis points compared to last year. The next Slide 13 provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q2 fiscal 2019 to Q2 fiscal 2020. As you can see, core performance was up a little less than $0.05 despite no organic revenue growth in the quarter. Large tailwinds related to incentive compensation and the lower tax rates were partially offset by the impact of currency. As expected, the impact of acquisitions was about neutral. I\u2019ll switch gears now and will provide some comments about our balance sheet and liquidity. Please move to Slide 14. We continue to be in a strong position with regard to our capital structure and liquidity. At March 31, cash on the balance sheet was about $640 million and our total debt was about $2.1 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.0. Last week, we executed the $400 million term loan, which provides us the funds to close two previously announced acquisitions, ASEM and Kalypso as well as funds for other general corporate purposes. The two acquisitions are expected to close in the next few weeks with a combined purchase price of $300 million. We expect both acquisitions to add about 0.5 point of revenue to fiscal 2020 sales and expect the fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS impact, including one-time costs to be about $0.05 headwind. From a liquidity perspective, in addition to our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation profile, we have access to the commercial paper market for our operating needs. Our single A credit ratings provide us good access to the capital markets. And finally, our liquidity is also supported by our existing $1.25 billion credit facility, which expires in November of 2023. This credit facility remains available and undrawn. The only financial covenant we have in our debt agreements is an EBITDA to the interest expense covenant in our credit facility and the new term loan. We have plenty of room under debt covenant, which we have pressure tested in our scenario analysis. As you know, we have a history of generating solid free cash flow, and we expect, just like in prior downturns working capital reduction to be a source of cash. We\u2019re also deferring non-critical capital expenditures and now expect fiscal 2020 capital expenditures to be closer to $130 million compared to $160 million prior guidance. Finally, as we have mentioned in the past, we do not expect to have any mandatory U.S. pension contributions in the next few years and we have no long term debt maturities until 2025. In a nutshell, we continue to be in the strong financial position and are focused on maintaining it. Next, I\u2019ll make some comments about what we\u2019re seeing in our supply chain, manufacturing, distribution operations, as well as our solutions and services businesses on Slide 15. We have a global supply chain, including a network of suppliers and manufacturing and distribution facilities. Our supply chain team is closely managing our end-to-end supply chain with a particular focus on all critical and at risk suppliers and supplier locations globally. In late January and early February, we proactively increased inventory levels of certain, mostly China source components and products. We are currently experiencing some isolated supply and cross-border transit disruptions and do see some increased supply chain costs, particularly related to reduce the air freight capacity. We\u2019re implementing freight surcharges to help mitigate the impact of these higher input costs. All of our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers are operating at this time. We have implemented additional safety and hygiene processes, including separation of shifts and social distancing between workstations to keep our employees safe. Some of the operational changes implemented as well as some unplanned employee absenteeism are driving some inefficiencies in our operations, which we\u2019re in the process of addressing. Our solutions and services businesses include thousands of domain experts. They understand our customer\u2019s challenges and priorities and design and implement solutions and provide services through a combination of domain expertise and our technology. Physical access to our customer facilities is often important as we delivered those solutions and services. As a result of COVID-19 access to customer facilities in some instances has been difficult, for example, for onsite commissioning. While we have been leveraging our technology and that of our partners to deliver certain services and solutions remotely, decreased access has led to some project delays as well as inefficiencies due to lower labor utilization. We intend to protect our domain experts as much as possible during this period. Moving to Slide 16, overview of cost actions. In early April, we announced several actions to address the current and anticipated business conditions as a result of the pandemic. I won\u2019t go through all of these, but will point out that all these actions are expected to yield over $150 million of savings for fiscal 2020. As the salary reductions take effect May 1, we expect most of the savings to be realized in our fourth quarter. We have identified additional cost actions to implement, if business conditions require or to reallocate resources through our highest priorities. Finally, note that well, our overall cost structure is coming down. We have maintained and in some cases are selectively increasing investments in some of our highest priority areas in order to increase differentiation and create long term value for customers and shareholders. This takes us to Slide 17. This slide presents an overview of the business conditions we saw in China and Italy, two of our larger end markets which were impacted by COVID-19 before other geographies. Note that the China and Italy charts provide an overview of the year-over-year growth in order intake for our product businesses only. Products are two-thirds of our business and represent our shorter cycle book-and-bill business. As you can see, the impact in China was severe in January and February, followed by a very strong V-shaped recovery in March. That has continued in April through Friday of last week. In Italy, we saw year-over-year product orders growth through January, followed by a weak February and March. Order intake in Italy remains weak in April, but it\u2019s up about 10% sequentially, when compared to March order rates. Using our product order trends in China and Italy as leading indicators, we expect most of our other geographies to be down significantly in the third quarter and expect a more gradual recovery starting late in the third quarter into our fourth quarter. Directionally, we expect solutions and services to also follow this trend. Moving to the right side of the slide, this represents our total company sales including solutions and service. Our guidance midpoint assumes that Q3 overall company organic sales will be down about 20% year-over-year, followed by a sequential improvement in our fourth quarter, which we estimate to be up about 10% sequentially, but still down over 10% compared to last year. Let\u2019s move on to Slide 18, guidance. Incorporating the expected revenue contributions from ASEM and Kalypso as well as updated currency forecasts, we now expect full year fiscal 2020 reported sales of about $6.35 billion and project organic sales to be down between 9.5% and 6.5% compared to last year. Segment margin is expected to be in a range of 18.5% to 19.5% compared to 20.5% \u2013 21.5% prior guidance, mostly as a result of lower volumes, partially offset by our cost actions. The lower adjusted effective tax rate mainly reflects some of the discrete benefits we recorded in the second quarter. Slide 19 represents the full year fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS bridge, midpoint of January guidance to midpoint of April guidance. Core performance includes the large unfavorable impact of volume and mix as well as some of the inefficiencies in our supply chain, operations and solutions and services I referred to. These are partially offset by our cost reduction actions, including lower incentive compensation. A headwind from currency and acquisitions is mostly offset by the lower tax rate. On a year-over-year basis, our guidance at the midpoint assumes full year core earnings conversion, which excludes the impact of currency and acquisitions of a little over 35%. We expect a particularly challenging third quarter. This is the quarter during which we expect our sales to trough with the weakest performance in our higher margin product businesses, and we won\u2019t have the full run rate savings of all the actions we implemented. We expect third quarter adjusted EPS to be a little over $1 per share. A few additional comments. General corporate net is now expected to be closer to $95 million. Purchase accounting amortization expense for the full year is expected to be about $45 million, up $30 million compared to last year. Net interest expense for fiscal 2020 is still expected to be about $100 million. We expect non-controlling interest now to be about neutral, given lower expected sales and earnings at Sensia. Average fully diluted share count is now expected to be $160 million for fiscal 2020. With respect to repurchases, we are currently in the market but are monitoring business conditions closely to inform the level of repurchases going forward. Finally, we expect continued strong free cash flow performance with free cash flow conversion over 100% of adjusted income as we liquidate working capital, particularly in the fourth quarter. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to you, Blake, for some closing remarks before Q&A. Blake Moret : Thanks, Patrick. We\u2019re managing our costs and protecting our balance sheet against the current reality of unprecedented volatility, but we\u2019re also considering long-lasting changes that are being accelerated by the pandemic. We remain optimistic about a world that learns to reduce the human toll from COVID-19 and about Rockwell\u2019s role in increasing business resilience. Here are some thoughts about that future, starting with the industries that we think will be especially important. It\u2019s clear that countries like the U.S. want to increase local manufacturing capability for medicines and medical devices, and we continue to grow share and capabilities in life sciences. I\u2019ve spoken earlier about some of the ways we\u2019re helping pharmaceutical and medical device companies scale up the production of critically needed products during this crisis. Packaged food and beverages are critically important when going out is not an option. Rockwell\u2019s Food & Beverage business is roughly 70% retail for grocery stores and home delivery and 30% food service or restaurants. End users as well as machine builders depend on Rockwell for the speed, flexibility and support that we can provide. Electric vehicles are going to continue to increase their share. Our Q2 growth in auto had a significant EV and battery component. And while we expect a tough road for the auto industry over the next few quarters, our investments in motion technology and software for these applications will continue to bear fruit. The Oil & Gas industry is going to be focused on lower cost production, not CapEx-driven capacity. Our focus on new technology that lowers ongoing production costs from existing assets will be most important for operators for the foreseeable future. Innovation will be necessary to lower the breakeven point for a barrel of oil. With respect to manufacturing footprint, we expect companies to reduce single points of failure in their supply chain and plant capacity. We are increasing the resilience of our own worldwide system, and we know our customers have plans to do the same. We are already seeing some manufacturers\u2019 plans to return manufacturing to North America where we have higher share. Remote support of operations will be important across many industries. To provide expertise virtually when being physically on-site is impossible. We\u2019re already doing this for hundreds of companies. To ensure the highest quality and safety of products, product traceability is becoming more important, which is an application we know very well from our life sciences experience. Flexibility is one of the biggest benefits of automation. Rapidly ramping up output, designing lines to run multiple products and changing packaging to meet evolving demand is likely to be even more important in the future. Software that simulates throughput under different conditions and optimizes production is a part of this flexibility, and we have a strong and growing offering in this area. Finally, we\u2019re seeing diverse companies come together to solve tough problems quicker than we ever thought possible. This is about the power of partnerships and the humility to recognize that no one company can do it all. Partnering is a fundamental part of our culture. For all of these reasons, we believe we are well positioned for a bright future. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jessica to start Q&A. Jessica Kourakos : Thanks, Blake. Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Sharon, let\u2019s take our first question. Operator : First question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Good morning, guys. So just on all these cost actions, how much of this flows into 2021? Patrick Goris : Steve, Patrick here. It will depend on when we undo some of those temporary actions, and that will depend on the business conditions. So the answer is it depends on when business conditions improve and when we feel comfortable undoing some of these temporary actions. Steve Tusa : Do any of the saves carry over into 2021? Like is there another step-up? I mean the incentive comp seems like it\u2019s kind of an annual thing. I would assume you\u2019re now down to kind of zero on that. I guess I don\u2019t see any real structural kind of change in the cost base. So I\u2019m just wondering, is there any \u2013 are there any incremental savings if revenues don\u2019t come back? Patrick Goris : Yes. So obviously, we have taken some structural actions in September, which are yielding savings this year. We implemented temporary, not permanent, cost reductions at this time because we think it\u2019s a temporary, not a permanent event. I want to protect our development programs in our R&D. Now also those temporary actions enabled us to have a quick cost impact with no cash cost to implement. And as I mentioned, we have identified additional, including structural cost actions, that we can implement if business conditions require or to reallocate resources to our highest priorities. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then just on the fourth quarter, obviously, you guys are conservative, so the $1, we\u2019ll take with a grain of salt, but still kind of a bounce back from even a number that\u2019s close to $1 in 4Q. Is that based on kind of backlog visibility? Front log? What\u2019s kind of \u2013 what gives you the confidence of that kind of bounce back in fourth quarter? Patrick Goris : Yes. So the $1, Steve, that was for the third quarter that I mentioned, a little over $1. So the fourth quarter, we expect sequential improvement just because \u2013 and given also what we\u2019ve seen in geographies like in China and in Italy, we\u2019ve seen a deep, call it, pullback, followed by a gradual improvement. And that is our 10% sequential improvement in the fourth quarter, which we expect to be broad-based, but with the exception of Oil & Gas where we\u2019re not projecting an improvement. Blake Moret : Yes. And if I can add to that as well. Steve, we did build backlog both year-over-year and sequentially in the quarter. And we have seen project delays, as Patrick mentioned, but we haven\u2019t seen cancellations. So we still do see people in certain of the industries that we talked about continuing with plans, and that\u2019s separate from the current rush to increase capacity in some of the essential products, and we\u2019ve certainly seen additional business in those areas. Steve Tusa : Great, all right, guys. Thanks a lot, I appreciate it. Operator : Next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Good morning. Maybe just wanted to drill in firstly on that second half, the decremental margins look very severe in that second half, maybe 50%, 60% or so year-on-year. Maybe just help us understand the phasing, first half to second half, of the $100 million or so of investment spend and also of the $150 million plus of savings. And any color you could give, like how much of an impact from mix are you dialing in and from those supply chain inefficiencies? Patrick Goris : Yes. Julian, if you look at our earnings conversion for the full year, and I call it core convergence, so I exclude the impact of acquisitions, which have a significant impact, and currency, for the full year, earnings conversion is a little over 35% on 8% revenue \u2013 organic revenue drop at the midpoint. For the second half, again, adjusting for the impact of currency and acquisitions, our conversion is a little bit below 40%. Julian Mitchell : I see. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And what\u2019s the phasing of that investment spend, Patrick, that $100 million or so? If you could split that at all, first half, second half or something. Patrick Goris : Julian, you\u2019re referring to the temporary actions? Julian Mitchell : Yes, the temporary actions. And also, I think you talked about some \u2013 you\u2019d lowered the investment spending, step-up assumption for the year. So just wondered how that spending delta shifts at all first half or second half. Patrick Goris : Got it. So the temporary actions will have a bigger impact in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter just because of the timing of our pay cuts. So that\u2019s one. If I look specifically in our January guidance, we had said investment spending would be up about 2% year-over-year. That\u2019s about $40 million. Currently, we expect that to be down 3% for the full year, and so that\u2019s a $100 million swing versus our January guidance. We think that Q3, Q4 will be down about 6%, 7% each compared to the prior year in terms of spend. And in dollar terms, it would be a little bit more in Q4 than in Q3. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. A couple just to further clarify on the cost actions. Patrick, fully understand the earlier comment about the decision on 2021 will come at a later point in time. But if we look at these actions that you\u2019re taking that do yield $150 million plus in 2020, what is the annualized run rate of those actions? Again, you may not continue them for a full year, but what is the annualized run rate of those actions you\u2019ve taken? Patrick Goris : Yes. So the run rate of these actions, if I look at the bonus, we cannot count on that after this year, but the full run rate of the pay cuts is north of $100 million. And so we get less than half of that this year. And so there is another \u2013 that is another over $50 million call of an annualized impact if we continue that into next year. But as I said, it will depend on business conditions, whether we do so. Jeff Sprague : Correct. And just on the incentive compensation, just to be clear, in Q2, we have not only the absence of an accrual, but we have the reversal of the Q1 accrual. And then I\u2019m just wondering, in the second half, what is the comparison? So we\u2019ll have zero accrual in the second half of 2020 versus what actually fell in the second half of 2019? Patrick Goris : Yes. So in the \u2013 for the balance of the year, we will have a $30 million decrease in bonus expense that will mostly fall in Q4. Jeff Sprague : Okay, all right. Thank you very much. Best of luck. Operator : Next question comes from John Inch with Gordon Haskett. John Inch : Good morning, everybody. Guys, you mentioned project delays. But like you said, there are no cancellations. I\u2019m wondering if you could give us a little more color on what verticals or areas of the world you\u2019re seeing these delays, if they\u2019ve been picking up sort of through April. And I know, Patrick, you had also talked about \u2013 you put China and Italy into a context \u2013 or certainly, you put China into a context of a V-shaped recovery, but your overall commentary seems to be anticipating something more of a gradual recovery. So I\u2019m curious if you could juxtapose those two, that two commentary, do you think China, is this something of an anomaly, it rebounds much more quickly versus rest of world? Or can rest of world actually pick up steam based on everything you\u2019re seeing, backlog and all that sort of stuff? Blake Moret : Yes. John, so with respect to project delays, I don\u2019t think we saw any acceleration through April. But think of final acceptance tests where it requires \u2013 it might require some visitation. Those are the types of things in projects that are causing delays because people just either can\u2019t get to the factory to take a look at the system before they take delivery or on-site for the commissioning that Patrick talked about. So those are the types of things that characterize delays. Oil & Gas would certainly see some of those because those are often coordinated type systems. In terms of the modeling for the recovery, we mentioned some of the inputs that we looked at. We looked at China, which was a strong shape recovery. We looked at Italy, which was a little bit more gradual. And consumer demand for our customers\u2019 end products will be something that we\u2019ll be looking at closely. But we thought taking something between the two would make sense, and so that\u2019s what we\u2019ve incorporated in our guidance. We\u2019re watching orders daily to see the development around the world and in different industries. John Inch : So that makes sense. I guess in terms of \u2013 just in terms of the environment, like is this comparable to 2008, 2009? Or is there something that\u2019s very different? Is there something that\u2019s very different about it? And also, I mean are you expecting Oil & Gas to cancel? I mean, oil prices are pretty darn low. Like I realize that you guys are about OpEx and it really \u2013 it\u2019s about productivity and so forth. But how are you thinking about that vertical? It\u2019s one of your largest and presumably most profitable. Blake Moret : Yes. So a couple of things. So first of all, with respect to comparisons with 2008, 2009, I think there was more of a structural element to 2008, 2009 with respect to finance infrastructure. We really continue to look at this as an event-driven activity. Now based on the duration, some other things could come into play, but we really do characterize this as something of a different beast than 2008, 2009. In terms of Oil & Gas, we have significant backlog in Oil & Gas. Process safety represents some of the stronger recent order activity, and process safety is going to tend to hold up through this type of event. Our assumptions for oil prices are up to, but not above, $30 a barrel for WTI, for West Texas Intermediate. So we\u2019re not expecting or pricing in some major recovery in terms of oil prices as the basis for our guidance. John Inch : That\u2019s very helpful. If I could just ask one more. I think there\u2019s a not insignificant risk that the U.S. could enter a partial or full-on cold war with China, especially if it becomes apparent the Chinese manufactured and released the coronavirus. And I\u2019m just wondering, you obviously took these supply chain actions, like is that enough? Like how are you thinking about your China operations strategically? So you mentioned reshoring in the U.S. That\u2019s going to benefit Rockwell. Do you potentially need to step up some of the work around China actions? Or are there other things that you think you could perhaps be doing or are thinking about? Blake Moret : Yes. I think the key point to think about is what I mentioned earlier, and that is reducing single points of failure in our supply chain. So whereas people have been looking at their supply chain for a while now as costs and what were previously lower-cost areas are rising and then with the trade war putting further stress on that, I think this event is going to cause people to make some changes in their supply chain. We\u2019re considering changes to add resilience to our operations. And when we\u2019re thinking about it, I\u2019m sure there are hundreds of our customers who are thinking the same thing. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they\u2019re going to bring it all back to the U.S. But the concept of being local to their most important markets and to have more than one place where you\u2019re manufacturing your high-value products, we think a lot of manufacturers are going to follow that path coming out of this. John Inch : Yes, I agree. And it just doesn\u2019t make sense to have all our pharmaceuticals manufactured in China. Thanks very much, guys, appreciate it. Blake Moret : Thanks, John. Operator : Next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Josh Pokrzywinski : Good morning, everybody. Blake Moret : Good morning. Josh Pokrzywinski : Just to kind of follow on that last question. I guess, Blake, you mentioned already seeing some input from customers on regionalized manufacturing or reshoring. What kind of specific industries, I guess, maybe outside of pharmaceuticals have you had those discussions on? It seems awfully early. I get maybe someone wants to kick the tires or at least kind of formulate a plan. But any specific verticals that you\u2019re starting to see an uptake on that discussion on? Blake Moret : Yes. So you mentioned pharmaceuticals, medical devices. There are certainly actions that have been dramatically accelerated through this current crisis, other consumer products. So Stanley Black & Decker has talked about bringing closer to their North American markets some of their manufacturing operations. So that would be another example. But I think getting closer to our customers and consumer markets would be a common theme. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just we\u2019ve heard from some other folks that there was a good amount of kind of pull forward and some isolated pushout, but in general, a lot of order shifting, I guess, in March as folks decided what they wanted to do. Did you see any kind of pull forward into the quarter as folks anticipated either trouble in getting products or imminent shutdowns such that they wanted to finish something up before they were done? I think in the long run, this is all a timing noise thing, but just trying to level set, if anything got pulled into the quarter. Blake Moret : Yes. We looked at that, and we really didn\u2019t see meaningful pull-ins in the quarter. So we looked at our distributor inventories, which we work closely with distribution on, and there was nothing unusual going on there. And then with respect to automotives, some of the projects that contributed to our strong growth in the quarter included battery-making equipment in Asia, which is an ongoing series of successes that we\u2019ve talked about in previous quarters. We also had line of sight to some more traditional projects by brand owners in internal combustion engines. These are projects that we\u2019ve been tracking for well over a year now. And then some activity additionally in auto from some of the tier suppliers in Europe, especially in Eastern Europe. And so we\u2019ve seen these projects. We\u2019ve been tracking them for a while, and we really haven\u2019t seen a distinctive trend that contributed to our strong Q2 results. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And I appreciate all the color this morning, especially some of your other peers out there pull guidance. So all the detail greatly appreciated. Best of luck. Blake Moret : Yes. Thanks, Josh. And just on that note, we thought it was important to share an extra amount of information that we thought was most helpful in navigating the current environment. Josh Pokrzywinski : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Good morning, guys. Really appreciate as the addition color. Can you talk about what you\u2019ve seen in China and Italy in April. I\u2019m sorry if I missed the broader discussion on what you\u2019ve seen in the Americas and Europe more broadly. But how is that down 20% compared to what you\u2019ve seen in April across your portfolio? Patrick Goris : Yes, Nigel, Patrick here. In April, globally, and this is for both orders and ships, our product businesses are down about 20% through Friday last week. And so consistent with our projection for the third quarter, what we\u2019re seeing so far this month, and as I said, this is for products, two-thirds of our business. Nigel Coe : And would you expect April to be worse than 2Q? I mean April is when we\u2019re in the sort of the eye of the storm, if you will, of plant shutdowns. Why wouldn\u2019t we see sequential improvement in May and June? Patrick Goris : Nigel, of course, it\u2019s a difficult question. We\u2019ve seen weakness start at the end of March. I think it\u2019s too early for us to say that in April, given where we are, that we have seen a bottom of that we call a bottom. So it\u2019s unclear when we may bottom out. We do believe that, that will be sometime in Q3 in that late this quarter. Mid or late June into the fourth quarter, we will see a sequential improvement. Nigel Coe : Okay. Fair enough. And then I do want to come back to the 3Q EPS question. Again, the $1 seems like a very low bar, but the decremental margins implied by that are extremely high. So I just want to sort of ask the question a different way. Is there anything we should need to think about in terms of mix or cost pressures or M&A dilution, FX dilution, FX hedges, et cetera, in terms of right setting 3Q EPS? Patrick Goris : Yes. So specific to Q3, organic sales down about 20%. That represents well over $300 million of revenue, which is weighted towards our product businesses, which, as you know, carry higher margins. We\u2019re not getting the full run rate of our cost actions given the timing of the pay cuts. And so we expect Q3 to be the trough. So Q3, excluding the impact of acquisitions and currency, we expect our decrementals to be close to about 50% for that quarter because of the reasons I mentioned. Nigel Coe : Okay. Thanks Patrick. Patrick Goris : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stephens. Robert McCarthy : Hello, everybody. Yes, I guess a couple of questions. And thank you for taking towards the end of the call. I guess kind of the first question, maybe just update us on PTC and the relationship there, in terms of what\u2019s going on, progress? And do you anticipate we\u2019ll have a virtual Liveworks this year? And kind of what are the \u2013 what\u2019s the agenda, particularly in this environment, to drive growth from that collaboration? Blake Moret : Yes. Rob, we\u2019re still very happy with the partnership with PTC. We continue to see orders in the quarter, both on top of our control platforms and also at competitive strongholds where the expanded scope of those offerings and software and augmented reality are winning us new business that we would not have otherwise won. The Liveworks or ROKLive activity will be virtual. I\u2019ll be participating in that. We\u2019ll be talking about new products that we\u2019re working on. And so the partnership remains vibrant even under these conditions, and we continue to strengthen it. Robert McCarthy : That\u2019s helpful. And obviously, congratulations on a solid quarter and a constructive guide in providing all the detail. Now that being said, we have seen the market rally pretty significantly here. And at least passively, there seems to be some expectation of what looks like an interruption and then perhaps a U shape or V recovery. But as Anthony Fauci always says, the virus gets to make the call. So if we go into a bit of a double here in terms of the virus comes back, and you\u2019re seeing companies cut CapEx across the board by 20% to 30%, and there\u2019s not a reason to believe we have creeping uncertainty until there\u2019s a vaccine in 16 to 18 months, that you couldn\u2019t have a continued tough business CapEx and fixture environment, which is not good for you despite some of these interesting secular trends for near shoring. How do you think \u2013 how you address that environment? And back to some of the questions around structural cost, what are some of the actions you could take to take some more structural cost out of the business? Blake Moret : Yes. Rob, we\u2019re looking closely at that. We\u2019re modeling different views of the recovery, both in terms of shape of the recovery as well as timing, depth and duration, all of those things. And we have plans that are appropriate to those that go into deeper structural reductions if necessary. And so we watch that. We\u2019ve taken those actions in the past, and we\u2019ll take them now if we feel like that\u2019s the appropriate response as the crisis unfolds. Robert McCarthy : Well, we\u2019re coming against the market open. And from that standpoint, I think a lot of guys have to write up or cover their ass, upgrade notes to neutral. So with that, I\u2019ll let you go. Blake Moret : Okay. Thank you, Rob. Jessica Kourakos : Thanks, operator. We can take one more question. Operator : We have a question from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Thanks for squeezing me at the end here. And I guess the real $10,000 question, Blake, is you talked about a lot of action that manufacturers of all types are going to be taking to improve their business resiliency really as a direct response to this crisis. And in the past, you\u2019ve talked about, even at your Investor Day, talked about being able to grow at a multiple of IP and increasing that. Should we be thinking and is it your view that coming out of this, the nature of the industrial recovery is such that your multiple could even expand as manufacturers take actions that play into your wheelhouse? Blake Moret : We\u2019re optimistic, Noah, about our ability to play an even more important role for customers as we go forward. And I\u2019ve given some insight as to the industries and some of the trends that we think we\u2019re well positioned to partner with those customers on. And we\u2019re going to be working hard in those areas, as Patrick mentioned, in some cases even investing in the areas of highest value. And we prefer to win in those opportunities, see the growth, and then we\u2019ll talk about the resulting multiples. But our intention is to make it happen. Noah Kaye : I appreciate that. Thanks very much for taking the question. Blake Moret : Thanks, Noah. Jessica Kourakos : Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you all for joining us. Really appreciate your support. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference call. At this time, you may disconnect. Thank you.",

[Operator Instructions] I would like to turn the call over to Jessica Kourakos, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Kourakos, please go ahead. Jessica Kourakos : Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation\u2019s Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Patrick Goris, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include and our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at the website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today\u2019s call. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings. So with that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks, Jessica, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Before we begin discussing our results and outlook, I\u2019d like to make just a few opening remarks. While we, as a company, are managing well in this environment, we are highly sensitive to the toll this is taking on our employees during this time. Beyond the fear of a loved one getting sick, racial injustice is on our minds as we develop actions as a company, and as individuals, that will help put a permanent end to the denial of fundamental human rights. Additionally, thousands of our employees continue to work under very difficult conditions, including the temporary pay cuts we implemented in May. These pay cuts were necessary to better align our costs to current business conditions while preserving jobs, but there is a limit to how long they can remain in place. I hope we would be in a position to announce a firm end-date to the temporary pay reductions by now, since our goal has always been to reverse them as soon as possible. However, business conditions remain weak and the recent surge of COVID-19 infections has worried all of us, and nobody can predict with accuracy when a combination of social distancing practices, therapeutic medicines, and eventual vaccines will turn the tide. We do intend to reverse the temporary pay reductions by the end of December and hopefully sooner. In addition, this quarter we will make another special payment to our manufacturing associates worldwide, who are on the front lines of maintaining our essential operations. There are many reasons to be optimistic, and I am immensely proud of all of our employees and the great work they are doing. Our Environmental, Health, and Safety team is working around the clock to keep employees safe, and our technology is crucial to projects that are increasing mask and respirator production to far higher levels than four months ago. Candidate therapeutics and vaccines are being produced and packaged with the help of our innovation and expertise around the world. In short, our employees are having a direct impact on protecting the health of millions of people around the world, and I want to thank them all for their dedication. Turning now to our results on Slide 3. While business conditions remain difficult, and results in Q3 were down year-over-year, earnings were higher than we expected for the quarter, primarily driven by better organic sales. Total sales declined by 16% versus the prior year, including a three-point contribution from inorganic investments. Organic sales were down about 17.5%, and better than the 20% decline we were expecting heading into the quarter. Product sales outperformed our expectations, and were driven by better performance in Logix, Motion and Network and Security Infrastructure. We also had a number of new strategic wins in process applications against major process competitors. These wins spanned several industries this quarter, including Life Sciences, Food & Beverage and Oil & Gas. One of the more notable wins was with Companhia Cacique de Caf\u00e9 Soluvel, the largest exporter of instant coffee in Brazil and one of the largest in the world. They are building a new, technologically advanced coffee plant to expand production capacity. This was a highly competitive greenfield win, and we beat our biggest competitors based on our technology and track record with the customer. This win includes a broad suite of Rockwell technology : FactoryTalk Innovation Suite software, drives, Connected Services, as well as newly-released process control technology within Logix that enhances our differentiation against traditional DCS systems. Turning to Information Solutions and Connected Services. Sales were down slightly, partly due to travel restrictions and limited access to customer sites. However, IS/CS orders grew double digits over the prior year and showed strong growth in both software as well as connected services. Turning now to earnings. Adjusted EPS was $1.27, and our strong cash flow performance further reinforces our already-strong balance sheet and liquidity position. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 4, where I will provide a few highlights of our Q3 organic end-market performance. Our Discrete market segment declined approximately 20% with Automotive performing better than we projected in April, based on the factory closures at that time. Semiconductor saw positive growth in the quarter, up mid-single digits, and continues to benefit from secular tailwinds in 5G, datacenters, and the Internet of Things. We also see ecommerce as an important emerging driver of our discrete business, due to the excellent fit of our technology with fulfillment center applications. Our Hybrid market segment declined about 10% with Food & Beverage and Life Sciences performing in line with our expectations. Food & Beverage customers continued to experience extremely high demand and as a result, we are helping them focus their resources on maximizing production. These customers continue to show strong interest in digital transformation solutions that will improve their resiliency and flexibility. Although timing around these projects has been delayed as a result of the pandemic, we would expect Food & Beverage to begin to improve over the coming months. One meaningful indicator for the Food & Beverage vertical continues to come from Packaging OEMs, which showed positive growth in the quarter. Turning to Life Sciences. We continue to expect Life Sciences to have a strong finish to the year, due to the industry\u2019s strong focus on digital transformation, as well as our involvement with the leading companies making significant investments in COVID-related vaccines and treatments. Process markets were down approximately 25% with Oil & Gas a little weaker. In general, process markets are more solutions-based and require more hands-on interaction, both at the front-end of a new project as well as at the back-end for final commissioning and delivery. We saw physical restrictions and continuing lack of access to plants due to COVID having a more significant impact on these industries. Turning now to Slide 5, and our organic regional sales performance in the quarter. North America declined by 20% with weaker process industries partly offset by better resiliency in discrete and hybrid industry segments. In this region, product sales performed better than our solutions and services. EMEA sales outperformed our expectations and benefited from PPE production and double-digit growth in Information Solutions and Connected Services. Asia Pacific sales declined 10% with year-over-year positive growth in Automotive and Semiconductor. China sales declined mid-single digits, but saw orders return to positive growth in the quarter. Broad-based Latin America declines were led by very weak Automotive performance. Turning now to our outlook on Slide 6. Last quarter, we forecasted that our fiscal third quarter sales would be down approximately 20% followed by sequential improvement in the fourth quarter. We came in slightly better than that in Q3, and our mix of product was also more favorable. However, the rate of recovery in our solutions and services business is slower than we anticipated, due to the continued restricted movement of people. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic, and global efforts to respond to it, are rapidly evolving. Our projections assume that a gradual recovery continues, with no increase in pandemic-related facility closures or disruptions to the supply chain. Based on all the information we have available at this time, we expect organic sales to decline approximately 8% for the fiscal year. No change from our prior full year guidance midpoint. We expect inorganic investments to contribute about four points of growth to the year, and adjusted EPS to reach $7.50 at the midpoint. That\u2019s up from the guidance midpoint of $7.30 we set in April. We continue to target free cash flow conversion at over 100%. With that, let me now turn it over to Patrick who will elaborate on our third quarter financial performance and fiscal 2020 outlook in his remarks. Patrick? Patrick Goris : Thank you, Blake, and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll start on Slide 8, third quarter key financial information. For the third quarter, organic sales were down 17.6% compared to last year, and acquisitions contributed just over 3% to total growth. Currency translation was a larger headwind than expected due to a stronger U.S. dollar, and decreased sales by 1.9 points. Orders performed better than sales, and were down mid-teens year-over-year. Overall, company backlog increased year-over-year for the quarter. Segment operating margin was 16.5%, down 730 basis points compared to last year\u2019s record high, primarily due to lower sales. General corporate net expense is up slightly compared to last year, mainly as a result of unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments related to our deferred and non-qualified compensation plans. Adjusted EPS of $1.27 was better than expected. During April\u2019s call, I mentioned that we expected adjusted EPS to be a bit over $1, based on an organic sales decline of about 20%. Organic sales performance at minus 17.6% was better than expected, as was product mix, and discrete tax items were about a $0.05 benefit to our results in the quarter. Our results include about $15 million or $0.10 of adjusted EPS of restructuring charges, which are offset by a gain on an asset sale. From an operating earnings perspective, both items are evenly split between the two segments. On the statement of operations on page ten of our press release, the gain on sale is included in other income and the restructuring charges are included in SG&A. You will note that SG&A is up about $9 million year-over-year, reflecting not only the restructuring charges, but also the incremental SG&A from acquisitions made this fiscal year. The combined impact of these two items is a year-over-year increase of over $30 million in SG&A expense. I\u2019ll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter of 13.5% was lower than we expected, due to a benefit from option exercises. Free cash flow in the quarter of $311 million was a strong result in this environment, with over 200% conversion on adjusted income \u2013 further enhancing our liquidity. Slide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our operating segments. I will just point out that the main driver of segment margin reduction is lower sales. The book-to-bill for our solutions and services businesses was 1.05 for Q3, with continued project delays impacting these businesses rather than project cancellations. The next slide, 10, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q3 fiscal 2019 to Q3 fiscal 2020. As you can see, core performance was down significantly on the large organic revenue decline in the quarter. Our temporary cost reduction actions, and a lower tax rate, partially mitigated the impact of the large sales decline. The restructuring charge and the gain on the asset sale pretty much offset each other. The Adjusted EPS impact of acquisitions was about $0.05 dilutive, including intangible amortization. Core earnings conversion in the quarter, that is, excluding the effects of acquisitions and currency, was about 50% roughly in line with the outlook comments that I shared with you in April. Before I move on, I want to mention that we continue to be in a strong position regarding our capital structure and liquidity. At June 30, cash on the balance sheet was over $900 million, and our total debt was about $2.4 billion. You can find a current update of our balance sheet and liquidity slide in the appendix. Moving to slide 11, product order trends. This slide shows our global daily order trends for our product businesses. Our product businesses represent about two-thirds of our overall sales, and include our shorter-cycle, book and bill businesses. Within the quarter, daily product orders troughed in April followed by sequential improvement in May, June, and continuing into July through Friday of last week. Our updated guidance assumes this improving trend continues at a gradual pace. Moving to slide 12. I\u2019ll provide a brief update on a few things that we discussed on our last earnings call with respect to COVID-19. Our first priority remains employee and customer safety. Access to customer sites improved throughout the third quarter, but remains a challenge for our solutions and services businesses. This affects not only our utilization rates and creates associated inefficiencies, but also project timing. We continue to experience project delays in our solutions and services businesses, and the rate of improvement is slower than we expected in April. We are however not seeing a pickup in cancellations, just project pushouts. Regarding our own manufacturing operations and supply chain, our plants continue to be operational and meet current demand. Supply disruptions have generally been mitigated, but we continue to incur higher freight costs and inefficiencies in our operations as we focus on the safety and well-being of our employees. During the quarter, we approved incremental investments to increase the resiliency of our supply chain and operations. For example, we\u2019re in the process of making investments to provide us more flexibility to produce products in multiple locations around the world. This includes capital investments in some of our U.S. facilities. Finally, the temporary cost actions we implemented during Q3 remain in place. The temporary cost actions and absence of a bonus earned are tailwinds for us in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. As these items are reversed, they will present a headwind for fiscal 2021. We intend to neutralize that headwind through the structural cost actions we have taken this year, additional cost savings identified, and by maintaining lower levels of discretionary spending. Let\u2019s move on to the next slide, 13, Updated Guidance. We now expect full year fiscal 2020 reported sales to be down approximately 5.5%. We continue to project organic sales to be down about 8% compared to last year. Segment margin is still expected to be about 19.5%. The lower adjusted effective tax rate mainly reflects the discrete items we benefited from in the third quarter. Our updated adjusted EPS guidance range is $7.40 to $7.60. At the midpoint, this is $0.20 higher than prior guidance, reflecting our third quarter performance and a lower tax rate for the full year. On a year-over-year basis, our guidance at the midpoint assumes full-year core earnings conversion, which excludes the impacts of currency and acquisitions, of about 35%. General corporate net is still expected to be about $95 million. Purchase accounting amortization expense for the full year is expected to be about $40 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2020 is still expected to amount to about $100 million. We expect non-controlling-interest to be slightly positive, given lower earnings at Sensia. We expect continued strong free cash flow performance, with free cash conversion of over 100% of adjusted income. Finally, with respect to repurchases, we spent about $50 million in the third quarter. Our guidance does not assume any additional share repurchases for the remainder of fiscal 2020. Average fully diluted share count is now expected to be 116.6 million for fiscal 2020. Our capital deployment priorities remain the same. Our first priority is organic growth. After that, we focus capital deployment on inorganic activities. Then, we focus on capital returns to shareowners, through our dividend and then share repurchases. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you Blake to for some additional remarks before we start Q&A. Blake Moret : Thanks, Patrick. Let\u2019s turn now to slide 14. While the pandemic has disrupted our normal course of business in the short-term, we believe it is also accelerating the need for industrial automation and digital transformation solutions that address manufacturing safety, as well as operational flexibility and resiliency. To better align us with the evolving needs of our customers, we are very excited to announce our three new operating segments, simplifying our structure around essential offerings, leveraging our sharpened industry focus, and adding software talent, which will play a larger role in our future value. This is the next step toward accelerating the profitable growth strategy that we discussed last year at Investor Day. It is also no coincidence that these operating segments map very closely to how our customers think about technology. If you recall, this is a similar technology stack to the one we reviewed at Investor Day last November. To begin with, the products included in our Intelligent Devices segment are every bit as important as they have always been. Intelligent Devices are the inputs and outputs for industrial processes, and they are also where the data is born. Moving up, control is at the heart of automation, and customers continue to demand high reliability and safety in their processes. We also see the growing role software can play to increase flexibility and insight across global customer operations. We\u2019re focusing on these crucial, integrated capabilities, and adding additional talent in our new software and control segment. And finally, the domain expertise provided by our lifecycle services ensures the positive business outcomes that give our customers a faster return on their automation investment. The three segments will continue to share a common sales organization and supply chain. Having a single sales force, knowledgeable in their customer\u2019s applications, simplifies the way customers interact with us. This is just one way in which simplification delivers efficiencies for both us and our customers. Our leadership will continue to blend experienced Rockwell leaders with fresh perspectives. Fran Wlodarczyk will lead the Intelligent Devices segment; Frank Kulaszewicz will lead the Lifecycle Services segment, and we will begin an external search for the leader of Software & Control. In the interim, Chris Nardecchia, our current Senior Vice President of Information Technology and Chief Information Officer, will serve as the leader for that segment. In addition, to accelerate the evolution of our culture, Becky House has become Chief Administrative and Legal Officer, which includes leadership of our talent, legal, ethics and compliance, and Environmental, Health & Safety teams. Our culture is the foundation for accelerated growth under this new structure. It reflects a willingness to compare ourselves to the best alternatives our stakeholders have; a focus on increasing the speed of decision-making; ensuring we have a steady stream of fresh ideas; and, of course, our strong culture of integrity and inclusion. A more detailed view of what is included in each segment can be found on slide 15. Turning to slide 16. These segments create clear focus for each of these essential offerings, and they all have plenty of room to gain share and profitably accelerate our growth in expanding markets. This new structure positions us well to deliver value to customers in what is being called the new normal. Turning to slide 17, I\u2019ll make some additional comments on the secular changes we\u2019re seeing in our market. As you may recall, last quarter, we talked about the increasing need for customers to build resiliency and flexibility in their operations and supply chains. That includes the need for life sciences companies to increase their local manufacturing capability for medicines and medical devices in the U.S.; and the need for innovative technologies to drive higher levels of productivity, flexibility, sustainability, traceability, and safety. In the last three months, we have seen examples of all of these trends. Many life sciences companies recently announced they are in the process of expanding their North American manufacturing footprints and supply chains, and other companies in discrete industries are planning to do the same. In the quarter, we also won business with Johnson & Johnson to deliver technology for their new Universal Machine, which represents the epitome of flexible manufacturing. The Universal Machine is a collaborative, mobile robot that will be deployed in response to the COVID-19 crisis, and can be repurposed to do machine loading and unloading, end of line packaging and inspection activities, or warehouse material handling activities where social distancing is needed. We think many companies will be interested in adding this type of flexible automation technology to their manufacturing environments in the future. And evidence continues to build for the need for more remote capabilities. In the quarter, we had a key win in EMEA with a major oil company that is making investments in Sensia technology to significantly increase their remote monitoring capabilities. In addition to our remote monitoring capabilities, the value of our augmented reality offering with PTC is very compelling to customers as they increasingly look for alternative ways to operate their plants efficiently and safely, and to re-skill their workers as quickly as possible. These trends are unfolding now, and as you can see from many of the offerings on this slide, we are well aligned to customers\u2019 needs as they manage through this new normal. Nobody is better positioned to bring information technology and industrial operational technology together than Rockwell and our partners. Our customers\u2019 efforts to increase resilience and agility have the potential to provide meaningful tailwinds for years to come. With that, let me pass the baton back to Jessica to begin the Q&A session. A - Jessica Kourakos : Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible. So, please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Lisa, let\u2019s take our first question. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Melius. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Good morning, guys. Patrick Goris : Good morning, Scott. Blake Moret : Good morning. Scott Davis : Good morning. I like these new segments. This seems simpler. But anyways, can you help us understand the margin, maybe perhaps some margin differences between the three? Patrick Goris : Yes, Scott. Good morning. Patrick, here. We\u2019re still fine-tuning this a little bit and operationalizing the changes, of course. But preliminary estimates based on fiscal 2019 results, and the numbers I\u2019m going to give you is, give or take, a few points in each the direction. Think of Intelligent Devices as being about 20%, Software & Control about 30%, and Lifecycle Service is about 15%. And so roughly, these are based on fiscal 2019, the segment margins. And I would add to that, Scott, that \u2013 and it may be very helpful for you guys is we do not intend to change our definition of segment operating earnings. Scott Davis : Super helpful, okay. And just as a follow-on, I can\u2019t remember you guys doing an external search for a operating role before. Did I hear you correctly, Blake? Blake? That you\u2019re doing to do an external search for Software & Control? Maybe some color around what you\u2019re looking for there. Blake Moret : Sure. I mean, we\u2019ve talked about our culture as involving a steady stream of new ideas. And bringing those new ideas into the organization comes from unlocking that innovation from our existing talent in the organization. It comes from acquisitions, and it comes from hiring at different levels of the organization as well. And we\u2019ve got great existing leadership in the company, but there\u2019s always good ideas that we can incorporate from the outside. And so as we launch this new segment of Software & Control, we do expect to bring those perspectives in with the leader of that segment. Scott Davis : Okay. Good luck to you, guys. Thank you. Patrick Goris : Yes. Thanks, Scott. Blake Moret : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Your line is open. John Inch : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I\u2019m wondering if we could talk about the sales or credit risks with, say, smaller oil and gas operators or EV start ups? And in that context, could you also talk about your auto industry project outlook? Patrick Goris : Yes, John. Patrick here. John Inch : Good morning. Patrick Goris : From a probably a receivable risk or credit and collection risk, we would actually say that in the last quarter overall, our overall, call it, the current receivable percent actually slightly improved. And so I\u2019d say that doesn\u2019t mean that there are some \u2013 one these twosies, where we may have some challenges. We always have that. But I\u2019d say our overall portfolio has actually improved in the last quarter. Blake Moret : Yes. I would also add to that, John. And from an EV standpoint, we watch closely. We recognize that the rush to add electric vehicle portfolios from big and small companies is new. And not all of those start-ups are going to survive. So, we manage that closely. I should also add, because so much of our business goes through distribution, we\u2019re keeping very close to our distributors during this time so that we\u2019re in constant communication to make sure that we understand what they\u2019re going through. And so that\u2019s an important part of our day-to-day operational activities, both in terms of the direct project business as well as the flow business through distribution. John Inch : All right. And then the auto industry project outlook? How are you guys thinking about that heading into sort of second half of this year and next year? The parts of EV versus traditional, whatever you like. Blake Moret : Sure. I think from an electric vehicle standpoint, a lot of these companies, whether they\u2019re big established companies that have divisions devoted to EV or they\u2019re start-ups, they have to bring a portfolio of vehicles to market to get a return on all that investment. And while those projects, in some cases, have been delayed, we\u2019ve seen very little in the way of cancellations there. And I think that\u2019s probably a general view of the automotive industry in that we did see MRO a little bit better than our expectations in the quarter. It was low, but it was better than we feared. And projects continue to move, although at a slower pace. John Inch : That\u2019s helpful. And then just lastly, could we put a frame around the restructuring and cost out actions. So I think, if we go back to last quarter, there was $150 million \u2013 I think you said the phraseology was \u201cmostly temporary.\u201d How much did you get out of the quarter? And I apologize if you said that, how much more is to come? And then I saw there were some restructuring charges. Maybe you could talk about kind of what those actions do for you in 2020 and what the setup is kind of on that basis for 2021? And obviously, are you contemplating even more restructuring or footprint realignment or stuff that could be more of a permanent nature, I think, like you did mention or maybe, Patrick, you mentioned you were going to try and offset, right, the temporary actions with other sort of measures. Maybe we could just sort of flesh that out a little bit. Thank you. Patrick Goris : Yes, John. So, in April, we mentioned that we implemented cost reductions that would yield over $150 million in year-over-year savings. That included a significant amount from temporary actions related to not having a bonus this year, but also some of the temporary pay cuts we implemented. We are achieving the savings we targeted. The temporary actions remain in place. As we undo dose temporary actions in fiscal 2021, they provide a headwind. That headwind, based on, as Blake mentioned in his comments, on doing the pay cuts at the end of the calendar year, that headwind is a little north of $130 million. We intend to neutralize that through : one, structural cost actions we\u2019ve taken in September last year with some carryover, but also the cost actions that we\u2019ve announced today. Those combined are expected to yield over $40 million of incremental savings in fiscal 2021. We\u2019ve identified additional cost savings that are a little over $50 million. And then finally, we expect to maintain lower levels of discretionary spend going forward. Maybe a little bit more color on the additional cost savings that I talked about. That includes permanent elimination of some open positions. In fiscal 2020, we have some one-time costs and inefficiencies related to the pandemic or even acquisitions, and we\u2019re in the process of reducing our real estate footprint globally. And so a lot of moving pieces there, but it is our intention to neutralize the reversal of temporary actions in fiscal 2021 through these cost actions. John Inch : Got it, very helpful. Thanks, everyone. Good luck. Patrick Goris : Thank you, John. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Patrick Goris : Hi, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Hey, maybe, just a first question on the top line point. If you could clarify what the solutions and services orders did year-on-year? Sorry, if I missed that. And also if the cadence of those incoming orders has broadly matched the slight improvement you\u2019re seeing month-on-month on the product side or whether the order intake is lagging to what you\u2019re seeing on the product improvement? Blake Moret : Yes. So, on the solutions and services, year-over-year, I would just say that our book-to-bill was 1.05 and that we built backlog in the quarter. And that our backlog is up year-over-year for our solutions and services as well. And I think that provides you some indication there. In terms of timing of orders for solutions and services, I think looking at that by week or by month is not always as helpful as it is for our flow business, our product businesses. And so I don\u2019t think that providing that by month would be very helpful. What we have seen is some project pushouts. But as more and more customers have opened up, we\u2019ve seen our services folks being called back into customer locations, and we\u2019ve seen our solutions people being able to enter some of our customer facilities as well. And so there is an improvement sequentially there. Patrick Goris : I would also add Julian, that the solutions and services orders and shipments are probably a little more subject to calendarization within the quarter to our products and that orders tend to come in later in the month and the last month of the quarter for both orders and shipments is typically stronger. So, it\u2019s a little more sensitive to which month you\u2019re in than the product flow. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. And then my second question on the margins, just wanted to clarify that the segment margin guide for the year, that does embed a narrower decremental margin in the fourth quarter than what you saw in Q3. Maybe just help us understand what drives that? And also, if you could clarify the investment spend, what that is doing in the second half of the year? Thank you. Patrick Goris : Yes. So, investment spend for the second half of the year is about down, about 6% year-over-year. Basically the same as what I shared with you last quarter. In terms of Q4 decrementals, they will be better. And so we expect our core decrementals to be in the mid-20s in Q4 and the main reason for that is that we get a bigger benefit from the temporary cost actions. We get three months rather than two months and in the fourth quarter compared to the last year, we have about a $30 million benefit as well from lower incentive compensation expense. So, higher run rate of the cost actions we have taken and also a bigger tailwind for lower incentive compensation in the fourth quarter. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Patrick Goris : Thank you, Julian. Blake Moret : Thank you, Julian. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague, your line is open. Jeff Sprague : I\u2019m sorry, good day everyone. Just a little more color if we could on kind of the trajectory here as we exited the quarter. This progression you showed on Slide 11, can you just give us some sense on June and July versus kind of prior year levels? What those order trends look like? Patrick Goris : The order transfer, they were still down significantly versus the prior year for both June and July. And so we \u2013 the worst performance year-over-year from an order perspective was in April. We\u2019ve improved sequentially since, but they\u2019re still down in the mid-teens for both June. And we\u2019re, I would say, gradually improving sequentially and as well as the year-over-year delta is becoming smaller. Jeff Sprague : You said the quarter was down mid-teens. June was also down mid-teens basically, sounds like. Could we dig a little further in the\u2026 Patrick Goris : April was the worst from a year-over-year perspective. And the subsequent months were a little bit better from a year-over-year perspective on the order intake. Jeff Sprague : All right. Thanks for that clarification. On the food and beverage side, can you elaborate a little bit more what you\u2019re seeing? We\u2019ve seen a reduction in SKUs and things like this as retailers try to push them out and more going through e-commerce and the like. It sounds like that is at least a temporary headwind on the business. How do you see that playing out? Blake Moret : Yes. A couple of things and let me just circle back, Jeff, to put a finer point on Patrick\u2019s comments. The order development that we\u2019ve seen over the last few months is consistent with that idea of a gradual recovery. So, as we look at that year-over-year and sequentially, a gradual recovery is what we continue to see through month-to-date in July. From a food and beverage standpoint, the basic issue is that these companies, given are weighting more heavily towards prepackaged food that goes to the grocery store or directly to the home, they\u2019re running full out. And so most of our efforts and theirs are devoted to maintaining production at really high levels. We\u2019re seeing a continued demand for flexibility. In this case, the food producers are moving quickly to be able to change their packaging formats to be able to meet what\u2019s being bought today. And in many cases, people who were eating at home much more than they ever have. We think that long term, the trend towards additional flexibility will only become greater. People are going to continue to want a variety of packaging formats, and we really haven\u2019t seen an overall SKU reduction across the industry. The mantra of the packaging machine OEMs driven by the end-user demand is getting to zero change over time, to go from one packaging format to the next, and we haven\u2019t seen any reduction in the focus in that area, which requires a lot of automation. Jeff Sprague : All right. Thank you for that. I\u2019ll pass for now. Blake Moret : Thank you, Jeff. Patrick Goris : Thank you, Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, guys. Blake Moret : Good morning. Patrick Goris : Good morning, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Blake, you just talked about the pandemic potentially accelerating the need for resilience and flexibility of your customers, especially in Life Sciences. Can you give us more color or at all quantify maybe what you would call the pandemic response orders you\u2019re seeing to help avoid single points of failure, increased resiliency and then stepping \u2013 do you think your primary markets can recover even in a CapEx constrained environment as customers focus on productivity through automation? Or is it really still too early to tell? Blake Moret : Well, I think our primary industries and the areas within those industries that we\u2019re putting particular focus do have good long-term growth prospects. When you talk \u2013 you mentioned Life Sciences, and people are going to continue even after we get past this current environment. People are going to want to live longer, healthier lives and so Life Sciences is going to be a continued area of focus for us. Food and beverage, for obvious reasons, they\u2019re going to continue \u2013 it\u2019s going to continue to be important. I think the trend towards electric vehicles, increasing. And even in the worst of the lockdowns, the world was still consuming 60 million or 70 million barrels of oil a day. And so the desire to produce that oil as efficiently as possible is in line with what we\u2019re doing. In terms of the quantification on our results, it\u2019s going to be varied by industry. And I\u2019ve talked before about how I think we\u2019re going to see the movement probably most pronounced in the discrete and the hybrid industries, where you\u2019re not as tied to the resource itself sitting in the ground, whether it\u2019s mining or oil and gas or what have you. So far, the orders that we\u2019ve seen that I would call are incremental come from machinery builders in Europe, comes from life sciences companies in the U.S. We\u2019ve talked a little bit about that. And so I think it\u2019s going to be gradual, but these are longer-term trends. And we also look at ourselves and what investments we\u2019re making to increase resiliency. And as Patrick said, we are making some capital investments in the U.S. to increase resiliency. In our case, it\u2019s to build some of our high-value products in more than one place. And I think when we have those ideas and a lot of our customers are thinking about it like us, then it\u2019s fair as soon that they\u2019ve got similar plans. Andy Kaplowitz : Blake, just a follow-up on that. So discrete has historically been a very cyclical part of your business, especially during recession. But it may be down only mid-single digits in FY 2020, as you talked about, despite auto markets globally being difficult. So, we know it\u2019s a combination of your technology, helping you in auto, focus on EV, semicon has held up. But do you see this level of discrete outperformance and sort of market share gains continuing or even accelerating going into 2021? Blake Moret : Well, we certainly intend to continue to gain share. I think it\u2019s not only picking the applications such as EV within the broader verticals, but it\u2019s also the mix of what we\u2019re offering as well. And we\u2019ve talked a lot about recurring revenue in terms of software and high-value services and then a maybe better balance across the industries as well. So, we talked before about how this year, automotive will be less than 10% of our business, it\u2019s very valuable. And we expect that business to grow profitably for us over time. But I like that we\u2019re serving a host of industries that have great long-term prospects. And so we do intend to gain share across a broad front. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks, Blake. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning, all. Blake Moret : Hey, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Just a first question, I guess for Patrick. I appreciate the color on kind of offsetting or neutralizing some of the push and pull on the cost front for next year. Presumably, there\u2019s a growth level which that starts to tip more toward investment. Any historical context that you could give us around, hey, once we get past mid single-digit growth, we really start to feed the machine. Or any way we should think about kind of that sensitivity of being able to restrain investment? Patrick Goris : Yes. I think the way you can think about it, Josh, is that going back to our framework of our objective to deliver mid-single digits of organic growth, 30% to 35% earnings conversion. And so the level of growth will determine how much more we intend to invest, but I can\u2019t give you a certain percent that says this will be a trigger to invest more than we otherwise would. But that long-term framework of 30% to 35% earnings conversion at mid-single digits, it\u2019s something that over a longer period of time we intend to adhere to. Blake Moret : Yes. Josh, I can add to that. Even with the restructuring that we announced, a significant portion of that frees up resource for reinvestment. It\u2019s not just about the cost savings year-over-year, but it\u2019s to focus resources well in the areas that we think are going to be particularly important and in the organizational changes. The primary purpose of that is to accelerate profitable growth. We\u2019re looking for efficiencies, and we expect we\u2019ll find some, but the primary purpose is to accelerate profitable growth. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just a follow-up. And Blake, I appreciate all the commentary on growth opportunities with near shoring. I guess another market that seeming to catch fire here is the warehouse automation market. And I know you have some content there, some exposure. It\u2019s fairly small. Is there either a product or a channel or a partner barrier there where that\u2019s not been larger? Because I think you\u2019ve seen some pretty frothy order numbers from folks in that space. It doesn\u2019t seem to have been a historical needle mover for you guys. So any commentary there on either investment or legacy barriers that have kept that from being bigger? Thanks. Blake Moret : Yes. It\u2019s a great part of the market for us. Traditionally, for a long time, we\u2019ve had a very good fit with the products when you think about the material handling and sortation. I think we\u2019ve added some products that have spurred some of the recent opportunities and wins that we\u2019ve seen. Independent cart is one area, so very high-precision motion control is needed even more than ever, the traceability that\u2019s used in their software systems. And so I don\u2019t see it as being constrained by products for the automation or channel. We\u2019re close to a lot of the key suppliers in the area. But we are, to your point, looking at ways as to how we can develop that even more because that\u2019s one of those long-term trends that we continue to expect to benefit from. Josh Pokrzywinski : Great. Thanks, Blake. Blake Moret : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Nigel Coe : Yes. Thanks, guys. Good morning. Maybe just asking Josh\u2019s question, first question in a slightly different way. You mentioned, I think, Blake, that you hope to maybe roll back some of these temporary cost measures before December. I guess, what would be the catalyst for you to do that? Do we need to see, I don\u2019t know, sales stabilizing or sales on a clear path back towards growth. I mean, what are you looking for to kind of ease back on those salary and benefit reductions? Blake Moret : Yes. I think we continue to expect a gradual recovery in orders and sales. But at the heart of it is the infection rates and to look at how the countries in which we operate in get the spread of infection under control. I think that\u2019s really the fundamental pacing item as that improves. Then we have a much more positive outlook. I would also say that, as I did say in my earlier remarks, there\u2019s a limit to how long we can keep those temporary reductions in place. And at some point, we would have to substitute more structural reductions for the pay reductions, because we can\u2019t go on past a certain amount of time with those temporary reductions affecting our entire workforce. Nigel Coe : Great. Thanks, Blake, that\u2019s great. And then the problem of given more disclosure is there\u2019s \u2013 the month that you have more disclosure. On the monthly product orders, July versus June, normally, I\u2019d expect July to be weaker than June sequentially. And obviously, July is slightly better than June. How does that look for Rockwell from a normal seasonal pattern? Would you normally see July versus June similar? Or would there be a slight step back? And I recognize that your sales are normally stronger in 4Q fiscal versus 3Q fiscal. Just wondering how normally that order pattern would look in a normal year, recognizing that there aren\u2019t too many normal years? Patrick Goris : Yes, Nigel, Patrick here. So actually for our product order intake, July tends to be somewhat similar than June historically. And so what we\u2019re seeing now is somewhat typical. On the sales side, normally, the first month after the end of the quarter is a little bit weaker than the prior. And so I would say \u2013 go ahead, Nigel? Nigel Coe : It feels like we\u2019re recoupling back to some semblance of normal seasonality into July at this point? Patrick Goris : It is still early in July, but what we\u2019ve seen so far is not untypical. And of course, our guidance assumes that we\u2019ll see continued improving trends sequentially. Nigel Coe : Okay. Thanks, Patrick. Thanks, Blake. Patrick Goris : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Your line is open. Andrew Obin, your line is open. Jessica Kourakos : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Great. Thank you. Good morning everyone. Patrick Goris : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Hey, Blake, when we caught up intra-quarter, you had referenced the life science customers and again, made reference to the fact that it seems like things are moving forward in that regard. Can you give us a sense on timing on when they\u2019ll actually make a decision to really improve \u2013 whether it\u2019s reshoring or capital investment, to basically improve their supply chain? Just any thoughts around timing around that those awards? Blake Moret : Joe, you\u2019re talking specifically about Life Sciences customers? Joe Ritchie : Yes, specifically around the Life Sciences customers. Blake Moret : Yes. I mean, we\u2019re seeing plans, particularly for those who were developing therapeutics and vaccine candidates. So we\u2019re seeing them either directly or through their contract manufacturers in the middle of plans to ramp that up now. Now that\u2019s not the entire market. But what is common across the entire life sciences market is the accelerated interest in digital transformation. They know that they\u2019re not going to be able to get to scale without the basic automation and the ability to schedule product manufacturing and so on, driven by software. So we\u2019re definitely seeing those plans increase. They\u2019ve got a little bit of the situation that food and beverage does in that many of them are already just trying to ramp up production with their existing assets. But I think we\u2019re going to see that over time. I don\u2019t expect it to be a step change, but we\u2019re definitely seeing the slope with the current increase with respect to Life Sciences customers. Joe Ritchie : That\u2019s helpful to hear. I guess maybe my one follow-up and just the flip side to that question is, you guys called out the process business. Basically your guidance being worse now versus where it was in April and I don\u2019t think that probably comes as much of a surprise to many people. But I\u2019m just curious, as you kind of think about the process business longer term and given where oil prices are today, and also the investments that you\u2019ve made within Sensia, like how are you thinking about this business with respect to the portfolio, just from a longer-term growth perspective? And how long is it going to take to kind of get back to some decent growth in the business? Blake Moret : Yes. There\u2019s no question that the oil and gas business is under a lot of pressure right now. But Sensia\u2019s positioned exactly where I would want it to be positioned, and that is focused on operational efficiencies and decreasing the breakeven point to produce a barrel of oil and I think there\u2019s some evidence that, that is where the market is investing and that orders for Sensia were actually a little bit better than our expectations in the quarter. So it\u2019s a tough spot for oil and gas, but helping them produce more efficiently is right where I want to be. Joe Ritchie : That\u2019s interesting comments on the order side. Thank you for that. Blake Moret : Yes. Thanks, Joe. Jessica Kourakos : Thank you very much everyone. I\u2019ll turn it back to Blake for a few final comments. Blake Moret : Thanks, Jessica. To summarize, we remain focused on the well-being of our employees, we\u2019re managing prudently through a gradual recovery, and we are taking steps to accelerate long- term profitable growth. Nobody is better positioned to bring information technology and industrial operational technology together than Rockwell and our partners, and we wish you all good health, and thank you for your interest and support. Jessica Kourakos : That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you all for joining us. Operator : Thank you for joining. That concludes today\u2019s conference call. At this time, you may disconnect.

I need to remind everyone that today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. Later in the call, we will open up the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Jessica Kourakos, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Kourakos, please go ahead. Jessica Kourakos : Thanks, Amy. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal 2020 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; Patrick Goris, our CFO; and Steve Etzel, our CFO elect. Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include, and our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today\u2019s call. In addition, we\u2019ve filed an 8-K and have posted supplemental information on our website related to our new business segments and adjusted earnings definition. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings. So with that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Before we begin discussing our results and outlook, I\u2019d like to make a few opening remarks. I first want to address Patrick\u2019s recent announcement that he will be leaving Rockwell to start a new chapter in his career. In his 14 years with us, the company has continued its long legacy of financial discipline and delivering superior shareowner returns, and we wish him well in his next pursuit. Many of you know Steve Etzel, who will be stepping in as CFO on an interim basis. Steve has been with us for over 30 years and over these years has run investor relations, treasury, and corporate FP&A. The Board and I have full confidence he will reinforce our strong financial framework and continued commitment to superior shareowner returns. Patrick and Steve are ensuring a very smooth transition, while we consider internal and external candidates for a permanent successor. I also want to send my deepest thanks to the thousands of employees who have been working under very difficult conditions, including the temporary pay cuts we implemented in May, to help us preserve jobs and to serve our customers during the pandemic. These cost actions enabled us to protect our company\u2019s financial strength and allowed us to continue making important targeted investments to drive our future growth. Now, with business conditions gradually improving, we will reverse the temporary pay reductions by the end of November, one month earlier than expected. In addition, our guidance for next year assumes a return to a fully funded bonus plan. Because of our employees\u2019 hard work and dedication, we have never been so well positioned for what lies ahead. This is another testament to the type of culture we have at Rockwell and I couldn\u2019t be prouder. Turning now to our Q4 results on Slide 3. While business conditions remain difficult relative to a year ago, we are pleased with the steady improvement we\u2019re seeing. In Q4, total reported sales declined by 9% versus the prior year. Organic sales were down about 12% versus prior year, but grew 10% sequentially. Product sales outperformed our expectations and were driven by better-than-expected results in Drives and Motion. Motion performance was led by our Independent Cart Technology, where we received the largest single order in Rockwell Automation\u2019s history. We won this multi-year project from the U.S. Navy based on a need for precise, highly responsive motion control not available with traditional systems, and on Rockwell\u2019s long track record as a dependable U.S. supplier. Independent Cart provides a new way for us to add value and drive growth. You\u2019ll be hearing more about it, and other innovative technologies, at our upcoming Investor Day on November 17. Turning to Information Solutions and Connected Services. Organic sales were up low-single digits versus prior year. IS/CS orders grew double digits over the prior year in both software and connected services. IS/CS sales reached approximately $400 million in fiscal 2020 on an organic basis and were well in excess of that when including all of our recent inorganic investments. Demand for software sold as a result of our PTC partnership is also increasing rapidly as we enter the new fiscal year, and we\u2019re very happy with the recent extension and expansion of this relationship. Together with PTC, we added over 200 new customer logos in fiscal 2020, and deal sizes in our Information Solutions software business continue to grow. The synergies of our combined offering are very evident to customers. In Connected Services, our recent Kalypso acquisition is doing particularly well and is helping us further differentiate. Kalypso is already contributing to some large competitive wins, and they just had the best orders quarter in their history. Total sales include a three point positive contribution from inorganic investments, led by our Sensia joint venture, along with the Kalypso and ASEM acquisitions. Total backlog in the quarter grew double digits versus the prior year and grew high-single digits on an organic basis. Our Q4 Solutions and Services book-to-bill was 0.87 and full-year book-to-bill was over 1. This Solutions and Services book-to-bill does not include the large Independent Cart order we received from the U.S. Navy. Turning to profitability, strong segment operating margin performance of over 20% in the quarter was flat with last year on lower sales, underscoring our increasing business resilience. Free cash flow was also very strong, reinforcing our solid balance sheet and liquidity position. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 4, where I will provide a few highlights of our Q4 organic end-market performance. Our discrete market segment declined approximately 10%, with automotive performing better than we expected, driven by stronger MRO and projects sales. Among the more notable projects in the quarter was a significant OT cybersecurity win in Europe with one of the major German car companies. And in electric vehicles, we saw momentum continue in the industry with battery manufacturers and brand owners. We are excited by recent announcements from both new and established automakers as they focus on production of compelling new EV offerings. In semiconductor, we had another very strong quarter and grew high-single digits versus the prior year. This vertical is benefiting from a variety of secular tailwinds such as the rise of smart devices and the resulting internet of things, along with the need for faster data centers and the adoption of 5G wireless technology. In addition to facilities management, which has been a strong foundation for us, we see an opportunity for our material handling technology as well as our software. In e-commerce, we had a significant expansion win at Cloostermans, one of the largest and most important suppliers to the global ecommerce industry. This is another industry with long-term secular tailwinds that will continue to invest in automation and industrial software to support its tremendous future growth. Turning now to our hybrid market segment. This segment declined a little less than 5% and outperformed the discrete and process industry segments. Food and beverage and life sciences each declined low-single digits for both the quarter and for the year. Packaging OEMs had another strong quarter and delivered double-digit growth versus the prior year. We believe these markets will outperform in fiscal 2021. Eco-industrial outperformed other industries in the quarter, driven by growth in water, where we continue to benefit from a differentiated offering that integrates control, power, and industrial software. Tire and rubber was down double digits but performed in line with our expectations. In the quarter, we had key wins at important strategic accounts, including Cooper Tire, which continues to strengthen its global track and trace capabilities to support the company\u2019s long-term growth plans. They chose FactoryTalk software because of our strong MES and analytics capabilities, and our differentiated ability to connect to both Rockwell and non-Rockwell control platforms. Once again, our strong software portfolio, our ecosystem of best-of-breed partners, and our expertise in connecting diverse manufacturing environments were all important reasons Rockwell won this very competitive project with Cooper Tire. Process markets were down approximately 20%. Oil and gas was a little weaker than we expected, but that was partially offset by better-than-expected performance in most other process markets like mining and pulp and paper. Sensia held up fairly well during the quarter and continues to demonstrate their competitive differentiation. Turning now to Slide 5 and our organic regional sales performance in the quarter. North America organic sales declined by 12% versus the prior year. Business conditions improved through the quarter, particularly in products, where orders significantly exceeded our expectations. While our large Independent Cart win was part of that result, we also saw great software orders within Information Solutions that more than doubled versus the prior year, creating strong momentum entering the new fiscal year. In EMEA, sales declined 12% largely due to CapEx delays. These were partially offset by strong growth in water. We also saw growth in life sciences and PPE-related machine builder business. Sales in the Asia Pacific region declined 9% largely due to declines in end user business within automotive and mass transit. Double-digit growth in mining and life sciences partially offset those declines. China sales declined, but orders grew mid-single digits year-over-year in the quarter. Latin America declines were led by mining and oil and gas. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 6 to review highlights for the full year. It\u2019s an understatement to say that fiscal 2020 turned out very different than the plans we discussed together at a great Investor Day during an incredible Automation Fair in Chicago last November. The shadow of the pandemic soon created unique challenges, but I\u2019m proud of our ability to respond while taking big steps forward in the execution of our strategic vision. We kept the safety of our employees at the top of our list and continued to provide dedicated service to our customers, many of whom are producing the food, water, protective gear, and medicine that keep us going. The pandemic has focused us all on what\u2019s truly important. We took thoughtful actions to manage costs through this pandemic while at the same time protect strategic investments, including some very big internal development projects. And you can see those investments drive the performance of our software business, which reached over $500 million in revenue in fiscal 2020 and was one of the best performing areas of our business in both orders and sales this year. We deployed over $500 million for inorganic investments that contributed almost four points to our top line growth; and we deployed over $700 million in cash toward dividends and repurchases enabled by our strong free cash flow. I am tremendously proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished in fiscal 2020, and I\u2019m excited about the resulting momentum as we enter fiscal 2021. Turning now to our outlook on Slide 7. As I said earlier, we saw strong sequential momentum exiting the year. Industrial production is projected to grow in the second half of our fiscal year. So it may take a couple of quarters for us to climb back to year-over-year sales growth from the Q3 trough in fiscal 2020. We expect double-digit year-over-year growth during our third and fourth quarters. Of course, we are all closely monitoring global infection levels related to this pandemic, but we are not assuming a widespread shutdown of customer manufacturing operations. We expect reported sales to grow about 7.5% at the midpoint of the guidance range, including 5% of organic growth and over a point of growth from our fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 acquisitions to date. In addition, we are adopting annual recurring revenue as an important metric for the company and have added ARR as a performance metric in our incentive compensation framework beginning this year. ARR is expected to grow double digits in fiscal 2021, after showing over 6% growth in fiscal 2020. This is further evidence of our ability to build an even more resilient business model. Adjusted EPS is expected to reach $8.65 at the midpoint, which is up 10% from last year\u2019s fiscal 2020 results. We are targeting free cash flow conversion of 100%. A more detailed view into our outlook by end market is found on Slide 8. I won\u2019t go into the details on this slide, but as you can see, we expect positive organic sales growth in all of our key end markets next year with the exception of oil and gas. With that, let me now turn it over to Patrick who will elaborate on our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 financial performance. We\u2019ll then have Steve discuss our fiscal 2021 outlook in his remarks. Patrick? Patrick Goris : Thank you, Blake, and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll start on Slide 9, Fourth Quarter Key Financial Information. Sales, segment margin, Adjusted EPS and free cash flow were all better than expected in the fourth quarter, mainly as a result of better organic sales growth and productivity. Organic sales improved as the quarter progressed and were up 10% sequentially versus Q3. Compared to last year, Q4 organic sales were down 12% and acquisitions contributed just over 3% to total growth. Currency translation was a smaller headwind than expected and decreased sales by 0.3 points. Overall company backlog increased year-over-year in the quarter. Backlog for our short-cycle products was up double digits from a year-over-year and sequential perspective, even excluding the very large Independent Cart order Blake referred to earlier. Segment operating margin was 20.2%, the same as last year. The negative impact of lower sales was partially offset by a combination of temporary and structural cost actions. Fourth quarter results included about $10 million of restructuring charges which are expected to yield over $15 million in additional annualized structural cost savings, most of these savings will be realized in fiscal 2021. General corporate net expense was $22 million, pretty much in line with what we expected. As I mentioned earlier, adjusted EPS of $1.87 was better than expected, mainly as a result of better organic sales, productivity, and a slightly lower tax rate. I\u2019ll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 15%, a bit lower than we expected, due to a slightly different geographic mix of our pre-tax income. Free cash flow performance remained strong. We generated over $300 million of free cash flow in the quarter, well over 100% conversion on adjusted income. Note that this result includes a voluntary $50 million pre-tax contribution made to the U.S. pension plan. This voluntary pension contribution was not reflected in our prior guidance. Slide 10 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our operating segments. Organic sales of both segments improved significantly compared to last quarter. Both segments were up about 10% on an organic basis compared to Q3, though organic sales remained lower compared to last year. Segment margin of both segments increased over 300 basis points compared to Q3, mainly due to higher organic sales, but also as a result of cost control including a full quarter benefit of our cost reduction actions and generally improving operating efficiencies. Compared to last year, Architecture & Software margins were up 100 basis points, despite the impact of lower sales, mainly as a result of our cost actions, including lower incentive compensation. Segment margins for the Control Products & Solutions segment declined 60 basis points compared to last year, with cost actions offsetting most of the impact of lower organic sales. The next Slide 11, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q4 fiscal 2019 to Q4 fiscal 2020. As you can see, core performance was down about $0.15 on a 12% organic sales decline. This implies core earnings conversion, that is, excluding the effects of acquisitions and currency of a little below 20%, which is a bit better than the outlook I shared with you in July. A positive adjusted EPS contribution from acquisitions is offset by unfavorable currency impacts. Slide 12 provides key financial information for full year fiscal 2020. After a good start to the fiscal year, we experienced significant year-over-year sales declines in the second half as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Organic sales declined 8% for the fiscal year. Our cost reduction actions protected key investments and helped to partially mitigate the impact of lower sales. We selectively increased investments in some of our highest priority areas. R&D expense was about flat compared to fiscal 2019, and R&D as a percent of sales increased further to 5.9% of sales in fiscal 2020. Full year segment margin remained at about 20% compared to record 22% segment margins last year, and Adjusted EPS was down 11%. Free cash flow performance remained strong, and excluding the $50 million voluntary pension contribution in fiscal 2020, was flat compared to last year. Free cash flow conversion was over 110% of adjusted income. And finally, return on invested capital remained well above our target of over 20%. Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to mention that we deployed about $1.3 billion of capital towards acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases in fiscal 2020. Our capital structure and liquidity remain very strong. At September 30, our fiscal year end, cash on the balance sheet was over $700 million, and our total debt was about $2 billion. During the fourth quarter, we paid off the $400 million term loan that we executed earlier in the year, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio at September 30 was 1.0. With that, Steve. Steve Etzel : Thank you, Patrick. Moving to Slide 13 product order trends, this slide shows our daily order trends for our products, which account for about two-thirds of our overall sales and represent our shorter-cycle businesses. As we expected, order intake for products continued to improve during the quarter. Our guidance for fiscal 2021 assumes this trend will continue. Daily product order performance through October continued to improve on a year-over-year basis, down low-single digits. Solutions orders are recovering slower than product orders. Let\u2019s move on to the next Slide 14, guidance for fiscal 2021. As Blake mentioned, we are expecting sales of about $6.8 billion in fiscal 2021, up about 7.5% at the midpoint of the range. We expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 3.5% to 6.5% and about 5% at the mid-point of our range. From a calendarization viewpoint, we expect first half organic sales to be down compared to fiscal 2020, followed by a stronger second half with organic sales up mid-to-high teens. As a reminder, first half fiscal 2020 organic sales were about flat, followed by double-digit declines in the second half. We therefore expect easier comps starting in Q3 of fiscal 2021. We expect segment operating margin to be between 20% and 20.5% probably at the higher end of that range. At the midpoint, our guidance assumes full year core earnings conversion, which excludes the impacts of currency and acquisitions of between 30% and 35%. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect to offset a $150 million year-over-year headwind related to fully funding our incentive compensation and reversing fiscal 2020 temporary cost reduction actions with additional productivity. We expect the full-year adjusted effective tax rate will be about 14%. This includes a 300-basis point benefit related to discrete items which we expect to realize late in the fiscal year. Our underlying adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be 17% to 18%. As disclosed in our earnings release, we are modifying our definition of adjusted EPS beginning in fiscal 2021. Under the new definition, we are now also excluding purchase accounting depreciation and amortization expense from adjusted EPS. This has the effect of increasing adjusted EPS by approximately $0.20 on a full year basis. Please note that we filed an 8-K this morning that provides historical information reflecting the new definition of adjusted EPS, as well as recast historical information for our new operating segments that we announced previously. Our adjusted EPS guidance range on the new basis is $8.45 to $8.85. This compares to fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS of $7.87 on the new basis. On an apples-to-apples basis, at the midpoint of the range, this represents 10% adjusted EPS growth on about 5% higher organic sales. We expect adjusted EPS to improve throughout the year and anticipate first quarter fiscal 2021 adjusted EPS to be lower than our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter performance, primarily as a result of a $0.30 sequential headwind related to increased incentive compensation expense and the reversal of our temporary cost actions as of the end of November. Finally, we expect full-year 2021 free cash flow conversion of about 100% of adjusted income. This assumes $150 million of capital expenditures and a $50 million voluntary pre-tax U.S. pension contribution. A few additional comments on fiscal 2021 guidance, corporate and other expense, which we previously referred to as general corporate net expense, is expected to be around $105 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2021 is expected to be between $90 million and $95 million, a little lower than fiscal 2020. Finally, we\u2019re assuming average diluted shares outstanding of about 117 million shares. The next Slide 15 provides the adjusted EPS walk from fiscal 2020 to the fiscal 2021 guidance midpoint. Moving from left to right, fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS was $7.68 on the old definition. Next you see the $0.19 impact of the new definition of adjusted EPS. So, fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS on the new basis was $7.87. Core performance is expected to contribute about $1.90. This includes the benefit of higher organic sales, as well as the benefit of our cost reduction actions. Reinstatement of the bonus and reversal of the temporary cost actions, together, will be a headwind of about $1.15. As mentioned in last quarter, we expect these headwinds to be offset by productivity, which is in core. Currency forecasts project a weaker U.S. dollar compared to fiscal 2020, which should contribute about $0.10 to EPS. The higher tax rate is expected to be about a $0.15 headwind. Acquisitions made during fiscal 2020, and so far this year, are expected to add about $0.10. Note that Sensia is now in core, as October 1 was the one-year anniversary of the formation of the joint venture. As mentioned, at the midpoint of our guidance range, adjusted EPS is $8.65. Moving on to the next Slide 16, I\u2019ll make a few comments on our capital deployment framework. You may recognize this slide from our last Investor Day. Our capital deployment priorities remain the same. Our first priority is organic growth. After that, we focus capital deployment on inorganic activities. Then we focus on capital returns to shareowners, through our dividend and then repurchases. Our capital deployment plans for fiscal 2021 include dividends of about $500 million. As a reminder, we announced a 5% dividend increase last week. Consistent with our past track record, we expect our remaining capital deployment to include a balance of inorganic investments and share repurchases. We resumed share repurchases on October 1, the beginning of our fiscal year. In summary, our guidance assumes a continued sequential improvement in organic sales performance. Cost actions are expected to offset the significant headwind of reinstating incentive compensation and reversing temporary cost actions and we expect about 10% adjusted EPS growth and continued strong free cash flow conversion. Turning to Slide, 17, I\u2019ll finish with a comment about our new segment structure which is effective for fiscal 2021. As a reminder, our first quarter fiscal 2021 results will be reported in the new, three-segment format as shown here. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Blake Moret : Thanks, Steve. We continue to see our customers take steps to increase their resilience, agility, and sustainability. Resilience includes investments to reduce single points of failure, with a growing list of companies announcing plans to build or expand North American operations. Our strong market share in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada make us a natural beneficiary of these plans. Other measures to increase resilience include increased automation, traceability, and remote monitoring, which are all Rockwell strengths. We\u2019re making investments in our own operations, which we\u2019ll showcase during next week\u2019s Investor Day. Our contribution to operations agility is demonstrated by our great results in consumer and life sciences packaging equipment and the growth of our software to manage the increasingly dynamic SKU\u2019s offered by our customers. The pandemic has prompted new food and beverage packaging formats, along with quantities of testing kits, therapeutic drugs, and hopefully very soon, doses of vaccines. Quite simply, these cannot be manufactured at the necessary scale, safety, and quality without automation. We\u2019re proud of the role our innovation is playing at Pfizer, Roche, and many other companies as we help the world recover. The need to increase the sustainability of industrial processes is only increasing. Clean drinking water is one of the reasons our Eco Industrial focus is so important for the future, along with electric vehicles and the everyday ways our products reduce energy consumption in every industry. This expanded value gives us optimism for the coming years. In fiscal 2021 we are guiding to high single-digit reported growth, paced by our highest-margin segment. This results in guidance that also includes double-digit EPS growth. I\u2019m looking forward to telling you more about our plans next week, with the help of great customers, partners, and a very talented Rockwell leadership team. With that, let me pass the baton back to Jessica to begin the Q&A session. Jessica Kourakos : Thanks, Blake. Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible. So please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Amy. Let\u2019s take our first question. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott, your line is open. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning guys. Blake Moret : Good morning. Scott Davis : And congrats, Patrick. Good luck. You\u2019ll be missed, I\u2019m sure. Patrick Goris : Thank you, Scott. This contract with the Navy is interesting. I mean, I haven\u2019t heard you talk about Independent Cart in a while. What is the U.S. Navy doing with the technology? Blake Moret : Scott, we can\u2019t talk in specifics about the particular application, but I can tell you that Independent Cart in general allows for more precise motion control than some of the traditional methods of servo amps and other types of technology. So with the kind of acceleration and deceleration profiles that are needed for some of these high performance applications, Independent Cart was really a differentiated solution. It also has to operate and as you can imagine, very difficult environments. The vital point is that, while we don\u2019t talk as much about our government business, now Rockwell\u2019s been a trusted U.S. supplier to the government for a long time, and so some of these premium high-performance applications were a natural fit. Scott Davis : Okay, makes sense. And then you mentioned Blake, PTC helping you add 200 new customer logos. What \u2013 I know that it might be a little bit varied, but any general theme around what type of new customers you\u2019re able to bring in, any particular end markets, geographies, that type of thing that you could point to? Blake Moret : Scott, one of the things that we\u2019ve really been proud of our partnership with PTC is good diversity of customers and geographies that we\u2019ve been able penetrate with the combined offering. So, while food and beverage and consumer-facing industries, as they are large for Rockwell\u2019s overall business are the source of a lot of the applications. It goes across automotive and mining as well as many of the other industries that we talk about all the time. It gives us new ways to win in these, and some of the things that we\u2019re most excited about that we\u2019ve talked about before are that it\u2019s not just on top of Rockwell control systems, about half of these applications are going on top of competitive control systems. So it\u2019s a new way to add value and to be meaningful in those customers\u2019 digital transformations. It\u2019s really across the various industries and across the geographies. We have wins in every geography we serve. Scott Davis : Okay. Very helpful. Thanks, and good luck, guys. Blake Moret : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Inch with Gordon Haskett. John, your line is open. John Inch : Thank you very much. Good morning, everybody, and congratulations, Patrick. Patrick Goris : Good morning, John. Thank you. John Inch : Welcome. Do you guys expect the cadence of the 10% core sequential sales to be sustained throughout the year? I realized that in aware of your mid-single digit core year-over-year, but talk to me about just sort of the sequential cadence, and do you expect that to sustain itself or if not even perhaps accelerate over the balance of fiscal 2021 as part of your guide? Steve Etzel : Hi, John, this is Steve. We expect a gradual sequential recovery throughout the year, including into the first quarter. And as we said on the call, that implies a first half decline year-over-year, and then a second half year-over-year growth rate in mid- to high-teens. Blake Moret : Yes. What I would also add John is that we did see good orders in October in terms of improvement. So, particularly on the products, that was an encouraging sign as we entered the year. We have to say that services and solutions order recovery is lagging behind those product orders, but products are really the leading indicator that we look at. John Inch : Right. Right. I understand that year-over-year. But does that translate into, like, how does that translate in terms of your expectations in terms of sequential improvement? Like we did 10% this quarter, do you expect that to slow in the December and March quarters and then pick back up? Just a little bit more color on how you think about the sequential trend. Steve Etzel : Yes. John, I think it\u2019s best to think of it as a mid-single digit quarter-to-quarter sequential growth in fiscal 2021. John Inch : Okay, good. No, that\u2019s helpful. And then just as a follow-up on your Page 15 on your EPS walk, where did the structural actions fall? I think you said in core, I just want to confirm that there\u2019s no structural actions that are sort of offsetting the temporary return, like you\u2019ve split it. And maybe I remember, Patrick, last quarter, you talked about you\u2019re going to take out some redundant facilities, maybe some sales offices and stuff. Is there a way to quantify the carryover of this structural impact in EPS? So I see the $15 headwind. What does that map against in terms of this structural takeout that is in response to the pandemic, right? Like would have been sort of\u2026 Steve Etzel : Sure. John, the $15 headwind that you see there on the walk is the bonus rehearsal, I\u2019m sorry, the bonus reinstatement and the temporary cost reversal. That bonus is about $115 million in and of itself for the full year. I will point out by the way as it relates to the bonus; it\u2019s obviously a full year headwind. The biggest headwind we\u2019ll see on a year-over-year bonus is in the second, I\u2019m sorry, yes, the second quarter, but each quarter will have some headwinds. In terms of some of the structural savings and so on, on that bridge, that\u2019s all in core. We have about $60 million of structural savings, which relate to restructurings that we\u2019ve taken over the last several quarters, including in Q4. And then there\u2019s some other cost reduction actions through a cost improvement, if you will, through increased efficiencies in our plants and so on as volume increases. John Inch : Great. No, that\u2019s quite helpful. Thanks very much everyone. Appreciate it. Blake Moret : Thank you, John. Steve Etzel : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian, your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. And thanks Patrick for all the help. And I look forward to working with you again, Steve. Perhaps, the first question just around the top line. Again, I understand that I think you called out good orders and good backlog trends in that the short cycle business and products, but wanted perhaps to focus on that solutions and service and process piece. I think the process sales were down 20% or so in Q4 guiding for low-single digit growth in the year ahead. Maybe help us understand how quickly you get to that return to growth in fiscal 2021. And when we should start to see that solutions? And so this book-to-bill looks a bit healthy, I think was down year-on-year, the book-to-bill in Q4. Blake Moret : That\u2019s right, Julian. Typically the book-to-bill is down for solutions and services in Q4, as we see normal seasonality increased the amount of shipments in the quarter. That being said, we are expecting orders to pick up in the first half of the year. Oil and gas is probably the most subdued as we talked about in some other areas like mining and pulp and paper, the activity is a little bit more vigorous. We continue to focus on the OpEx expenditures in oil and gas through Sensia. I would also say if we look at the typical performance of our various businesses, as we come out of a downturn like this, products are almost always going to lead the solutions and services orders. We\u2019ve seen that repeated over many years and multiple cycles. So we\u2019re not surprised by this. But at the end of the day, you have to compete and win for each order that\u2019s up. There\u2019s still business out there. We are confident that that activity is going to increase, but we have to be on the winning side as that business comes up. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on, not only with our traditional resources, but with some of the new acquisitions. So we\u2019ve got a really helping in that space. And I mentioned Kalypso, but there are other unsung heroes when we look at some of the acquisitions in OT cybersecurity with Avnet and Orlo, when we look at MES tech and the ability to quote even more competitively for the delivery of software-based projects, those are all going to help us recover just as fast as possible as those projects increase in frequency. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. And then maybe Blake, just a more strategic one and perhaps we\u2019ll hear more about this at the Investor Day. But it did seem as if the broadening of that strategic alliance with PTC was quite substantive that you talked about a couple of weeks ago. Maybe give us some background as to why the relationship now includes PLM and SaaS. And maybe how your own perspectives on the benefits of co-offering PLM may have shifted, if at all? Blake Moret : Sure. Julian, I know a couple of aspects of the expanded relationship. The starting point is that we have a great foundation. The pace of competitive wins is picking up. I mentioned before that it seems to be catalyzing the increased size of all of our software wins; so not just what we\u2019re doing directly with PTC, but on the MES side as well, for instance, and then our own FactoryTalk analytics offering. Another specific example of the way that the partnership is evolving is that we\u2019re focused on annual recurring revenue now. So it\u2019s not just about the new annual contract value of wins, but it\u2019s also about the total value of the business, including the renewals. And of course, that\u2019s absolutely essential for us to be on the same side of the table, as we\u2019re both focused on increasing that recurring base. Specifically with respect to PLM and Onshape and some of their offerings, we see the opportunity to help pull through PTC in some of these digital thread opportunities, we preserve an open approach and respect customers\u2019 installed base. But having the ability when a customer is looking at PTC, the ability to include that in the digital thread offering is proving to be very valuable. And with the recent acquisition of Kalypso, we have formidable capabilities with respect to digital thread. So this is just another tool that we have at our disposal. And we continue to look for meaningful ways to integrate PTC technology with our own offering, not just on the software side, but also really importantly on the way that data is pulled from the control and brought up to that information layer. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Blake Moret : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff, your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Blake Moret : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Good morning. Two for me. First is just kind of on the software and control side, thanks for the timely restates. Kind of interesting, right, the software and control kind of in the two worst quarters of the pandemic, basically performed in line with intelligent devices. What if you could just speak to your view of kind of resiliency in that business over time? And as part of that, if we\u2019re going to talk ARR, can you baseline us on what it is for the fiscal year of 2020? So we are kind of level set here. Blake Moret : Yes. Jeff, I\u2019ll make a couple of comments. And then Patrick and Steve may add to that. I mean, software and control includes the essential heart of a control system. The control function, whether it\u2019s based in hardware or software or a combination of the two is processing the inputs and changing the states of outputs. And that\u2019s going to remain a persistent part of control systems in all of the industries that we serve. We see some evidence of that as we talked about the great performance in packaging on our end, compact logics really performed quite well relative to the rest of the control during the last couple of quarters. So we think that that\u2019s an essential functionality and regardless of where the execution point moves from hardware and firmware to pure software or back, depending on customer preferences, we\u2019re confident that we can continue to perform very well there. On the software side, the pure software side, we are increasing the focus on ARR. It\u2019s a little bit over 5% of sales currently. And as we talked about last Investor Day, as we\u2019ll talk about again next week, the goal is to bring it to 10% and more in the next few years, and we think we\u2019re on a good path to do that. I should add it takes all hands on deck to make that happen. It starts with great software, either that we\u2019re developing ourselves or that we\u2019re buying. It also includes increasing our selling capabilities and significant part of our recent investments is adding sales who had a specific focus on software and also the infrastructure within the company to make sure we do a great job of processing those orders and that we\u2019re decreasing churn rates and so on. So it\u2019s really the full company on board and an integrated effort to grow that. Jeff Sprague : And then separately, just on the decision to go ex-amort, just kind of interested in the philosophical decision there. I mean, we\u2019ve seen it happen at other companies, so certainly you\u2019re not alone. Most of the placements that happened there was kind of a investor push for it because the amortization was quite high relative to GAAP EPS. And there was a clear disconnect here. What should we \u2013 if anything gleaned from making this adjustment, right, it\u2019s kind of 2% of earnings. I guess my read would be we\u2019ve got a much more active M&A pipeline coming at us, but any color there would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. Steve Etzel : Sure. This is Steve. We did a lot of benchmarking, as you said, we did get a lot of investor input as it relates to this. We obviously have been on a path doing more acquisitions than perhaps in our history. We have a goal of growing top line more than a point per year from acquisitions and we have been doing more. And we thought now is the right time to make the change and come more in line with a lot of other companies that we compare our substance. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Steve, your line is open. Steve Tusa : Hi, good morning. Blake Moret : Good morning Steve. Steve Tusa : So just thinking about kind of the sequential or I guess the year-over-year performance, maybe a little bit better, because John kind of got you on the sequential side, 2Q last year you guys outperformed almost everybody by a lot. And anything you guys want to kind of highlight as far as the project comps there at all in the second quarter that we should take down of in our models? Blake Moret : Steve, I think we\u2019re in a period of time in general where things are going to be highly variable by geographies and by end markets and by end user, OEM split. So we\u2019re kind of top line there, you\u2019re correct and I think in Q2, it looks like our performance last year outpaced pretty much all of our competitors. And during this time, relative position and amount of business in different parts of the world, I think are going to have a big impact on the results. In general, the theme is of course towards recovery. And as we said, as we pull out from the Q3 trough, we expect gradually recovering conditions and a return to strong year-over-year growth in Q3 as industrial production returns to grow and as we have easier comps. The other point I would make regarding Q2 that you mentioned fiscal 2020, it was broad-based. Automotive, I think was a bit of a positive surprise, but it wasn\u2019t just automotive, but there were a number of industries that were positive in the quarter. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then just \u2013 yes, go ahead. Sorry. Patrick Goris : I am just going to elaborate a little bit on what I mentioned earlier since you brought up Q2. But all of our bonus headwinds of $115 million for the full year, the headwind is going to play out by quarter something like $10 million headwind in Q1, $45 million to $50 million in Q2 and approaching $30 million per quarter in Q3 and Q4. Steve Tusa : Okay, great. Thanks for the color. And then just lastly on these new segment breakouts, on the Software & Control side, I mean, I think the majority of those sales are kind of logics and the PLCs, those margins and I think in 2019 at the peak were 30% for that segment, given that the vast majority of that segment is the hardware. Can I assume that hardware sale is pretty high margin for you guys? Blake Moret : Well, yes, no question that logics hardware is good margin for us. If you do the math and you look at what we\u2019ve provided on fiscal 2020 breakout by segment, about $1.7 billion in Software & Control and all of the software is in this segment. So that, we said it was over $500 million in fiscal 2020 of the pure software. And then, I should also mention, that this is the segment that is currently attractive in the majority of our investment. So whether it\u2019s in logics or it\u2019s in the software development as a percentage of sales this segment would have the highest investment. Steve Tusa : Right. And then PTC related sales that come through there, I think you\u2019ve said will flow through at your kind of normal incremental margin. So, you\u2019re basically booking similar margins on those PTC sales, if you will? Steve Etzel : Steve, the way you can think about it, if we package PTC and offerings to one of our customers we probably achieve between 30% and 40% incremental margins there, so in-line with overall company average, lower of course than it would be our own controllers or our own software. Steve Tusa : Yes. Great, thanks a lot for the color. I appreciate it. Steve Etzel : Thank you, Steve. Operator : You\u2019re next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andy, your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning guys. Patrick, congrats. Steve, looking forward to working with you again. Steve Etzel : Thank you, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Blake. I know you spoke about this a bit in your prepared remarks, but can you give us a little more color into what you\u2019re seeing in terms of your customers, either reassuring or investing to avoid single points of failure? We know you\u2019ve talked about in the past, life sciences, semiconductors, are you seeing investment continuing to increase in these sectors or actually increasing outside of these sectors? And when you think about the order uptake you\u2019ve seen, would you characterize the significant amount of orders as it related to this type of investment? Blake Moret : Yes. As we\u2019ve talked about before Andy, life science is probably the area where we have the longest list of customers that have announced plans to do things in the U.S. Some of these have been public about what they\u2019re doing. You take about, what Becton, Dickinson is doing or Sanofi and so on, and other customers that we\u2019re working with, but they haven\u2019t yet disclosed that publicly and so we respect that. We\u2019ve also seen some high profile semiconductor announcements that we\u2019ve talked in the past about Taiwan Semi and the work that we\u2019re doing with them. And there are some others out there in other industries, our consumer electronics, consumer tools, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a steady cadence and we have \u2013 let\u2019s say get started kids, if you will to work with customers who are considering doing these sorts of things that our salespeople are familiar with. It\u2019s really a part of the overall attempts for resilience. So we\u2019re not seeing an avalanche of that reassuring. We see that steady, but the business that\u2019s coming out of it, it\u2019s meaningful. It\u2019s certainly in the millions of dollars that we\u2019re seeing there. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks for that Blake. And then can you give us more color into what you\u2019re seeing in the automotive markets? You mentioned it was better than you expected, but down 20% in Q4, as you know was only modestly better than Q3, it declined and auto builds did improve materially globally. So we know you\u2019re guiding automotive being up 10% in FY 2021, was there anything that kind of held you back in Q4 versus build and maybe update us on sort of the EV transition we\u2019re seeing seems to be accelerating a bit that should help you, I think as you go into 2021. Blake Moret : Yes, we did see as with almost all our industries, so good sequential. It was so strong, a double-digit sequential increase in automotive. So up 20% gives us optimism. Then as we talk about, fiscal year 2021 get into around 10% growth in automotive. We think we have a line of sight on the projects and the improving MRO to substantiate that. And obviously within there, areas like electric vehicle that we think are particularly good for us as we see higher win rates in EV than across the general portfolio for automotive. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks for that. Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks Andy, welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew, your line is open. Andrew Obin : Hi, guys. Good morning. Blake Moret : Hey, good morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin : So Patrick congratulations. And Steve, look forward to working with you again as everybody has mentioned. Maybe Patrick, I\u2019ll ask you a question about Mexican effects, I won\u2019t do that. Just a couple of questions, so first, you also announced in addition to PTC partnership, you also announced the expansion of your partnership with Microsoft. And I was just wondering, because Microsoft is aligned with PTC, but yet they\u2019re trying to do their own thing in industrial vertical. Can you just talk a little bit more, what it is you are doing more with Microsoft, because clearly you guys have been aligned for a long time, but is there anything new there? They\u2019re more focused on SaaS, more focused on cloud. So that\u2019s my first question. Patrick Goris : Sure. The primary focus of this new expansion of work with Microsoft is targeted at Azure infrastructure and the cloud. And so we\u2019re working with Microsoft and we\u2019ll be demonstrating some of our new capabilities that are already well along in the areas of design as well as information in using a SaaS approach for new capabilities. So these really complement our existing capabilities and are kind of a forerunner of a significant amount of new functionality, both on-prem and in the cloud that customers will see over the next year or so. So it\u2019s really, it\u2019s focused on combining forces using their expertise with Azure in our OT expertise to provide new design tools for customers and we\u2019re very excited about it. I\u2019m excited, not only about the functionality, the specific functionality that\u2019s going to bring, but it\u2019s the pace with which we were able to join forces, assemble teams and to come together to create new value. From the first meeting really that we talked about this with Microsoft to now it\u2019s been less than a year. And that\u2019s a great foreshadowing of things to come. Andrew Obin : Do you need to reconfigure your sales force to out-sale to sort of do more of the SaaS Azure sales? Blake Moret : We\u2019re certainly going to be adding additional talent and learning new motions within our sales force, but it\u2019s really a microcosm of the overall convergence of IT and OT. Our home field advantage is understanding of these customers and the operational technologies and what happens on the plant floor and how they make money or avoid downtime. And complimenting that with perspectives of people who understand the software selling motion is what we\u2019re right in the middle of now. We\u2019re making significant investments in new talent, training enablement for our overall sales force and so it\u2019s bringing that talent up together, the existing plus the new. Andrew Obin : And just a follow-up question, again with the new administration, frankly we are hearing from a lot of investors that new administration maybe mean less focused on reassuring, because tariffs will go away. What kind of conversations have you had with your customers, about sort of contingency plans and their longer-term strategy on capacity in the U.S. and globally, in light of the election results. Thank you. Blake Moret : We\u2019re encouraged in that, the Biden campaign and the Biden administration has talked about the importance of U.S. manufacturing. And so that is the single most important issue for us. And we\u2019re optimistic that they recognize the importance that manufacturing in this country plays as a part of the vital core of the American economy. And so we\u2019re looking forward to working with them through professional organizations and so on, to find ways to increase the manufacturing in the U.S. along with the attendant issue of workforce development which is a crucial issue for us as well. Andrew Obin : Very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel, your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for fitting me in here. So just want to go back to John\u2019s question on sequential sales. Did you say 1Q up 5% and I\u2019m not sure if that was what you indicated. Just normally 1Q is below 4Q, so I just want to make sure I got that right. Patrick Goris : Yes. So, we are seeing some momentum as I just described in the product side, but it\u2019s typical for Q1 for solutions to be down. So my general comment was roughly mid-single digit sequential growth. It could be a little slower than that in Q1. And that\u2019s part of the reason why we\u2019ve mentioned that Q1 EPS could be down sequentially, expected to be done sequentially from Q4 then as well as the sequential headwind from the temporary actions being reversed and bonus being reinstated. Nigel Coe : Right. But the point is that there\u2019s enough momentum in products that offset the seasonal down take inflations? Patrick Goris : Yes, I think directionally that\u2019s probably the case. Nigel Coe : Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And then the expansion of the relationship with PTC, one of your big competitors has taken a very strong view on the PLM, PLC integration. And I think historically Rockwell has been a bit more skeptical about that. I\u2019m just wondering, has there been a change in your view of integration amongst those layers? And then sort of within that, have you done all of the investment required to offer integrated solution with PTC or is there still some investment spending to be done around that? Blake Moret : Yes. Our view is that, our customer is going to have multiple applications to create their version of the digital thread and that\u2019s going to vary by different industries. So what you\u2019re looking for in terms of the digital thread in oil and gas is going to be different than what you\u2019re looking for in automotive typically. Let\u2019s say, we are selectively looking at integration between interesting parts of the PTC portfolio. One of the specific areas that Jim Heppelmann highlighted during LiveWorx this past summer was Onshape and our Emulate3D simulation capabilities. And so that\u2019s one area that\u2019s very interesting, and we have differentiated value. We\u2019re using it in our own facilities and it\u2019s helped us win competitively in other areas. But that doesn\u2019t mean that we have to have that capability in every instance in-house. So an open approach and respecting the investment that customer has already have made in terms of training and installation, different vendors, application software in industry is an important tenant of our approach to the market. And so we don\u2019t necessarily need to own everything, but where we pick particularly interesting use cases like the one I just mentioned between Onshape and Emulate3D, that\u2019s an example where we will go deeper and we will provide additional integration tools to add that value. Nigel Coe : Right. Well, thanks Blake. Thanks, Steve. And Patrick, good luck. Steve Etzel : Thank you, Nigel. Operator : This concludes our question-and answer-session. I will now turn the call back over to Jessica Kourakos for closing remarks. Jessica Kourakos : Thank you. Thank you, Amy. I\u2019ll turn it back to the Blake for few final comments. Blake Moret : Thanks, Jessica. Nobody is better positioned than Rockwell and our partners to bring information technology and industrial operational technology together. We remain focused on the well-being of our employees, and we continue to manage thoughtfully through a gradual recovery. At the same time, we are happy to see the positive results of steps being taken to accelerate profitable growth. I also want to wish Patrick all the best. Patrick, you\u2019ve played a big role in our success, and you will be missed. We wish you all good health and thank you for your interest and support. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. At this time, you may just disconnect. Thank you.",

Later in the call, we will open up the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Jessica Kourakos, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Kourakos, please go ahead. Jessica Kourakos : Good morning and thank you for joining us, for Rockwell Automation's First Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Steve Etzel, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning. And the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include, and our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call. Supplemental information related to our new business segments can be found in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. So with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Before we begin discussing our results and outlook, I'd like to make a few opening remarks. On the leadership front, we have 2 exciting announcements today. First, we have hired Scott Genereux as our new Chief Revenue Officer. Scott built strong executive-level customer relationships and has spent most of his career leading global sales forces at major enterprise software and hardware companies. These include Oracle, and most recently, Veritas. And we're thrilled to bring him onboard in this newly created role. Scott will be responsible for all our worldwide sales and marketing efforts, leading our global go-to market strategies and accelerating Rockwell's growth, including software sales and annual recurring revenue. The second important announcement is that Brian Shepherd has been hired as the new leader of our Software & Control business segment. Brian has extensive experience in the industrial software space and joins Scott in bringing proven knowledge about ways to drive faster recurring revenue growth in our business. Prior to joining us, Brian was President of Production Software and Smart Factory Solutions, for Hexagon AB. And before that, was a long-time executive at PTC, where he led strategy and operations for their Enterprise Software segments. He has strong technical expertise across the design, operate and maintain phases of the customer journey and how industrial software can maximize customer value. We're excited to have them on board. Both Scott and Brian began on February 1. Finally, I'm happy to report we are well along in our CFO search and expect to make that announcement shortly. It's been a busy few months, but I'm very pleased with the new talent and fresh perspectives we're adding to our leadership team. In other news this quarter, we had very important win on the legal front. In Q1, Radwell International was found liable for trademark infringement and false advertising relating to its resale of Rockwell products. This latest legal victory underscores our commitment to protecting our intellectual property, as well as our authorized distribution network. We're using a portion of the gain that resulted from this ruling to make additional investments this year. This includes investments to pull forward software product launches that will increase recurring revenue in fiscal 2022 and beyond, as well as sustainability related investments to drive our ESG goals. With that, let me now turn to our Q1 results on Slide 3. In Q1, total reported sales declined 7%. Organic sales were down 10% versus prior year. Total sales included a 2 point positive contribution from our ASEM and Kalypso acquisitions. Note that Sensia is now included in our organic results. During the quarter, we saw a sharp acceleration in order intake, especially for our products. Total orders were back above pre-pandemic levels. The increased demand was broad based and well above our expectations and the higher order rates will benefit sales for the balance of the year. More on that in a moment. I'll now comment on our new business segments. Intelligent Devices' organic sales declined 8%. In the quarter, we saw positive year-over-year growth in Motion, where we believe we are gaining market share. Orders in this segment returned to positive growth a quarter ahead of our expectations. Software & Control organic sales declined 6%. In the quarter, we saw year-over-year growth in network and security infrastructure. Lifecycle Services' organic sales decline of 16% was led by continued weakness in oil and gas. We did see a 25% sequential uptick in Lifecycle Services orders in the quarter, which will drive sequential sales improvement through the balance of the year. In Information Solutions and Connected Services, organic sales were down slightly in the quarter, primarily due to COVID related project delays. However, we saw double-digit organic orders growth in IS as well as strong demand in the cybersecurity portion of Connected Services. IS/CS built backlog by about 30% versus prior year and we expect IS/CS to have a great year overall, growing double digits in fiscal 2021 with organic sales exceeding $500 million. Total backlog grew strong double digits on an organic basis both year-over-year and sequentially. Lifecycle Services book-to-bill reached a record of 1.18, reflecting a significant improvement both sequentially and year-over-year. Turning to profitability, segment operating margin performance of 20% in the quarter was roughly flat with last year on lower sales, a testament to our increasing business resilience. Adjusted EPS grew 11% versus prior year, including the legal settlement gain. Excluding the gain, adjusted EPS came in above our expectations for the quarter. Let's now turn to Slide 4, where I'll provide a few highlights of our Q1 end-market performance. Figures are for organic sales. Our discrete market segment sales declined by approximately 5%. However, we saw strong broad order momentum in the quarter, particularly in North America that should benefit sales performance for the remainder of the year. Automotive sales declined approximately 10% versus prior year with mid-single-digits growth in EMEA offset by tough comparisons in other regions. Our EV business significantly outperformed the rest of automotive and included key wins from a major auto brand-owner in Europe that is building a new line for EV battery manufacturing. We also won at a European Tier 1 OEM, who chose our Independent Cart Technology for the precision motion control necessary to build new electric vehicles. These were both hard-fought wins, where our strong customer support and technology differentiation were important factors in our success. Semiconductor grew low-single-digits in the quarter and is expected to improve significantly over the balance of the year. Strong secular tailwinds in this vertical are prompting some of our largest Semiconductor customers to increase their CapEx spend this year. As a result, we are raising our semiconductor outlook to high-single-digit growth for the year, up from our original guidance of mid-single-digit growth. Another highlight within Discrete was our performance in e-Commerce, with sales growing approximately 40% versus prior year. This is obviously another industry with secular tailwinds, and we are well-positioned to provide value that will continue to support its tremendous future growth. Our Independent Cart Technology is a long-term differentiator here, as it is in battery assembly and the packaging of consumer products. Turning now to our Hybrid market segment. This segment grew by low-single-digits and accounted for 45% of revenue this quarter. Food & Beverage grew low-single-digits. In addition, packaging OEMs delivered another quarter of double-digit growth versus the prior year. Life Sciences grew about 10% in Q1, well above our expectation for the quarter, led by strong broad-based demand in North America. Thermo Fisher is an important part of the vaccine ecosystem, and we were very proud this quarter to be awarded a significant multi-year enterprise software order to supply software and professional services to enable their Pharma 4.0 initiative and drive their COVID readiness and response. They chose Rockwell's FactoryTalk Innovation Suite which uniquely integrates MES, IIoT, Analytics and Augmented Reality in a single software solution to drive productivity. FTIS, in combination with strong pharma industry expertise, full lifecycle services, and best in breed digital partner ecosystem were key factors in why Thermo Fisher selected Rockwell. While there is a lot of focus on our role in vaccine formulation, we are also working with the broader vaccine ecosystem to support packaging and distribution requirements. For every one pallet of vaccines being shipped, 20 to 30 additional pallets of vaccine accessories are required. Based on the broad-based increase in life sciences demand, we are now expecting Life Sciences to grow mid-teens in fiscal 2021. Process markets were down approximately 25% and weaker than we expected, led by larger declines in Oil & Gas. Process verticals typically lag our discrete business by about half a year. Turning now to Slide 5, into our organic regional sales performance in the quarter. North America organic sales declined by 11% versus the prior year, primarily due to sales declines in Oil & Gas and Automotive. Business conditions improved significantly through the quarter and were reflected in strong product orders. EMEA sales declined 8%, led by Oil & Gas. Sales from Food & Beverage and Water customers were strong in the quarter. Sales in the Asia Pacific region declined 7%, largely due to declines in Process industries that were partially offset by growth in Mass Transit and Semiconductor. Asia Pacific backlog reached a record high in the quarter and we do expect strong sales growth in the region for both the upcoming quarter and full year. In China, we saw growth in auto with some important greenfield EV battery wins. Sequential orders growth in Q1 and double-digit year-over-year growth in backlog support our full-year sales growth outlook in China to be above the company average. Latin America declines were led by Oil & Gas and Mining. In the region, we saw good growth in Food & Beverage and Tire. Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review highlights for the full year outlook. Orders momentum in the first quarter is expected to drive strong growth in the balance of the year. The higher top-line guidance is primarily related to improvements in the outlook for Life Sciences and e-Commerce in North America, as well as in our global outlook for semiconductor growth. Our new reported sales outlook assumes 10% year-over-year growth at the midpoint, including 6% organic growth. We expect our new software offerings and expanded services will drive double-digit ARR growth in fiscal 2021. Our new hires will be focused on this objective. Our new Adjusted EPS target of $8.90 at the midpoint of the range represents 13% growth over the prior year. A more detailed view into our outlook by end market is found on Slide 7. I won't go into the details on this slide, but as you can see, we expect positive organic sales growth in all of our key end markets this year with the exception of Oil & Gas. A marked uptick in orders for Sensia in the latter part of Q1 sets the stage for improving sales later in the fiscal year. With that, let me now turn it over to Steve who will elaborate on our first quarter performance and updated financial outlook for fiscal 2021. Steve? Steve Etzel : Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 8, first quarter key financial information. First quarter reported sales were down 7.1% year-over-year. Organic sales were down 9.7%. Acquisitions contributed 1.8 points of growth, and currency translation increased sales by 0.8 points. Segment operating margin was 19.8%, slightly below Q1 of last year. This is the second quarter in a row that segment margin was about flat year-over-year despite lower sales, so a good result. Corporate and other expense of $28 million was down about $5 million compared to last year. Last year's amount included transaction fees related to the formation of the Sensia joint venture. Note that previously we referred to this line item as general corporate-net. The adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter was 15.4% compared to 8.3% last year. The increase in the tax rate is primarily due to a large discrete tax benefit recorded in Q1 last year related to the formation of Sensia and other discrete items. Moving on to EPS. As a reminder, beginning with this quarter we changed the definition of Adjusted EPS to also exclude the impact of purchase accounting depreciation and amortization expense. First quarter adjusted EPS was $2.38. As Blake mentioned earlier, this result includes $0.45 related to a favorable legal settlement. Adjusted EPS excluding the legal settlement was $1.93, identical to last quarter, and better than we expected. We are pleased with this result, since compared to last quarter, we were able to overcome a $0.30 headwind from the reinstatement of incentive compensation and the reversal of temporary cost actions as of the end of November. I'll cover a year-over-year Adjusted EPS bridge for Q1 on a later slide. Free cash flow was $319 million in the quarter, including the $70 million legal settlement. Free cash flow conversion was 115% of adjusted income. One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased 356,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of about $88 million. This is in line with our full year placeholder of about $350 million. At December 31, $766 million remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our operating segments. As a reminder, this is the first quarter we're reporting under our new 3 segment structure. The Intelligent Devices segment had an organic sales decline of 7.9% in the quarter. Segment margin was 19.4%, 130 basis points lower than last year, mainly due to lower sales, partially offset by temporary and structural cost savings. As Blake highlighted earlier, we had strong orders performance in the quarter, particularly in our products businesses. Intelligent Devices orders grew low single digits year-over-year, and high-single-digits sequentially. Software & Control segment organic sales declined 6.2% in the quarter. Acquisitions contributed 2.7% to growth and segment margin was 30.2%, which was 80 basis points lower than last year's strong margin performance, mainly due to lower sales, partially offset by temporary and structural cost savings. Software & Control orders also grew low-single-digits year-over-year and high-single-digits sequentially. Organic sales of the Lifecycle Services segment declined 16.3% year-over-year, as the recovery in this segment's offerings tends to lag our products businesses. Acquisitions contributed 3.9% to growth. Operating margin for this segment increased 50 basis points to 8.9% versus 8.4% a year ago, despite lower sales. Contributing to the lower year-over-year margin improvement - I'm sorry, contributing to the year-over-year margin improvement were temporary and structural cost savings, and the absence of Sensia onetime items recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. First quarter book-to-bill performance for the Lifecycle Services segment was 1.18, a strong start to the year. The next Slide, 10, provides the Adjusted EPS walk from Q1 fiscal 2020 to Q1 fiscal 2021. Starting on the left, core performance had a negative impact of about $0.25 driven by lower organic sales. Temporary cost actions partially offset the sales impact by $0.20. These were the salary reductions and 401(k) match suspension that we implemented in Q3 of fiscal 2020, which remained in effect through the end of November 2020. Incentive compensation was a year-over-year headwind of about $0.10. Tax was a headwind of about $0.10, primarily due to the Sensia-related tax benefit recorded last year and other discrete items. Acquisitions contributed about $0.05. This represents the positive contribution from acquisitions that we completed in 2020 and so far in 2021. As a reminder, Sensia is now reported in core. Finally, as mentioned earlier, the legal settlement contributed $0.45 to Adjusted EPS. Moving to Slide 11, monthly product order trends. This slide shows our order - daily order trends for our Software & Control and Intelligent Devices segments, excluding the longer lead time configured-to-order offerings. The trends shown here account for about two-thirds of our overall sales. Order intake for products improved again this quarter, as the recovery continued. As you can see, there was a sharp acceleration in demand in November and December. Orders for the Lifecycle Services segment also improved in the quarter, but are recovering slower than product orders. The strong order performance resulted in record total company backlog, growing over 20% year-over-year and double digits sequentially. Our quarterly product order trends are shown on Slide 12. This is the same data as the prior slide, summarized by quarter. Our order levels in the first quarter are now clearly above pre-pandemic levels, both for products and the total company. This takes us to Slide 13, updated guidance. We are increasing our organic sales growth outlook by 1 point. The new range is 4.5% to 7.5%, with a mid-point of 6%. Given the weaker U.S. dollar, we now expect currency translation to contribute about 2.5% to growth. We expect acquisitions to contribute about 1.5%. In total, the midpoint of our reported sales guidance range is 10%. We have also updated the adjusted EPS guidance range to $8.70 to $9.10. I'll review the bridge from the prior guidance midpoint to the new $8.90 midpoint on the next slide. Segment operating margins is now expected to be about 19.5%. The lower margin compared to prior guidance reflects the software investments that Blake mentioned earlier and the impact of the Fiix acquisition. These will primarily affect the Software & Control segment and will be weighted toward the third and fourth quarters. Our adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be about 14%, the same as prior guidance. As mentioned last quarter, this includes a 300 basis point benefit related to discrete items, which we expect to realize late in the fiscal year. We continue to project free cash flow conversion of about 100% of adjusted income. A few additional comments on the fiscal 2021 guidance. Corporate and other expenses is expected to be between $105 million and $110 million. Purchase accounting amortization expense for the full year is expected to be about $50 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2021 is still expected to be between $90 million and $95 million. Finally, we're still assuming average diluted shares outstanding of about 117 million shares. This takes us to Slide 14. This slide bridges the midpoint of our November adjusted EPS guidance range to the midpoint of our new guidance. Starting on the left. There is a higher contribution from core operating performance, primarily due to the higher organic sales guidance. Currency is projected to add about $0.05 compared to prior guidance. Next, given the increase in guidance, there is about a $0.10 impact from higher bonus expense. Finally, there is the $0.45 contribution from the Q1 legal settlement, partially offset by about $0.35 for the incremental investments and the impact of the Fiix acquisition. The new midpoint of the guidance range is $8.90. Finally, a couple of quick comments regarding fiscal Q2. Given our strong order performance in Q1, we expect Q2 sales to grow sequentially, and to be about flat year-over-year. We expect second half year-over-year organic sales growth in the mid to high teens. As a reminder, as we mentioned on the last earnings call, Q2 will have the largest year-over-year headwind from the reinstatement of the bonus in the range of $50 million. With that, I'll hand it back to Blake for some additional comments. Blake Moret : Thanks, Steve. Historically, the pace of recovering demand for our products after a recession has come faster than we predicted when we were still in the downturn. This recovery is looking similar so far. And we will see Q2 sales and earnings begin to reflect the torrent of orders we received in November and December, with significant double-digit year-over-year growth expected in the second half of the year. The rate of infections in each region around the world has had a direct impact on the timing and rate of their respective economic recoveries. The Americas were last in and seem to be the last to recover with our sales most highly correlated to this geography, given our revenue there. We are working overtime to meet this demand and staying close to our components suppliers around the world. We're actively hiring and additional capacity for Logix is coming online this month. The new Milwaukee Manufacturing Center is working 2 shifts a day to keep pace with this increased level of orders activity. Turning to Slide 15, we're also investing in software development to drive our future growth. Last November at our Investor Day, we talked about how we will be releasing Software-as-a-Service within our FactoryTalk portfolio to add value in the design, operate and maintenance phases of the customers' investment lifecycle. The recent legal settlement gained will allow us to advance these deliverables. Recent acquisitions are playing an important role in these offerings as well, with Fiix software central to FactoryTalk Maintenance Hub within the Software & Control business segment. Fiix is already showing great momentum and just booked their first $1 million dollar annual recurring revenue contract. Their leadership is already a part of the larger plans for accelerating our SaaS offerings. It all begins with great people. And I continue to be immensely proud of our employees in all parts of the organization and around the world. We continue to hire top talent. And the 2 new members of the team we announced today will add to an already great leadership team. With that, let me pass the baton back to Jessica to begin the Q&A session. Jessica Kourakos : Thanks, Blake. Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and the quick follow-up. Thanks. Michelle, let's take our first question. Operator : Okay. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Your line is open. Karen Lau : Hi, good morning, everyone. It's Karen Lau dialing in for John. Good morning. Blake Moret : Hey, Karen. Karen Lau : Hey. I was wondering, are there - have you guys seen any signs of maybe the order or sales conversions slowing down given the renewed flare-up in COVID cases around the world in Europe, China, and U.S. obviously? Have you seen any moderation in sales conversion? Understanding the order trends has been very strong, but curious, if there's any underlying moderation beneath maybe some sort of budget slash in the year and if you can comment on that? Blake Moret : Yeah, so a couple of pieces of that, first of all orders continued strong in the early part of January. So we don't see significant causal for what we saw through last quarter tailing off because of any sort of budget flush. So we see those trends continue. We do, obviously, continue to see challenges, particularly with our longer cycle solutions business due to continued mobility challenges, as infections have stayed high around the world. But we haven't seen any new obstacles placed with increased infections. Karen Lau : Okay, that's great to hear. And then my other question is on e-commerce. I don't recall you guys in the past calling out this end-market in particular. Obviously, it has been a very strong market for some time. So curious, if your positioning or anything has changed over there and maybe a comment - if you can comment on how big it is and what's like - how is your positioning and the potential and so forth? Blake Moret : Yes, so our role in distribution or fulfillment centers has always been good. We've always had a strong presence in the core automation there in terms of conveyors and sortation. It was a great fit for our core technology. What's changed and why we're talking more about it is, first, the explosive growth of the end-market itself, which I don't think shows much sign of slowing down. And 2, we do have even improved offerings to be able to serve that market. Independent Cart Technology is an example, where we really differentiate. We talked about that last quarter with respect to that Navy, when it differentiates us in e-commerce as well. And some of the potential opportunities there make the Navy order look small with respect to Independent Cart Technology as a form of precision motion control. So it's really a combination of the market expanding, as well as our readiness to serve going even higher. It's still a relatively small part of our total business. But we expect that to increase as a percentage of our total sales in the quarters and years to come. Karen Lau : That sounds great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is open. Trish Gorman : Hey, good morning. This is Trish on for Julian. So maybe just a couple questions on the extra $0.35 of investments spent, maybe a little bit more color on the timing, of how we should expect that throughout the year? And then if this is a new run rate of investment spend or that should set down in 2022? And then just more broadly on margins, apart from the temporary cost reversals, is there anything abnormal to call out? Blake Moret : So I'll make a couple of comments. And then, Steve will add. The investment spend is expected to pull forward some of the development programs that we've been working on in our software area, and specifically, with an eye towards increasing the contribution of Software-as-a-Service to our annual recurring revenue next year. But it's expected to be onetime investments that we can make to accelerate it, not that automatically go into a run rate. And so the investments were selected specifically for that reason, to increase revenue beginning as soon as next year, but without going into an ongoing run rate. Steve Etzel : And as it relates to the $0.35, think of about $0.10 or so of that related to the Fiix acquisition, the dilution from that and the remainder to the software investments that Blake just described. And as it relates to the timing, you can think of it mostly affecting the third and fourth quarter of both items, and as well it's all in the Software & Control segment. Trish Gorman : That's very helpful. Thank you. And then maybe switching gears, in Asia sales down 7% seem to underperform factory automation, pure company. Can you just talk more about what's going on in that region and maybe what the business is specifically in China? Blake Moret : Sure. So, in general, our position in China is really strong with later cycle businesses. We've talked before about the higher percentage relatively towards longer lead time solutions, targeted at end users, as opposed to earlier cycle business that would be centered on indigenous machine builders. And I think you're seeing some of that play out with respect to China. Now, in China, we still see great opportunities, and we've had some exciting wins recently in EV, mass transit, water, wastewater, our software is a differentiator there. So I like our position there. But we're going to pick up the pace, so as we go after that market, with new opportunities, new go-to-market strategies to complement what we're already doing there. Trish Gorman : Got it. Thanks. Blake Moret : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Tusa from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Stephen Tusa : Hey, guys, good morning. Blake Moret : Hey, good morning. Steve Etzel : Hi, Steve. Stephen Tusa : Can you just remind us of - on the kind of the product order trends? What's kind of the cycle time on those orders turning into sales? Blake Moret : So, those are typically characterized as weeks. In those trends, we excluded the longer lead time, configured to order lineups of Power Control. So when you look at those trends, those are typically turnarounds that are measured in weeks in average. A lot of that, of course, sits on our distributor shelf. So when an end customer places an order for it, then it can be fulfilled within hours or a few days. Stephen Tusa : Right. So are you confident that this isn't - if that's the case, are you confident this isn't like a restock? Blake Moret : We are, because we have good visibility into our distributors' inventory management practices. And their buys are based on underlying end customer demand. So they'll be buying on us based on what they see from end users and integrators and panel builders. And the other point is that we saw continued strong orders into the first part of January. So we're not seeing any evidence that there's a large portion of this due to distributor restock, due to our visibility into their inventory management practices. Stephen Tusa : Got it. And then, just one last one, it's kind of the raise of the organic guidance and the cut to the margin. You may have mentioned this earlier, but just curious as to what's driving that kind of lower leverage, if you will? Blake Moret : So some of it now, I'll ask Steve to top this up. But some of that is due to the investments we decided to make from a portion of the gain from that legal settlement we mentioned. So we made a decision to make investments that would be one-time investments in fiscal 2021 to pull forward the recurring revenue that we can get from certain strategic software development projects. So we expect to be releasing Software-as-a-Service for automation software, for information management through the next year and we expect that to impact our revenue next year. But importantly, this does not go into the run rate? So those increased investments were due to accelerate that, but they're not necessary as a part of a recurring spend base. Steve Etzel : Yeah, Steve, the other thing as well, the segment P&L that the subtle end game is outside of segment operating earnings, whereas these incremental investments, and the fixed impact are in segment operating earnings. So they're saying basically, the one side effect comes through the margin. Stephen Tusa : Great. All right. Thanks for the color. I appreciate it. Blake Moret : Yeah. Operator : Your next question will come from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, guys. Steve Etzel : Hey, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz : Blake, it's not really a surprise that you took up your discrete and hybrid organic sales expectations and maybe took down process a little bit, but you did mention that you saw pickup at Sensia through the end of Q1. And obviously, we've seen a spike in commodity prices. So have you seen the stabilization now, overall process related bookings and have you seen any bigger uptick, especially on the mining side? Blake Moret : So the fundamentals for mining, particularly copper are encouraging given the price per pound of copper well above $3, while that presents a little bit of pressure on price for our materials. We don't use a lot of raw materials like that. So the potential benefit of new projects by the miners outweighs of any near-term cost pressure on us. I think, there are some big projects out there that we're looking at I know of a few that we're tracking in Latin America, we haven't seen it yet in terms of mining. But I would say we're more optimistic about that than in terms of a quick oil and gas recovery. On oil and gas, I did mention that we saw some good orders in Sensia towards the back half or of Q1. So the latter part of Q1, we did see some orders that will support the sequential sales improvement through the balance of the year for oil and gas. Andrew Kaplowitz : It's helpful, Blake. And then, just stepping back obviously you talked about orders picking up maybe faster than you expected. Could you talk about how much of the pickup you think is just sort of normal cyclical recovery versus the secular trends we've been talking about here, reshoring, step-ups and resilience to improve single source of failure? You talked about e-commerce a little bit, but also focused on ESG and energy transition, how much is all this stuff sort of helping with order recovery? Blake Moret : I think it fortifies the strength of the recovery. We have more ways to win. So it's not just the recovery of the general core automation and MRO spend having a larger software portfolio services; cybersecurity services that's in the neighborhood of $100 million for this year. These are offerings that we didn't really have in past downturns. And so I think we can participate more fully, as customers try to accelerate out of the curve, in terms of their digital transformation plans. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks, Blake. Blake Moret : Thank you. Operator : And your next question will come from Rick Eastman from Baird. Your line is open. Richard Eastman : Yes, good morning and thank you. Blake Moret : Hi, Rick. Richard Eastman : Blake, could you maybe speak to for a minute or 2? We've seen some fairly aggressive kind of EV expectations for the number of models here over the next 3 years. And I'm curious, your perspective there around the investments in bringing those models to market around EVs. How do you view that as - is that more than a zero-sum game versus investment in trailing ICE models? So maybe that's my first question. And then, just to follow on with that, are you starting to see some order growth around this significant EV model build forecast? Where does that spend kind of in a pipeline, if you will? Blake Moret : So we've always said that our auto business in general is based more on model changes, new models, new cockpit designs and things like that then the raw [SAR] [ph] count. And if you think of these EV launches as new models, then that's positive. And I think it is above a zero-sum game. So I think the opportunities are higher than just ICE going down, EV going up at the same amount. These are new projects, as we've also talked about, we can participate in all the traditional ways of that automation is needed to build a vehicle in terms of body and paint and stamping, and so on. But we also have a higher readiness to serve in the drive train with our capabilities in terms of battery assembly and so on. So there's a mix opportunity and a customer share opportunity there as well as the increased reliance on software to schedule the units in these EV plants. The MES offering that we have is being looked at as more market serving as opposed to a nice to have, it's being looked at is somewhat of an essential part of a modern automobile factory. So those were all very positive things. For us, I would also say if the focus on made in America pertains to fleets being made in the U.S., that's obviously a good thing for us as well, if given our strong position within that geography and within many of the EV brand owners. Richard Eastman : Very good. And then just as a follow-up around Life Sciences, again, we saw the strength in the book-to-bill there, and just maybe a thought, Blake, around - is our content greater within the life sciences marketplace? Or are we seeing just the accelerated spend kind of the pandemic, if you will, defensive spend that we're seeing across the board? Or is our content also greater there, as well? Blake Moret : Yeah, I think, it is expanded customer share as well as the market for automation and information expanding, you think about the things that we're providing to these companies. So it certainly includes the core automation and our capabilities in terms of formulation as well as packaging, track and trace. But then when you look at additional offerings that we can provide the software that we're providing, and again, in this face, it's not just on top of our core automation, it's on top of competitive control platforms. So it's another way to win. Augmented Reality that we have through our relationship with PTC is being used in many of these facilities. And then cybersecurity service is a very fast-growing part of our offering is something that's critically important to these life sciences' customers now more than ever. Richard Eastman : That's it. Great, thank you. Blake Moret : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Your line is open. Joseph Giordano : Hey, guys, good morning. Blake Moret : Good morning, Joe. Joseph Giordano : Hey, just curious on auto, obviously, you have a big ramp in the rest of the year. With the shortage going on in semiconductors, obviously, you're not on the production vehicle side of things. But what's the risk that if that drags on longer that it delayed some of the investments then in putting the equipment in place? Blake Moret : I think, particularly on the EV side, these companies know they need to get units out in the market and an offering to begin to get revenue there. So I think it's given them a lot of headaches. But I still see a pretty dramatic uptake in the size of the project funnel that we're looking at in automotive. So when you look at that funnel of CapEx projects with an auto, our folks are telling us that they're really seeing a pretty market increase in that funnel. I think that, again, the semiconductor shortages that they're fighting with are going to be a hassle for them, but I don't see it causing them to add significant additional delays to these major projects, because they know they have to get their brands out there in the EV market. Joseph Giordano : Okay, great. And then just last for me, the temporary savings was a benefit this quarter does that flip to a give back starting next quarter? Steve Etzel : So year-over-year the temporary savings should now be a net-zero basically for Q2, we've restored the salaries and the 401(k) match, so that's basically a net-zero year-over-year. Now we have talked about the bonus, which is a big year-over-year headwind in Q2, it's about $50 million. Last year, we've reversed all of our bonus accruals in the second quarter due to the downturn, and this year, we're accruing a little above target now. Joseph Giordano : Okay. Thanks, guys. Blake Moret : Thank you. Operator : And our final question for today will come from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Noah Kaye : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. It was really just on the software accelerated investment here, I'm trying to understand kind of combining this with you're bringing in a Chief Revenue Officer. And then, how much of that spend is really for actual product development versus a go-to market change or an investment in the selling infrastructure? Do you feel you have the rights to put sales infrastructure in place to accelerate the adoption of Software-as-a-Service? Any kind of changes you think you need to make in sort of the selling strategy or the business model there? If you can talk about that, that'd be helpful. Blake Moret : Sure. The vast majority of the additional spend that we're making is in the development of the software. So it's in Software-as-a-Service that will be start to release in the coming months and over the next year or so. And it's our automation software. So this is right at the core of what we do, interfacing with our intelligent devices and leveraging that home-field advantage that we have really right at that convergence of IT and operational technology. So it's mostly going into the software development. Because as I said, it's mainly a onetime investment, that doesn't go into our ongoing run rate. We've previously talked about doubling the number of our software specialist, assisting our general account managers, that's not a onetime cost. That's an investment that we've previously talked about and that is increasing. Our approach is really twofold with respect to selling more software. We have a large and growing number of software specialists, as well as technical consultants to assist with those sales. And then, we've got our general account managers who more and more are coming in with inherent software understanding as well. They've got big portfolios to sell to our customers. But I like that, I like having a single account manager that can draw on these various resources, because it simplifies how our customers interact with us and it also puts an emphasis on solutions, because we sell our software, but it is part of a collection of offerings that provide outcomes to those customers. So it typically involves hardware. And it involves software, it involves services. And sometimes we're actually integrating the project ourself. One of the things that Scott brings into the CRO role is a really good understanding of how all those things come together, and how it is provided to the customer as a solution, and how to describe that to increasingly senior levels of our customers, because it's not just selling to plant engineers, plant managers and design engineers. We're a bigger part of our customers' digital transformation with this expanded portfolio. And so, we're talking to people higher up in the company. Noah Kaye : That makes a lot of sense. And thank you for the color. And then I wanted to just touch the last. So you mentioned there is a portion of the investment you talked that is for ESG spend. And I was curious if you could give us just a little bit of details on that. I don't know you could care to quantify it. But in general, what is that spend driving towards? Blake Moret : Sure. Just so a couple of things, I mean, we announced our carbon-neutral goals during investor day. And so, that's what we're doing within our own facilities. And so, we are spending sizable amount of money, I mean, in the millions of dollars to make sure that we are going at a fast pace in terms of advancing those ESG goals in our own shop. But maybe even more important as an overall impact is what we can do for customers. We've always had a big impact on their energy efficiency in their plants. But there are other areas like recycling and our role in the circular economy, renewables, those are things that we're looking at new offerings in to be able to help our customers meet their own ESG goals. Noah Kaye : Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Blake Moret : Thank you. Operator : This brings us to the end of our Q&A session. I turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks. Jessica Kourakos : Thanks, Michelle. I'll now turn it back to Blake for a few final comments. Blake Moret : Thanks, Jessica. In summary, we are very pleased with our very strong orders performance in the quarter. The recovery in manufacturing is clearly happening at a much faster pace than we were anticipating. And we expect that to result in strong revenue growth for the balance of the fiscal year. We're very excited about the new software product launches that we have lined up over the next 12 to 24 months, and the new talent we are bringing on board with Fiix and Oylo as well as our new leadership additions that will accelerate our growth and drive higher recurring revenue in the future. Nobody is better positioned than Rockwell and our partners to bring Information Technology and Industrial Operational Technology together. It is an exciting time to be aligned with Rockwell. And we thank you for your interest and ongoing support. Be well.",

So, with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks Jessica. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Slide three. Strong orders momentum we saw last quarter accelerated and broadened across verticals in fiscal Q2 surpassed $2 billion, which is a new record. Organic orders grew double-digits from last year's orders. As you may recall, COVID did not significantly impact our business until the June quarter of last year. Total reported sales grew 6%, including a two-point contribution from recent acquisitions, including Awesome, Kalypso and Fiix. Organic sales grew a little over 1% versus prior year, despite significant supply chain constraints. Manufacturing supply chain continues to be stressed by sharply increased demand, along with various well public-sized defense surrounding the world and have reduced output and narrowed freight lanes. We'll continue to navigate these challenges in the coming months, take measures to continue increasing supply chain resiliency. I'll now comment on our topline performance by business segment. Intelligent Devices organic sales increased 6%, led by strong broad-based demand for our automation products. Our motion control offering continues to shine up double-digits. CPG companies continue to add packaging flexibility. Software & Control organic sales also grew 6%, led by strong demand across this segment. We saw growth in Logix control, visualization, hardware and software, network and security infrastructure across the balance of our FactoryTalk software portfolio. Net sales growth over 12% for the segment in the quarter. Orders for the Intelligent Devices and Software & Control business segments totaled strong double-digits year-over-year and sequentially. Turning to Lifecycle Services, organic sales declined 11% versus the prior year, primarily impacted by weaker performance in oil and gas. On a sequential basis, revenue and orders grew mid-single-digits; expect continued sequential sales improvement in this segment -- balance of the year. Information Solutions & Connected Services had another strong quarter. Organic sales and orders were double-digits contribution across a variety of end markets. This quarter's orders also included a number of meaningful software and infrastructure-as-a-service, multiyear wins for some of the world's largest food and beverage manufacturers. This included Kraft heinz, where we actively monitor our industrial network and cybersecurity environments. These wins also contribute to ARR, which grew double-digits year-over-year. Total backlog grew strong double-digits on an organic basis, both year-over-year and sequentially. Turning to profitability. Segment operating margin of 22% and adjusted EPS of $2.41 were above expectations and overcame headwinds from the reinstatement of the bonus and higher costs related to supply chain constraints. Stronger volume, favorable business mix, timing of spending, all contributed to our strong profit performance in the quarter as we continue to increase our business resiliency. Let's now turn to slide 4, where I'll provide a few highlights of our Q2 end market performance. Figures are for organic sales. We had a very good growth from discrete industry segment, high single-digit sales growth significantly above our expectations. Within this industry segment, automotive sales were in line with expectations. Declining mid single-digits versus a strong prior year period when auto grew by over 20%. We continue to estimate 10% organic sales growth for the year in this vertical, as MRO continues to grow and as an increasing number of capital projects are expected to launch in the second half of the year. Despite chip shortages impacting automotive production, we are not seeing related delays in capital or operational spending for our products. The semiconductor vertical significantly outperformed our expectations this quarter, growing about 15%. We believe strong secular tailwinds, increasing capital spend, broadening share of wallet with customers are all driving our growth and share gains in this vertical. As a result, we are raising our semiconductor growth outlook, approximately 15% for the year, up from our original November guidance of mid single-digit growth. Another highlight within discrete was our performance in e-commerce with sales growing over 70% versus prior year. Once again, our differentiated offering, featuring our independent Cart Technology is enabling e-commerce applications at a growing number of marquee accounts. This vertical has significant secular tailwinds, of course, and has become a bigger growth driver for our overall discrete industry segment. Turning now to our hybrid industry segment. These verticals also had a terrific quarter. Food and beverage grew over 10% as our strong product portfolio enables these customers to efficiently add SKUs as they seek to differentiate their offering and maximize their growth. We saw increased capital spending by food and beverage customers in the quarter. Not surprisingly, packaging OEMs are also very busy. They contributed another quarter of double-digit growth versus the prior year. Life Sciences grew about 15% in Q2, led by strong demand in North America and Asia Pacific. We won an important MES project via during the quarter, opened the dawn AST pharmaceutical company, face the challenge of exporting products that need to comply with FDA regulations. Dawn AST is expecting production efficiency and quality to improve by going paperless through their choice of Rockwell's PharmaSuite MES. Based on the broad-based increase in life sciences demand, the share gains we are seeing in this market. We're raising our view on life sciences and expected to grow about 20% in fiscal 2021. Process markets were down approximately 10% and were weaker than expected, led by larger declines in oil and gas. Process verticals typically lag our discrete business by about half a year. That said, we saw sequential improvement, again, in North America for oil and gas during Q2. Finding customers are also becoming more active. We saw low single-digit growth in the quarter. Turning now to slide 5 and our Q2 organic regional sales performance. North America organic sales grew by 2% versus the prior year, primarily due to strong growth in food and beverage, e-Commerce and Life Sciences. EMEA sales declined 7%, driven by Oil & Gas, metals and auto, partially offset by strength in Food & Beverage. Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 16%, broad-based growth led by semiconductor, chemicals and Life Sciences. Asia Pacific backlog reached another record high in the quarter. We expect strong sales growth in the region, both the upcoming quarter and full year. In China, we saw over 30% organic growth, driven by strong growth in all three industry segments, including particular strength in EV and semiconductor in discrete, tire, Life Sciences and Food & Beverage and hybrid, mining and chemical and process. We expect growth in China will exceed the company average for the year as our longer cycle businesses kick in. Let's now turn to Slide 6. Highlights for the full year outlook. Orders momentum in the first half of the year expected to drive strong sales growth in the balance of the year, especially as we enter a period of easier comps. Higher top line guidance is driven by improvements during the quarter, our discrete and hybrid industry segments that more than offset incremental declines in process. Our new outlook for total reported sales is over 10% year-over-year growth at the midpoint, including 7% organic growth. Core automation is not the only driver of growth this year, as we also expect double-digit sales growth in Information Solutions & Connected Services. We're seeing good contribution from both organic and inorganic sources. We also expect double-digit ARR growth in fiscal 2021. We expect margins to stay relatively flat with last year, despite the reinstatement of our bonus and the incremental one-time investments we spoke about last quarter that will largely impact the second half. Our new adjusted EPS target, $9.15 at the midpoint of the range, represents over 16% growth compared to the prior year. More detailed view into our outlook by end market is found on Slide 7. I won't go into the details on this slide. But as you can see, we continue to expect broad-based organic sales growth this year with Oil & Gas lagging. Our diversification across higher growth end markets is one aspect of the increasing business resilience that we talked about during the Investor Day in November. With that, let me now turn it over to Nick, who will elaborate on our second quarter performance and updated financial outlook fiscal 2021. Nick? Nick Gangestad : Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. Slide 8, second quarter reported sales were up 5.6% year-over-year. Organic sales were up 1.3%, slightly better than our expectations. Acquisitions contributed 1.9 points of growth and currency translation increased sales by 2.4 points. Segment's operating margin was 22%, flat compared to Q2 of last year. This represents strong underlying improvement considering a $60 million headwind from the year-on-year change in the bonus. Corporate and other expense of $30 million was $12 million higher than last year, primarily due to mark-to-market adjustments related to our deferred [Technical Difficulty]. Adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter was 16.7% [Technical Difficulty] last year's rate benefited from several larger discrete items. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $2.41, well above our expectations, cover year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge for Q2 on a later slide. [Technical Difficulty] March 31, $674 million remain available [Technical Difficulty] authorization. Slide nine, provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. The Intelligent Devices segment had organic sales growth of 5.8% in the quarter. Segment margin was 23.8%, 80 basis points higher than last year, mainly due to higher sales and lower spend, partially offset by the reinstatement of incentive compensation. As Blake highlighted earlier, we once again had strong orders performance in the quarter, particularly in our products businesses. Intelligent Devices orders grew approximately 20%, both year-over-year and sequentially. Software & Control segment's organic sales grew 5.6% in the quarter. Acquisitions contributed four points to growth. Segment margin was 29% [Technical Difficulty]. Margin benefit from higher sales was offset by the reinstatement of incentive compensation. Software and control orders also grew mid-teens, both year-over-year and sequentially. Organic sales of the LifeCycle Services segment declined 11% year-over-year, as the recovery in this segment continues at a slower pace than our products businesses. Acquisitions contributed [Technical Difficulty]. Operating margin for this segment declined 310 basis points to 9% versus 12.1% a year ago, primarily due to lower sales and the reinstatement of incentive compensation, partially offset by favorable mix and cost savings from actions taken in the prior year. Second quarter book-to-bill performance for the LifeCycle Services segment was 1.19. In the next slide 10 provides the adjusted EPS block from Q2 [Technical Difficulty]. Starting on the left, [Technical Difficulty] positive impact of approximately [Technical Difficulty]. Slide 11 product order trend, slide shows our average daily order trends for our products. [Technical Difficulty]. Order intake for product [Technical Difficulty]. Q2 product order levels grew year-on-year as well as sequentially, they're at an all-time high, particularly strong areas were in [Indiscernible], utilization and Logix. Orders for the life cycle services segment also improved in the quarter sequentially, deliver slower pace than our product order growth. The overall strong order performance resulted in record company backlog, growing over 30% year-over-year, double-digits sequentially. This takes us to slide 12, updated guidance. We are increasing our organic sales growth outlook by one point across the range. The new range is 5.5% to 8.5% with a midpoint of 7%. We expect currency translation to now contribute about 2% to growth. We still expect acquisitions to contribute 1.5%. In total, the midpoint of our reported sales guidance range is 10.5% or about $7 billion. We've also updated the adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $8.95 to $9.35. I'll review the bridge from the prior guidance midpoint to the new $9.15 midpoint on the next slide. Segment operating margin is expected to be approximately 19.5%. This is unchanged from prior guidance and primarily reflects strong Q2 margin performance and the higher sales guidance offset by higher supply chain costs, bonus expense and less favorable currency. As a reminder, second half includes higher spend as well as the incremental one-time software development and sustainability investments that we discussed on last quarter's call. The one-time investments will primarily affect Software & Control segment. Our adjusted effective tax rate is still expected to be about 14%, the same as prior guidance. As previously mentioned, this includes a 300 basis point benefit related to discrete items, which we expect to realize late in the fiscal year. We continue to project free cash flow conversion to be approximately 100% of adjusted income. A few additional comments on fiscal 2021 guidance. Corporate and other expense is expected to be about $110 million. Total purchase accounting amortization expense for the full year is expected to be about $50 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2021 is still expected to be between $90 million and $95 million. And finally, we're still assuming average diluted shares outstanding of about 117 million shares. This takes us to slide 13. This slide bridges the midpoint of our January adjusted EPS guidance range to the midpoint of our new guidance. Starting on the left. There's a higher contribution from core operating performance, primarily due to the higher organic sales guidance and favorable mix, partially offset by higher supply chain costs. Contribution from currency is now expected to be $0.10 lower compared to prior guidance. Next, given the increase in guidance, there's about a $0.15 impact from higher bonus expense, which brings the new midpoint of the guidance range to $9.15. Finally, a quick comment regarding the second half, we expect second half year-over-year organic sales growth of about 20%. With that, I'll hand it back to Blake for some additional comments. Blake Moret : Thanks, Nick. With a solid first half under our belt, look at the remainder of fiscal 2021 with optimism, strong order trends and record backlog underpin a robust top-line outlook. We have confidence in our team's ability to navigate the supply chain challenges. Looking to our future. We continue to invest in software capabilities, including development, sales resources and infrastructure. These investments support strong growth in our software business and ARR fiscal 2022 and beyond. Our momentum would not be possible without the tremendous efforts of our employees. I'd like to thank everyone at Rockwell, and particularly, our integrated supply chain organization, which has done a great job managing pandemic challenges and now mitigating our sourcing and logistics constraints. We're leveraging our own manufacturing expertise to help customers be more resilient, agile and sustainable. Nobody is better positioned to help our customers deal with these increasingly complex manufacturing challenges and opportunities than Rockwell, and our ecosystem of best-in-class partners. With that, let me make some remarks about Steve Etzel, who is participating in his final earnings call. Steve stepped up during a critical period for us as we pivoted into the early stages of this recovery and accelerated our transformation. An experienced, dedication, hearing for fellow employees is exactly what we needed. Nick and I joined thousands of employees in wishing Steve and Michelle all the best, happy retirement, little adventure time. I now pass the baton back to Jessica to begin the Q&A session. Jessica Kourakos : Thanks, Blake. Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and the quick follow-up. And for those of you that had some trouble hearing us on the call, we'll make sure to have the prepared remarks available on our Investor Relations website immediately after the call. With that, let me pass it on to Tanya to start the Q&A. Tanya? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Scott Davis with Melius. Scott Davis : Good morning, everybody. Nick Gangestad : Good morning. Scott Davis : And congrats, Steve on retirement. Good to hear your voice, Nick. Anyways, I -- like this is about the most excited I've heard you on an earnings call in a while. What -- when you think about these big new giant semi projects that have been announced, when do you start submitting RFPs for those? And do you envision that being, kind of, 2022 or 2023 business? I assume none of that is in the new projects are in your increase in forecast in 2021? Blake Moret : Scott, we are seeing some increased business in semi. I don't know that it's going into the US fabs that have been announced. But with some of these customers, we're already seeing some significant orders, which contributed to semi helping to power the growth in Asia. So it's not just the big fabs going into the US, its activity in other parts of the world, and we're starting to see that now. As far as the US fabs go, I think you're right. I think that's more of a story for next year and beyond. But everybody in that industry is making investments, and we're working hard to maximize our share of wallet at each of those customers. Scott Davis : Good. And just a quick follow-up. On the incentive comp, is that -- is the run rate guide for 2Q, what we should expect in each of the quarters this year? Nick Gangestad : So Scott, the run rate that we've been at for the first half is what we should expect for the second half as well. It's a little higher in the actual run rate in the second quarter. Because there's a little bit of catch-up given our added performance, but the run rate we're out through the first half is exactly what we expect to have in the second half. Scott Davis : Okay. Thank you. Good luck, guys. Nick Gangestad : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Your next question is from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Yes. Good morning. Just a question, sort of, longer-term question. What kind of conversations are you having with your customers? We know that short-term things are getting better. You guys are excited about longer-term prospects for US CapEx. But are you starting to have these discussions with your customers about, sort of, longer run CapEx growth in North America? Blake Moret : Andrew, I do believe that this is the beginning of a sustained period of expansion in the North American manufacturing economy. The breadth of the orders that we're seeing, the mix of supply for existing operations plus expansions and then the occasional greenfield gives us a lot of confidence that we are seeing a sustained period of growth. And we're having those discussions across various industries. You look at EV, there's no chance of that slowing down. You look at semiconductor for the obvious reasons as they're increasing capacity, e-commerce with the secular tailwinds there; life sciences, food and beverage, the return of oil and gas. All of those are areas that we have significant exposure to. And we expect that, that's going to sustain for a period of time. Andrew Obin : And just a follow-up question. How do you adjust your own supply chain and manufacturing footprint to be able to service this, which seems to be a structural increase for a while? Blake Moret : Well, you look at increasing single points of failure in the supply chain, both on the part of our suppliers, as well as in our own internal operations. In some cases, that's done in supply. In other cases, it's redundant lines within our own operations. When it comes to areas where there's engineering required for specific projects, more work in terms of remote operations, to be able to go deeper in the commissioning process. Remotely, final acceptance testing, does it require the same degree of travel that it once did. And looking carefully at sizing our operations and inserting the agility, including our own automation to be able to maximize the number of different products that can come off a single line. So you look at the same kind of packaging flexibility that's driving the strong double-digit growth packaging to OEMs. We're incorporating a lot of those same concepts and our own operations, including our manufacturing, just down the hall from where we are right now in Milwaukee. Andrew Obin : Thank you. Blake Moret : Thanks, Andrew. Operator : Your next question is from John Inch with Gordon Haskett. John Inch : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I'd like to start on taxes. Rockwell carries, I think, the lowest tax rate in multi-industry or very close to that. If items drive to raise U.S. corporate taxes exceeds, are there tax levers Rockwell can pull to offset, what would appear to be, possibly a disproportionately negative impact for your company? Nick Gangestad : John, as far as levers we would pull, I mean it is still a little early to say exactly what we would be doing. But we continue to look at how we would best optimize our supply chain and servicing our customers and what that would mean for our -- ultimately for our taxes. But in terms of other levers, I think we're just waiting to see how this materializes. As far as the impact it will have, like we've shared in the past in our 10-K, the components that this -- of our current tax rate and certainly, a higher tax rate would impact us, but also components like FDII and GILTI. And those are the provisions we're really waiting to see more specifics of what it ends up looking like to really know how this will impact us in total, and whether there are any additional levers we can go after. John Inch : Well, Nick, based on your understanding of what's being proposed, because it's all there on the web, right? Rockwell's success in having lowered its tax rate, presumably through international -- your international operations and the way you're structured. Is any of that prospectively more at risk versus simply you being in the same boat and your U.S. taxes will rise along with everyone else. I don't think anyone's that concerned if Rockwell's U.S. taxes go up the same as everybody else's, because it is what it is. It's more to the question of the opportunity to maintain disproportionately lower tax rate based on your success of having achieved this, are there provisions that you understand that could be sort of tackling those areas? And can you do something about that type of thing? Nick Gangestad : Yes. So, yes, you're exactly right, John. If there's an increase in the tax rate, that will impact us as I presume it will impact others fairly proportionately. What we see in what's been written that has an impact on what we have as an advantage in relatively low GILTI rate and some benefits from FDII. We're still waiting for any kind of information of theirs replacing FDII, if there's any incentives that are going to be put in place to be encouraging U.S. based manufacturing, which Rockwell does have a significant base of U.S. manufacturing. And then in the end, John, just making a bit broader macro changes to U.S. tax policy that ultimately do encourage more U.S. based manufacturing, that's ultimately benefiting our underlying business as well, given our strong presence that we have in the U.S. John Inch : Yes. No, I agree with that. Just then lastly, Nick, in the short time you've been at Rockwell, I'm wondering if you could talk about best practices or accomplishments you'd like to, say, bring over or see adopted based on your many years at 3M? Nick Gangestad : Hey, John, thanks for that question. So let me just describe it this way. What am I seeing as priorities? And then what I'm observing in the company? First, from a priority standpoint, a high degree of priority in my early days here on execution. There's a lot of moving parts in the world and in this company and making sure that our company delivers from an execution perspective, that's a high priority. And then Rockwell has some very sound strategies about how to be continuing to increase our importance on our customers as the world of automation changes and industrial automation changes. And my focus is going to be how do we best realize those strategies and make those happen. Now, John, part of your question, just early observations, a great company. And one of the things I find very refreshing and positive, this is a company full of engineers. Engineers focused on productivity. And that kind of productivity enables opportunity for investment. So I find a very healthy balance here of what are we doing to drive productivity, but also how do we invested for future growth. John Inch : Got it. Thanks, Nick. Thanks, Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question is from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Just wanted to highlight maybe on the segment margin outlook. So it looks like in the second half, you're implying a segment margin down slightly year-on-year, despite the very high organic growth of 20%. So I understand what's going on with incentive comp, but maybe just on investment spend, remind us sort of the scale of that investment in the second half. If there's any specific weighting between the two quarters that are left? And whether there's any sort of carryover investment spend into next year as an increase? Nick Gangestad : Yes. As far as the year-over-year margin, so comparing second half of 2020 to the second half of 2021. Those margins are going to -- as you just said, are going to be pretty similar. And some of the things that will be improving that margin year-over-year is the growth, which you just mentioned, some added price and also we'll be benefiting from some of the action -- structural actions that we've taken over the last 18 months. What will be depressing that or bringing that margin back down to year-on-year, more or less flat, is this bonus impact, which we've talked about, some rising input costs and then the investments that was, I think, really the heart of your question. And the investment spending that we're doing, and I'll put it in perspective for you. For the second quarter, our investment spending was down a couple of percentage points from the second quarter last year. For the full year, we expect them to be up 2.5 percentage points versus full year 2020. And those are coming from the investments that we've talked about with you already. Some of it the onetime accelerated software development expenses that we're funding, and that's going to be happening fairly evenly in the last two quarters of the year. But we're also investing in added growth platforms. That's been part of the plan. Some of that involves hiring and projects. And just as a little bit of color, we did see a $5 million to $10 million shift of spending from the -- that we intended to have in the second quarter, shifting into the second half of the year, primarily due to higher -- a bit higher -- bit delay in hiring as well as some project delays, not changing our overall spending plan but shifting a little of that in the second half of the year. So overall, we're expecting a noticeable uptick in investments in the second half of the year. As far as the run rate into next year, some of that will be trailing off. We've been very careful about some of these incremental investments, particularly the ones we talked about last quarter, that they will -- they are temporary one-time and will not be carrying forward into 2022. And all that into our second half EPS assumption, which more or less is unchanged from what we were saying a quarter ago. Julian Mitchell : Thank you, Nick. And maybe just a follow-up question around life cycle services trends. The sales were down, I think, low double-digit last quarter. But a book-to-bill of almost 1.2. So maybe characterize for us what kind of recovery slope we should see in LifeCycle Services from here? Blake Moret : Yes. Let me just make the general comment, and then Nick can add additional color. But LifeCycle Services' backlog is up year-over-year and sequentially. And so, we are expecting sequential improvements through Q3 and Q4. Nick Gangestad : Yes. And -- Yes, as Blake just said, it will -- we continue to expect it to get better. We do expect for the full year, it will not be growing as fast as our other 2 segments. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thanks very much and I wish Steve all the best. Thank you. Nick Gangestad : Thank you, Julian. Operator : Your next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Just maybe 2 for me. First on supply disruptions, and I'm sorry if I missed it, you were cutting out a lot at the beginning. But can you just elaborate a little bit what you saw in the quarter, and we did pick up some things in our survey that suggested you were having some problems delivering PLCs and other things. Can you just give us a little bit of color on where your -- whether that's accurate, where you're at on kind of untangling that and was there any kind of discernible negative top line impact from supply disruptions either in the quarter or in your outlook for the back half? Blake Moret : Yes, Jeff, we factored supply chain constraints into our outlook. So there is an impact. And I think it's the things that you're hearing about throughout the industry that are affecting us like other manufacturers. So certainly, electronic components, including chips are in short supply, seeing other mechanical products and materials, sized strengths with resins that are used in a variety of manufacturing processes based on some of the bad weather, a little shorter-term than some of these other issues. Freight lanes continue to be narrow. And so seeing constricted building to transport products would be another area. We've done a nice job of having the necessary labor in [Technical Difficulty] so we really kept to an absolute minimum in our manufacturing operations, we still hire more. We've added several hundred people last quarter. And so that part is shared. But we're going to continue to be very dynamic situation based on sharply increased demand as well as others. And we're working with customers to minimize the disruption. Jeff Sprague : Okay. And just on the investment spend, I understand there's some identifiable things you're doing that might be a little bit larger than the typical project. But it doesn't strike me that a 2.5% increase in investment spend for the year is unusual, but you're kind of suggesting it is as part of this margin construct. So perhaps, I have that wrong, but 2.5% growth in investment spend, I think, would be about $50 million, that kind of dovetails to the $0.35 you talked about in the back half on the software deals. Is there something else in that equation? Maybe you could just frame the kind of the normal trajectory of investment spend? Nick Gangestad : Yes, Jeff, I think the part of that, that I just want to make sure is clear is that, that increase in investment spend is all second half. In fact, more than all in the second half because year-on-year the first half, it was down. So just as we look sequentially first half to second half, we're seeing that sequentially going up, brings the full year to that $50 million that you're talking about of the year-on-year change, but more than all of that change is coming in the second half. Jeff Sprague : Got it. Thank you. Understood. Operator : Your next question is from Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, guys. Blake Moret : Hi, Andy. Nick Gangestad : Hey, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Steve, congrats. Welcome, Nick. So you mentioned the big March order you had in your order trends, which makes two out of the last three quarters that you've called out larger orders. So given your focus, for instance, on independent card, which does tend to attract large orders, an increased focus on e-commerce. At what point are these larger orders more the rule than the exception? And then could you talk about the cadence of your Q2 orders ex the large order? In March, did you see a continued pickup in orders throughout the quarter? Blake Moret : Andy, let me start by saying, I hope you're right, and I hope seeing these large orders across different industries and different offerings becomes the rule rather than the exception. We are happy to see it. And the most recent one, as you said, was in e-commerce. We traditionally haven't called out in as much specificity the orders development from month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter. We thought during the pandemic, it made sense to give you that additional visibility. And it does show developing dynamic of having some of these large orders -- industries and in some cases, non-traditional offerings, so it gives us more ways to win. And so we're looking at that. We have seen a little bit of an uptick in large orders in general that began in Q2, and we would expect that to continue as our life cycle services segment kicks in, and that is where a fairly good proportion, our bigger traditional projects are home grown. So we do expect more of that to come. Majority of our business continues to be more run rate. We used to say $3 million to $5 million was a pretty big project for us. But now we're seeing an increasing frequency of bigger ones. Andy Kaplowitz : Blake, that's helpful. And then you hired several new leaders, including Nick, a few months ago. We know Scott and Brian have different roles, but both seem focused on improving and accelerating Rock software sales, annual recurring revenue. So maybe it's early days, but could you talk about the impact they're having so far on that side of the business? And we just focus on Software & Control. It obviously, has easy comparisons in the second half of your fiscal year, but it's already growing 12% in Q2. So is the expectation at this point that this segment could be a double-digit grower through maybe '22? Blake Moret : I won't comment specifically on '22, but I really like the idea that our highest margin segment is also fastest growing, so that's a nice place to be. I've been very happy with the new perspectives that our new execs have brought to the organization and the way that the organization has embraced them. That's not easy to do, is to bring people in at a senior position into a well-established company with a long culture, a strong culture. But I've been very happy with the way that we brought in those new perspectives into the organization. Brian is focused on increasing the frequency and the impact of new product introductions, particularly around software. Scott's focused on doing the things to focus our sales force on delivering outcomes to customers and increasing our annual recurring revenue, great experience that he brings and high credibility as he works with our sales force. And obviously, as Nick said earlier, that the financial organization analyze the execution of this strategy are all good things. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks, Blake. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Hi. Good morning. Blake Moret : Hi, Steve. Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : Thanks for all the details. The slide deck is very straightforward and a lot of very informative. So easy to digest. Thank you for that. Appreciate it. The $2 billion in orders, I think that's like the total absolute number for the quarter, correct? And I mean, that's a relatively -- obviously, a big number. How do you see that kind of playing out over the course of the next couple of quarters, given it's such a solid kind of book-to-bill, if you will? Blake Moret : Yes. Well -- and we wanted to call that out, because this is really before Lifecycle Services is kicking in full. So we're expecting a nice run of that magnitude of orders for the company over the next few quarters and this is primarily driven at this point with products. But again, as the project business ramps up, which is our expectation, that could deliver some continued nice results there. Steve Tusa : Okay. And as far as this investment spend is concerned, just going back to Jeff's question. So I think you're saying that some of the uptick in investments this year goes away. But does that mean that number is actually down next year? Or it's just growing less off of the higher base next year? Because usually, you guys do have anywhere from, I don't know, a $45 million to $50 million to even $80 million year-over-year headwind, I mean, going back to like 2010 from kind of investments growing faster than sales. Is what -- can you just kind of refine the messaging on that account and where it goes next year? Nick Gangestad : Sure. Thanks, Steve. I believe it's a little early to get anything too declarative on 2022. However, just to clarify, this increase in investment spend is approximately $30 million of that we are saying is temporary. The rest of it is part of our normal increase in investment spend. And then the other way to think about it, Steve, is we also expect a 30% to 35% potential the core conversion. And that's the way we've operated, and that's the way we continue to expect to operate. Steve Tusa : Right. And that 30% to 35% would be, again, like an all-in kind of number for the segments, including whatever happens with this investment bucket for next year? Correct? Nick Gangestad : That's that. When we say that, 30% to 35%, that includes the investment spend. We, however, are holding ourselves to a higher bar and not giving ourselves that credit for that $30 million of incremental spend when we think about that core conversion next year. Steve Tusa : Yes. Okay. That makes sense. I appreciate the color. Thanks. Blake Moret : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi. Good morning, guys. Blake Moret : Hey, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : So Blake, I just want to talk about software for a minute and maybe what you're seeing out there. Are you running into competitors when you win some of these orders? Is it more of a non-competitive process where you're just sort of attaching on to an installed base? And then maybe talk about what product lines you're seeing strength, and I think Honeywell talked about cybersecurity. I know you have an offering there as well. So maybe just sort of a landscape of what you're seeing in the software side? Blake Moret : Sure. So parts of the software business are still somewhat fragmented where you're largely competing against doing nothing on the part of our customer or a homegrown solution. And we still see a lot of that within, say, IoT applications. In MES, it's a little bit more, let's say, mature. And you are typically competing with a fairly well-known competitor, sometimes our traditional full scope automation competitors, sometimes niche competitors. And that visualization, I would say, is similar to that, which is a big part of our software offering. Again, a little bit more stratified, but there's the new applications, IoT, analytics, things like that. It's still a fairly diffuse, let's say, competitor landscape customers are looking for the outcomes. And you're also having to dovetail into an installed base. That's a big part of it, because a lot of your challenges come in the interfaces with existing installations, and that's why we've taken that open approach to expect that these customers already have software and hardware in place and don't want to rip it all out. With respect to cybersecurity, even apart from the hardware, we got a cybersecurity business that's over $100 million in terms of the services. It grew double digits, very strong. We're seeing good contribution from recent acquisitions of Avnet and Oilo, and that's an area that I'm particularly proud of, because it's an area that when we introduced it, it wasn't one that customers necessarily thought of Rockwell first for. But we're having a great impact on customers, and we're working with a whole new set of decision-makers, including the CIO and his or her team in some really big companies, so very happy with the development of that part of our business. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up question on orders. Maybe taking a step back, I get that that $2 billion of orders really only covers about two-thirds of the business. And some of that's longer cycle. But cyclically, seasonally, I don't know if you necessarily go backwards from here. Does that suggest that Rockwell is an $8 billion company over the next couple of years? Like why wouldn't the $2 billion get multiplied by something near four, and you have a bit of a fudge factor for Lifecycle Services, like what leaks out of that equation, because it seems like a pretty big number pretty early in the cycle? Blake Moret : Well, we're happy with it. That's why we've called it down. I want to make sure and you know this, Josh that the $2 billion is a company number, but we're notching that figure even before Lifecycle Services really kicks in like we expected to over the next couple of quarters. But yes, we're expecting that as we've created more ways to win, our strategy is to accelerate profitable growth. That's what we've been talking about in the last two years, doing it by growing as a higher multiple of industrial production in our core, continued double digits in Information Solutions and Connected Services and making acquisitions that are going to, again, give us more ways to win. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hey, perfect. Thanks for that. Blake Moret : Thanks Josh. Operator : Your next question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. Nick is going to hear new voice, we couldn\u2019t hear that well, and Steve congratulations on your retirement. I hate to go back over investor spend again, but I'm a little bit bamboozle about some of new pieces here. But when you talk about the increase in the full year, 2.5% mentioned, $50 million you okay with. Is that the second half increase, or is that $50 million for the full year and the second half is more than to that number? Just want to clarify that, please. Nick Gangestad : Yes, Nigel, happy to clarify that. We were down in investment spend in the first half of the year. We were down approximately between $40 million and $50 million. We now expect the full year to be up approximately $50 million or $55 million that means the delta of $90 million to $100 million higher investment spend in the second half standalone. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's clear. And then of that $90 million to $100 million, about $30 million is temporary and washes away, is that correct? Nick Gangestad : Exactly. Nigel Coe : Okay, got it. Okay. Clear as crystal. And then moving on to semi, I know it's a relatively small portion of your revenues. But, obviously, everyone very excited about the investment spend that we are seeing committed in the U.S. Can you just remind us where do you currently play? Where does Rockwell currently play in the fab? And what opportunities do you see to maybe increase the scope going forward? Blake Moret : Sure. Nigel, the primary applications are around facilities management. So it's making sure that the environment is clean and not the right temperature and the right humidity and so on. It's a fairly complex automation project, and that's our traditional area. Lately, we've had some success in increasing the scope even within that facilities management, including things like cybersecurity and other related services and networking. We see additional opportunity in the materials handling. And also, given that we are a good-sized user of electronic components and use circuit boards and so on. We've developed some artificial intelligence applications that have helped us be more productive, and we're working with some customers to acquaint them with our capabilities there as well. So, there's a lot of additional room expansion from that base. Nigel Coe : Thanks, Blake. It\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. Operator : Your final question is from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : Good morning and thanks. You commented earlier about the process of continuing to increase your importance to the customers. And Blake, some of the supply issues you've cited on this call around freight, narrowing and trip shortage and just materials availability in general. I mean, obviously a huge portion of your customer base is all going through that at the same time. And so, I was curious, if you can talk to us a little bit about, how you're seeing the customers use some of your software offerings like FactoryTalk and others to deal with these supply chain issues and how that is advancing your dialogue with them and your opportunity set? Blake Moret : One of the ways, just for an example looking at our own MES software, when we added that into our operations over the last decade there were a couple of ways that, that increased our efficiency. It decreased work in process, and it also helped us with airproofing, to be able to have a defined workflow, so as our customers are having to bring new talent on that may be new to these types of operations, that workforce development is a big deal. And it sometimes sits right on the critical path of getting new capacity up and running. So whether it's the MES software that we've been offering, augmented reality offerings that we have with PTC. We've got some great solutions as well as the training that we provide to help with these new hires at our customers come online just as fast as possible. I also believe that the flexibility that we are adding in our own operations, and I mentioned earlier, in our own contactor facility here in Milwaukee, is giving us insight that we can impart to our customers to help them be more agile, to produce a wider variety of SKUs on a single line. I saw an application recently with a beverage company that's able to make a very wide range of packaging formats for beverages, using our independent cart technology. And it's a whole different game than it was 10 years ago in terms of different types of SKUs that these companies can create to maximize their shelf space and retail outlets. Noah Kaye : Yes. And you mentioned, MES being able to reduce work in progress. But we're hearing about, for example, in auto suppliers trying to reach two and three layers deeper into their supply chain and trying to, through software, do better tracking, not walking away from just in time, but really trying to evolve and get a better visualization of the entire supply base. Is that something that Rockwell can play a role in and then how also? Blake Moret : Yes, absolutely. Being able to take those real-time production signals and to be able to look upstream into that supply base, and just as you said, going deeper and before, it's not a nice to have anymore, it's a requirement to be able to look at those suppliers and to be able to marry that with your real-time production requirements, particularly when you're looking at increasingly multiple potential sources of supply for those components or those materials that you need. So, we see a lot of activity going forward. And you talk customers, nothing gets them more interested in when you talk about the role that we can play in a connected supply chain. There's huge amounts of additional productivity that we can help with their and our ecosystem. Because that's an area that ecosystem is going to play a very large role. Noah Kaye : Make sense. Thanks so much. Blake Moret : Yes. Thanks, Noah. Jessica Kourakos : Operator, now I'll turn it back to Blake for a few final comments. Blake Moret : Thanks, Jessica. In summary, we're very pleased with our strong performance in the quarter. The recovery in manufacturing is accelerating at a much faster pace than we initially expected. Rockwell is extremely well positioned in this recovery, and we're especially excited about the new product introductions and services that we will bring to market over the next couple of years. It's an exciting time to be a part of the Rockwell journey. We thank you for your interest and ongoing support. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. At this time, you may now disconnect.",

Later in the call, we will open up the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I would now like to turn the call over to Jessica Kourakos, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Kourakos, please go ahead. Jessica Kourakos : Thanks Rene. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's Third Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO and Nick Gangestad, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include and our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call. Supplemental information related to our new business segments can be also found in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website.  Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings. So, with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks Jessica and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before I begin let me first congratulate our Milwaukee Bucks for such an incredible season, Go Bucks. Let me now take a moment to talk about a couple of key highlights in the quarter. First of all, I'm pleased to welcome Cyril Perducat as our new Chief Technology Officer. He succeeds Sujeet Chand who is retiring later this year after a long and very impactful career at Rockwell and I'll talk more about his legacy in November. Cyril brings a wealth of automation and digital transformation experience to the role with great global experience and a passion for helping customers. His mindset and additional perspective will help drive even more value from the combination of our core automation, software, and managed services offerings to provide positive outcomes for customers.  We also announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Plex Systems which we expect to close in Q4 of this year. Plex is the leading cloud-native smart manufacturing platform operating at scale and it will be a big part of our FactoryTalk software as a service offering. We look forward to showcasing its unique capabilities and integration into a complete production system at Investor Day during our November Automation Fair in Houston. Now let's turn to our quarterly results on Slide 3. We saw another quarter of exceptional demand across our product portfolio. Total orders surpassed $2 billion reflecting a very strong demand pipeline. Total revenue of over $1.8 billion hit a new record and grew 33% including a one-point contribution from recent acquisitions including ASEM, Kalypso, and Fiix. Organic sales grew 26% versus prior year despite significant supply chain challenges. The manufacturing supply chain continues to remain constrained due to increased levels of demand and persistent electronic component shortages. It's a dynamic situation that we are monitoring closely. Our global supply chain organization continues to navigate these challenges and is taking a variety of measures investing in both short and long-term strategies to increase our supply chain resiliency.  I will now comment on our top line performance by business segment. Intelligent Devices organic sales increased 29% led by strong broad based demand for our automation products. From the orders perspective this is the third consecutive quarter of record order intake in this segment. Once again strong order growth in motion was driven by our independent cart technology offering which saw over 100% orders growth in the quarter. Independent cart orders growth was broad based and included strong wins in e-commerce and warehouse automation including Interlocks, an important North American material handling OEM partner whose machines are supporting some of the largest e- commerce applications in the world. Interlocks is leveraging our independent cart technology and a high bottleneck area of their process was able to realize a 30% increase in sortation throughput.  Software and control organic sales grew 32% led by strong demand across this segment. Logix sales grew over 40% versus the prior year and was our strongest major product family. Orders for the software and control business segment grew over 55% year-over-year showing strong momentum. In lifecycle services, organic sales increased 17% versus the prior year and increased 8% sequentially. Book-to-bill for this segment of 1.18 is expected to drive continued sequential sales improvement in this segment through the fourth quarter. Total company backlog grew by over 50% year-over-year. Turning to profitability, segment operating margin of 20% increased by 340 basis points versus the prior year primarily due to higher sales. Adjusted EPS of $2.31 grew 75% and was above our expectations. Stronger sales and favorable mix all contributed to our strong profit performance in the quarter as we continued to increase our business resiliency and make technology and people investments that set us up for a strong future.  Turning to Information Solutions and Connected Services, which represent many of Rockwell\u2019s newest digital revenue streams, we had another great quarter. Organic sales and orders grew strong double digits, with contributions across a variety of end markets. Recent orders also include a number of meaningful software and infrastructure-as-a-service wins with some of the world\u2019s most important Food & Beverage and Life Sciences manufacturers. For example, SINOVAC, one of the largest pharmaceutical manufacturers in China, recently chose our PharmaSuite MES to help bolster production of their vaccines. We also had a great win with GE Renewable Energy on a greenfield project to develop a major power plant in Africa. Once operational, this hydro plant is expected to provide 30% of the country\u2019s energy demand, while reducing annual power generation costs by $100 million. In addition to using our core automation products, our capabilities in industrial cybersecurity helped us win even greater share of this greenfield project. Kalypso also continues to play a very important role within our Connected Services offerings, and last week received PTC\u2019s systems integrator Partner of the Year award. This is in addition to Rockwell receiving PTC\u2019s overall Partner of the Year Award, as we continue to see good synergies across the PTC-Rockwell portfolio.  Turning to Slide 4. At last year's Investor Day, we talked about how we are bringing our FactoryTalk software offering to the cloud with SaaS offerings in three key areas : FactoryTalk Design Hub, FactoryTalk Operations Hub, and our FactoryTalk Maintenance Hub. The organic development of our FactoryTalk Design Hub is well underway and complements our best-in-class Studio 5000 software. With the addition of Plex, we will have a world-class, full scale FactoryTalk Operations Hub. Plex's smart manufacturing platform includes one of the most advanced cloud-native MES offerings available as well as cloud-native quality and supply chain management solutions. Capabilities like inventory management, supply chain optimization, and track and trace are more critical than ever, and we will have unmatched on-premise, and cloud-native solutions.  Last week, we also announced our partnership with Kezzler, a leading provider of cloud-based traceability software that will be a great complement to both our on-prem and cloud-native supply chain offerings. The foundation of our FactoryTalk Maintenance Hub comes from last year's acquisition of Fiix, an AI-enabled maintenance management platform, with a cloud-native offering that is sold 100% on a subscription basis. Since the acquisition, we've seen accelerated growth at Fiix, including the addition of their first two customers with contributions of over $1 million of annual recurring revenue each. This quarter, Fiix revenue grew by over 40% both year-over-year and sequentially, and they\u2019ve added on average, over 50 new logos per month since they\u2019ve joined Rockwell. Fiix and Plex applications are highly complementary, with many opportunities for customers to further improve manufacturing productivity, product quality, and asset utilization.  In addition, we believe that Fiix\u2019s high velocity, go-to-market model will provide additional revenue synergies in the years ahead. As we mentioned on the call to announce the Plex deal, we are moving fast, because manufacturers are picking up the pace of innovation; and we have the opportunity to leap ahead with new value from highly scalable, easy to use, and well-integrated information solutions that build on our rock-solid heritage, born in the world of real-time data. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 5 where I\u2019ll provide a few highlights of our Q3 end-market performance. Figures are for organic sales. We had great performance in our Discrete industry segment, with roughly 40% sales growth. Within this industry segment, automotive sales grew at about 50%, led by an increase in capital project activity. We estimate two-thirds of the capital projects we are winning are related to EV projects taking flight. For example, we had another win at the Indian automotive supplier Wipro-PARI, where our core automation technology will be used in an EV battery pack assembly line for one of North America\u2019s largest automotive brand owners.  In Semiconductor, we grew about 35%. We believe strong secular tailwinds, increasing capital spend, and broadening share of wallet with customers are all driving our growth. We are raising our Semiconductor growth outlook once again to high teens for the year. Another highlight within Discrete was our performance in e-commerce, with sales growing approximately 65% versus prior year. This vertical has significant secular tailwinds with pure play ecommerce players, as well as traditional retailers, that are transforming their warehouses through automation.  Turning now to our Hybrid industry segment. These verticals also had a terrific quarter. Food & Beverage grew over 30% and had the most significant outperformance relative to our expectations, as customers prioritize investing in technologies that help them differentiate their offerings and maximize their growth. We believe we are taking share in this market and that our technical and commercial strength is reaping dividends that should carry through into fiscal 2022. Life Sciences grew over 40% in Q3 and was another great performer in the quarter. Life Sciences was our fourth largest industry in the quarter, not far behind Automotive, and we continue to believe we are taking share in this fast-growing vertical. Key wins included a highly competitive win for a large greenfield project with Butantan to fast-track their Covid-19 vaccine production in Brazil. Here our PlantPAX Control System, Factory Talk Batch, and PharmaSuite MES will enable a best-in-class paperless system that will fully integrate with batch control and other equipment on the factory floor.  Our fastest growing vertical in the Hybrid segment was Tire, which was up about 60% in the quarter. Key wins included Toyo Tire Group in Japan, where Rockwell was chosen as the automation standard for their plant in Serbia. Our core automation technology, our IoT-ready architecture, and strong MES capability were all critical factors in securing this key win. Tire has always been a strong industry vertical for Rockwell and our technologies are actively supporting our customers\u2019 increasing investments in innovation and production capacity. Process markets were up approximately 15% and were better than expected. This was the first quarter where we saw all of our major process industry verticals return to positive growth, including Oil & Gas, which grew low single digits versus the prior year, and grew high single digits sequentially. Turning now to Slide 6, and our Q3 organic regional sales performance. North America organic sales grew by 29% versus the prior year, with strong double-digit growth across all three industry segments. EMEA sales increased 21%, driven by strength in Food & Beverage and Tire. Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 23%, with broad-based growth led by Semiconductor, Life Sciences, and Tire. In China, we saw double-digit growth driven by strength in Tire, Life Sciences and EV. We continue to expect growth in China will exceed the company average for the year, as our longer cycle businesses kick in. Latin America growth of 26% was led by Food & Beverage and Automotive.  Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 7 to review highlights for the full-year outlook. Orders momentum and backlog are expected to drive strong sales growth in the balance of the year and into fiscal 2022. Our higher top line guidance is driven by improvements in our Hybrid and Process industry segments. Our new outlook for total reported sales growth is up 12%, including 8% organic growth versus the prior year. We are seeing strong growth in both Core automation as well as Information Solutions and Connected Services. Acquisitions are contributing over a point of profitable growth. We are increasing our margin expectation to 20%. Our new adjusted EPS target of $9.20 at the midpoint of the range represents 17% growth compared to the prior year. This also includes $0.15 from transaction fees related to our pending acquisition of Plex. I should add that we expect double-digit Annual Recurring Revenue growth in fiscal 2021, with the Plex acquisition expected to add over $175 million to our ARR totals next fiscal year.  A more detailed view into our outlook by end market is found on Slide 8. I won\u2019t go into the details on this slide, but as you can see, we continue to expect broad-based organic sales growth this year. With that, let me now turn it over to Nick who will elaborate on our third quarter performance and updated financial outlook for fiscal 2021. Nick? Nick Gangestad : Thank you, Blake, and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll start on Slide 9, third quarter key financial information. Third quarter reported sales were up 33% over last year. Organic sales were up 26%. Acquisitions contributed one point of growth, and currency translation increased sales by five points. Segment operating margin was 19.9%, an expansion of 340 basis points compared to Q3 of last year. Higher sales volume, a favorable mix, and price all contributed to our margin expansion. These factors more than offset higher incentive compensation, our planned investment spend, last year\u2019s pay reductions, and higher input costs. Corporate and Other expense was $29 million, slightly higher than last year, mainly driven by costs related to the pending Plex acquisition.  The adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter was 14.6% compared to 14.1% last year. Third quarter adjusted EPS was $2.31, above our expectations, primarily related to higher sales. I\u2019ll cover a year-over-year Adjusted EPS bridge for Q3 on a later slide. Free cash flow was $437 million or conversion of 161% in the quarter. Strong conversion in the quarter was driven by continued management of our working capital. Year-to-date, free cash flow conversion was 118% and free cash flow dollars was up 39% versus last year. One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased 225,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $60 million. For the full year, we have lowered our repurchase target from $350 million to $300 million, in anticipation of our upcoming Plex transaction. At June 30th, $613 million remained available under our repurchase authorization.  Slide 10 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. The Intelligent Devices segment had organic sales growth of 29% in the quarter. Segment margin was 21.9%, 500 basis points higher than last year, mainly due to higher sales. This segment did see higher input costs both year-over-year and sequentially, however these costs were largely offset by price. We once again had strong orders performance in the quarter. Intelligent Devices orders grew approximately 65% led by North America and EMEA demand.  Software & Control segment organic sales grew 32% in the quarter. Acquisitions contributed three points to growth. Segment margin was 25.2%, which was 270 basis points above last year. The margin benefit from higher sales was partially offset by higher investment spend. These investments relate primarily to software development and additional sales resources to drive revenue growth in fiscal year 2022 and beyond. Software & Control orders also grew strong double digits led by Logix, which grew double digits in all regions. Organic sales of the Lifecycle Services segment grew 17% year-over-year, led by Life Sciences, Food & Beverage, and Semiconductor. Acquisitions contributed about 1.5% to growth. Operating margin for this segment was 10.3%, an increase of 60 basis points compared to last year. This increase was primarily due to higher sales partially offset by the reinstatement of incentive compensation. Third quarter book-to-bill performance for the Lifecycle Services segment was 1.18. The next Slide 11, provides the ADJUSTED EPS walk from Q3 fiscal 2020 to Q3 fiscal 2021. Starting on the left. Core performance had a positive impact of approximately $1.65, primarily due to higher sales and favorable mix. We did see higher input costs this quarter compared to a year ago, which we have been offsetting with targeted price increases throughout the year. Approximately, $0.10 was related to non-recurring accelerated investments that we announced earlier this year. These investments are mostly in our Software & Control segment. Currency contributed about $0.05. Incentive compensation, and the reversal of the temporary pay reductions, was a year-over-year headwind of approximately $0.55, of which bonus was $0.40 and temporary pay actions $0.15. As a reminder, there was no bonus expense in Q3 of fiscal 2020. Acquisitions were about $0.05 dilutive as we expected. Moving to Slide 12, quarterly product order trends. This slide shows our average daily order trends for our products, which includes our software portfolio. The trends shown here account for about two-thirds of our overall sales. Order intake improved again this quarter. Q3 product order levels grew year-on-year as well as sequentially and are at an all-time high; particularly strong areas were in Logix and Motion. Not included on this slide are orders for the Lifecycle Services segment, which were up double digits in the quarter both sequentially and year-over-year. The overall strong order performance resulted in total company backlog of over $2 billion, growing over 50% year-over-year.  This takes us to Slide 13, updated guidance. We are increasing our organic sales growth outlook to 8%, which is a one-point increase from the previous mid-point of 7%. We expect currency translation to now contribute about 2.5 points to growth, and we still expect acquisitions to contribute about 1.5%. In total, we are forecasting reported sales to be about $7.1 billion or up 12%. We have also updated the adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $9.10 to $9.30. This new range now includes about $0.15 of transaction fees related to the pending Plex acquisition. I\u2019ll review the bridge from the prior guidance mid-point of $9.15 to the new mid-point of $9.20 on the next slide.  Segment operating margin is now expected to be approximately 20%. This represents a 50-basis point increase from prior guidance and primarily reflects higher sales partially offset by additional bonus expense. We continue to expect positive price/costs for the full year. Our adjusted effective tax rate is still expected to be about 14%, the same as prior guidance. This includes a 200-basis point annual benefit related to discrete items which we expect to realize in Q4. We believe our normalized adjusted effective tax rate is around 18%. Given our strong generation of free cash flow through the first three quarters, we are now projecting free cash flow conversion to be above 105% of adjusted income. A few additional comments on fiscal 2021 guidance. Corporate and Other Expense is expected to be about $135 million, and now includes about $20 million primarily from the transaction-related fees and expenses anticipated for the pending acquisition of Plex. Net interest expense for fiscal 2021 is now expected to be about $95 million to $100 million and now reflects the expected incremental interest of about $5 million related to new debt for the pending acquisition of Plex. Finally, we\u2019re assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 117.1 million shares. This takes us to Slide 14. This slide bridges the mid-point of our April adjusted EPS guidance range to the mid-point of our new guidance. Starting on the left, there is a higher contribution from core operating performance, primarily due to the higher organic sales and increase in margin. The contribution from currency is now expected to be $0.05 higher compared to prior guidance. Next, given the increase in guidance, there is about a $0.15 impact from higher bonus expense. Full-year bonus expense is now expected to be approximately $175 million. Given our projected full year performance this bonus is higher than the initial fiscal year 2021 target of about approximately $115 million. For comparison, this was zero for fiscal year 2020. Finally, we now have about a $0.15 impact coming from the pending acquisition of Plex, which we anticipate will close in Q4. This brings the new midpoint of the guidance range to $9.20. Finally, a few more comments on Plex, turning now to page 15. Plex will be reported in our Software & Control segment and be a part of our Information Solutions & Connected Services portfolio of offerings. We are forecasting that in fiscal year 2022, it will generate $175 million of ARR, $160 million of revenue after the adjustment for deferred revenue, and a neutral impact to earnings per share. About $0.35 of incremental EPS from operations is forecasted to fully offset the deferred revenue adjustment, integration expenses, and incremental interest expense. We expect fiscal year 2023 revenues to be above $200 million with a meaningful contribution to EPS in fiscal year 2023. We have included further details in the appendix on the financial impact of Plex in fiscal year 2021 and 2022. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Blake for some additional comments. Blake Moret : Thanks, Nick. Once again, strong order trends and record backlog underpin a robust top line outlook, and we have confidence in our team\u2019s ability to navigate the supply chain challenges. And we continue to invest in our future. The combination of our software portfolio with our controllers, Intelligent Devices, and Lifecycle Services creates unique value for customers across Discrete, Hybrid, and Process end markets. Our momentum would not be possible without the tremendous efforts of our employees. I\u2019d like to thank everyone at Rockwell, and particularly the people in our Integrated Supply Chain organization, who have done a great job managing pandemic challenges and now mitigating our sourcing constraints. We\u2019re leveraging our own manufacturing expertise to help customers be more resilient, agile, and sustainable. Let me now pass the baton back to Jessica and we\u2019ll begin the Q&A session. Jessica Kourakos : Thanks Blake. Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Rene, let's take our first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. I just wanted to understand, first of all, how we should be thinking about operating leverage over the let's say the next sort of 12 to 18 months, realizing the current quarter there is a heavy headwind from incentive compensation, and probably some headwinds as well from trying to manage supply chain constraints and component costs. Just wondered how quickly those sorts of items you think should fade as we move beyond this current fiscal quarter and when you look at the business mix, how we should think about sort of operating leverage, please? Blake Moret : Hey Julian, first, just to around out 2021 as far as operating leverage, and we often at Rockwell talk about our core conversion, we see full year 2021 being right in the range of the 30% to 35% core conversion that we often talk about. As far as thinking about the future, of course, we'll say more about that in November at our Investor Day. But like one way to think about it is, there's several things, nothing drives our operating margin like top line growth, and given our 30% to 35% core conversion, we think that's still a helpful way to think about it. And that implies that we would expect our margins to expand next year. But of course, I'm going to give -- we will give more detail about that at our Investor Day in November. Julian Mitchell : Perfect, thanks very much. And then just, as we're thinking about the automotive end market within Discrete, very, very strong growth of 50% I think you delivered in the third quarter year-on-year, just wondered if you could update us sort of as you're looking into 2022, what portion of your backlog, perhaps if there is such a thing in auto is related to EV, and how you think about the sustainability of that auto CAPEX rebounds? Blake Moret : Sure. Well, Julian, we think that about two thirds of the capital projects that we're currently seeing in automotive have EV content. And EV power train is quickly passing the power train business we're seeing for internal combustion engines as a part of the mix within automotive. And we see that trend continuing and probably accelerating as new entrants into the EV market, either the established brand owners and then the startups are bringing their products to market. And our sales are, of course, directly to those brand owners, as well as all of the tier suppliers, like Wipro Power that we mentioned a little bit earlier. So around the world, we're very positive, very bullish on our portfolio. And quite frankly, we think Plex is going to help that with tier suppliers, because that's one of their strengths, providing their smart manufacturing platform to tier automotive suppliers. So we see this trend continuing. And we're expecting strength going into the next fiscal year in order. Julian Mitchell : Great, thank you. Blake Moret : Thanks, Julian. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning, guys and Jessica. Jessica Kourakos : Morning. Scott Davis : I'm kind of intrigued just to follow-up on Julian's question there. I mean, these EV projects, I mean, how do they compare versus ice and like complexity, and scope? And, any different dynamics, like if are the less suppliers, more suppliers, more competition, less competition, just any additional color you can give there be helpful, I think? Blake Moret : Sure. For Rockwell, there's actually upside to an EV project versus a traditional internal combustion engine. So starting with the drive train, a lot of our independent cart technology wins for precision motion control have actually been on the battery and the drive train side, if you will, for EV where traditionally in internal combustion engines, Rockwell has had a smaller content. That may not be true for some of the other suppliers who have a traditional revenue stream for CNC or what have you, but we don't and so we're not losing business in that transition. It's a net positive for us.  On the software side, the EV manufacturers are adopting right from the start MES software as a necessary element of their production scheduling system. And so whereas 10 years ago or so, it was seen as a nice to have, but not necessarily a requirement with these new facilities coming online MES is seen as a necessary part of the bill of material, if you will. And then you combine all the other pieces of putting a vehicle together, that remained the same. So you still have to stamp and paint metal, you assemble the components, you test them at the end of the line, and so on. And those are all applications that Rockwell has good offerings for.  In terms of the competitive landscape, as you would expect, the usual suspects are there in terms of the traditional part of the vehicle manufacturing and assembly. On the battery and in the electric vehicle drive train, very heavy Asian content; China, Japan, Korea. And so I'd say it's even more international with a bias towards Asia in some of those new elements. And we've put together good teams for tracking and pursuing these projects that span across multiple countries. Scott Davis : That's really helpful. And you've increasingly become more bullish, like on independent cart, kind of almost every call here for the last year. Are there -- how does this scale out, I mean, could you actually do a full Amazon style kind of warehouse and independent cart, is that even possible, does it scale to that size? Blake Moret : There's lots more applications within say, an Amazon fulfillment center that can be accomplished through independent cart. Today, those pieces of their overall facility are typically being provided by multiple of our customers. So you don't see necessarily one single sub supplier to them, providing all of the conveyance and sortation, and so on. And so we're working with some of the big ones, of course, whose names you would recognize. But there's also a whole host of integrators and machinery builders with a good idea, though, that Amazon is bringing into their ecosystem. And so we're working with a lot of these smaller suppliers. And I would also add, this isn't just for the big e-commerce giants. Now, this is for the big box retailers who are also looking to automate their material handling, the Walmarts of the world are also looking at these solutions at their individual locations, where they're bringing in tremendous amounts of material to try to get in the right place more efficiently than ever before. But we see almost limitless opportunity just in the e-commerce area for additional adoption of independent cart. And as we've talked about, we see independent cart wins in other applications outside of e-commerce. We see it in Life Sciences, we see it and Food and Beverage Packaging, given scalability and flexibility that manufacturers could never see before. And then we have some, let's say, more unusual applications, like the one we talked about with the U.S. Navy a few quarters ago. Scott Davis : Excellent. Good luck, guys. Thank you. Blake Moret : Thanks Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning to you. Blake Moret : Hey Josh. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Just a follow-up on I guess, what might be several questions on orders and backlog. Blake say you have another quarter here with pretty healthy order intake, you reference that that over 2 billion of backlog up a lot year-over-year, anything about this cycle or the complexion of Greenfield and Brownfield that you guys are seeing that would make that shippable over a longer period of time than usual, obviously, you guys have sort of a reputation for being more short cycle, but how is that evolving and over what timeframe would you view that backlog is sort of a shippable number? Blake Moret : Yeah, I would I would not look at this backlog as being longer-term shippable based on the mix of industries or projects. The longest backlog orders that we get are typically in solutions, and that's the part of the business that's actually getting a little bit slower to recover. So there's nothing in that mix that would indicate that these backlog increases are due to some, special case with respect to higher project content or what have you. It's really due to just the dramatic surge that we have seen and seen sustained over the last few quarter in orders, coupled with supply chain constraints. But we've given you the color about the individual verticals that it's coming from. And it's a great balance that, it has been across Discrete and Hybrid. And now, the process markets are starting to kick in a bit there. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got it, it's helpful. And then just a follow-up on some of the moving pieces on the cost side for you Nick. I think last quarter or maybe some earlier quarters there was a bit of a talk on some of the investments being kind of frontloaded for 2021 to whether maybe that's a bit more of a tailwind to the 2022. If we had to add up the investments and the incentive comp fees, is that something that leveled out on a normalized basis or is there still some kind of catch up or get back where you start off next year in the plus column? Nick Gangestad : Yeah, Josh, in terms of our investments for full year 2021, we expect our total investments to go up about 2% for the full year. And that's really more back end loaded. I said last quarter, that we expected year-on-year the investments to go up between $90 million and $100 million, compared to the second half of 2020. Our best estimate now is it's going to go up $85 million year-on-year for the second half. So I'd call it more back end loaded than front end loaded up of our investments. And then in terms of investment spending next year, Josh, again it's early, but I don't see any reason to think that it would not be fairly evenly spread over the year. I don't see any big seasonality impacting next year in our investment spend. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning guys. Blake Moret : Hey Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Blake, I'm sure you don't want to give us too much on 2022 at this point, but given orders are so much higher and they keep trending up, what kind of confidence at this point do your order trends give you in delivering organic growth in FYI 2022, that could be close to 2021 or at least at or above your two times industrial production target? Blake Moret : Well, without saying too much about 2022 until November, we're very positive on where we are. The orders momentum, the backlog that we expect to largely shift as we get closer to normal levels through the balance of the year, our ability to compete and win in competitive projects across the world, and across the verticals. I think it's a great setup. And it should bode well for our growth and performance going into the next year and beyond. Andy Kaplowitz : That's helpful and maybe just focusing on process markets, obviously you're seeing especially in chemicals, giving you monthly raise your 2021 forecasts and some improved growth, but you're starting to see more significant improvement yet in oil and gas, what's your confidence level and sort of more of a typical later cycle recovery for process as you go forward? Blake Moret : Yeah, we continue to see optimism for oil and gas as it always seems to do lagging the earlier cycle Discrete businesses. But we grew year-over-year and sequentially in oil and gas. We expect another quarter of growth in oil and gas in the fourth quarter. And while there's still a lot of uncertainty, these are projects around the world and we're continuing to watch COVID infections and those are continuing to be a concern for us. We think we're in a good spot with oil and gas and some of the comments from some of the earlier cycle oil and gas operators, the people who are providing drilling technology as well as oilfield services, those generally lead the impact on our business by say six or nine months. And so we are optimistic that some of the early signs that we saw this quarter in oil and gas are going to persist and pick up. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate it Blake. Blake Moret : Yeah, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. I'm on for Nigel Co. My question will be looking at the investment question again, I was still looking at the 35 million tailwind and for the incentive stores around 30 million for 2022? Blake Moret : In terms of the tailwind for 2022, I mean, we're not yet in a position where we're sharing guidance on what we expect investment spend to be for 2022. But our total investment spend this year is going up approximately 2%, very much like our -- what we've seen in prior years. As far as headwinds and tailwind, I didn't quite catch all of that. But, for instance, it would be more likely that our bonus is back in a more normal zone of what I talked about during earlier on this call. That's an example. But I won't necessarily say investments will necessarily go down or not repeat. The one exception is we have temporary investments, these accelerated investments with $30 million, that is going exactly as we anticipated. That's $30 million in the second half of the year, about $10 million of that we spent in the third quarter of $20 million we're anticipating in the fourth quarter. Those will not repeat into 2022 and we did those investments to accelerate our growth in 2022. And then the last point is, as I said earlier with Julian's question, it's our expectation that margins will be expanding in fiscal year 2022. Unidentified Analyst : Got you. And another one was that in terms of the orders momentum, you mentioned, it's not as long cycle. Do you have any idea when the conversion will happen into sales? Blake Moret : Well, obviously, we're seeing good sales rates that were above our expected expectations in Q3. And that led us to raise the guidance of organic growth at the midpoint for this year. And we expect that we'll be shifting the backlog through the balance of 2022 getting us closer towards, more normal backlog levels. Backlog will be up in Q4 a little bit, but not as market increase as we saw in Q3. Unidentified Analyst : Appreciate it. Thank you. Blake Moret : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Tusa from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Stephen Tusa : Hi, good morning. Blake Moret : Good morning, Steve. Stephen Tusa : Thanks as usual for all the details. Just wanted to -- maybe I might have missed the comment on incentive comp, what is normal, just mechanically, what do you think is normal incentive comp, kind of relative to the level that you're performing at this year? Blake Moret : Yeah, Steve we started the year with our planned compensation, which is what we would consider our normal amounts of $115 million. Given our expectation of exceeding that performance, we're currently expecting total bonus expense this year to be approximately $175 million. Stephen Tusa : Okay, so just mechanically, we should assume that next year you'd get a $60 million tailwind from that? Blake Moret : I think that's a pretty fair assumption. Stephen Tusa : Okay. And then just for the investments, I mean, so should we kind of think about investments up 2 and then and then remove the 30 million, so is that kind of the profile for investments going forward, at least, for next year? Blake Moret : You know, in terms of the investments, yeah, the 30 million you should think of that is something that we're not planning to repeat. But we still haven't given our guidance here. We're working through a lot of things of how we want to, what we want to invest on in 2022. But yes, your assumption of taking 30 million out of what we've done this year, that's the way we've been saying that and I agree with that approach. Stephen Tusa : Okay, so something like it's like 60 million plus, the 30 million and then we have to kind of make up our minds on how much kind of the core investment account goes up and that's kind of the profile for those costs? Blake Moret : I think the best way is to look to November when we're going to be able to provide more detail for this. Stephen Tusa : Okay, I won't ask you for the date of that. That would be the follow up but one more question for you just on this orders. Sorry, on the Plex deal. That's a pretty big growth number in 2023, is there something to do with the accounting around deferred revenues on that front because 30% seems to be a pretty dramatic acceleration as to where this company has been in the past? And then how much of their revenue is actually like, pure MES that's really kind of detached from their kind of ERP core? And thanks for the details again. Blake Moret : Yeah, just so a couple of things. I'll start and Nick may have some additional comments. First of all, the figure in 2023 is after the adjusted adjustments for deferred revenue, that impact the revenue in 2021, and 2022. So you don't see the deferred revenue adjustment in 2023. So we're not looking for 30% top line growth in 2023. But we will not be seeing the deferred revenue adjustments carrying into that year. And then in terms of the mix of Plex\u2019s offering. So they offer a modular smart manufacturing platform, and it has ERP, it has MES, it has quality management, it has supply chain. And so particularly when you're talking to small and medium sized manufacturers, now they don't have big, centralized engineering resources to take a bunch of disparate software applications, and hope that they knit together. And so Plex offers an integrated suite of those modules. MES is a large portion of it, they have ERP and those other applications I mentioned, but they've done some good work over the last couple of years to modularize their offerings, so that a customer isn't forced to buy what they don't want. We will continue to support all these applications for the customers who've already bought them. And we're going to be helping Plex as they expand the introduction of the offering outside of the U.S., as well as to other industries, like food and beverage and pharmaceuticals, that they haven't had as much exposure to in the past. Stephen Tusa : Got it. Nick Gangestad : Hey Steve, just to make sure you're seeing it in the appendix, we've provided some additional detailed breaking out 2022, for Plex and that shows the underlying revenue and then the deferred revenue adjustment or actually a range on that that we're anticipating. That we provide that so you can put it in context of how to think about that growth that we're showing. Stephen Tusa : Right. That's super helpful. Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : We have one last question from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Noah Kaye : Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. I guess just following up on that, would love to hear some of the responses that you've been getting to the Plex announcement, both from the customer base and internally. And I think there have been some questions about on-prem versus cloud migration for a lot of these manufacturing customers. You've got another arrow coming in the quiver but you also have your own broad portfolio of offerings, some of which are, of course, legacy, and prime, and some of which are moving to the cloud. So can you just talk a little about the responses and what you think customers are going to be trying to figure out and how you think you can help them over the coming quarters and years? Blake Moret : Sure, Noah, thanks for the question. Look, on the day that we announced it, I got a lot of unsolicited feedback from both employees and customers that I've developed relationships with over the years. And they were really excited, thrilled about what we were bringing in. They felt like it made great sense and it added what we can offer to compliment the core automation that they've been buying from us for years or in some cases, where they're trying to decide who their digital transformation partner is. With this, what we have, and this is something we've talked about for a long time, an approach that meets customers where they are on their journey. We're still going to sell a lot of on-premise software. And customers have made investments there and they want to see a migration path. And our MES orders have production center based MES continue to grow and those orders get larger, and we continue to see lots of runway for that software for customers who have decided they want an on-premise solution.  But we have the opportunity for customers who have made a decision that they're going to start working with these applications with cloud native software. And they're ready to start working there, to build on Plex\u2019s great customer base and introduce it to those customers who said, they're ready to look at that as well. And so having that approach, it all comes back to that theme of an open approach where we're not forcing one philosophy down a customer's throat. And we're telling them, we can meet them where they are on their journey. We'd like for that data to be coming from Rockwell core automation components but as we've talked about before, a lot of this software we fully expect is going to give us a way in into competitive strongholds where we're not currently the supplier of the core automation. And we're going to be providing the value at the software and then working on the automation pieces as well. So it's going to be a bold approach and we're thrilled about the new ways to win that Plex gives us. Noah Kaye : Okay, thanks, Blake. Let me ask one more question. I don't think it was addressed too much on this call, but you mentioned both in the press release and I think it in the prepared remarks, some of the supply chain constraints, and I was wondering if we can get a little bit more color around where you see the supply chain pressures really still manifesting for Rockwell internally, and what that looks like over the coming couple of quarters? But then also, if you can just touch on what impact this is maybe still having on demand, I mean, I got to imagine for any ops or production planner, is this reramp is like drinking from a firehose every day. And so just wondering to what extent you're seeing your customers demand or kind of CAPEX plans somewhat being held back by just the challenges of the ramping? Blake Moret : Sure. So in the quarter, we saw a little bit of an impact on supply chain in automotive, MRO. It was a small amount and we did not see that affecting capital projects or other industries. And we still believe that while this is something that our customers, operations, and supply chain organizations are going to continue to be working on for the foreseeable future, it's not going to crimp the supply going forward. And in fact, it's probably lessening with respect to automotive from what we may have seen earlier in the year. The part of the supply chain constraints that we're thinking about are in terms of converting our own backlog. And I've mentioned specifically that our supply chain organization, I think, is doing a terrific job navigating this, but it's not going to be over in the next quarter. We're going to continue to be dealing with these supply chain constraints for the foreseeable future and we're looking at how do we deal with these on a short term basis, but also on a longer term basis. And I would say electronic components are a piece of that. Some of this is, just simply brought on by the extremely sharp recovery in demand that we've seen, and that we continue to see in orders. But then there's also the labor and we have to make sure that we're a great destination for labor, in our plants, in our supply chain organization, in our development teams and so on across the organization. Because as you know, it's a very hard, it's a very active labor market right now. Again, I think we're doing a great job with that. We have really good collaboration across all parts of the organization to make sure that we're pulling together so that when people are considering Rockwell as a destination, that we come out on top. So it's those two areas, I would say, but again, in terms of the demand, we're really not seeing a significant dampening of demand brought on by our customers supply chain constraints. Noah Kaye : That's extremely helpful. Thanks so much. Blake Moret : Yeah. Thanks, Noah. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over back to Ms. Kourakos. Jessica Kourakos : Thanks Rene. Well, thanks everyone for joining us today. I know it's a very, very busy day for earnings, but we appreciate your interest and support and we'll see you all, we will see you soon. Operator : That concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Jessica Kourakos, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Kourakos, please go ahead. Jessica Kourakos : Thanks, Chris. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include in our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast on this call will be available at our website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call. Additional information and news about our company can also be found on Rockwell's Investor Relations Twitter feed using the handle at InvestorsROK, that's @InvestorsROK.  Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in our SEC filings. So with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to our quarterly results on Slide 3. We saw another quarter of exceptional demand across all 3 business segments. Total orders surpassed $2.2 billion and grew 40% over the prior year, reflecting a very strong demand pipeline across our portfolio of core automation and digital transformation solutions. Total revenue of over $1.8 billion grew 15%, with additional sales that shifted into fiscal '22 due to supply chain headwinds. Organic sales grew 13% versus prior year. We had very strong growth in core automation and Information Solutions and Connected Services grew double digits in both orders and revenue. This performance was led by strong demand for software and cybersecurity services. Turning to ARR. We continue to make significant progress to drive recurring revenue. Our ARR grew organically by over 18%. And including our recent acquisition of Plex, now accounts for over 8% of total sales. Segment margin of 18% came in line with our expectations with the execution of planned investments in Q4. I'll now comment on our top line performance by business segment. Intelligent Devices organic sales increased 15% versus prior year, even with significant headwinds from supply chain. From the orders perspective, this is the fourth consecutive quarter of record order intake in this segment with orders 30% above fiscal 2019 levels. We continue to see significant strength across the automation portfolio and share gains, particularly evident in motion, led by our independent cart technology. Software & Control organic sales grew 14%, led by strong demand across the segment, including double-digit growth in Logix. Orders grew approximately 50% year-over-year, once again showing great momentum across the software control, visualization and network portfolios. In Lifecycle Services, organic sales increased 7% versus the prior year and increased 2% sequentially even with some projects delayed as a result of component availability. Lifecycle Services book-to-bill of 1.09 was well above seasonal Q4 levels. Total company backlog of $2.9 billion grew by over 80% year-over-year. Over 40% of backlog is related to our Lifecycle Services business. Turning to Information Solutions and Connected Services, which represent many of Rockwell's newest digital revenue streams. We had another great quarter. Recent orders included a number of meaningful software and infrastructure as a service wins. One of the more notable wins in the quarter was with Ardagh Group, one of the world's largest sustainable packaging companies. The company had placed a $1 million order for fixed software in Q3 to reduce unplanned downtime. Ardagh, like a lot of manufacturers, is trying to respond to a sharp increase in demand. By Q4, as the relationship developed, we pulled through an additional $4 million purchase of core automation products showcasing the tremendous synergy resulting from our new software capabilities and intelligent devices. With their ARR growing 45% and over 470 new fixed customers added in just the last 9 months, I'm very happy with the contributions Fiix has been able to make to our overall business. We also had a great win with one of the world's largest food and beverage companies in 2 key application areas. The first win is in the area of predictive analytics, where our Kalypso Digital Consulting business will combine our FactoryTalk innovation suite with our automation technology to provide real-time monitoring and analytics for their manufacturing environment. The second application is in the area of sustainability, where our software and automation technology will be used to help monitor water, air, gas, electricity and steam usage to develop real-time KPIs that further reduce their carbon footprint and drive quantifiable production outcomes. Kalypso continues to play a very important role within Rockwell and is spearheading some of the most exciting digital transformation projects in all of manufacturing. Our customers are recognizing Rockwell's expanding capabilities to converge IT and OT and be a strong partner throughout the digital transformation journey. In fact, we announced yesterday that we are adding to Kalypso's capabilities with our acquisition of AVATA, which will strengthen and expand their supply chain solutions domain expertise. This expertise, combined with our operations management software, and that of our partners, drives great outcomes for our customers. We are very excited to be expanding our presence in the connected supply chain since it is such a critical high-growth area. We also accelerated our FactoryTalk SaaS offering with the acquisition of Plex in September. The integration is going well, and we look forward to showcasing the entire FactoryTalk software offering, including Plex at our upcoming Investor Day on November 10 in Houston. We hope to see you there. I'd also like to highlight the increasing traction we are seeing with our PTC partnership. Our sales force is seeing the number and size of engagements growing. The capabilities and versatility of the combined solution is a great way to win, with both existing customers and new ones all over the world. A number of the wins we saw this quarter were in diverse industries around the world. We're happy with this partnership and think it's a great part of our software portfolio. Let's now turn to Slide 4, where I'll provide a few highlights of our Q4 end market performance. We had great performance in our Discrete Industry segment with roughly 15% sales growth. Within this industry segment, automotive sales grew about 15%, led by an increase in EV capital project activity, including a strategic win at Magna, one of the top Tier 1 auto manufacturers delivering EV content for GM and Ford. Semiconductor was strong, growing 20% off of a very good quarter last year. E-commerce performance was also exceptional with sales growing approximately 30% versus a strong prior year. Turning now to our Hybrid Industry segment. The verticals in this segment also had a terrific quarter. Food and beverage grew about 15%, led by strong greenfield and brownfield project opportunities in North America and EMEA as well as strong double-digit OEM demand. Life sciences grew over 15% in Q4, and remains one of our top growth verticals. We see continued growth in the overall life sciences market and evidence that we are taking market share. Once again, our fastest-growing vertical in the Hybrid segment was tire, which was up about 35% in the quarter. Process markets grew over 10%, with strong sequential and year-over-year growth in oil and gas, especially in our Sensia JV. In summary, we are clearly seeing very strong growth across Discrete and Hybrid segments as well as improving oil and gas trends. Turning now to Slide 5 and our Q4 organic regional sales performance. North America organic sales grew by 16% versus the prior year with strong double-digit growth across all 3 industry segments. EMEA sales increased 7%, driven by strength in food and beverage, tire and metals. Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 12%, with broad-based growth led by EV, semiconductor and mining. In China, we saw double-digit growth, driven by strength in mining, life sciences, tire and EV. Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review highlights of fiscal '21. Record orders of $8.2 billion grew 26%. Reported sales grew 11%, even with supply chain constraints. Organic sales grew almost 7%. IS/CS revenue exceeded $500 million at year-end and grew double digits organically. Adjusted EPS grew 20%, and we, once again, generated significant cash flow due to our very profitable financial framework, strong focus on productivity and financial discipline. At the same time, we made significant investments in our future to accelerate profitable growth. That included organic investments as well as inorganic investments. In fiscal '21, we accelerated funding of software development projects and deployed approximately $2.5 billion towards inorganic investments. At the same time, we returned to $800 million back to shareowners in the form of dividends and buybacks. Turning to Slide 7. You can see how these investments and our strong order momentum and backlog are helping to accelerate our top line performance heading into fiscal '22. Our new fiscal '22 outlook expects total reported sales growth of 17.5%, including 15.5% organic growth versus the prior year. These projections take into account our latest view of supply chain constraints. We have the people, supplier commitments and plant capacity to support this growth, but we will no doubt need to continue to manage new challenges as they emerge in this highly dynamic environment. We expect double-digit growth in both core automation as well as Information Solutions and Connected Services. Acquisitions are expected to contribute 2 points of profitable growth. We are increasing our margin expectations to 21.5%, up 150 basis points over the prior year. Our new adjusted EPS target of $10.80, at the midpoint of the range, represents about 15% growth compared to the prior year. I should add that we expect another year of double-digit annual recurring revenue growth, including our recent Plex acquisition, which adds approximately $170 million to our ARR totals in fiscal '22. A more detailed view into our outlook by end market is found on Slide 8. I will go into the details on this slide, but as you can see, we continue to expect broad-based organic sales growth in fiscal '22. With that, let me now turn it over to Nick, who will elaborate on our fiscal '21 results and financial outlook for fiscal '22. Nick? Nicholas Gangestad : Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 9, fourth quarter key financial information. Fourth quarter reported sales were up 15% over last year. Q4 organic sales were up 12.6%, and acquisitions contributed 1 point to total growth. Currency translation increased sales by 1.5 percentage points. Segment operating margin was 17.9%, in line with our expectations. The 230 basis point decline was primarily related to higher plant investment spend, the reversal of temporary pay actions and the restoration of incentive compensation partially offset by the impact of higher sales.  Corporate & Other expense was $33 million. The year-over-year increase was from deal costs associated with the Plex acquisition. Adjusted EPS of $2.33 was better than expected and grew 21% versus the prior year. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was negative 3%, much lower than expected, compared to 15% in the prior year. The lower-than-expected rate was related to the cumulative impact of several onetime discrete items recognized in the current quarter. Free cash flow performance was in line with our expectations. We generated $160 million of free cash flow in the quarter. The free cash flow generation includes higher levels of working capital in the current year to support our increasing revenue and build inventory in anticipation of the accelerated revenue levels in fiscal year '22. One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased 200,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $61 million. For the full year, our share repurchases totaled $301 million, in line with our July guidance. On September 30, $552 million remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 10 provides the sales and margin performance of our 3 operating segments. Organic sales of both Intelligent Devices and Software & Control were up double digits. Lifecycle Services organic sales were up sequentially and up 7% year-over-year, led by oil and gas, life sciences and food and beverage. All segments saw strong double-digit growth in orders. Compared to last year, Intelligent Devices margins were up 100 basis points on higher sales. This segment did see higher input costs both year-over-year and sequentially. However, these costs were largely offset by price. Segment margins for the Software & Control segment declined 330 basis points compared to last year, with higher planned investment spend, partially offset by higher organic sales. This segment benefited from positive price cost in the quarter. Lifecycle Services segment margin was 8.1% and declined 820 basis points driven by the reversal of temporary pay actions, the reinstatement of incentive compensation as well as unfavorable mix, partially offset by higher sales. The next slide, 11, provides the adjusted EPS Walk from Q4 fiscal '20 to Q4 fiscal '21. As you can see, core performance was up about $0.70 on a 12.6% organic sales increase. Approximately $0.10 was related to nonrecurring accelerated investments that we announced earlier this year. These investments are mostly in our Software & Control segment. The reversal of temporary pay actions and restoration of incentive compensation contributed negative $0.45. Acquisitions were a $0.15 headwind due to the deal costs associated with the Plex acquisition. As previously noted, our lower adjusted effective tax rate contributed $0.40. Slide 12 provides a walk from our Q4 midpoint in our July guidance to our actual Q4 adjusted EPS results. We usually don't provide this information, but I wanted to show how the quarter played out relative to the midpoint of what we had guided back in July. The unforeseen impact of the Delta variants in Southeast Asia added incremental pressure to the supply chain, but the impact of the volume miss of $0.40 was mitigated to lower incentive compensation, further productivity and a favorable mix, all of which contributed $0.35. As previously noted, a more favorable tax rate benefited our EPS versus guidance by $0.25. Moving to Slide 13, product order trends. This slide shows our average daily order trends for our products, which includes our software portfolio. As a reminder, the trends shown here account for about 2/3 of our overall sales. Order intake was broad-based and improved sequentially for the fifth consecutive quarter. Q4 product order levels grew at about 40% versus the prior year and are well above pre-pandemic levels as customers are increasingly interested in investing in our core automation and software, both of which are essential to drive the outcomes that come from digital transformation. Slide 14 provides key financial information for the full year fiscal '21. Reported sales grew 10.5%, including over 1 point coming from acquisitions. Organic sales were up 6.7%, led by double-digit growth in our Hybrid and Discrete end markets and improving process verticals. Full year segment margins remained at about 20%, including close to $30 million of onetime accelerated investments, mostly in our Software & Control segment. R&D expense was up 14% compared to fiscal '20, and R&D as a percent of sales increased further to 6% of sales in fiscal '21. Our core automation, which excludes the impact -- excuse me, our core conversion, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, currency and our accelerated onetime investments, was 34%. Corporate & Other was up just over $20 million, mostly related to acquisition costs associated with the Plex acquisition. Adjusted EPS was up 20%. A detailed year-over-year adjusted EPS Walk can be found in the appendix for your reference. Free cash flow performance remained strong and was in line with our July expectations. Free cash flow conversion was 103% of adjusted income. Finally, ROIC remained well above our target of over 20%. For the year, we deployed about $3.3 billion of capital towards acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases in fiscal '21. Our capital structure and liquidity remains strong. Let's move on to the next slide, 15, guidance for fiscal '22. As Blake mentioned, we are expecting sales of about $8.2 billion in fiscal '22, up 17.5% at the midpoint of the range. We expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 14% to 17% and about 15.5% at the midpoint of our range. This outlook includes our latest assumptions on supply chain constraints. We expect full year segment operating margins to be about 21.5%. We expect positive price/cost for the full year from the additional price increase we implemented this month. At the midpoint of our guidance, assumes full year core earnings conversion of between 30% and 35%. We believe we are in the early stages of a cycle of sustained growth and are making investments to fuel this growth in '22 and beyond. Our fiscal '22 segment margin and core conversion outlook includes our plan to increase R&D and other growth-related investments by double digits. We expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17%. We do not anticipate any material discrete items to impact tax in fiscal '22. This rate is under current tax law. Should tax laws change, we would provide an updated outlook with the impacts from these changes. Our adjusted EPS guidance is $10.50 to $11.10. This compares to fiscal '21 adjusted EPS of $9.43. At the midpoint of the range, this represents 15% adjusted EPS growth. I will cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS Walk on the next page. From a calendarization viewpoint, based on our current supply chain availability, we expect our first quarter sales to be relatively flat compared to our Q4 of fiscal '21. Following the first quarter, we expect sequential sales to improve over the balance of the year. We expect segment margins and the adjusted EPS to decline sequentially in Q1 and then improve throughout the year in line with our sales volume and the timing of price increases. We anticipate recent price increases to having more substantial benefit in subsequent quarters given the timing of when customer agreements are renewed throughout the year. Also as a reminder, fiscal '21 Q1 included a nonrecurring $0.45 gain related to the settlement of a legal matter. Finally, we expect full year fiscal '22 free cash flow conversion of about 90% of adjusted income. This reflects a $155 million bonus payout for the fiscal '21 performance, $165 million of capital expenditures and funding higher levels of working capital to support higher sales. Our working capital is targeted to be aligned with our historic amount of about 12% of sales. A few comments -- additional comments on fiscal '22 guidance. Corporate & Other expense is expected to be around $125 million. Net interest expense for fiscal '22 is expected to be about $115 million. And finally, we're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of about 117.5 million shares. The next slide, 16, provides the adjusted EPS Walk from fiscal '21 to fiscal '22 guidance at the midpoint. Moving from left to right, core performance is expected to contribute $2.15. This includes the benefit of higher organic sales. We anticipate price realization will exceed input cost inflation by about $0.10. Our pricing philosophy is built on the high value that we bring our customers. In light of increasing input costs, we have taken several price adjustments this year to mitigate, and we are prepared to take additional price actions as needed. The removal of the onetime accelerated investments made in fiscal year '21 will be about a $0.20 benefit. The onetime gain from a legal matter that was settled in the prior year is a $0.45 headwind. Plex will be a $0.15 tailwind in fiscal '22, including the impact of incremental interest. We have included further information showing the impact of Plex in both fiscal '21 and fiscal '22 in our appendix. No real significant changes to what we showed in July. We expect about a $0.05 impact coming from share dilution, and the higher tax rate is expected to be about a $0.75 headwind. Moving on to the next slide, 17, I'll make a few comments on our capital deployment framework. Our long-term capital deployment priorities remain the same. Our first priority is organic growth. After that, we focus capital deployment on inorganic activities. And then we focus on capital returns to shareholders, through our dividends and then share repurchases. In addition to our organic and inorganic investments, our capital deployment plans for fiscal '22 include a focus on delevering, dividends of about $520 million and share repurchases of $100 million. In summary, our guidance assumes a combination of order and backlog growth that drives 15.5% organic sales at the midpoint and reaches the total sales of over $8 billion. We continue to offset inflationary pressures through additional price actions yielding segment margins of 21.5%. We expect adjusted EPS growth of 15% and continued strong free cash flow. With that, I'll turn it over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start the Q&A. Blake Moret : Thanks, Nick. As we look forward to fiscal '22, strong order trends and record backlog underpin a robust top line outlook. We are making investments in our capacity, technology and people to support our future growth. Our people delivered great results this year, and I want to take a moment to recognize their tremendous work during especially challenging times. As the world recovers, investments in automation and digital transformation have never been more top of mind. Nobody is better positioned to help industrial customers be more resilient, agile and sustainable. As many of you will see at our upcoming Investor Day, we're taking manufacturing to a whole new level and look forward to a great year ahead. Let me now pass the baton back to Jessica to begin the Q&A session. Jessica Kourakos : Thanks, Blake. Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible. So please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Chris, let's take our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : What are your customers saying? Like when you think about kind of the issue here with not just labor, materials and kind of cadencing projects, I mean it seems like every day we see some sort of multibillion-dollar announcement. But there's also that reality that there's just so many integrators and other folks who can get this stuff done. So I know your guide for fiscal 1Q is relatively conservative, but you have things snapping back right after that. What are your customers saying, at least, about their ability or what they think their ability to, at least, get projects done on time today looks like? Blake Moret : Well, sometimes it's useful to look at our own plans as a manufacturer in our own right. And our investments, I think, are broadly indicative of what a lot of customers in different industries are doing. They're looking to make sure that they have the capacity to meet the current demand but also looking to get in place the capacity punch new lines of business and find new ways to win, and that's language that we've used, but we're hearing that from a lot of our customers as well. So in some cases, it's just meeting the capacity demands. When we look at semiconductor, and when we look at life sciences in some of these areas, it's to meet current capacity in well-known areas. In other cases, people are looking to launch new lines of business with EV probably being the best known of that. They're very eager to take delivery of our products. And one of the things that we have is the intimacy through our own salespeople as well as through our distribution of line of sight to these projects that are driving the demand and when they're needed. So we're not just guessing when they might need these products, we know what projects they're going into and when those projects are expected to start. To be sure, there's certainly some delays in those projects that our customers are seeing, but they're trying to get these -- this capacity up and running just as soon as possible. Scott Davis : Yes. That makes a lot of sense. And how do you think about -- I mean are you -- I assume your pricing -- your -- you have tremendous pricing power right now? I mean there has to be somewhat a shortage in the industry overall. Is that -- you talked just about price and then I'll pass it on. Blake Moret : Yes. I'll make a couple of comments, and then Nick can add to that as well. I mean we're looking at expanding margins in the coming year taking share in some important industries and product areas and building the foundation for the future, and we're doing it with select pricing increases. I think one of the things that bears mentioning is the tools that we've implemented for pricing have dramatically improved over the last couple of years. So pricing can be a real science with a lot of analytics. And I think we've significantly upgraded the tools and the talent so that we can get price where the market bears that, but also where we can reserve the right to be selectively aggressive to win share. Nick? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes, I'll just add a couple of things, Scott. Our pricing philosophy is built on this high value we are bringing to our customers. And what we're seeing with increasing input costs, we have taken several price adjustments in fiscal year '21. And we're prepared to take additional price actions as needed if input costs increased more than what we're anticipating at this point. So we do command premium prices in the market. It's reflected in our margins. And we continue to focus on the value we are creating for our customers and the relationships we have there. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : You highlighted ARR of plus 18% in the quarter. Can you just talk about what are the key drivers? And how should we think about this strong exit rate into '22? Blake Moret : Yes. So very happy with the development of our ARR, both in terms of the percentage growth and then the step change that we received from acquisitions like Plex. And -- so we're currently looking at an ARR of over 8% of the company's total, and we're continuing on that path. If you think about the main elements of ARR in the company, it starts with software, software subscriptions, software delivered as a service and the associated technical support which is also delivered as a contract either bundled with the software or as a separate subscription or software that's still being sold as a perpetual license. But we also have some interesting additional areas, cybersecurity infrastructure as a service. So our industrial data center that comes its hardware with the software and the services bundle to be able to monitor network traffic on-premise has been a great offering that we've had. It's a good business in its own right, and it also pulls through a lot of additional opportunities because it's a different set of decision makers. So those are really the primary areas, and we continue to look to expand with the opening of our new software this year to be able to offer additional services that are bought as a subscription as we develop and release organically developed software that's sold as a service that's running in the cloud. I'm very happy with the robust outlook for growth of existing offerings plus new product introductions, a number of which you'll see next week at Automation Fair. Andrew Obin : So I guess, we'll wait until the Analyst Day to hear more about that. But can you just highlight oil and gas improvement? Can you just give more detail by end market, especially North America? I'm looking at sort of upstream, midstream, brownfield, greenfield, just a little bit more color there? Blake Moret : Yes. So we did -- we were encouraged by the development of oil and gas in the fourth quarter and the outlook for fiscal '22. Our oil and gas is about 60% -- it's about 60% in upstream, with most of the remainder in midstream. So we're not really doing a whole lot in the downstream side. We do provide power control products and MAVERICK is doing work downstream often with our safety offering. But the majority of our business is in the upstream, and we were happy to see both sequential and year-over-year growth. In the fourth quarter, we saw particularly strong orders from Sensia and the growth was contributed to by all of the regions. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : I'm sorry. You got me there now. Just a couple of questions. Just first on price, I don't know if you said it, but could you be specific on the amount of price you actually achieved in 2021? And what's embedded in 2022? We see the positive price/cost spread, obviously, of $0.10, but I'm curious on the actual nominal price capture involved here? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes, Jeff, we had a little over 1% price growth in fiscal year '21, and we're projecting an approximately 2% net price growth in '22. However, I will be quick to caution that is based on our current level of cost increases. We are prepared to increase that more if we see additional cost increases coming in that we haven't anticipated in our latest price adjustments. Jeffrey Sprague : And then also, I guess, investment spend would be embedded in the core number. But I think you said, Nick, you're growing at double digit. Are you growing at actually less than sales growth? I wonder if you could just kind of speak to what the actual rate of growth is? Actually, is it a tailwind inside that core number? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes. Jeff, that is accretive to our margins because it's not growing at the same pace as our sales, but it is in the -- as I said, double digits. It's from the low double digits. And Jeff, just to put some color on it, we see ourselves in the early stages of a cycle of sustained growth. And we are making investments in '22 to fuel that growth both in '22 and then beyond. And so we are increasing our spending in '22 on R&D and other growth-related investments. Some of the places we're investing, Jeff, we're investing in some key products and software development projects, mostly in Software & Control. We're investing in customer-facing selling resources, and the addition of some travel and customer-facing expenses that had gone down during the pandemic. And we're also expanding investments in our plant capacity. So those are some of the big areas, Jeff, where you're seeing investment spend increase in '22. Jeffrey Sprague : And I'm sorry, if I could just squeeze one more in. Nick, could you just elaborate a little bit more on Q1? I mean actually, it would be normal for Q1 sales to decline sequentially, I think, and you have them flat. So the idea that EPS may decline sequentially does just jump out a little bit. Maybe just elaborate what's going on with price cost or other things to drive to that outcome in the quarter? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes, Jeff, what we are seeing is our Q1 sequential with Q4, that's really based -- from a revenue standpoint, it's based on what we are anticipating from supply chain constraints and that, that will be keeping our revenue flat as we move from Q4 into Q1. From a margin standpoint and an EPS perspective, some of our price increases that we have implemented will be impacting the later quarters of '22 more than they will be impacting the first quarter of '22. So part of what I'm sharing, as I say, what we expect for margin in the first quarter of '22 is impacted by the timing of price increases -- impacting our revenue and our margins as we go through the year. We also expect that cost increases from a year-on-year perspective will be most pronounced in our first quarter. And then from an EPS perspective, I will just point out first quarter of last year, we had a $0.45 gain from a legal settlement, and that will not be repeating. Operator : Our next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Joshua Pokrzywinski : And just first question, I guess, on the backlog. Like you talked about it several times kind of a source of strength in the next year. How much of the growth is really kind of catch up or conversion of maybe this excess or elevated backlog versus maybe commentary on the underlying end markets? Blake Moret : So as we talked about backlog of $2.9 billion is at a huge level. And we said about 40% of that is Lifecycle Services, reflecting the strengthening dynamic of our longer cycle project business, which includes a high process content. And then you, of course, have the product backlog that's being built by those enormous order quarters in Intelligent Devices and also in Software & Control. So we have a huge tailwind coming from that, but we see continuing demand. The demand remains strong coming in. And so it really is a mix, but the sharply increased sales in '22 is due to strength and secular tailwinds, let's say, investment themes and a number of the industries that we're serving. And just in general, as people are building in resilience and agility into their basic operations, we think that, that is part of what's being reflected in our orders intake and the subsequent sales growth in '22. And we're making the investments to be a beneficiary of those trends beyond '22 as well. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Okay. And then maybe just a coincidence, but everything from like an end market perspective, up 15% is pretty strong, but also strangely level, I guess, on one hand, maybe a good economic indicator, but also says that nothing at the end market basis is sort of standing out. Is there anything that can sort of be added to that? Or anything maybe at the product level that tells a different story? Blake Moret : Sure. I think if you go 1 level deeper in some of those end markets, in automotive, obviously, EV investment for capital projects is coming out. And so that's at a high level. You look at life sciences, there's obviously the work there associated with COVID treatments and vaccines. We're a little surprised by the uniformity, but I think each one has its own story. Oil and gas, we love it to be part of the pack again, so to speak. So I think if you go through each one, you can see that. And then obviously, there's some regional variation as well. Operator : Our next question is from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Just wanted to follow up on the free cash flow topic. Nick, I know you made some comments around that in the prepared remarks, but the free cash flow, I think, is guided about $1.1 billion. That would imply the same free cash flow dollar number for sort of 5 years in a row now. So I just wondered if there's something maybe in the business mix as you're shifting towards more ARR or more software-focused that's becoming a drag on the cash flow near term as the business model sort of shifts? Or do you just view it as each year, there's some onetime headwinds that are kind of keeping that free cash flow sort of stuck at that number, even as the sales and adjusted profit is growing? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes. Julian, the biggest story in the 90% free cash flow conversion for us in '22 is really the higher revenues and that's -- and the working capital that we're putting in place to go with those higher revenues. That's the single biggest thing. Secondary things that we are seeing, Julian, are the payout of our bonus in '22 related to the '21 performance. And then we're also increasing our CapEx investment in light of the higher demand for our products. But no, in terms of our mix and anything going on from that perspective, that's not really having an impact, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Understood. And then just trying to follow up on the topic of sort of backlog and conversion. So I think your backlog is worth about 1/3 of your fiscal '22 revenue guide. And you said it was $2.9 billion, your guide is 8 2. Just wondered sort of as you look at sort of backlog conversion today, is the main assumption that it's slower right now because of supply constraints, that conversion into revenue then accelerates from January, February and also your incoming orders pace continues to grow over the balance of the year. Is that the sort of the way to think about backlog and orders? Blake Moret : In a word, yes. That's right. And I should mention the quality of the backlog, we think, is good since it's a higher percent of products than you would normally expect in terms of the traditional split of our backlog because of the longer lead times with some of those products Operator : Our next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : Just on this topic of investment spend. I think you guys have this like a bucket of like $2 billion that you use on the P&L to talk about investment spend. I think you threw in CapEx in the discussion with maybe Jeff it was. What is that $2 billion going to grow this year? And then what is the number net of the decline in onetime? So if you include the onetime impact, what is the year-over-year growth or absolute headwind, however you want to talk about it, on that $2 billion of investment spend that typically runs through the P&L? Nicholas Gangestad : So Steve, we had approximately $30 million of onetime spend that we did in fiscal year '21. That's not repeating. Then to our total fiscal year '22 of the roughly $2 billion of investment spend, that's what we're saying is going up double digits in '22, low double digits actually. So there's a little over $200 million of increase there in investment spend. C. Stephen Tusa : Parts of the bridge that you want to call out on that on this front, whether it's some of the incentive comp or -- sorry, it was on a call earlier, you may have highlighted it, but anything else in the bridge moving around? Nicholas Gangestad : We have some onetimes that impacted us in fiscal year '21 that we're pointing out that those will not repeat. Also, the tax rate is based on current tax law. If this tax law does change, we would update what we expect for that. But Steve, those are a couple of the things I'd just point out. Operator : Our next question is from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : Blake, this is your third quarter in a row with orders of $2 billion or more, and they've continued to go higher without larger projects this quarter. I know we've asked you this before, but do you get any sense that some of the strength has been customers getting in mind or double ordering? And given it still seems early your process automation recovery and the inorganic additions you've made at the company, is it reasonable to think that orders can maintain or even grow from these levels over the next few quarters? Blake Moret : Yes. So in Q4, there certainly were some pull-ins in the quarter. But as we talk to our sales force and distribution, we think it's well under 10% of the total. So we think the vast majority of what we're seeing is underlying demand, and it's broad-based across multiple industries. So we do believe, and we're seeing this into October. We continue to see strong demand coming from customers as some of these secular tailwinds that we've talked about, and you pick the industry, are investing, whether it's in transportation or food and beverage, life sciences. Chemical is expected to have decent growth in the coming year for building chemicals and packaging chemicals. So you can see it from a variety of places. And so we're very optimistic about continued order growth in the year, particularly because we're talking to customers about new things, new capabilities that 24, 36 months ago, we didn't have in our portfolio. But there's a pretty significant expansion of what we can talk to customers about in all 3 of our business segments. Andrew Kaplowitz : And Blake, I wanted to follow up on some of the comments you made on EV. Obviously, during the quarter, there were several additional announcements of planned CapEx by some of your customers, EV battery facilities. And you mentioned that your EV business led 15% automotive growth, despite big production declines from many of your customers. So can you give us more color into what your for EV-related business in FY '22? We know you're seeing automotive up mid-teens. And how much of that is just auto build recovery versus what could be the opportunity for you in EV? Blake Moret : Yes. I think the majority of it is getting our new models on the road. That's how where these traditional brand owners are getting out there with EV and how the start-ups stay in business, getting a return on the investments that have been made in them. For scale, you think about automotive being about 8% of Rockwell's total business with EV about 1/4 of that, so about 25%. And we expect over multiple years EV and associated battery are going to be a strong driver of growth for us. And that's around the world. I mean you look at the wins that we're getting in China associated with battery and EV. And it's clearly a calling card for us. We look at the wins, the opportunities that we have with Plex in the Tier providers. All of these things, I think, are positive for us. Operator : Our next question is from Markus Mittermaier with UBS. Markus Mittermaier : I wanted to come back to backlog and pricing, if I could, and link the 2. I wonder sort of how much ability you have in the existing backlog to adjust prices there if need be? Nicholas Gangestad : Markus, the significant majority of our backlog, we are not repricing. There is a relatively small portion of our backlog that has more dynamic prices that we can adjust. So we are not changing the prices in our product backlog. But as Blake mentioned earlier, when we look at our total backlog and as we work through some of that in '22, it's favorable. It's favorable in terms of the mix that we're seeing there. So we don't expect it to be dilutive. We actually expect it to be accretive to us in '22. Markus Mittermaier : That's helpful. And then, Blake, you've mentioned share gains in motion. I wonder if you could elaborate a little bit on that, which regions, which product categories and what's the ultimate driver there? Blake Moret : So I mentioned motion control, and we're seeing share gains from a couple of places. First of all, our traditional products that are controlling the motion of a more traditional motor, we have some very strong products there and they're fit in an overall integrated control and information architecture are doing very well. We had some product releases of organically developed products last year that get to the more price-sensitive markets like China, and we've seen some good uptick in our kinetics products there. But an area that we've talked, especially about in the last few quarters, is independent cart technology. And so it's linear motion control and due to its ability to save space on machinery acceleration and deceleration rates, the integration as part -- a fundamental part of the machinery really gives us a very differentiated offering in a variety of industries around the world. So it can be used in power transmission in vehicles. It can be used in tire building, in packaging, or food and beverage and life sciences. There's even some interesting applications that we're working on in mining. And so it's very versatile set of technology. We bought 2 small companies to get into that to complement actually a technology we've had for many years, and then we'll continue to invest and build it into the overall automation architecture. So we're very happy with the growth that we're seeing there, which continues at strong double digits. Jessica Kourakos : Operator, we'll take one last question. Operator : Certainly. Our final question is from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : Certainly, the acquisition of AVATA seems very timely with supply chain management challenges that seem ramping across the industries. And like you've often talked about Rockwell's own manufacturing journey being a great test case for customers. Curious, how do you think say, having AVATA and the ability to manage supply chain and the cloud solution? How might that impact or be able to impact you going forward just to gain increased control and visibility of your own supply chain? And how do you see it benefiting the customers? Blake Moret : Well, we're excited about using the technology in our own operations. So we've got a pretty good system on the floor and taking that data into information systems today. But one of the real excitement for a big company like Rockwell in a cloud-based solution is the ease of implementation for the same reasons that small- and medium-sized businesses like it because they may not have an IT department to be able to manage a big fleet of computers in their plants. The ability to have a cloud-based approach is exciting when we make new acquisitions. When we open more agile plants around the world, the heavy lift that would come with more traditional systems may not be what's most appropriate. On the other hand, we're going to continue to do well with our on-prem MES offering because you have a lot of companies, particularly those in regulated industries that cannot change quickly. They need to have the ability to maintain a system with no change for many years. And so that on-prem system can be very helpful there. And so we see the 2 coexisting for a long time to come. Noah Kaye : That's helpful. And then just curious if you can comment on any potential shifts in customer spending from CapEx to OpEx? You mentioned Sensia seems to be recovering. Wondering, as many of the customer base, particularly on the process side, are being relatively disciplined with CapEx investments, whether this is a significant transition you're seeing? And any potential wallet share gains as a result? Blake Moret : Well, we think in Sensia for oil and gas, we think the fundamental value proposition is still as strong as when we entered into it. And we are seeing that reflected in our orders. In mining, as you said, those companies are being disciplined with their capital spend, even with super high commodity prices, we haven't seen a dramatic increase in the release of funds for big capital expenditures. Some of that's going to have to come because they only stay in business by having the ability to efficiently bring the resources to market. And we're talking to them about quotes. There's activity there, but we haven't seen it manifest itself yet. I did mention earlier, chemical is a process vertical. But we do see good growth in the teens over the year, and it's for things like construction resins as well as chemicals used in packaging because people are still getting lots of products and boxes delivered to them. Operator : Yes. This concludes the Q&A session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Kourakos for any closing remarks. Jessica Kourakos : Thanks, Chris. Thanks, everyone, for joining us. We look forward to seeing you next week, hopefully, and have a great day. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. At this time, you may now disconnect. Thank you.",

I need to remind everyone that today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. Later in the call, we\u2019ll open up the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Jessica Kourakos, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Kourakos, please go ahead. Jessica Kourakos : Thanks, Emma. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation\u2019s First Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include, and our call today will reference, non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today\u2019s call. Additional information and news about our company can also be found on Rockwell\u2019s investor relations twitter feed using the handle @InvestorsROK, that\u2019s @Investors R-O-K. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our Company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in our SEC filings. So with that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let\u2019s turn to our first quarter results on Slide 3. Total orders grew by more than 40% to over $2.5 billion, once again reflecting very strong demand across our portfolio of core automation and digital transformation solutions. Total revenue of $1.9 billion grew 19%. Organic sales grew 17% versus prior year, better than our expectations, despite significant supply chain challenges in the quarter. The manufacturing supply chain remains constrained due to extremely high levels of demand and persistent electronic component shortages. It\u2019s a very dynamic situation, and our global supply chain organization continues to navigate these challenges. We are taking a variety of actions, including qualifying additional semiconductor technology, and investing in capacity to increase our supply chain resiliency and support our growth. Turning now to our top line performance. Core automation sales and orders momentum was broad-based across our product lines, including Control, Visualization, Network, Motion, Power, Sensors and Safety. In the Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales increased 26% versus prior year, even with significant headwinds from supply chain. Software & Control was also impacted by supply chain constraints, but organic sales growth of 8% was above our expectations. We also had very strong orders growth in the segment. Of note, industrial PC orders at ASEM, our recent acquisition, were particularly strong and almost doubled from a year ago. In Lifecycle Services, organic sales increased 10% versus the prior year, led by double-digit growth at Sensia and our Solutions business. Demand is strongly increasing in this segment, as demonstrated by double-digit sequential orders growth and a 1.38 book-to-bill for the segment. Information Solutions & Connected Services grew double digits in both orders and revenue. Q1 sales were particularly strong across the entire Information Solutions portfolio as well as Kalypso\u2019s digital consulting services. Industrial cybersecurity demand was strong in the quarter and included a strategic win with one of the world\u2019s leading natural gas pipeline companies in North America. We also had a key win with one of the largest Beverage manufacturers in EMEA, demonstrating how our industrial cyber business continues to create new ways for us to win. Our investments in the cloud are also showing very good traction. Another notable win in the quarter was with The Shyft Group, formerly known as Spartan Motors. The Shyft Group is a global leader in the commercial vehicle industry and a big beneficiary of EV and last mile delivery trends. Here, Plex\u2019s Smart Manufacturing Platform was chosen to enable best practices across their operations, reduce material costs, automate quality processes, all while supporting high-speed line deployments. At Fiix, we had another great quarter, with their ARR growing over 40% and over 600 new Fiix customers added in just the last 12 months. In the quarter, Rockwell expanded its presence within Lucid Motors, one of the top up-and-coming luxury EV companies in the world. Lucid had already selected Rockwell\u2019s FactoryTalk software to manage production and is growing the Fiix subscription base to ensure readiness and facilitate skilled resource effectiveness. This is a great example of the synergies we are already seeing across our cloud and on-prem software portfolios, and the positive contributions they are making to our overall business. I\u2019d also like to highlight the continued traction we see with our PTC partnership. The capabilities and versatility of the combined solution has contributed to our significant software portfolio differentiation and has become a great way to win with customers. In summary, I\u2019m very happy with how these digital offerings are contributing to our recurring revenue base, including contributions from our organically developed software, PTC, and our recent acquisitions. In the quarter, total ARR grew by over 50% and organic ARR grew double digits. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 4 where I\u2019ll provide a few highlights of our Q1 end-market performance. Each of our industry segments showed strong, double-digit, year-over-year organic growth. And as we\u2019ve said, our strong orders are reflective of underlying demand. Advance orders for longer lead time products that are not immediately needed made up about 10% of the total. In our Discrete industry segment, sales grew approximately 20% versus the prior year. Within this industry segment, Automotive sales grew mid-teens, led by a 50% increase in EV capital project activity around the world and strong growth in EV battery, led by our independent cart technology. Semiconductor sales grew over 25% in the quarter, with strong double-digit growth in all regions. Significant greenfield project activity is leading to our strong growth at semiconductor-focused engineering firms and machine builders. eCommerce was our fastest-growing vertical, with sales growing approximately 50% over the prior year. eCommerce orders included a series of multi-million dollar wins to automate new fulfillment centers throughout North America for a well-known eCommerce provider. We believe our strong differentiation in Motion, including advanced material handling technology, and support services are driving market share gains in this fast-growing vertical. Turning now to our Hybrid industry segment. The verticals in this segment also had a terrific quarter. Food and Beverage grew over 20% in Q1, with broad growth across the regions. Once again, SKU expansion, end-of-line automation, and the need for greater manufacturing flexibility are important trends requiring greater levels of automation. We believe the steady pipeline of greenfield and brownfield project opportunities, our deep relationships with machine builders, and our strong technology differentiation are driving record demand in this key vertical. Life Sciences sales grew over 10% in Q1, off of an extremely strong quarter last year and remains one of our fastest-growing verticals in fiscal 2022. We have significantly invested in this area of our business over the last few years and believe we are well-positioned to gain more share through broader and deeper offerings and expertise. Our fastest growing vertical in the Hybrid segment this quarter was Tire, which grew about 35% in the quarter. This is another great vertical that is investing heavily in innovation. Turning to Process, this industry segment grew approximately 15%, led by improving trends in upstream and midstream Oil and Gas. Our Sensia joint venture had strong sales and orders in the quarter, led by strength in process automation and lift control solutions. Sensia\u2019s digitalization solutions are well suited to the energy industry\u2019s desire to improve productivity and extend the useful life of existing infrastructure, as well as the desire to use modern technology to improve safety and reduce environmental impact. As operating and capital budgets increasingly open up, we believe Sensia is well-positioned for double-digit growth in fiscal 2022. Turning now to Slide 5 and our Q1 organic regional sales performance. North America organic sales grew by 16% versus the prior year, with strong double-digit growth across all three industry segments. EMEA sales increased 15%, driven by strength in Food and Beverage and Tire and Metals. Asia-Pacific was our fastest growing region in Q1, growing 25%, with broad-based growth led by Semiconductor and Food and Beverage. In China, we saw double-digit growth driven by strength in Tire, Food and Beverage, Chemical, and Mass Transit. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 6 to review highlights for the full year outlook. We now expect orders for the year to exceed $9 billion, which is above what we expected just a few months ago and really taking our business to a whole new level. We continue to expect total reported sales growth of 17.5%, including 15.5% organic growth versus the prior year. Our projections reflect a detailed review of supply chain constraints by supplier and product line over the course of the year, but as we\u2019ve said before, these constraints remain very dynamic. We continue to expect double-digit growth in both Core Automation as well as Information Solutions and Connected Services. Acquisitions are off to a good start and expected to contribute two points of profitable top line growth. We are maintaining our margin expectation and adjusted EPS target of $10.80 for the year, which represents about 15% growth at the midpoint of the range compared to the prior year. I should add that we continue to expect another year of double-digit annual recurring revenue growth, including our recent Plex acquisition, which adds approximately $170 million to our ARR totals in fiscal 2022. A more detailed view into our outlook by end market is found on Slide 7. I won\u2019t go into the details on this slide, but as you can see, there is no change to the outlook for our three industry segments. With that, let me now turn it over to Nick, who will elaborate on our Q1 results and financial outlook for fiscal 2022. Nick? Nick Gangestad : Thank you, Blake, and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll start on Slide 8, first quarter key financial information. First quarter reported sales were up 19% over last year. This is slightly better for the quarter than we expected and indicated in November. We saw some improvements in the timing of electronic component shipments from our suppliers that resulted in a stronger first quarter than we anticipated. Q1 organic sales were up 17% and acquisitions contributed 2.6 points to total growth. Currency translation decreased sales by under 1 point. Segment operating margin was 19.1%, better than expected and improved sequentially from Q4. Our stronger sales performance improved our margins in the quarter. Versus last year, our margins declined 70 basis points due to higher planned spend and negative price/cost, both in-line with expectations. These were both partially offset by the impact of higher sales. Corporate and other expense was $29 million. Our adjusted EPS in the quarter was $2.14. Q1 of fiscal year 2021 included a non-recurring favorable legal settlement of $0.45. Excluding the prior year favorable legal settlement, adjusted EPS grew 11% versus the prior year. I\u2019ll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter was 15.3% and in line with the prior year. Free cash flow was negative by $50 million in the quarter and down compared to prior year due to the payout of the fiscal 2021 bonus, an increase in our working capital to serve our strong demand, and higher planned tax payments. One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased 151,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $49 million. On December 31, $503 million remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. Total reported sales grew double digits across all three of our segments. Intelligent Devices grew organic sales by 26%. Compared to last year, Intelligent Devices margins expanded 430 basis points to 23.7%, on higher sales despite a price/cost headwind. Software & Control organic sales were up 8%. Segment margins for this segment declined 730 basis points compared to last year, with higher planned investment spend, and the impact of acquisition integration costs, partially offset by higher organic sales. This segment also saw negative price/cost in the quarter. Lifecycle Services grew organic sales by 10%. Segment margin was 5.5% and declined 340 basis points driven by higher planned investment spend, unfavorable project mix, and higher input costs, partially offset by higher sales. Margin is expected to grow through the balance of the year as a result of strong sales growth and a higher margin backlog. The next Slide 10, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q1 fiscal 2021 to Q1 fiscal 2022. Starting on the left. Core performance was up about $0.55 on a 16.8% organic sales increase. Approximately $0.20 was related to temporary pay actions that were benefiting the prior year and have since been reversed. This is the last quarter that we have this in our prior year comparables as a headwind. Currency was slightly unfavorable by about $0.05. Acquisitions had a negative impact of $0.10, mostly related to Plex. We continue to expect that Plex, including the impact of interest expense will be breakeven in fiscal year 2022 EPS and up $0.15 from fiscal year 2021. As a reminder, our prior year EPS included a non-recurring legal settlement gain of $0.45. This brings us to our total EPS of $2.14. Let\u2019s move on to the next Slide 11, guidance for fiscal 2022. We are reaffirming our sales guidance of about $8.2 billion in fiscal 2022, up 17.5% at the midpoint of the range. We expect organic sales growth to be in a range of 14% to 17%, and 15.5% at the midpoint of our range. This guidance is based on our current view of electronic component availability. By quarter, we see Q2 sales improving sequentially low to mid-single digits with continued improvement in the second half of the year. Our first half is expected to be in line with our initial projections with our first quarter being a little stronger and our second quarter coming in a little lower due to timing of electronic component availability. We are pleased with our supply chain team\u2019s ability to navigate through this dynamic environment and keep the focus on serving our customers. We expect full year segment operating margin to be about 21.5%. We continue to expect slightly positive price/cost for the full year. We expect the first half impact of price/cost on margins to be dilutive by approximately 200 basis points, and that the margin impact in the second half from price/cost will be accretive by over 100 basis points. Given the first half of the year negative impact of price/cost, we expect margins in the second quarter to be similar to Q1 margins, with the positive impact from higher sales being offset by higher sequential input costs. We expect the phasing of our price increases along with higher sales will significantly benefit margins in the second half of the year. Our full year view on margins and the impact of price/cost on those margins remains unchanged. We continue to expect full year core earnings conversion of between 30% and 35%. We are on track to grow our R&D and other growth-related investments by double digits. These investments will position us well as we drive sustained growth in 2022 and beyond. We continue to expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17%. We do not anticipate any material discrete items to impact tax in fiscal 2022. We are also reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance of $10.50 to $11.10. At the midpoint of the range, this represents 15% adjusted EPS growth. Finally, we are projecting full year fiscal 2022 free cash flow conversion of about 90% of adjusted income. This reflects a $155 million bonus payout made in quarter one for the fiscal 2021 performance, $165 million of capital expenditures and funding higher levels of working capital to support significantly higher sales growth. Our working capital target is aligned to our historical amount of about 12% of total sales. A few additional comments on fiscal 2022 guidance. Corporate and other expense remains around $125 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2022 is expected to be about $115 million, and we\u2019re assuming average diluted shares outstanding of about 117.5 million shares. Finally, on capital deployment, no change to our strategy or fiscal 2022 priorities. Our first priority is organic growth. After that, we focus capital deployment on inorganic activities. Then we focus on capital returns to shareholders, through our dividend, and then share repurchases, and we continue to focus on delevering in fiscal year 2022. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Blake Moret : Thanks, Nick. Strong order trends and record backlog underpin a robust top line outlook for fiscal 2022. As we said last quarter, we are making investments in our capacity, technology, and people to support our future growth. We are investing in our operations to expand capacity by $500 million per quarter, while at the same time increasing the resiliency of our supply chains. We made significant progress in the quarter to release FactoryTalk SaaS offerings, including new Plex smart manufacturing platform capabilities, and we\u2019ve expanded FiiX\u2019s applied AI capabilities. We also released the next version of Emulate3D to further our capabilities in creating and operating digital twins of production systems. A significant release of new Logix functionality is scheduled for next quarter. Importantly, last year\u2019s accelerated organic investments have allowed us to release new secure remote access functionality and cloud-based data management of automation design information earlier than originally anticipated. In summary, Q1 was a great start to the year. We\u2019ve been very busy capitalizing on the opportunities we see today, while at the same time building for the future. I want to take a moment to recognize the people in our organization and the tremendous work that went into these results during especially challenging times. We are making significant investments in existing and new talent and are empowering them with the technologies and resources to be successful. We continue to encourage fresh ideas from across the organization and look at ways to increase our value through the customer\u2019s eyes. I feel confident that investments in automation and digital transformation have never been more top of mind than they are today. As a pure-play leader devoted exclusively to these areas, we think our agility, our differentiated portfolio of products and services, our significant domain expertise, and our ecosystem of best-in-class partners, make us the best positioned company to benefit from what should be a significant, multi-year growth cycle. Let me now pass the baton back to Jessica to begin the Q&A session. Jessica Kourakos : Thanks, Blake. Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Emma, let\u2019s take our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is now open. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning, everybody. Blake Moret : Hey, Scott. Nick Gangestad : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : Good morning, everybody. But kind of \u2013 Blake, I wanted to ask about this Emulate3D, the digital twin stuff. Is that becoming the new kind of the standard to do a full kind of factory simulation digitally before you break ground? Is that becoming the norm? Or is that still kind of tip of the iceberg stuff? Blake Moret : I think \u2013 Scott, I think we\u2019re still climbing the adoption curve there. But everybody is aware of the promise of being able to simulate production systems before actually starting to run material through the line. And this is one of those areas that I think the pandemic accelerated, because you couldn\u2019t get everybody that you traditionally would have wanted to be on-site, shoulder to shoulder on a line commissioning a new line. And so the ability to go and to digitize your system to be able to tune it, to be able to get a good picture of what should happen takes you much further down the path without actually having to have people together and running product through a line in the traditional way. So we see the most advanced companies well into proofs of concept. We\u2019re heavily involved with them on that. And I should add, this is an area that the Kalypso acquisition and then followed by the more recent AVATA acquisition has really helped to complement the technology that we have with Emulate3D and some of the new Logix capabilities to have the people who can describe that holistically at the higher levels of the organization that are required to sign off on that sort of initiative has really been helpful for us. Scott Davis : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, Blake, historically, in the up cycle, you always have this unfavorable project mix, but there has got to be some supply and demand imbalances here, where supplying into these projects is going to be harder and harder just given how many projects there are. Is there a scenario that this cycle is a little bit different that you can price those projects and the bids more aggressively and have less of an unfavorable mix impact? Or is that just not how it works? Blake Moret : No. I think a couple of things. First of all, I do think that this cycle is going to be a little bit unusual. Now there\u2019s always some differences from one cycle to the next. But I think this one maybe a little bit elongated, because with the amount of longer-term capital investment in verticals wide semiconductor, where that new capacity is not going to come on for a while, where they still have to build an ecosystem of local partners around these big fabs. I think we could see a cycle that actually lasts a little bit longer than maybe that mean in the past. In terms of demand and being able to supply into this, right now, the bottleneck is the chips. We\u2019re working through that, but I still think that the material is getting out there and we are going to see the completion of these projects. I can\u2019t \u2013 I haven\u2019t seen any evidence that people are not moving forward with their expansion plans because of supply chain constraints. They\u2019re slowing them down, but everybody is trying to come out of the pandemic better positioned than their competitors in terms of capacity and new offerings, and I don\u2019t see that changing. Scott Davis : Okay. Good luck, Blake. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Andrew Obin : Hi, guys. Good morning. Blake Moret : Hey, Andrew. Nick Gangestad : Hey, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just first question, you guys sort of said that first quarter was better than expected and second quarter was a little bit weaker. And I think you cited price/cost and supply constraints. I guess the question we\u2019re hearing is that for a lot of companies actually the fourth quarter seems to be a big pinch point and you guys managed to do better than expected in the fourth quarter. So what specifically, I\u2019m just trying to figure out how it is you were able to get stuff out of the door in your first fiscal quarter. And why would it get worse in the second quarter? Thank you. Blake Moret : So Andrew, we have a broad base of suppliers. Obviously, it goes well beyond just the semiconductor suppliers. But even within that category, we\u2019re managing a broad base of suppliers because virtually all of our Intelligent Devices are intelligent. They have semiconductor based technology. We are in daily contact with our key suppliers through our supply chain organization and conversations that include me and my senior team. And basically, we were able to get a few more chips in the first quarter than we had originally forecast, but we\u2019re expecting the second quarter to be a little bit lighter. It\u2019s a dynamic situation, but the fundamental, I guess, framework you should think about is that with the enormous backlog that we have the new incoming orders are coming in on top of that. So the demand is not the constraint, and we don\u2019t expect it to be for quite some time to come. Nick, anything to add to that? Nick Gangestad : Yes. Our deal is what we were going to be getting for the first half of the year from for chips as our most significant component that just hasn\u2019t changed. Some of them came in a little earlier, and we were able to ship things out in the first quarter. The first half view of what we were going to get just did not change, Andrew. Andrew Obin : No, that makes sense. And maybe a follow-up question on Software & Control. You highlighted high planned investment spend. Can you just \u2013 versus your expectation, I just wanted to figure out where was the margin on Software & Control versus your expectation for the quarter? And how much of this investment spend were planned? And how much of it was discretionary in the quarter? And what were you spending money on? Thank you so much. Nick Gangestad : Yes, Andrew, it\u2019s \u2013 the Software & Control margins were actually just a little bit better than what we had in our internal planning. The investment spending is right in line with that total \u2013 for the total company, where, three months ago, we said that we\u2019d be upping our investment spend by approximately $200 million. Our first quarter, we executed exactly on that plan. It\u2019s roughly $50 million a quarter \u2013 over each quarter of last year that we\u2019re increasing. And that spending is as planned. We were also impacted in the margin in the first quarter by our continued spend on the acquisition integration costs. We expect that impact on the margin will diminish in the coming quarters as we work through the integration. So for the full year, Andrew, I know you didn\u2019t ask it quite this way, but we think the margins are going to continue to grow in Software & Control. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be of our total company margin expansion of 150 basis points, we largely think of Software & Control as largely flat compared to last year and the most of our margin expansion coming from Intelligent Device and Lifecycle Services. Now specifically, what we were spending on, we were spending on product development, software development in Software & Control. We also are spending more on our customer-facing selling resources and Software & Control is one piece of that as we are building more specialization in how we sell in some of the Software & Control products. So those are a couple of things that we\u2019ve increased our spending on. Blake will add a little more detail on that. Blake Moret : Yes. Andrew, just specifically in terms of the things within Software & Control, as we\u2019ve talked about, cloud-native software development in multiple products within the FactoryTalk Hub that we explored a little bit during Investor Day. There\u2019s also new visualization tools, hardware and software that are under development and then new hardware functionality around the Logix control system. We\u2019re going to have major new product releases in all three of those areas in the next 12 months. Andrew Obin : Thank you. This is super useful. And it was fun to hear Jim last night compliment you on your software growth as well. Thanks a lot. Blake Moret : Yes. Thank you. The PTC relationship is going well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Blake Moret : Hey, Jeff. Nick Gangestad : Hey, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Hey, good to catch up with everybody. And can we just delve a little bit more into the sequentials? And I know we touched on it a bit on the prior questions. But just thinking about margins being flat sequentially on higher revenues sequentially, is \u2013 so you addressed availability, but is price/cost actually worse in the second quarter also? Or is there something else going on in incentives or investment spend or something like that that would create that kind of lack of leverage on sequential revenue growth? Nick Gangestad : Yes, Jeff, in terms of price/cost, you\u2019re exactly right in what you\u2019re theorizing there. Price costs were negatively impacting us in the first quarter. They will even more negatively impact us in the second quarter, bringing that first half impact to that roughly 200 basis point negative impact on margin. Then from there, it starts to ascend the price/cost, and that will be getting substantially better in the third and fourth quarter on price/cost. And that\u2019s largely how we had this planned out at the beginning of the year when what we shared three months ago. I think the only dynamic that\u2019s been happening throughout \u2013 in the first three months is we are seeing costs go higher, and we\u2019re seeing our planned price actions go higher as well. So both of those moving in tandem to keep our net price/cost exactly what we said three months ago. Jeff Sprague : And so the expected relief in the second half is a function of continued price mounting and kind of anniversarying? Are you baking in actually cost relief in the back half? Maybe you could discuss. Nick Gangestad : No. I mean, of course, Jeff, that would be great to think that will happen, but we\u2019re not planning for cost relief. We are planning for continued cost inflation going in. It will be the price part and the phasing in of our pricing that will be positively impacting us in the second half of the year. Jeff Sprague : And then could you also just separately address how to think about the orders? And the nature of my question is $9 billion of orders, 10% long lead time stuff. So let\u2019s call it 90% shorter-cycle orders, maybe you want to use a different term, but that would kind of imply a little over $8 billion in orders on the short-cycle deliverable stuff. That\u2019s sort of where your revenue guide is plus or minus a little bit. Is that the way to think about just kind of the reaction function here between orders and conversion to sales? Or I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a little bit more complicated than that. But just maybe frame up how orders convert to sales and maybe that\u2019s changing because of the supply chain and other disruptions that we\u2019re dealing with. Blake Moret : Yes. Jeff, the other main component, I\u2019d say, of the equation is the very large entering backlog that we have there. So these orders \u2013 continued orders growth comes on top of historic levels of backlog. And even the longer lead time orders, and I\u2019ll describe that a little bit, those will likely shift or a large part of that will shift in the fiscal year. So when we say longer lead time, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s pushed down beyond the end of fiscal 2022. To be sure, we\u2019re going to have very large backlog in any scenario at the end of fiscal 2022 setting up for fiscal 2023. But let me give an example of what those advanced orders would be. So you think of an OEM that has big backlog in their own shop of machines to be built, and they would typically buy, let\u2019s say, three months of components from Rockwell, controllers and drives and servo amplifiers and so on. Because of the longer lead times, they may extend that out to six months\u2019 worth of component orders that they\u2019re placing on us. So that\u2019s the example where they have the demand. It\u2019s not speculative they just increased their advanced orders in that respect. And we look carefully at both that customer demand as well as distributor order patterns. We\u2019re working closely with them, and that gives us the confidence to say that this is representative of underlying demand that goes right to the end user. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thanks for the color. I\u2019ll pass the baton. Blake Moret : Yes. Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hey, good morning, guys. Blake Moret : Hey, Josh. Nick Gangestad : Hey, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : So maybe just on the Intelligent Devices margins first. I know we\u2019ve covered some ground there. But anything that you can tell us, Nick, about was there kind of inventory preposition just waiting for chips or something else that kind of goose the margin with this first wave, like price/cost getting worse here in the second quarter? Is it really as common \u2013 I think across the industrial universe is because price has been so high. Like anything that sort of gave you the kind of initial advantage, yes, when you were able to get that extra supply in this quarter. That goes away? Or is it just inflation? Nick Gangestad : The single biggest thing that was driving that margin expansion in the Intelligent Device \u2013 and we had high expectations for Intelligence Device margin as well in the first quarter. But what drove it even higher is the higher sales than what we were expecting. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m guiding that we\u2019re not planning margin expansion there in the total company sequentially because what we see for a bit of benefit from higher revenue in the second quarter as the low to mid-single digits I talked about, that will be largely offset by price/cost getting a little worse in the second quarter. Now what I would just describe in terms of our overall pricing philosophy here is we are seeking to price in a way to offset our input costs. And we\u2019re not pricing in a way to generate even more substantial profit after that but to largely offset the input cost inflation that we\u2019re seeing. We see opportunities for how we can be using our pricing to be gaining share around the world. And we are basically trying to offset it. That\u2019s why at three months ago now, we still see it slightly as a benefit to earnings per share but not a substantial difference there between input cost and price. Blake Moret : Yes. It\u2019s in line with the idea that we\u2019ve talked about of accelerating profitable growth, and we remain committed to the IDN or seeing this play out that nothing expands margins like top line growth. And so we think that we\u2019re striking a good balance between the near-term profitability and the investment to create an even brighter future. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just a follow-up on Jeff\u2019s question on orders. Interesting, that stat on the longer lead time stuff is it really a big part of the equation sort of suggests that customers aren\u2019t ordering earlier to try and secure their spot in the line. So I guess that\u2019s a good thing, but like is the only thing that\u2019s sort of delaying kind of convergence of orders and sales on what should be a shorter cycle business, just supply chain? Or is there some other kind of delay in the process, labor or something on the customer\u2019s end that kind of prevents us from converging near-term? Blake Moret : Josh, it\u2019s supply chain constraints. We\u2019ve got this enormous demand that\u2019s a result, I think, of three basic things. First of all, it\u2019s the secular trends that you\u2019re seeing play out across industries and geography, placing a higher degree of importance on automation and digital transformation than ever before. So it\u2019s secular. It\u2019s also cyclical. We are still early in what we believe is going to be a multi-year period of economic expansion. And then finally, it\u2019s our position in this market. And I think all three of those things are driving the demand. Nick Gangestad : Hey Josh, one thing I\u2019ll add is we\u2019ve invested in our own internal capacity that we do not see that as a constraint. So as Blake said, it\u2019s that component\u2019s availability and getting that, and we\u2019re equipped and ready to go for that as that ramps up. Blake Moret : Yes. And just a final point just to summarize, fiscal 2022 sales would be higher were it not for the supply chain constraints. So we\u2019re managing, as Nick said, our capacity, our labor based on very dynamic practices hand to hand around the world, making sure that we\u2019re acquiring talent, keeping talent, paying competitive wages, all those things, we\u2019re keeping ahead of it. Josh Pokrzywinski : Great. Appreciate the color. Best of luck guys. Blake Moret : Yes. Thanks, Josh. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Just wanted to circle back on the orders outlook again, so is the sort of assumption backing into that $9 billion-plus number for the year but you probably have a decent double-digit order growth year-on-year in Q2 and then maybe it\u2019s down year-on-year in the back half as supply chain conditions get easier but you\u2019ve got tougher comps as well. Is that the sort of the right way to think about orders over the balance of this year? Nick Gangestad : Hey Julian, we \u2013 based on what we\u2019re seeing and what we\u2019re expecting, we do think we are going to see order growth in our second quarter year-on-year order growth. And then second half of the year, you can do the own math of calculating what that would mean \u2013 of what that means if we\u2019re at $9 billion. Like whether it\u2019s up year-on-year or down a little, I think that\u2019s a little too fine of a point. But what we\u2019re seeing in second quarter so far, we think that\u2019s in line with that, and we think it\u2019s going to be growth year-on-year. Blake Moret : Yes. The other point I would just add is we\u2019ve continued to see this order momentum for multiple quarters now. And the trends are extending into January. So we see it, again, as reflective of underlying demand in multiple industries, and we can point to the specific investments based on the large greenfields that have been announced as well as on the ground individual salespeople from distributors, from our own people who are directly involved in these projects. So we feel very good about the overall demand. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then just my second question on the price cost aspect. So you mentioned some price \u2013 some extra price increases, but you\u2019ve left the organic sales guide in aggregate unchanged. So does that mean that pricing for the year as a whole is still not that different from that 2% type tailwind you\u2019d mentioned before? And then maybe just to clarify, when you talk about price cost, is that cost aspect solely sort of freight and logistics and components and labor is kind of separate from that? Nick Gangestad : I\u2019m going to take the second part of the question first, Julian. When we talk and think about price cost, it is exactly what you\u2019re saying, what we\u2019re paying for all the inputs as well as logistics costs. Labor is something that we\u2019ve largely managed around productivity and what we\u2019re doing there to improve the efficiency and productivity of our operations often are incentive to more than offset what we see of wage inflation there. So when we talk input costs, we\u2019re in the cost \u2013 price cost deflation, its input costs and logistics. Now in terms of pricing and our overall guide, yes, we have chosen to keep our organic growth guide the same three months ago, when as I indicated a 2% \u2013 roughly 2% price growth that we were planning for the full year. We think that\u2019s going to go up. I\u2019m not going to put a new number on it because we \u2013 I mean it\u2019s a dynamic situation with price and cost, but we see that number going up. We\u2019re focusing more on the net, keeping those net in balance and what the two parts of that equation are. So we kept the guide the same. I think it\u2019s likely in one quarter from now with things like FX, things like price, we\u2019ll be incorporating all of that into the guidance. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Blake Moret : Thanks, Julian. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Luecke with Bernstein. Your line is now open. Brendan Luecke : Good morning, all. Thanks for taking my question. Blake Moret : Hey Brendan. Brendan Luecke : As you talk to customers, are you seeing any early indications of shifting manufacturing footprints sort of on the back of the extended supply chain crisis? Or is this really more of a CapEx recovery story and share gain when you look at your growth projections? Blake Moret : I think its new investment. I would not look at it as shifting manufacturing, although I think manufacturing in North America is probably a larger percentage of a company\u2019s global investment than it has been traditionally. So I don\u2019t see people closing plants in Asia, for instance, and bringing them back as the majority of what\u2019s driving the demand. But I do see, as people are planning new capacity, whether it\u2019s brownfields or greenfields or upgrades adding digitization solutions to existing capacity. I see North America, and that obviously is our strongest market, as being an outsized beneficiary. So automation, in general, as I said before, from a secular standpoint is increasing. Then in the cycle, it\u2019s still early. And our position in high growth, high investment areas of both geography and technology are positive in what are driving a lot of this outlook. Brendan Luecke : Excellent. Thank you. Blake Moret : Thanks, Brendan. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Steve Tusa : Hey guys, good morning. Blake Moret : Hey, Steve. Nick Gangestad : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : Congrats on good execution here, kind of above seasonal. So it looks like you guys shoot through a little bit of that backlog at least. I just wanted to make that clear on the comments you just made. You\u2019re guiding Forex at zero. I think you\u2019ll have a headwind. If you snap the line today, what\u2019s that headwind on Forex, I would assume that, that would be a headwind for the year. Nick Gangestad : Yes, Steve. We \u2013 if I snapped the line earlier this week, it would be between a 1% and 2% negative impact. We chose \u2013 I chose not to be updating because it\u2019s volatile and we have enough volatility. I didn\u2019t want to be updating for just one component and not updating for all. So we have FX that\u2019s if I snap the top line right now, a little bit worse than our initial guide. We have price that is better than our initial guidance, and we have input costs that are higher than our initial guide. All in, we think that leads to an aggregate where we think our top line growth and EPS growth that we said three months ago still make the most sense. Steve Tusa : Right, right, right. Okay. Got it. And then how much \u2013 I have like $35 million for Plex revenues in the quarter. And then what were orders for Plex side \u2013 is there some sort of deferred revenue kind of booking dynamic there? I\u2019m not a software guy. So I feel like every time our companies do a software deal, there\u2019s like a bunch of orders that flow through in the first quarter. Can you just talk to revenues and orders at Plex? Nick Gangestad : Yes. Your numbers on Plex are just in terms of revenue, that\u2019s exactly where they were. Orders were substantially higher. My ballpark looking at it is about 20% higher than what our revenue was. Steve Tusa : Okay. It\u2019s kind of huge number thought it\u2019s not like you didn\u2019t rebook anything there in orders for them. Blake Moret : No. There is no \u2013 Nick Gangestad : No, no, no. Yes. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then just one last one on kind of the back half of the year, and anything to talk about as far as just keep in mind for third or fourth \u2013 third and fourth quarter dynamics? Nick Gangestad : Yes. I mean the biggest two things, Steve, or what I\u2019ve already talked about, in terms of revenue, we see continued sequential improvement as we are estimating and improved access to electronic components as we progress into our second half. In terms of margin and profitability, the single biggest dynamic is \u2013 that\u2019s going to be driving the margin up is the flip on price costs from negative to positive in the second half. And then also benefiting the second half is the improved leverage with the added sales that we\u2019d be having. That\u2019s the biggest dynamics going on in the second half. There isn\u2019t a another big thing going on there. Blake Moret : Yes. And I would just say continued very strong backlog. So just a simple math of what we shipped and what we booked indicates the backlog remains and even grows. So that remains healthy. Steve Tusa : Awesome. Thanks for all the details. Appreciate it. Blake Moret : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, guys. Blake Moret : Hey, Andy. Nick Gangestad : Hey. Andy Kaplowitz : Blake, you mentioned China strong double digits in Q1 and Asia-Pacific actually led your global growth. I know you still have easy comparisons in the Asia-Pacific, but I think you\u2019ve been talking about changing the way you go to market there and you\u2019re making investments in the region. So is Q1 results \u2013 is Q1 a result of those efforts? And then obviously, there seems to be some macro risk in the region. So could you give us a little more color into what you\u2019re seeing there? Blake Moret : Sure. Just specifically on China, if we look at the verticals that contributed to that strong double-digit growth, there was a Tire, which, in general, of course, continues to be a great vertical, and there\u2019s a lot of tire activity complementing the EV activity going on in China, and we\u2019re a beneficiary of that. Food and Beverage is an area where that worldwide is our single biggest vertical. And we\u2019ve had some great recent traction within China in Food and Beverage, Chemical and then Mass Transit. So these are industries that have generally been pretty good for us in China. And when I talk about new ways to get to market, it\u2019s really complementing our traditional distribution. But we\u2019ve also given our local leadership more empowerment to make investments that they say are appropriate with our relatively lower share in China. We think by doing basic things correctly, there\u2019s lots of room to run. And it\u2019s a combination of our core products as well as the new ways to win, Information Solutions & Connected Services. And those are really seen as a calling card getting into customers even when their installed base might be with competitive product, it\u2019s a way for engaging high level decision makers as we bring that new value to them. And those companies across Food and Beverage and Life Sciences and EV, they\u2019re all intensely interested in climbing the productivity curve fast. And so that\u2019s where we see particular endorsement of our software, which is a strong contributor in China as well as new disruptive technology like independent card, which we continue to win some very large orders in China based on independent card, particularly in EV and battery assembly. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks for that, Blake. And then, Nick, I know you didn\u2019t change your overall sales growth forecast. I mean, if I look, though, at the pieces of the end markets, it looks like you\u2019ve raised a little bit e-commerce, life sciences, oil and gas, you lowered chemicals. So if you sort of put that all together, I think last quarter, you told us that even with supply chain issues, you still \u2013 you felt relatively confident about your range even at the high end. Does the sort of implicit changes in these end markets that you made here this quarter suggest that you might even have more confidence, especially given the orders that you just recorded in Q1? Nick Gangestad : We \u2013 Andy, we remain confident that we\u2019re guiding exactly where we think it will be, but those small things that you\u2019re talking about, those are like more on the fringe that we think our guidance is based far less of a view of demand and far more by what we see of our ability to be procuring components and that view has not changed, and we continue to think where we\u2019re guiding is exactly what we\u2019re going to be able to deliver this year. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks, guys. Blake Moret : Thanks, Andy. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. Ms. Kourakos, I turn the call back to you. Jessica Kourakos : Thanks, Emma. Thanks, everyone. That concludes today\u2019s call. We appreciate your support and look forward to talking to you soon. Have a great day. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference call. At this time, you may disconnect. Thank you.",

Later in the call, we will open up the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Jessica Kourakos, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Kourakos, please go ahead. Jessica Kourakos : Thanks Rob. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's Second Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts included in our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call. Additional information and news about our company can also be found on Rockwell's Investor Relations Twitter feed using the handles @investorsrok, that's @investorsrok. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. So, with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks Jessica and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before providing detail on second quarter results, which were below our expectations, I want to provide general comments on the business environment. Through the first half of our fiscal ,year two themes stand out. The first is broad-based demand growth across industries, geographies, and offerings. Substantial backlog in all three business segments, low cancellation rates, and detailed component supply forecasts give us confidence that we will achieve double-digit revenue growth this fiscal year and reach $9 billion of profitable sales in the next couple of years. The second theme is persistent supply chain constraints and associated cost inflation, which put particular pressure on Q2 sales and earnings. Since our last earnings release in January, we've seen supplier push outs and de-commits for electronic component shipments, the impact of unexpected COVID-related shutdowns in China, and Russia started war in Ukraine. These have had an impact on our results and guidance. So, let's get into the detail on our quarter, the outlook, and what we are doing to maximize Rockwell's business performance and long-term value. Our second quarter results are summarized on slide three. Total orders grew by 37% ,once again reflecting very strong demand across our portfolio of core automation and digital transformation solutions. Total revenue grew 2% year-over-year in the quarter. Organic sales grew a little over 1% versus prior year, worse than our expectations due to the supply chain challenges. Through six months Rockwell's organic topline has grown 9% year-over-year. Orders momentum was broad-based across all three business segments. However, product shipments and solutions with significant hardware content were limited by multiple component shortages. In the Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales declined 3% versus prior year, a sharp reversal from the 25% growth in the first quarter, reflecting volatile components supply. Within this segment's motion business, sales of our Independent Cart Technology grew strong double digits and our orders more than doubled from a year ago. Software & Control organic sales grew a little less than 1%, also reflecting component shortages. We continue to see strong order growth in this business led by logic and visualization. In Lifecycle Services, organic sales increased 11% versus the prior year, led by 24% growth at Sensia. Demand is broadly increasing in Lifecycle Services as demonstrated by a 1.34 book-to-bill. Information Solutions & Connected Services grew strong double digits in both orders and revenue. Industrial cybersecurity demand was strong in the quarter with orders up 90% year-over-year, as customers in life sciences, food and beverage, mining and many other end markets are increasingly relying on us to provide the robust network technology and real-time domain expertise to keep their critical operations secure and resilient. In the quarter, one of our Plex wins was with Reautomotive, an automotive technology company and EV platform maker headquartered in the EMEA region, where our cloud-native smart manufacturing platform will enable the state-of-the-art plan with real-time production monitoring, inventory and quality management, creating an agile manufacturing system needed for customized electric vehicles. You will recall that globalizing market access for Plex' software was an important synergy to be realized through this deal. Last month, Plex also became available on Microsoft's Azure Cloud in Europe and we're partnering with Microsoft to promote this new capability. At Fiix, we had another great quarter with ARR growing over 40%. We continue to win new logos including our first wins in Asia. Our partnership with PTC continues to grow and in the quarter, we booked software subscriptions for digital performance management based on ThingWorx. This new solution helps identify prioritize and act on debottlenecking opportunities that have the greatest potential P&L impact in manufacturing sites. We combine great technology and domain expertise to create a very strong value proposition for our customers. In the quarter, organic ARR grew by 17%. Let's turn to slide 4. Our usual Q2 end market performance slide is in the appendix. It's important to understand that this quarter, sales growth have declined in specific industry verticals is primarily based on the particular products being shipped into these verticals and the degree they were impacted by component shortages rather than underlying demand. Working left to right on the slide, auto and e-commerce, two very important verticals we serve within our discrete industry segment were down in the quarter with the resulting single-digit decline for the discrete segment. The majority of sales to these verticals are in products, which were heavily impacted by component shortages that impacted our ability to ship to these customers. In contrast, orders for auto and e-commerce remain very strong. We continue to see large competitive wins with our Independent Cart Technology for motion control and battery applications. And about a third of our total auto business is expected to be for electric vehicle applications in the full year. We also had an important sustainability win this quarter at Electra Battery Materials, a leading provider of low-carbon and sustainable metals to the EV automotive sector. Rockwell was chosen to provide a turnkey solution for North America's first integrated and environmentally sustainable battery materials plant. In e-commerce and warehouse automation, we continue to win expansion projects with our flexible material handling technology and digital twin software. And in semiconductor our offerings can be found in chip making machinery, material handling equipment and building management systems at the largest semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment companies in the world. It is clear we are playing a critical role in this industry's plans for multibillion dollar capacity expansion. We continue to see strong broad-based demand in food and beverage with particular focus on digital transformation projects. Life sciences sales were up double digits as two-thirds of our life sciences business is in software, solutions and services that are less dependent on electronic components. Oil and gas sales were up double digits led by improving trends in upstream and midstream. Our Sensia joint venture had strong orders and ships in the quarter and is expected to grow strong double digits for the year. In summary, multi-year capital investments across many end markets coupled with higher automation and digital transformation intensity have created high backlog and a continuing strong order funnel to support growth in each industry segment we serve. Turning now to Slide 5 and our Q2 organic regional sales performance. North America organic sales declined by about 3% versus the prior year due to the higher mix of Intelligent Devices in this region. The Intelligent Devices segment was more heavily impacted by component shortages this quarter. We continue to expect more balanced sales growth across regions for the full year and expect North America to be the fastest-growing region in fiscal 2022. Latin America sales were up 13%. EMEA sales increased 6% and Asia Pacific grew 9% due in part to the higher solutions content in this region. In China, we saw high single-digit growth driven by strength in mass transit, life sciences, tire and oil and gas. Let's turn to Slide 6, which is a new slide we thought would be helpful this quarter. The high backlog, we've been building over the last few quarters and continued low cancellation rates, set the stage for strong revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2022 and beyond. We do expect lead times and backlog to stabilize over the next year. And at that point, orders and shipment levels will begin to converge, which is a good thing. In the near term, the primary limiting factor to growth is component availability. So as we turn to Slide 7, let's go a bit deeper into some of the actions we are taking to improve semiconductor, chip availability and our overall resiliency. We expect component shipments to increase in the coming quarters due to several factors. The first is improved material flow from key suppliers over the next couple of quarters. Where we are seeing improved flow from existing suppliers, several factors are contributing, such as the addition of incremental capacity, improved allocation percentages, opportunistic broker buys and some of these suppliers recovery from discrete events like fires and floods. We have also reengineered certain products to utilize components with better supply resiliency. For example, the new series of PanelView operator interface has enabled us to double the shipment quantity in the last two months. We have significantly accelerated our manufacturing capacity investments in our Twinsburg and Singapore facilities over the last year which will benefit production and resiliency in the second half of fiscal 2022. We continue to qualify new and additional semiconductor chip vendors, to create redundant sources for individual components and to diversify our supplier base and we expect to see the benefit in fiscal Q4. We continue to invest in diversifying our portfolio and see continued double-digit growth in our Information Solutions & Connected Services, which are less dependent on hardware supply chains. Price is also a meaningful contributor to our growth and our resiliency in mitigating inflation. We have very strong pricing power in the market, thanks to our highly differentiated offerings. We're seeing good price realization as annual customer agreements renew and we are taking action to get quicker realization of future price increases. In the last year, we have announced several price increases totaling 17%, materially benefiting the latter portion of this fiscal year and even more so in fiscal 2023. However, as you know there are risks that cannot yet be accurately quantified, which is one of the reasons, we have widened our range for growth expectations for the full year. These risks include the duration and potential escalation of the war in Ukraine. We have suspended the small amount of business we do in Russia and Belarus, less than half of 1% of total sales. We are seeing logistics cost increases due to higher energy costs as well as constrained and lengthened air freight lanes. Another source of risk is, the widespread shutdown of businesses in China due to COVID infection outbreaks. Our plants have partially reopened due to the critical role our products and services play in industries such as semiconductor, but the bigger risk is from upstream suppliers with operations in the area. We have built in some risk for China shutdowns, but it is difficult to quantify this risk in the next two quarters. Let's now turn to Slide 8, to review highlights for the full year outlook. Orders for the year are expected to approach $10 billion. At some point, we expect orders to moderate as lead times for our products return to more normal levels. However, orders are expected to remain well above pre-pandemic levels given the amount of capital projects underway in industries we serve. We continue to expect double-digit reported sales growth, but we've reduced the midpoint and widened the range in part given the volatility of component supply that we saw in the second quarter. April component supply and total sales are tracking well with our forecast. Acquisitions are expected to do well and contribute over two points of profitable growth. We continue to expect double-digit growth in both core automation as well as Information Solutions & Connected Services. We continue to expect another year of double-digit annual recurring revenue growth, which makes up over 8% of our total revenue. I'm pleased with the impact of both acquisitions and organic investments are having in these new lines of business. We have reduced our margin expectation and adjusted EPS target range for the year. The midpoint of the adjusted EPS range represents one point of increase over the prior year and a 13% increase without the impact of last year's lower tax rate and benefit from a one-time legal settlement. And as noted on the slide the Board authorized an additional $1 billion of share repurchases. Nick will now add detail to our Q2 results and our financial outlook for fiscal 2022. Nick? Nick Gangestad : Thank you, Blake, and good morning everyone. I'll start on slide 9, second quarter key financial information. Second quarter reported sales were up 2% over last year. This is below our expectations and was directly linked to electronic component availability in the quarter. Q2 organic sales were up 1.3% and acquisitions contributed 2.3 points to total growth. Currency translation decreased sales by 1.8%. Segment operating margin was 15.7%, approximately 300 basis points worse than we expected and primarily impacted by lower-than-expected sales volume and higher input costs. Versus last year, our margins declined 630 basis points mostly due to negative price cost and higher investments in key growth areas. I will comment further on price cost on the next page. Our adjusted EPS in the quarter was $1.66 and 31% down from the prior year. As we said last quarter, we expect Q2 to be the most impacted by negative price cost as the benefits from prior price actions will be more heavily weighted to the second half of fiscal year 2022 and into fiscal year 2023. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter was 16% and in line with the prior year. Free cash flow was $46 million in the quarter and down compared to the prior year due to lower pre-tax income and higher income tax payments. Income tax payments were in line with our expectations and higher year-over-year due to the payments made in the current quarter in the US related to fiscal year 2021 discrete tax transactions. Free cash flow results were lower than expectations driven by lower pre-tax income and higher working capital as we continue to build our subassemblies for more rapid conversion into finished goods as we receive critical components. Turning to page 10. This is a new slide we added this quarter. This slide shows the actual impacts for quarter one and quarter two and what we included in our projections for the second half for both price and input costs. First on pricing. From our three price increases since last summer, we expect those actions to provide about $400 million of cost recovery once fully implemented. Less than 10% of this benefit was realized in the first half of fiscal year 2022. The ramp to achieve the pricing impact occurs, because much of our pricing is set by pricing agreements we have with our customers. Once we announce a price increase, these customers will not see the increases until their current annual agreements renew. We are implementing actions to accelerate realization on future price increases. The price growth projected here is only from previously announced price increases and factors in higher inflationary costs not yet seen. If inflation forecast for fiscal 2023 worsens more than expected we will take further price actions to offset these costs. On input costs, we did see a higher year-over-year and sequential increase in input costs in Q2. These increases were driven by increased logistics costs and a higher level of broker buys. We anticipate these elevated costs to continue increasing for the balance of the year. For fiscal 2022, we expect input costs to increase over $200 million, primarily due to higher electronic component costs and higher freight. On a net price cost basis, we are negative in the first half and positive in the second half. We now expect full year price cost to be slightly negative in fiscal 2022. Slide 11 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. Total reported sales were up mid to high-single-digits in both our Software & Control and Lifecycle Services segments. Intelligent Devices was down 5% as this segment was impacted more by supply chain constraints. Intelligent Devices organic sales were down 3% in Q2 and up 10% in the first half. Compared to last year Intelligent Devices margins declined 920 basis points to 14.6% driven by negative price cost investment spend and lower volumes. This segment accounted for the vast majority of the miss to our internal expectations in both sales and margins. We expect the second half margins in this segment to expand by 200 to 300 basis points sequentially on higher volumes and higher price from earlier implemented price actions. Software & Control organic sales were up less than one point and 4% in the first half. Segment margins were up sequentially for this segment and declined 520 basis points compared to last year, mostly due to higher year-over-year investment spend, negative price/cost and the impact of acquisition integration costs. We expect the second half margins in this segment to expand by over 600 basis points sequentially on higher sales and higher price from implemented price actions. Lifecycle Services grew organic sales by 11% including more than 20% growth from Sensia. Demand remains strong across all businesses and end markets. Book-to-bill was 1.34 for Q2. Segment margin was up sequentially for this segment and declined 170 basis points compared to the prior year, driven by lower labor utilization caused by supply chain constraints, partially offset by higher sales volume and lower incentive compensation. Margin is expected to grow through the balance of the year with strong sales growth and a higher margin backlog. The next slide 12 provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q2 fiscal 2021 to Q2 fiscal 2022. Starting on the left. Core performance was down about $0.75 on a 1.3% organic sales increase as we continue to make growth-related investments. We also were impacted by the timing of merit increases and lower labor utilization. As previously discussed price/cost had a negative $0.25 impact in the quarter. Given our updated guidance we lowered our estimate for fiscal year 2022 incentive compensation. On a year-over-year basis incentive compensation was about a $0.25 tailwind. This brings us to our total EPS of $1.66. Let's move on to the next Slide 13, guidance for fiscal 2022. We are updating our sales guidance to a new range of approximately $7.8 billion to $8 billion in fiscal 2022, up 11% to 15% for the year. We expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 10% to 14%. We expect currency translation to be a headwind of 1.5 points and about 2.5 points of growth coming from acquisitions. Our wider sales guidance range reflects the volatility we see in the component supply and uncertainty of the full impact of COVID-related shutdowns in China. As Blake mentioned earlier, we are forecasting an increase in sales in the second half in line with improved material flow from key suppliers. From a calendarization perspective, we are forecasting improved sequential performance over the balance of the year with a heavier weighting in Q4, driven by the resiliency actions Blake mentioned as well as the timing from higher price realization. We expect full year segment operating margin to be about 20%. This is a 150 basis point reduction from our prior guide and is the result of our volume decrease. The impact from higher input costs since our January guidance is expected to be more than offset with reduced spending levels including lower incentive compensation. We will continue to prioritize our growth and resiliency investments. We expect second half margins of around 22%, up four percentage points from first half levels, primarily driven from higher sales volume and a 250 basis point improvement from price cost. The first half impact of price cost and margins on a year-over-year basis was dilutive by approximately 250 basis points and the margin impact in the second half from price cost will be accretive by over 100 basis points. We expect margins to improve sequentially 300 to 400 basis points in the third quarter and another 400 to 500 basis points in the fourth quarter. We now expect full year core earnings conversion of between 20% and 25% with second half core conversion of approximately 40%. We continue to expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17%. We do not anticipate any material discrete items to impact tax in fiscal 2022. We are decreasing our adjusted EPS guidance range to $9.20 to $9.80. At the midpoint of the range, this is up about one point compared to the prior year. Finally, we expect free cash -- we expect full year fiscal 2022 free cash flow conversion of about 85% of adjusted income. The decrease from our prior guide of 90% is driven by higher working capital where we continue to have high inventory levels in order to support our increased demand. A few additional comments on fiscal 2022 guidance. Corporate and other expense is projected around $120 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2022 is expected to be about $115 million. We're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of about 117 million shares. Finally, on capital deployment our capital allocation priorities for this year remain the same including our focus on deleveraging. As Blake mentioned earlier, the Board authorized another $1 billion of share repurchases. Board and management are committed to using our capital deployment framework to drive long-term share owner value including opportunities for increased share repurchases. Turning now to Page 14. This slide bridges the midpoint of our January adjusted EPS guidance range to the midpoint of our new range. Starting on to the midpoint of our new guidance. Starting on the left. There is a lower contribution from core operating performance due to the lower organic sales guidance partially offset by lower spend. We now expect price cost to be negative for the full year or a $0.25 negative impact versus our January guidance. Currency is expected to be a $0.20 headwind. Next, given the decrease in our forecasted performance, there is about a $0.35 impact from a projected lower bonus expense, which brings the new midpoint of the guidance range to $9.50. Although not on this page, we continue to expect our acquisitions including Plex to be about neutral this year including incremental interest expense or a year-over-year benefit of about $0.15. With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Blake Moret : Thanks, Nick. This was a tough quarter, but we are aggressively working to temper the impact of persistent and volatile supply chain shortages. We have provided guidance that reflects a detailed view of expected component availability and actions we are taking to increase the flow of product and solutions to the market. We are beginning to see increases in some of the semiconductors we use, we continue to qualify new sources and important new capacity is being built for the technology we use in many of our products. For example, the incremental fab capacity a major supplier is planning to bring online will directly benefit a number of our product families in early 2023. While we do not anticipate supply chain challenges to end soon, we do expect gradual sequential improvement over the coming quarters. I want to thank our suppliers for the recognition of the critical role we play in US manufacturing and industrial applications around the world. We are on track with our manufacturing capacity expansion to ensure that internal equipment and processes support our revenue growth in fiscal year '22 and beyond.  Despite these challenges we are also on offense. We continue to introduce new differentiated technology and services including the January opening of our Israeli Cybersecurity Operations Center to support worldwide customers. Later this year we will release new FactoryTalk, operator interface and design software at our annual automation fair.  We have reduced spending plans in response to the higher cost but we are prioritizing programs that will generate new revenue in the coming years and we are increasing investments that strengthen our resiliency. We continue to focus on accelerating profitable growth within the long-term financial framework that has served us and our investors well.  We complement internal investment with a disciplined capital allocation that is focused on creating value. The capabilities and dedication of our people continue to set us apart. From our manufacturing associates and plants around the world to our salespeople working together with supply chain professionals to meet our customers' most critical needs through our development engineers balancing the simultaneous demands of building component resiliency and launching new products to the teams who are focused on keeping our people safe and productive, we're confident that our extra effort will be remembered as we help manufacturers speed cloth protect and move the world. Jessica will now begin the Q&A session. Jessica Kourakos : Operator you may begin Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Go ahead Rob. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Melius Research. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Good morning, everybody. Blake Moret : Good morning. Scott Davis : I'm not going to fixate on the details of the quarter as much as talk about what do you think your customers do if we were to run into a recession? Is it a different playbook this time because they're so far behind on digital transformation? Do those projects continue? Do they get delayed? Do they stop and then restart down there? I mean how does it -- how do you guys think about how your customers act or respond if -- particularly on the consumer side if we do hit a recession? Blake Moret : Yes. Scott I'll make some comments and Nick may add to that as well. But we look at an industry-by-industry view of what the stated investments are in these different industries and what's likely to happen which of these are more at risk if we see the effects of inflation continuing to weigh on the economy and some of these macroeconomic events that have happened here in the last few months.  Certain of the big multiyear investments we think are going to be resilient through that. I'll start with semiconductor. With several hundred billion dollars of announced capacity expansions by these fabs and back-end suppliers I don't think that those are going to be thrown off track by the economic conditions and inflation because there's just such a need for that in the world as we are all seeing. So I think investments in semiconductor in electric vehicle as every company regardless of the current economic conditions is moving to produce vehicles that the world is looking for. Life sciences -- the continued demand for vaccines and other medicines. The digital transformation in food and beverage activities as people are trying to be more competitive and save cost. So as you look across the oil and gas, the high cost of oil and the need to pump more to be more efficient I think there's certain underlying secular trends that are driving that. To be sure in the cycle, we're seeing the impact of chip shortages and huge inflationary pressures. But I think these multiyear capacity expansion projects along with the enormous backlog that we and others have built up are going to create a little different dynamic than typical cyclical approaches. And then finally, we are happy with our position working with these customers who are really involved in the most important capacity expansion. So I think there's a good portion of the investment Scott that have been announced that are going to continue on because they have to meet the kind of demand that we're seeing in the world. Scott Davis : Okay. Good color. I'll stick to one question. Thank you. Good luck. Blake Moret : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Your line is open. Andrew Obin : Hey, good morning. Blake Moret : Hi, Andrew. Good morning. Andrew Obin : Hi. Could you just talk about how it did sort of component availability progressed throughout the quarter? And what kind of visibility on your supply chain you have in terms of their ability to add capacity because we're sort of getting into this chicken and egg thing right? If you guys can ship your controllers to your customers I wonder how they can have add capacity if you can't provide them with controllers? So a that's my question. Thanks a lot. Blake Moret : Sure, Andrew. I mean it is an interesting dynamic. The circularity of what we're providing to capital equipment suppliers in semiconductor and directly to some of the big fab owners is dated to some extent by the availability of our equipment. So we're absolutely seeing how critical we are in these operations. I don't know that the general availability of existing suppliers changed a whole lot from month to month as we went through the quarter although we did see the early benefits of some of the reengineering that we have done with our products. I mentioned the PanelView and I think it's a good example because we now have redundant bills of material between the new and the old series PanelView that give us already significantly increased flow. And we see other reengineering efforts that will start coming online in Q3 and Q4. We have done a detailed product-by-product analysis of all the chips that go into those various products. As you can imagine with the breadth of SKUs we offer there's a highly diverse supplier base to this and that gives us the confidence in the guidance going forward, which do reflect more of our suppliers increasing their basic flow with incremental capacity expansions. Obviously, it takes a while for the brand-new greenfield capacity to come online. But between now and then, we are seeing increased flow for the reasons that I mentioned in my script. Nick? Nick Gangestad : Hey, Andrew, specifically to the first part of your question, we\u2019ll head on month-to-month during the quarter. We saw some improvements in availability as the quarter went on with March being noticeably our largest month of the quarter of shipments out we were able to do. Andrew Obin : Thanks so much. Good luck. Nick Gangestad : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning. Blake Moret : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Hey, good morning. Just on price and price cost. So you're talking about the 17% price increase. $400 million is obviously 6%. Are you suggesting you expect some significant additional price, or is that kind of the normal leakage between kind of headline price announcements and what is realized? And also Nick you might have been going back and forth between sequential and year-over-year. But I thought you said cost is only going to be $200 million for the year. Maybe that was just an incremental number. But can you clarify that? Maybe just clarify the whole kind of price/cost equation for the year? Nick Gangestad : Great. Yes. Thanks Jeff. From the three price increases that we put into place those impact the pricing that we have on our products. There are parts of our business such as Lifecycle Services that those general price increases don't apply to and those are done on a contract and -- and project-by-project basis. So that 17% and the ultimate yield of $400 million that applies to our price increases on our products that we're selling. And that $400 million that will progress through the -- through fiscal year 2022 and 2023. And by the late 2023 that fiscal year 2023 that's when we expect to be at the fully implemented at that annualized $400 million of price increase. As far as the cost impact. For the full fiscal year 2022 versus the input costs that we had in fiscal year 2021 that's what we're saying year-over-year is going to be a $200 million increase. Now we expect that to continue to go up from those input costs to continue to go up. That's why we put the price increases in that we've had in anticipation of further cost increases in the second half of 2022 and into 2023. If it turns out that our projections that we've underestimated the amount of input cost inflation we're prepared to act with another price increase if needed. But right now we believe we have some cushion in 2023 a little bit of cushion there. Jeff Sprague : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, Good morning, guys. A \u2013 Blake Moret : Good morning, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : So just on your comment earlier Blake, you expect this order and revenue environment to sort of converge over the next year or so sort of implies the $9 billion is on the table before too long. I guess, what's your sense on the margin on that? And we've talked a little bit about price/cost but I'm wondering sort of what's the mix or kind of pricing level in that backlog and the confidence that this stuff starts to come out that you'll be pleased with the margins on that? And I guess, the context for that is I think last quarter you talked about some pretty decent pricing power and maybe still got a little surprised on price cost this quarter. So just trying to see how repriceable that backlog is today. A \u2013 Blake Moret : Yes. The majority of the backlog is in the higher-margin product as opposed to solutions. So the general quality of the backlog, with respect to the margin is good. Nick, kind of talked about the increasing benefits of price increases that we have already implemented and as customer agreements, come due for renewal over the coming quarters we'll see a steadily mounting benefit from those price increases. And as both of us have said, we're prepared to do more if necessary. So I think the margin is good. And as we see the growth, we also see in terms of absorption and so on that there's an actual impact that expands margins there. We remain committed to the long-term framework that we've talked about for the last few years in terms of conversion of incremental revenue and we're sizing the business to continue to show that commitment for good conversion. And as Nick said, the second half of the year we think will demonstrate that. Josh Pokrzywinski : Great. Thanks. A \u2013 Blake Moret : Thanks, Josh. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. That's a very clear guidance on the sort of the profit walk on price and cost. I just wanted to go to circle back to other pieces in that bridge, sort of incentive compensation and then investment spend. Maybe help us understand exactly what that new incentive comp tailwind is in pre-tax dollars, and also what the investment spend guided headwind is? I think it was $200 million headwind before for the year. What's the new number? And then, how much of those two factors boost the second half profits? Just trying to get to that kind of walk to those big margin increases in the back half. Any color around that -- those two items please? Nick Gangestad : Julian, in terms of our incentive comp that I highlighted are what we often call our bonus. We started the year with a plan, that that would be $130 million. Given our reduced guidance expectation for the full year, we've reduced that from $130 million down to $80 million. That $50 million reduction from our original plan, is evenly balanced between first half and second half. In terms of investment spend, you're correct. We started the year saying, we expect investment spend to go up approximately $200 million, we now expect that \u2013 we scale that spending down to now instead of increasing $200 million to only increase approximately $100 million and that will be part of the benefit that we expect in margin in the second half of the year. Julian Mitchell : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Luecke from AllianceBernstein. Your line is open. Brendan Luecke : Good morning, all. Thanks for taking the question. Blake Moret : Good morning. Brendan Luecke : As you look at the last quarter here or the last couple of quarters, how are you thinking about your share position in North America, specifically and if you have a comment perhaps in other regions? Are there areas where you believe you're taking share for competitors or submarket segments where you're a bit more concerned? Blake Moret : Brendan we're \u2013 in a time as volatile as this we're looking over a period of multiple quarters as you suggest. And so that first half 9% shipments that is something that feels pretty good but even more importantly it's the kind of orders and the continued low cancellation rates that we're seeing in every region. And as we talked about North America, we'd see strong orders growth and we expect over the full year for North America to be our fastest-growing region. There's a lot of anecdotes of where we have won new business from new customers in different spots around the world and we're proud of those but I don't think it's too early to call some major new share gain movement in those areas. So we're continuing to bring the orders in do our best of shipping it out and then we'll take a look at where we are. But in terms of the order flow not only in North America but across the world in Asia, in Europe with both our core automation offerings as well as the new digital transformation solutions I'm very pleased with the new business that we're winning from competitively held accounts. Brendan Luecke : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Your line is open Andy Kaplowitz : Blake, could you give us a little more color into what you're seeing in Lifecycle Services and Process Solutions in general? I think you mentioned the 1.34 book-to-bill in the segment which is good but it seems like a lot of the growth is concentrated in upstream oil and gas. How much leverage do you have to an uptick in midstream investment? Are you seeing movement in downstream projects at this point and \u2013 in mining, or is it really just component issues that are holding you back in those segments? Blake Moret : Sure. So in oil and gas our focus is on upstream and midstream. I would say there's a fair bit of activity particularly at our Sensia joint venture in terminals. And certainly a lot of people are talking about LNG but we had some good solutions there throughout our offering, especially in our power offering there. So midstream we are seeing good activity and good funnel. And what \u2013 and this goes back to my previous comment with Brendan, we're seeing some places where we're adding some of our new offerings on top of the core automation. So adding the software, adding some of the higher level of services on there as well, again through Sensia, but they're all about adding automation, closed-loop control even autonomous solutions in these operations. So it's really about the upstream and the midstream and the downstream refinery control is not a target application for us, but we're doing a lot of the balance of plant as well as the safety systems. And we did see some nice wins in the quarter with our safety offering as well. In mining, I think you asked about mining and we are seeing some increased activity there, particularly in Latin America, where we're seeing some of our strongest installed base and we're seeing some of that work come to life as well. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks Blake. Blake Moret : Yes, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. Just so we get the you gave us some elements of the second half ramp up Nick. Kind of a couple of things. Number one given that the bulk of your sales in North America goes through distribution, why does it take so long to get pricing through channel? Just want to understand that. I think 85% 90% of your sales in North America go through channels. So, I just want to understand that dynamic. Then it seems like you implied 4Q is 320, 330 at the midpoint. Can you just confirm that's how you see the ramp up coming through? That would be helpful. Thanks. Nick Gangestad : Nigel, I'll take the first part of that what you've calculated for the type of earnings in Q4 that's in the zone of what we're thinking to. You've interpreted that correctly. In terms of the elements that are driving our margin expansion in the second half of the year there's several things. First is -- and the biggest is the volume versus the first half of the year and versus last year that's the biggest. The flip we see on price costs moving to the positive is the second piece, and then the lowering of our spend is the third piece. Now, in particular, your question about price and the timing it takes for us to be getting the price that's -- it's really a function of what I talked about in my opening remarks about we have many of our customers on annual agreements. And when we announce a price increase, they do not see that price increase -- even if it's going through distribution, they do not see that price increase until their next annual agreement renews. So, that can create noticeable lags from the time we announce until we're actually realizing that increase. That Nigel is the primary thing even for things through distribution that caused that lag. Blake Moret : Yes. And if I could add to that Nick and I both talked about actions to speed the realization of price. And we are increasing the number of agreements that will not have to wait for that full lag period, until annual agreements renew at customers. We've done that in certain places. I wish, we had that in place a year ago, but it's going to benefit us going forward as we make those changes. Nigel Coe : Great. Thank you. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is open. Noah Kaye : Thanks for taking the question. In the past you provided some metrics around maybe some advanced ordering. You\u2019re talking about orders for the year approaching $10 billion still how much of this do you think is really pulled forward? And I guess, the second part of it is frankly if you didn't have these component shortages how much higher would the revenue be for the year? Blake Moret : Yeah. The vast majority of the orders that we are receiving are for current needs for customers. We have line of sight. Our distributors have line of sight to the projects and the machines they're trying to ship. I've been on the call with several dozen customers as we talked about what their needs are and their plans to expand and the impact on us with that. So the vast majority as we've been talking about is that underlying demand further backed up by the very low continuing cancellation rates there. And I think that, that continues as we go forward. A significant amount of that backlog with no component shortages would be shipping. So the order \u2013 the shipment levels would be much greater. But we also do see the impacts of long lead times on the orders as our customers MRP systems are automatically increasing the amount of orders that they're putting in. But it still \u2013 it represents underlying demand. Operator : And thank you for your questions. I will now turn the call back over to Ms. Kourakos for some closing remarks. Jessica Kourakos : Thanks Rob. That concludes today's call. So thank you all for joining us. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Later in the call, we will open up the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Aijana Zellner, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Zellner, please go ahead. Aijana Zellner : Thanks Rex. Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2022 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include and our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our Company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings. So with that, I'll hand it over to Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I want to also take this opportunity to congratulate Aijana on her promotion since our last earnings call. Let's turn to our third quarter results on Slide 3. We had a strong quarter with orders, shipments, margin, and profit, all at or above our expectations. We successfully navigated supply chain disruptions in a still volatile environment. And we saw the positive impact of pricing actions that demonstrate our strong position in the market. Total orders grew over 17% versus prior year with strong demand in all three business segments. Our continued orders strength reflects the value our customers place on Rockwell's differentiated offerings and the increased need for automation solutions regardless of the current macroeconomic backdrop. Total revenue of almost $2 billion was up 6.5% year-over-year. Organic sales came in as expected and grew over 7% versus prior year. Acquisitions contributed 2.5 points of growth. Currency translation reduced sales by over 3% driven by continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. While we saw a gradual overall improvement in supply chain through the quarter, our sales volume and mix continue to be impacted by component shortages as we've been discussing for a while now. Our top line performance, both by segment and region was driven by specific component availability in Q3, more than the underlying demand, which remains strong. In the Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales were up over 2% year-over-year, but below expectations. This segment was disproportionately impacted by component availability, further exacerbated by extended China COVID shutdowns. Software & Control organic sales growth of over 13% versus prior year was above expectations. A strong performance here reflects both an improvement in the chip supply and some early benefits from the recent resiliency investments. Sales of our View operator interface panels, which we redesigned to optimize our component supply, were up almost 60% year-over-year. Our software sales grew double-digits versus prior year. In Lifecycle Services, organic sales increased almost 9% versus the prior year, despite continued component shortages and a partial shutdown of our Shanghai facility earlier in the quarter. Within Lifecycle Services, Sensia had another quarter of strong growth with both orders and sales up over 20% year-over-year. Sales in our services business also grew double-digits driven by higher demand for asset management and cybersecurity. Lifecycle Services\u2019 book-to-bill was 1.27 in the quarter, reflecting continued strength in our orders. Information Solutions & Connected Services, orders and sales both grew strong double-digits in the quarter with particular strength in the MES software and industrial cybersecurity sales. Within Information Solutions, we had a number of strategic wins this quarter, thanks to our industry leading portfolio of scalable and flexible software offerings. For instance, Eli Lilly and Company has chosen Rockwell Automation's PharmaSuite MES solution as the next-generation MES platform for their drug products. In addition to our on-prem software wins, we continue to gain traction with our recent cloud native acquisitions. One of our Plex wins this quarter was with ZEVx, an Arizona based company, focused on electrification of light and medium duty fleet vehicles worldwide. Our smart manufacturing platform will help this customer's aggressive growth plan with advanced supplier and inventory management, improved data visibility and reporting. We're also happy to report the sale of a Plex application that will run natively on Microsoft Azure in Europe, as well as a growing list of wins in food and beverage companies. These are important deal synergies that we are starting to realize. At Fiix, we continue to see strong double-digit sales growth led by both new logo wins and expansion deals. Our competitive maintenance management wins across many verticals, including EV and food and beverage reflect the platform's differentiated AI capabilities and ease of deployment. Connected Services\u2019 orders and sales were also strong in the quarter, demonstrating customers increasing reliance on our deep domain expertise, cybersecurity services and 24/7 remote support, especially as many companies are struggling with labor shortages and temporary budget constraints. In the quarter, total ARR was up almost 60%, an organic ARR grew 18%. Our strong operating performance and focus on price cost execution resulted in exceptional earnings this quarter. With adjusted EPS growing 15% versus prior year. Let's now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q3 end market performance. As I mentioned earlier, what we saw a gradual overall improvement in supply chain constraints this quarter, some of our businesses and industry verticals mainly discrete and the hardware intensive parts of hybrid were disproportionately impacted by the ongoing component supply issues. In our discrete industries, sales were up low single-digits. Within this industry segment, automotive sales were up 6% versus prior year. We continue to see investments in the EV transition from both traditional brand owners and EV startups with a healthy mix of greenfield and brownfield activities. In Q3, we had a strategic greenfield win in Asia, where a Chinese automotive company, Chery Auto chose Rockwell's differentiated MES IoT and core automation offerings over their traditional European supplier to build a smart plant and increase their speed to market. In addition to working with leading electric vehicle manufacturers, we continue to gain share in the EV battery space. With several competitive wins in the quarter, both in Asia and Europe, while most of our previous wins in this space were in battery assembly and conveyance. We're starting to expand our presence in battery cells. Rockwell's integrated logics and motion offering was selected by Doer Clean Technology Systems to provide an end to end coating process from powder handling and slurry mixing to coating and drying. Semiconductor sales decline 2% versus prior year and were significantly impacted by COVID-related shutdowns in China. Despite the near-term supply chain challenges impacting its own ecosystem this industry continues to see strong demand with about 80 greenfield and 300 brownfield projects announced today. In the e-commerce and warehouse automation, our sales were down over 15% in the quarter, mainly driven by electronic component shortages and tough prior year comps. While we are seeing a slowdown in investments from some e-commerce customers, we continue to work with traditional retailers and grocers who are investing in new automated infrastructure to gain share in the market. Turning to our Hybrid Industry segment. Sales in this segment grew mid single digits led by growth in life sciences and food and beverage. Food and beverage sales were up mid single digits versus prior year, while inflation might put some pressure on new expansion investments, we continue to expect, especially strong demand in certain markets like agriculture processing, where Rockwell has high share and a differentiated technology offering. We saw a number of CapEx wins in Latin America this quarter with one of our food and beverage wins coming from CP Kelco a Brazilian nature-based ingredients manufacturer, which chose Rockwell and our plant PlantPAx process control architecture as their automation partner for the next capacity expansion project. Life sciences sales grew over 15% in Q3 with strong year-over-year growth in medical devices, pharma and biotech. This was another industry where our differentiated process controller along with strong network infrastructure and overall project management expertise helped us win a competitive project with Thermo Fisher in their joint venture plant in China. A combination of industry leading MES and IoT software and the multidiscipline logics platform for hybrid applications along with our increasing expertise in biotech and cell gene therapies position us well in this fast growing vertical. Tire was up low single digits in the quarter, we continued to see increased customer demand for our software and services in this vertical. In the quarter, we had our first Plex win in tire with Prometeon Tyre Group, a global leader in tire manufacturing, headquartered in Italy. The customer chose our Plex QMS to standardize quality management across its global operations. Moving to process. This industry segment group 12% versus prior year with oil and gas, mining and metals all growing double digits. We continue to grow our presence in process by displacing the traditional DCS players across oil and gas, mining and chemical industries. Our investments in process control technology and petrochemical expertise are paying off as demonstrated by our recent wins in North America and Europe. We also had a strategic multimillion dollar ESG win where Rockwell will be helping one of the most active operators in the Permian Basin, reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and bring all operated oil and gas assets to net zero by 2050. Turning now to Slide 5 in our Q3 organic regional sales performance. Once again, these results were heavily impacted by our component availability. North America organic sales grew by 11% versus the prior year, Latin America sales increased by over 15%, EMEA sales were up over 3% and Asia Pacific was down almost 6%. Let's move to Slide 6, an update to a new slide we had provided last quarter. As you can see, order cancellations remained very low and are within our historical ranges. Our strong orders and record backlog of over $5 billion, continue to support strong sales in fiscal year 2022 and beyond. As we turn to Slide 7 let's review highlights for the full year outlook. Orders are expected to stay strong for the remainder of this fiscal year. While we continue to expect strong double digit year-over-year and sequential organic sales growth in Q4, resulting in double digit growth for the full year, we're reducing the midpoint of our organic growth range to 11%. Our revised guidance reflects ongoing supply chain volatility in this environment, especially for business operations and suppliers located in Asia. The supply of electronic components is gradually improving, but remains volatile. Acquisitions are expected to contribute 2.5 points of profitable growth, more than offsetting a 2 point headwind from currency translation. We continue to expect double digit growth in both core automation as well as information solutions and connected services. We continue to expect another year of double digit annual recurring revenue growth. Our organic investments and acquisitions help make this revenue stream become a more meaningful contributor to our overall business resilience. Our additional investments in resiliency actions are progressing well as we develop deeper relationships with key suppliers, complete redesign projects and realize price to mitigate inflation. We expect our margins to expand in Q4 on higher sales and continued price cost execution. With only one more quarter to go, we have narrowed our adjusted EPS guidance range with our midpoint still at $9.50. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion of 85% for the full year. Nick will now add detail to our Q3 results and financial outlook for fiscal 2022. Nick? Nick Gangestad : Thank you, Blake and good morning everyone. I'll start on Slide 9, third quarter key financial information. Third quarter reported sales were up 6.5% over last year with organic sales up 7.1% and acquisitions adding another 2.5 points to total growth. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 3.1%, while the U.S. dollar has strengthened against many currencies, the strength against the euro has had the largest impact on Rockwell in the quarter. We saw our organic sales improve through the quarter, helped by some easing of supply chain constraints following the listing of COVID restrictions in China. Segment operating margin was 20.8%, an increase of 90 basis points versus last year, mostly due to higher sales and lower incentive compensation, partially offset by higher investment spend. Last quarter, we shared our expectation that price cost would improve significantly in Q3. And that is exactly what happened. Price in the quarter more than offset our year-over-year increases in input costs. Our adjusted EPS in the quarter was $2.66, up 15% from the prior year. I\u2019ll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter was 14.5% and in line with the prior year. This was better than our expectations due to a favorable return to provision true up. Free cash flow dollar generation was $327 million in the quarter and down compared to the prior year due to higher working capital primarily in receivables. We saw a higher percentage of our sales in June than in the prior year and our free cash flow conversion exceeded 100% in the quarter, despite our increases in working capital. One additional item not shown on the slide. We repurchased 860,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $176 million. On June 30, $1.3 billion remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 10 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. We had a good quarter with organic sales up in all three business segments both year-over-year and sequentially. Improving sales in our strong operating execution resulted in sequential margin growth of over 500 basis points. Intelligent Devices organic sales were up 2.7% in Q3. This segment had the largest negative impact in the quarter from component availability and extended shutdowns in China. Compared to last year, Intelligent Devices margins declined 220 basis points to 19.7% primarily driven by higher investment spend. Year-over-year price increases were able to neutralize the impact of higher input costs. Margin in this segment improves sequentially by 510 basis points driven by positive price costs and higher volume. Software & Control total sales were up 19%, including 13.4% organic growth versus the prior year. Strong sales were driven by improved chip supply and benefited from resiliency actions taken earlier in the year. Segment margins were up 620 basis points compared to last year and up 680 basis points sequentially, mostly due to higher sales. Price cost was positive year-over-year and sequentially. Lifecycle Services organic sales grew 8.7% led by strong double-digit growth in Sensia. Demand continues to remain strong across all businesses. Book-to-bill was 1.27 for Q3. Segment margin declined 90 basis points compared to the prior year driven by supply chain constraints and higher investment spend, partially offset by higher sales and lower incentive compensation. Segment margin was up against sequentially on higher sales. With gradual improvement in the supply chain, we expect the trend of sequential margin expansion to continue in the coming quarters. The next Slide 11 provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q3 fiscal 2021 to Q3 fiscal 2022. Starting on the left. Core performance was up about $0.15, including about $0.25 from higher sales. Price cost contributed $0.05. Strong execution led to about $0.10 of productivity. We saw some favorable corporate items about half of which were due to timing between Q3 and Q4. We also continue to invest in growth and resiliency, which offset the core growth by $0.35. In the prior year, we made about $0.10 of non-recurring accelerated investments that mostly impacted our Software & Control business. Currency negatively impacted our earnings by about $0.10. On a year-over-year basis, incentive compensation was about a $0.20 tailwind. This brings us to our total adjusted EPS of $2.66. Let\u2019s move to the next Slide 12, our guidance for fiscal 2022. We are updating our sales guidance to a new range of approximately $7.7 billion to $7.9 billion in fiscal 2022, up 10.5% to 12.5% for the year. We expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 10% to 12%. And we expect about 2.5 points of growth coming from acquisitions and currency translation will be a headwind of about two points. Our sales guidance range reflects the continued volatility we see in the supply chain. The midpoint of our guidance implies a 9% sequential increase in Q4 total sales driven by improved material flow from key suppliers including those in China, further sequential improvement from resiliency actions and higher sequential price realization. We continue to expect full year segment operating margins to be about 20% and unchanged from our prior guide. We expect our margins to continue to expand in the fourth quarter. The margin expansion will come primarily from higher sequential sales and continued positive momentum on price costs. While price costs will be negative for the full year, it is positive in the second half. We now expect second half core conversion above 40%. We expect a full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 16.5%. And we are narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance range to $9.30 to $9.70 with no change to our midpoint of $9.50 from prior guidance. Finally, we continue to expect full year fiscal 2022 free cash flow conversion of about 85% of adjusted income. A few additional comments on fiscal 2022 guidance. Corporate and other expense is now projected to be around $110 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2022 is now expected to be about $120 million. We\u2019re assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 116.7 million shares. Finally on capital deployment, our capital allocation priorities for this year remain the same, including our focus on de-leveraging. As I mentioned earlier, we repurchased about $176 million worth of shares in Q3 and are now projecting our full year share repurchases to be about $300 million. Turning now to Page 13. While there is no change to the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance, we wanted to show some of the moving pieces within this number, starting on the left. There is a lower contribution due to the lower organic sales guidance. This is fully offset by improved productivity, favorable segment mix and lower corporate expenses. Currency is an additional headwind of about $0.05. A more favorable tax rate adds $0.05, which brings us to our midpoints of $9.50. Although not on this page, we continue to expect our acquisitions including Plex to be about neutral this year, including incremental interest expense or a year-over-year benefit of about $0.15. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Blake? Blake Moret : Thanks, Nick. We had a good quarter of growth, price realization, profitability, and investment for the future. We are executing well, and I\u2019m proud of how our teams are managing supply chain complexity to serve the needs of our customers. In volatile times, a relentless focus on helping customers creates long-term differentiation and value. Aijana, we will now begin the Q&A session. Aijana Zellner : We would like to get to as many of you as possible. So please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Rex, let\u2019s take our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Davis. [Melius Research] Your line is open. Scott Davis : Good morning, guys. Good morning, Aijana. Blake Moret : Good morning. Aijana Zellner : Good morning. Scott Davis : Little bit different tone this quarter than last quarter, and that\u2019s nice to see it bounce back. But this may be a little hard to answer. But you have an order book that\u2019s up about 17%. How much of that and you don\u2019t have to give me an exact number, but is price because I know you had some pretty big price increases that were announced, is it order magnitude is half of that order book price? Is it \u2013 is there some way to kind of size that? Nick Gangestad : Hey, Scott. For the full \u2013 for the third quarter, we had about 3.5% price growth for the total company. That\u2019s about half of our total organic growth. I think that\u2019s a pretty fair estimate to apply to our order growth as well. That 3.5% is about \u2013 of that 17% order growth, 3.5% of that is coming from price. Scott Davis : Yes. Wow. So. Yes. Okay. Sorry, Blake. Blake Moret : Yes, Scott, I was just going to add. When we talk about orders, just to give some scale to the magnitude of the orders, they remain around 45% above pre pandemic levels. So in addition to the very large existing backlog, we\u2019re continuing to add that at a rate above our expectations. Scott Davis : No, that\u2019s good to hear. And then you gave the example that cherry when example Blake, which I thought was interesting. Can \u2013 is a deal like that priced in U.S. dollars. Is it priced in local currency? I mean, how do you kind of compete against a suite of competitors that have such a big currency advantage if [indiscernible]. Blake Moret : Hey Scott. Most of our transactions in a country like China are priced in the local currency and that\u2019s generally the way we do business. When there start to be large movements in FX, like what we\u2019re seeing there that becomes part of our pricing strategy. We have hedges in place to protect us, protect earnings in the short term. And in the longer term, then pricing becomes part of that strategy of how we\u2019ll adjust pricing in the local currency to be offsetting what we\u2019re seeing in terms of FX movements. Scott Davis : Really helpful. All right, I\u2019ll pass it on. Good luck. Thank you. Blake Moret : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski. [Morgan Stanley] Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning, team. Blake Moret : Hi, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Just Software & Control, pretty solid quarter there. I guess, that division has been a little bit less impacted by supply chain versus Intelligent Devices. But I guess if I think back to kind of other periods of macro volatility, it just seems to do this every now and then where you\u2019ll have a pretty decently big quarter on margins and the revenue. Anything lumpy in terms of shipments or availability pull forward, like you guys had earlier in the year, anything that could sort of give us a direction on timeline would be helpful? Blake Moret : Sure. Well, Josh, first of all limited pull through or pull forward in that. We\u2019re still looking at large year-over-year and sequential growth in Q4. I think you can think of this, the hardware portion of Software & Control as having less SKUs than Intelligent Devices. And the chip availability was relatively higher for Software & Control being able to ship logics, compact logics and the associated IO. So in the quarter it was less impacted. And again, with the kind of backlog that we have in the continuing orders, we can ship as much as we have components for across all of the business segments, and we expect that to be the case for quarters to come. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just quick follow-up on the orders, anything that you can kind of break down further in there, whether it\u2019s any currency headwinds, I noticed not a cancellations, but any kind of change in that growth. So have cancellation stepped up and project size like are those getting bigger or smaller? Thanks. Nick Gangestad : Josh, we have been seeing over time the size of our orders getting larger and that trend continues. But in terms of the specifics of your question, there\u2019s really nothing significant to call out. Everything is tracking very similar to what we\u2019ve seen in the past. As Blake mentioned in our prepared comments, orders are coming in even stronger than what we had anticipated for the quarter. Josh Pokrzywinski : And the FX piece is that did that move around well? [Ph] Nick Gangestad : FX is one of the things can impacting our orders within Europe, but \u2013 and that\u2019s included in what we\u2019re seeing for that. So seeing the Euro devalue about 10% and that\u2019s part of what we\u2019re seeing in the order in the total global orders that we reported in Q3. Josh Pokrzywinski : Super helpful. Appreciate it. Best of luck. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell. [Barclays] Your line is open. Aijana Zellner : Rex, let\u2019s move on to the next one. Operator : Excellent. Your next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz. [Citigroup] Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, everyone. Blake Moret : Good morning, Andy. Nick Gangestad : Hey, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Blake, can you elaborate on your comments regarding and improving supply chain? Did you see continued improvement in component availability throughout the quarter and through July here? And I know you mentioned chip starting to get better. Maybe give us a little more color around that. Do you have visibility toward more normalized growth, less pressure by supply chain as you go into FY 2023? Blake Moret : So, Andy look, we continue to see chip constraints being a factor for the near term. We did see improvement through the quarter as you\u2019ll recall, we saw the more severe wave of COVID shutdowns in China in April and May. And we were able to largely recover from that as chips began flowing a little bit more strongly in the back half of the quarter. And we continued to see gradual improvement in Q4 and into our fiscal year 2023. But it remains a volatile situation. You can\u2019t count the chips until they show up on your receiving doc. But we do see a gradual improvement that continues into the early part of Q4. Andy Kaplowitz : And thanks for that Blake. And then Blake or Nick, I know you don\u2019t want to talk too much about 2023, but when you think about incremental margin, obviously it\u2019s picked up here in the second half, as you said, Nick. As you look at next year, maybe talk about the puts and takes you remind us about investments spend and incentive comp as we were in the second half at this point. And then, obviously growth is picking up. Usually you guys are 30% to 35%, but if growth is a bit higher, could you do higher incremental margins given the easy comps at least in the first half of the year? Nick Gangestad : Yes. So some of the puts and takes to be thinking about that we\u2019re thinking about for fiscal year 2023. As Blake just said, supply chain component availability that\u2019s going to continue to be probably our most important factor in particular around growth. Some of the things that will be impacting our margin and what we\u2019re thinking about now is aspects like price cost, where as I\u2019ve said earlier, that was negative in the first half of the year, shifting to positive in the second half, we expect that to continue to be positive for us. Issues like inflation, issues like FX and what that can be doing to our profit and margin. The level of investment spend another factor we\u2019re thinking about. We also have a number of new product launches and how that will be impacting us in fiscal year 2023. So all of those things in comp, oh, the other one, we \u2013 right now, we are paying a bonus this year that is below our normal planned level. We would expect that to go back to the planned level in fiscal year 2023, all of those things in combination, we think the \u2013 our financial framework around core conversion of 30% to 35% remains a good starting point to think about 2023 and profit and margin expansion for us. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks for that, Nick. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell. [Barclays]. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much and good morning. Maybe Nick, I know there was an effort there to talk about next year\u2019s sort of EBIT bridge moving parts. But if we just focus on Slide 4, sorry, Slide 11 and you look at those main points around price cost, investment spend, productivity and incentive comp, maybe those items in particular, when we\u2019re thinking about the fourth quarter and the year-on-year impact, anything major to call out versus what you just saw in the third quarter? I\u2019m assuming price cost is a bigger tailwind than that $0.05 figure. But anything perhaps to mention on investment spend or productivity or the incentive comp for Q4? Nick Gangestad : Yes. In Q4, a couple things that are changing. I had mentioned in my prepared remarks, corporate items, while it\u2019s a benefit for Q3. We expect some of that is timing and we\u2019ll come back in Q4 that will flip from being a benefit to a headwind in Q4 versus what we were originally estimating price costs, as you estimated will continue to improve for us. Volume will continue to be a positive as we're expecting even higher volume growth in Q4 then in Q3. And then overall investment spend, we expect that to be pretty flat between Q3 and Q4, not really a big change happening there. And we do expect productivity to continue to be a benefit to us in Q4 as well. Julian Mitchell : That's very helpful. Thank you, Nick. And then maybe sort of a broader question, the Software & Control operating margins very volatile, particularly from the outside and maybe the inside as well. Quite hard to predict on a sort of three to six month view. It looks like for the sort of in fiscal half overall, you have a low 30s sort of Software & Control operating margin. Is that a reasonable sort of run rate looking into 2023 and the medium term, or are there any sort of exceptional mix tailwinds or something that you'd call out that are bolstering that Software & Control margin right now? Nick Gangestad : Yes, so a few things to keep in mind when you're looking at the margins that we've been experiencing and experiencing right now. The higher margin that we had in Q3 are higher sales volume was by far the driving factor on that. In the first half of the year, it was being negatively impacted by a lower volume growth. It was also being impacted by negative price cost, which is now flipping to positive. We also, in the first half of the year, where we had the lion's share of our Plex integration expenses. And while we're still investing there, that's going to be at a lower level. So the 30 plus percent that we're experiencing, I don't see that as something being off track of what to be expecting going forward from Software & Control. Julian Mitchell : That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye [Oppenheimer & Company]. Your line is open. Noah Kaye : Thanks for taking the question. Blake, obviously looks like we're going to have elevated backlogs here for a period of time, given the continuing order strength but you mentioned e-commerce as one area starting to slow down, any other pockets where you're starting to see some softening, I know, possibly in the longer cycle type parts of the business. It can all be green lights at this point. So, curious for where you think we may see some softness as we head into 2023 in the order environment and where you think you've got some cushion there in terms of the mix of products and services you're offering. Blake Moret : Yes. Thanks, Noah. I think e-commerce in particular has been the outlier that we've seen so far in that they've taken a pause and in some of the expansion. Within that vertical, we also talk about warehouse automation outside of e-commerce. And they're continuing to look at productivity opportunities with in some cases, reducing labor requirements, more efficient handling of product at the front end and of their process and of their stores. So that continues to be pretty strong with some nice, recent wins there. I would say in general, the closer to the consumer that you are, those would be the areas that we're probably watching the most closely. We do continue to see strong industrial production figures. And as you know, over a long period of time, IP is what Rockwell's performance \u2013 top line performance is most correlated to. And we still see a positive IP number in our served markets, especially in the U.S. So EV continues strong. We've talked before that. It's hard to imagine that either the established brand owners or the startups are going to take a pause in trying to convert their fleet capacity to EV, they're going to have to continue because they got fear of missing out and being able to get in early to get some experience and to get some volume there. Semiconductor, we see a lot of in-process activity, regardless of what happens from a legislative standpoint, pharmaceutical, food and beverage. It's just hard to bet, too much against these verticals but again, e-commerce, so we have seen some softening and in general, the closer to the consumer, you are, maybe recreational vehicles but that's obviously, it's not a big part of our overall auto number there. Noah Kaye : Yes. And maybe just to follow up on this, I don't know if the current environment affects how customers think about on-prem versus cloud native, but what are you seeing in terms of customer preferences. Does this environment create a little bit more momentum for cloud native? And are you seeing kind of relatively stronger orders trends on some of your cloud native offerings and talk about that kind of balance configurations? Blake Moret : Sure. No, it's a good question. I mean, some of the advantages of a cloud native deployment is that you don't have to continue to invest or to create a large IT on-prem infrastructure to either acquire the assets, the servers and such and the IT staff. You can deploy a cloud native solution much quicker and that's why offerings like Plex and Fiix have been so popular among small and medium sized businesses that just don't have that money to invest in those areas. And they want to get up and running quick, they're on a kind of a quicker time constant there. And some of the bigger companies are taking that play and looking at how they can apply that as well. And I think that's part of the reason that we're seeing Plex win in some of the verticals that were part of the synergy that we had baked into the model where we see food and beverage, tire, these are new verticals that they just didn't have the resources to address. And we're seeing some wins there. And similarly with Fiix, some of the wins that we've seen in Asia, in India, for instance I think are part of that where customers want it now, and they don't want to have to wait to build all the infrastructure. So it's part of the reason that we have a parallel offering. We have a really strong on-prem offering with our production center based MES that continues to grow well. And then Plex and Fiix are doing what we expected them to do for us. Noah Kaye : Okay. Thanks for the color, Blake. Appreciate it. Blake Moret : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa [J.P. Morgan]. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Hey, good morning. Blake Moret : Hey, Steve. Nick Gangestad : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : So what are you guys seeing in the process industries just as a start or orders there seem to be holding up pretty well. Blake Moret : Yes. Orders are going quite well in process and I would say, orders and shipments for that matter. If you notice that we gave a little bit more in the way of customer wins this quarter, that wasn't a coincidence. I have seen the number of bigger wins tick up a bit in process. And I think some of the investments that we've made over the last really five or six years beginning with MAVERICK in expertise, obviously the joint venture was Schlumberger, Sensia, Kalypso, that expertise along with the steady drumbeat of new technology introductions are helping increase the win rate. And as Nick mentioned, increasing the order size, from a macro standpoint, oil and gas spending, particularly in areas of efficiency, which is really where we're centered even more than the CapEx side of things is helpful. But chemical had, I think, their best quarter ever for us, metals still a very big automation market, mining out there. I don't think mining has hit its full stride, but we are seeing activity particularly in battery materials. So a lot of wins in lithium over the recent past. Steve Tusa : Just to follow up on the \u2013 I guess, the S&C margin and then the cash flow. Nick, what do you think is kind of your long-term cash conversion? I mean, this year 85% is a little low relative to history. It actually, I mean, your fourth quarter looks like a pretty big step up to get to that number to begin with, but even putting that aside, maybe you could just comment on that. What \u2013 how much confidence you guys have in that fourth quarter ramp, because it's a big number, but then beyond that, what is the normal cash conversion. And does that lower cash conversion have anything to do with the growing software revenue that may be a little more lumpy versus the actual cash? Nick Gangestad : Yes, thanks for that question, Steve. On the cash flow conversion side, 100% is our \u2013 what I consider our normal run rate. In fiscal year 2022, we are seeing noticeable increases in our working capital, some of the supply chain constraints that we're seeing. We see places where we've been building inventory. And so the biggest constraint on that's causing our free cash flow projection for the full year to be 85% is working capital. I don't think that's a permanent thing. I think that we will start to see some normalcy. In fact, we expect our working capital to be in total dollars to be coming down in the fourth quarter. And that's why we're expecting a pretty noticeable free cash flow generation in Q4 to benefit, it'll be benefited by higher profits in Q4, but even higher conversion as we bring down some of those working capital balances. It won't get to normal in 2022, but in 2023 and 2024, we see our working capital, the types of turns we have getting back closer to our normal range, which is why I say 100% is about right. You mentioned a little at the beginning on Software & Control margin. Is there something in particular you wanted to talk about on that, Steve? Steve Tusa : Yes. I hopped on a little late, but the margin there was obviously very strong. Is there something \u2013 what was driving that outside of maybe just the \u2013 was it just the devices within that business, the price cost there? Or is there something else going on with the more software oriented revenue streams? Nick Gangestad : Yes. First of all, it\u2019s not being negatively impacted by software. That\u2019s a nice growing part of the total software. Portfolio part of that business is portfolio. The three big things that were driving up the margin this quarter, one is the higher sales. This is a business that \u2013 as our sales go up, we clearly see the margin benefit impacting that. We were also benefited by price cost, looking from negative in the first half of the year to being positive in the third quarter, it will become even more positive in the fourth quarter. And then finally, you maybe missed me say that earlier, earlier we were investing more in our Plex integration and while we\u2019re still investing the level of investment in Plex integration is as planned coming down. And that\u2019s another thing that\u2019s helping our margin go up in software and control. Steve Tusa : Got it. Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : The next question comes from a line of Andrew Obin [Bank of America]. Your line is open. Andrew Obin : Hi. Yes. Good morning. Blake Moret : Hey Andrew. Nick Gangestad : Hi, Andrew. Aijana Zellner : Good morning. Andrew Obin : Just a question in terms of, as we think about supply chain for chips. As far as you can tell, where are we in terms of adding capacity for what you need, right? Because based on talking to chip brokers, sort of lower end stuff that industrials use are still in very short supply. And my understanding is that the big hope is capacity additions in North America. At the same time, we\u2019re hearing that not only you guys can get chips, but guys like Lam Research can get chips to provide the equipment. So where are we in terms of the scope and timing of capacity additions in North America over the next 12 to 18 months that would be relevant for Rockwell? Thank you. Blake Moret : Yes, it\u2019s a good question, Andrew. And it supports the thesis of gradually improving supply. So obviously it\u2019s important for us to continue to deepen relationships with our existing suppliers. And the ones that are going to be most important to us, going forward are ones for whom industrial is an important part of their business models. And as we talk to them specifically about the process nodes and the increased supply, that\u2019s going to be important to us, we see some of that capacity starting to come online at the end of this calendar year. So TI has a couple of plants coming online, analog devices, Intel with their Tower acquisition recently and some of their new investments. So we look closely at the new capacity and while a lot of it is in the leading edge notes for handsets and communications and so on for the suppliers that are most important to us, they are making investments in the fabs that are going to produce the wafers that ultimately result in the chips that are most important to us. So when we go through our analysis product by product and chip by chip within those products, we look at are we getting increased allocation, are redesign efforts going to have an impact such as with the view terminals that I\u2019ve talked about for the last couple of quarters. And we have some more of those projects that are coming to fruition here in the next few months and then the capacity additions that are coming from either our existing suppliers or in some cases, new suppliers that we\u2019re adding to the list of qualified vendors there. Andrew Obin : Thank you. And just a follow up question also to keep on chips. There is a lot of news on incremental semiconductor capacity coming into the U.S., specifically I think Samsung has filed with the state of Texas. And the spending seems to be very, very material. I think $200 billion is what the number is used. The pushback we get on this thesis that this is important for you guys is that historically, semiconductor end market just doesn\u2019t represent a large vertical for you. Yet the spending number seems to be very material, right, very material impact on overall CapEx in the U.S. How should we think about opportunity in semiconductors for Rockwell? And are you having conversations with the folks who are in the news that would be material to your numbers over the next year or two? Thanks. Blake Moret : Yes. I would characterize the opportunity as growing both in terms of the base of total announced CapEx as well as our ability to serve. So traditionally the majority of our business in semiconductors has been the facilities management control systems, the FMCS systems, which are controlling the temperature and the cleanliness and the humidity of the air in the environment, particularly in clean rooms. And we\u2019ve always had some capability in that space, turns out that Maverick is really good at that as well. And so we considerably increased our expertise in that area. There are drives that go into those air handling systems, and we\u2019re beginning to win a larger proportion of the drives in addition to the software and the engineering in those FMCS systems. And those are multimillion dollar systems. We\u2019re one few of those here recently that are noteworthy. Independent cart for material handling is also a technology that we didn\u2019t traditionally have. And as that technology gets qualified for clean room environments, we\u2019re seeing increased opportunities there. Cyber security, so obviously these fabs are very concerned about being resilient in that dimension as well. And we\u2019ve got the best offering to go in on the production floor. So we\u2019re seeing a lot of meaningful wins in cyber security as well. So those are just a few of the areas that we\u2019re providing value, not only for the direct fabs themselves, but also for the capital equipment suppliers, which remain good customers of ours. Andrew Obin : And as more incremental capacity sort of shifts to North America versus what we\u2019ve seen Asia, does it create opportunities and adjacencies longer-term that have not been present just to grow organically or through M&A? Blake Moret : Yes, for sure, because you\u2019ve got ecosystems. It\u2019s one thing to announce a fab and for Intel or TI or Micron or Samsung to build their facility, but they need a village, right? They need an ecosystem in each of these areas for the chemicals that are need, the substrates, the lead frames, all of those things. And those are all opportunities for us, particularly in the U.S., where we have overwhelmingly the strongest support and installed base. Andrew Obin : Very much. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Rob Mason. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Good morning. I had a question about the order pace. And what we\u2019ve been seeing there it sounds like, orders will still stay solid in the fourth quarter, maybe up a little bit. Previously Blake you talked about some order pull forwards \u2013 pull ahead, I\u2019m just curious how that dynamic is continuing to play out in the order rate if you\u2019re still seeing that if it\u2019s backed off. You talked about larger order sizes, whether that plays into that dynamic that you spoke to. Blake Moret : Yes. I think there\u2019s still \u2013 some of what we\u2019ve talked about in the past where, because the lead times are still long, they\u2019re longer than we or our customers would like. People are placing orders to cover that spread between now and when they actually expect to get the materials. And we see that most market with the machinery builders, they have a certain amount of machines and in the past they might have only placed orders to cover X months of those bookings that they have in their backlog and their needs for our automation equipment. And they may have doubled that at this point to be able to cover that. But that\u2019s the machine builders. And I think while we continue to see some of that, we hope to see over the coming quarters, those lead times pull in and we\u2019ve seen some green shoots where we\u2019ve seen some improvements in the lead times. In fact, we\u2019ve won some competitive business because we could deliver faster than competitors in certain areas. And as we see those lead times reduce naturally, we\u2019ll see the orders from some of those machine builders, for instance, reduce a bit. They also have big backlogs. And so, they\u2019re looking to get that material. But as shown by those continued low cancellation rates and as I mentioned earlier, these customers want the equipment they need it. And I can tell you from the conversations that we continue to have with the leadership of our customers, they continue to want that material just as fast as they can. So that would be, I\u2019d say the most tangible element of pull forward. But we don\u2019t see people placing orders in the last quarter, the current quarter to avoid price increases and things like that. So I would say our order development continues to be healthy. Unidentified Analyst : Very good. Just one quick follow up for Nick, just around price cost. It sounds like we\u2019ll continue to get some incremental benefit in the fourth quarter. Is there a way to think about the year-over-year benefit? Do we top out in the fourth quarter and start to moderate as we go into 2023? Or are you still expecting that year-over-year benefit to rise as you go into 2023? Nick Gangestad : So the fourth quarter will be the highest benefit of all the quarters, Rob. Well, I\u2019m not guiding for 2023 yet. The first half of 2023 will be getting the benefit of the fact that we don\u2019t anticipate it to be negative as it was in the first half of 2022. So just the absence of that negative, we think creates some year-on-year benefit in the first half of fiscal year 2023. I\u2019m not yet guiding for the full year of 2023, what we\u2019re expecting for the net price cost. Unidentified Analyst : Understood. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Ms. Zellner, I turn the call back over to you. Aijana Zellner : Thanks, Rex. Okay. That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference call. At this time you may disconnect. Thank you.",

Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties and that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings. So with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let\u2019s turn to our fourth quarter results on Slide 3. We had a great finish to the fiscal year and delivered very strong operating performance. I\u2019m proud of how our teams navigated this challenging year with continued supply chain volatility, significant inflation and currency headwinds. Our Q4 results were in line with our expectations with organic sales and earnings, both growing double-digits year-over-year and sequentially. Orders came in as expected in the quarter. Our record backlog, along with very low order cancellation rates reflect the continued solid underlying demand from our customers across many industries and regions. Total revenue of over $2.1 billion was up 17.6% year-over-year. Organic sales grew 20.5% versus prior year in line with our expectations. Acquisitions contributed almost two points of growth this quarter. Currency translation reduced sales by about 5%, driven by continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. As expected, we continue to see a gradual stabilization of global supply chain. Similar to last quarter, the split of Q4 shipments by business segment and region was driven by access to specific electronic components. In the Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales grew over 16% versus prior year with growth in all regions. While growth in this segment for the quarter was once again disproportionately impacted by component availability, we were able to mitigate these supply issues with the benefits from our resiliency actions. We see continued market need for our intelligent devices from PowerFlex drives to our motion technology to our best-in-class safety solutions. Our independent cart technology business had a record year with both orders and sales growing over 35% year-over-year. Software & Control organic sales growth of over 32% versus prior year was above expectations. Strong double-digit growth in View and Logix was driven by an improving component supply and our redesign investments. Lifecycle Services organic sales were up 16% year-over-year. Book-to-bill in this segment was 1.02, very good for our fourth quarter. Information Solutions and Connected Services had another quarter of double-digit growth in both orders and sales. Here are a couple of wins in ISCS to highlight the continued value of our recent acquisitions and new releases in these areas. One of our Plex wins this quarter was with Futaba North America, a member of the Toyota business network. Futaba has selected Plex Smart Manufacturing platform for ERP, MES, quality management and production monitoring. Our state-of-the-art solution provides real-time inventory management complex planning and full visibility into this customer\u2019s manufacturing operations. Another example of how our new offerings are adding new value to our traditional customers is our win with Kraft Heinz this quarter. Our Plex platform, along with Kalypso\u2019s digital design and implementation services are helping Kraft meet its productivity, yield and quality goals. We also continue to broaden our customer base with our Fiix, cloud-native maintenance management system. In the quarter, Fiix was chosen by Barrett Steel, the UK\u2019s largest independent steel stockholder to help reduce their unplanned downtime with a solution that could be easily scaled across 28 sites. Connected Services sales were also strong in the quarter with double-digit growth in digital projects and cybersecurity services. In the quarter, ARR grew 14%, bringing our ARR to over 8% of total revenue. Segment margin of over 23% was up 540 basis points year-over-year, reflecting another quarter of strong execution. Adjusted EPS grew 30% year-over-year. Earlier this week, we completed the acquisition of the Danish company, CUBIC, a worldwide leader in modular systems for electrical panels. This acquisition will help expand the global REIT for our intelligent devices and will bring new customers and partners, including a broader market access in renewable energy and data centers. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q4 end market performance. All three industry segments grew double-digits this quarter driven by continued gradual improvement in the availability of electronic components. In our discrete industries, sales were up almost 20%. Within discrete, automotive sales were up 25% versus prior year. We had numerous wins this quarter with our customers continuing to invest in their global operations, whether it\u2019s starting up a new factory, securing their network infrastructure, or upgrading existing facilities with cloud-native software. One of our key EV wins this quarter was with Hyundai Motors for their U.S. greenfield mega site in Bryan County, Georgia. Hyundai Motors has selected Rockwell as their controls partner for press, body, paint and general assembly. Semiconductor sales grew 30% year-over-year with several global wins this quarter. In addition to securing a sizable turnkey project in Asia with our proven facilities monitoring system, we had an important win here in the U.S. to provide flexible wafer transfers as part of this customer\u2019s automated material handling system. Our Independent Cart Technology is being leveraged at scale to support this customer\u2019s labor productivity and capacity goals. In e-commerce and warehouse automation, our sales were up high-single digits in the quarter. Even with the slowdown in new e-commerce fulfillment center investment, retailers continue to adopt our solutions for greater warehouse efficiency and throughput. Moving to our hybrid industry segment. Sales in this segment grew over 20%, led by growth in food and beverage, life sciences and eco-industrial. Food and beverage sales were up 20% versus prior year. Similar to last quarter, we continue to see a good pipeline of greenfield and brownfield projects at our key customers. In the quarter, we won several multi-site deals with some of the largest food and beverage companies with a healthy mix of intelligent devices, software and digital consulting and implementation services. Life Sciences sales grew over 35% in the quarter with continued customer investments in software, cybersecurity and modular process control. Tire was up 20% versus prior year, led by growth at our end user customers. This is another vertical where we are seeing an increase in greenfield projects in all regions. Turning to process. This industry segment grew mid-teens versus prior year, with growth in metals, chemicals and oil and gas. One of the wins in chemicals this quarter was with Bora Lyondell Basell Petrochemical, the joint venture between Lyondell Basell and Bora Enterprise Group. The customer chose our advanced analytics solution to help improve product quality and increase production capacity at their new polymer production plant in China. Turning now to Slide 5 in our Q4 organic regional sales performance. North America organic sales grew by 20% versus the prior year. Latin America sales were also up 20%, EMEA sales grew over 24%, and Asia-Pacific was up almost 18%. Let\u2019s move to Slide 6, an update to our orders and backlog performance this fiscal year. Order cancellations continue to stay within our historical low-single digit range. Our orders of over $10 billion and record backlog of over $5 billion this year set the stage for another year of strong sales growth in fiscal year 2023. As we turn to Slide 7, let\u2019s review highlights of fiscal 2022. We had another year of record orders with total orders of over $10 billion, growing 20% versus prior year. Reported and organic sales grew 11%, an impressive performance in light of all the challenges of the year. Information Solutions and Connected Services continue to meaningfully contribute to our growth with over $800 million in sales, growing double digits. ARR is also growing double digits and now accounts for more than 8% of our total revenue. Adjusted EPS was up 1% versus prior year. Excluding last year\u2019s one-time items, adjusted EPS was up 11%. Free cash flow conversion of 61% was driven by higher working capital. Nick will cover this in more detail later. The investments we\u2019ve made this year have strengthened the resiliency of our business model and position us for sustained growth in fiscal year 2023 and beyond. Let\u2019s now move to Slide 8, fiscal 2023 outlook. With the size of our record backlog, our outlook for fiscal 2023 is predicated on the availability of components. Given continued supply chain volatility, we think a conservative approach is appropriate. Our fiscal 2023 guidance projects total reported sales growth of 9.5%. Organic sales growth of 11% at the mid-point assumes continued supply chain stabilization with 4 points of growth coming from price and 7 points coming from volume. We expect acquisitions to contribute a point of profitable growth and currency to be a headwind of about 2.5 points. ARR is expected to have another year of double-digit growth. We are projecting segment margin to expand by 60 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow 12% versus prior year. And we target generation of over $1.1 billion of free cash flow next year with a return to a more normalized conversion of 95%. Let me turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q4 performance and financial outlook for fiscal 2023. Nick? Nick Gangestad : Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll start on Slide 9, fourth quarter key financial information. Fourth quarter reported sales were up 17.6% over last year. Q4 organic sales were up 20.5% and acquisitions contributed 1.9 points to total growth. Currency translation decreased sales by 4.8 points. Segment operating margin expanded to 23.3% and was in line with our expectations. The 540 basis point increase was driven by higher sales and positive price costs, partially offset by the negative impact from currency. Corporate and other expense was $35 million and in line with the prior year. Adjusted EPS of $3.04 was in line with our guidance and grew 30% versus the prior year. I\u2019ll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 17.8%. The year-over-year increase was related to the cumulative impact of several onetime discrete items recognized in the prior year. Free cash flow was $359 million and was up $200 million over the prior year, driven by higher pretax income. Working capital on a currency-neutral basis grew 10% sequentially versus our plans for a 10% decline. Our planned inventory reductions did not materialize in the quarter due to the continued build of raw material and work in process waiting on critical components. The actions we put in place to rightsize inventory are taking longer to implement in the current supply chain environment. Our inventory days on hand at the end of the current year were close to 130 days versus a pre-pandemic average of 90 to 100 days. One additional item not shown on the slide. We repurchased approximately 300,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $76 million. For the full year, our share repurchases totaled $301 million, in line with our July guidance. On September 30, $1.3 billion remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 10 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. Total and organic sales grew double digits across all three segments with software and control growing over 30% year-over-year. Backlog for all three segments grew sequentially and was up over 75% year-over-year. Segment margins for the Intelligent Devices segment expanded to 22.3% on higher sales and positive price/costs, partially offset by the negative impact from currency. Compared to last year, software and control margins were up over 10 percentage points driven by higher sales and positive price/cost, partially offset by negative currency impacts. Lifecycle Services segment margin was 10.7% and increased 260 basis points versus prior year, benefiting from higher sales. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.02. The next Slide 11 provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q4 fiscal 2021 to Q4 fiscal 2022. Core performance was up $1.15 on a 20.5% organic sales increase. Approximately $0.10 were related to non-recurring accelerated investments that were made in the prior year. These investments were mostly in our Software & Control segment. The impact of currency was a $0.25 reduction in EPS, which was about $0.10 worse than our expectations, reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar throughout the quarter. Incentive compensation was a $0.10 benefit. As previously noted, our higher adjusted effective tax rate was a $0.60 headwind due to prior year comps. Acquisitions, including the impact of interest added $0.15, primarily related to the prior year Plex deal fees. Our reduction in outstanding shares added about $0.05. Slide 12 provides a walk from our Q4 midpoint in our July guidance to our actual Q4 adjusted EPS results. Other than currency, sales and profits in the quarter played out in line with our guidance. Currency impact on sales was about $25 million worse than we expected and a $0.10 worse on EPS. The impact from currency on EPS was offset by a slightly lower incentive compensation and a more favorable adjusted tax rate. Strong organic sales growth and good execution delivered over 23% operating margin in the quarter. Slide 13 provides key financial information for the full year fiscal 2022. Reported sales grew 10.9% to $7.8 billion, including over 2 points coming from acquisitions. Currency negatively impacted sales by approximately $200 million or 2.7 points. Organic sales were up over 11% with growth bounced across all regions and business segments. Full year segment margin remained at about 20%. The benefit from higher volumes and lower incentive compensation was fully offset by higher wages and labor inefficiencies in our projects and in our plants caused by supply chain constraints. Margins were also negatively impacted by negative price costs, primarily in the first half of the year. We increased our growth investments by double digits this year with a big focus on key product launches, new digital capabilities, increased sales force investments and plant capacity expansion. Corporate and other was down $16 million, mostly related to acquisition costs associated with the Plex acquisition in the prior year. Adjusted EPS was up 1%. A detailed year-over-year adjusted EPS walk can be found in the appendix for your reference. Excluding the impact of the tax rate and the prior year onetime items, which included a favorable legal settlement and onetime accelerated investments, our adjusted EPS was up 11%. As discussed earlier, free cash flow performance was below our expectations with free cash flow conversion of 61%. The $460 million decrease in free cash flow was driven by a 50% increase in working capital on a currency-neutral basis as well as the payments of the fiscal year 2021 bonus in fiscal year 2022. There was no bonus payment made in fiscal year 2021. Working capital as a percent of sales was 16% compared to 12% a year earlier. Return on invested capital was 15.2% for fiscal year 2022 and 16 points worse than the prior year, primarily related to higher invested capital and lower pretax GAAP income driven by our mark-to-market adjustments made on our PTC investment in both years. For the year, we deployed about $900 million of capital towards dividends, share repurchases and inorganic investments in fiscal 2022. We also paid down debt by about $150 million. Our capital structure and liquidity remains strong. Before I cover fiscal year 2023 guidance, let\u2019s turn to Page 14. In fiscal year 2022, our backlog grew by over 75% year-over-year, including strong double-digit growth in each segment. Pre-pandemic, we had about one month or less of the following year\u2019s revenue in the backlog for Software & Control and Intelligent Devices. Our backlog now represents over 50% of our fiscal year 2023 sales guide for both of these segments. This unprecedented backlog coverage adds to our confidence in our revenue outlook. Our backlog also includes the benefits of price increases that were implemented throughout fiscal year 2022. Let\u2019s move on to the next Slide 15, guidance for fiscal year 2023. We are expecting sales of about $8.5 billion in fiscal 2023, up 9.5% at the midpoint of the range. We expect organic sales growth to be in a range of 9% to 13% and 11% at the midpoint of our range. This outlook includes our current backlog levels, our latest assumptions on supply chain stabilization as well as continued price growth momentum. We expect full year segment operating margins to be about 20.5%. At the midpoint, our guidance assumes full year core earnings conversion of between 30% and 35%. I\u2019ll cover a few more details on this on the next slide. We expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate will be around 18%. We do not anticipate any material discrete items to impact our tax rate in fiscal 2023. Our adjusted EPS guidance is $10.20 to $11. This compares to fiscal 2022 adjusted EPS of $9.49. At the midpoint of the range, this represents 12% adjusted EPS growth. I will cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS walk on a later slide. We expect full year fiscal 2023 free cash flow conversion of about 95% of adjusted income. This reflects $190 million of capital expenditures. We are planning for a reduction in our working capital days with a focus on inventory days on hand. Our working capital is targeted to be about 15% of sales, still above our historic amount of around 12% as the return to pre-pandemic supplier lead times is slow. Finally, our projections include additional income tax payments of around $100 million related to the change in U.S. tax law that no longer allows for the immediate expensing of R&D. A few additional comments on fiscal 2023 guidance. Corporate and other expense is expected to be around $120 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2023 is expected to be around $120 million. And finally, we\u2019re assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 115.1 million shares. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 16. Given the continued supply chain volatility and many moving pieces, we wanted to provide a slide that lays out the tailwinds and headwinds that are included in our fiscal year 2023 guidance. From a top line perspective, our 11% organic sales growth is supported by our higher backlog. This includes about 7% from higher volumes due to general supply chain stabilization, low cancellation rates and resiliency benefits coming from our redesign efforts done in fiscal 2022 and continuing in fiscal 2023. About 4% is coming from price growth, mostly tied to price actions that went into effect in fiscal 2022. We also have factored in about 1% inorganic growth for our recently completed acquisition of CUBIC. While the supply chain shows some signs of stabilization in Q4, there continues to be volatility along with a dynamic macroeconomic environment including the unfavorable impact of currency. All of these factors have informed our sales guidance and range. On adjusted EPS, we expect margin expansion from increased volume and positive price growth. The net favorable impact of price/cost on margins is about 100 basis points. We also will benefit from a higher discount rate favorably impacting our pension expense and will see about a $0.15 benefit from share repurchases. We continue to make investments in attracting and retaining key talent as well as restoring our bonus payout back to 100%. Combined these two items are around a 150-basis point headwind to our margins. While we do expect a positive price/cost for the year, we are also factoring in continued inflation, primarily in electronic components. We expect our margins to be negatively impacted by unfavorable mix and currency. Combined these two items will be a negative impact of around 150 basis points. We are expecting an adjusted effective tax rate of 18% or about a $0.20 headwind. The next Slide 17 provides the adjusted EPS walk from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023 guidance at the midpoint for your reference and which I spoke to on the previous slide. From a calendarization viewpoint, we expect our second and third quarters to have the highest sales growth rates for the year with each up mid-to-high teens year-over-year. We expect Q1 and Q4 to be in the single-digit growth range. Following the first quarter, we expect sequential sales to improve over the balance of the year. We expect segment margins and adjusted EPS to decline year-over-year in Q1. We see segment margins in the mid-teens for Q1 which is factored into our full year view of 20.5%. In Q1, we are projecting a year-over-year margin decrease from increases in spend, unfavorable mix, and currency, partially offset by positive price/cost. We are seeing margins improved sequentially following Q1 driven by higher volumes and continued positive price/cost. Moving on to the next Slide 18. I\u2019ll make a few comments on our capital deployment framework. Our long-term capital deployment priorities remain the same. Our first priority is organic growth. After that, we focus capital deployment on inorganic activities. Then we focus on capital returns to shareowners, through our dividend, and then share repurchases. In addition to our organic and inorganic investments, our capital deployment plans for fiscal 2023 include a focus on de-levering, dividends of about $540 million, and share repurchases of between $200 million and $300 million. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Blake Moret : Thanks, Nick. As we look to 2023, we are confident in our ability to execute our strategy. Our record backlog, underlying customer demand, and a more resilient operating model set the stage for a year of double-digit sales and earnings growth. As you heard today, we are continuing to invest for our future, including investing in attracting and retaining key talent. I would like to thank our people for their relentless commitment to solving the immediate needs of our customers while focusing on continued innovation and investment for the future. We are excited to share some of these innovations with you at our Investor Day in Chicago during Automation Fair later this month. We will be introducing an industry-first, cloud-native programming application for Logix, a new operator interface package, new I/O for process industries, on-machine motor control, and a host of other differentiated offerings that make this time a historic moment in Rockwell\u2019s journey. Aijana will now begin the Q&A session. Aijana Zellner : We would like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow up. Thank you. Julianne, let\u2019s take our first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning, guys, Blake, Nick, Aijana. Blake Moret : Hey, good morning. Aijana Zellner : Good morning. Scott Davis : Thanks for the detail. But can you give us a sense of inflection points and end markets, things that you\u2019re expecting to get perhaps meaningfully better or meaningfully worse in your 2023 guide? Blake Moret : So Scott, just working through the different industry segments, we talk about continued investment within the discrete industry segment in EV and battery. I mentioned the Hyundai wind, great wind force for with the greenfield, and we continue to see both the established brand owners as well as the startups increase capacity in their EV fleets because they have to, otherwise they\u2019re going to lose share and they\u2019re not going to be ready to meet growing consumer demand there. So we see that continuing. We continue to see a semiconductor moving forward. And even with a decrease in demand in the consumer markets, the trends remain that people are going to try to make every product that they produce smarter and there\u2019s going to continue to be growth in semiconductor, in consumer and certainly in the industrial markets that we participate in and automotive and so on. So we see continued investment there. And as we talked about a little bit, we\u2019re playing an expanded role in semiconductor production most specifically referenced by that material handling that way for handling wind that we talked about on the call. We see warehouse automation continuing. I don\u2019t see an immediate reacceleration in e-commerce, but for retailers wanting to be more efficient in back of store and in their own warehouses, we continue to see good business there going forward into fiscal 2023. In the Hybrid Industry segment, food and beverage continues a lot of that activity apart from a few of the green fields that we\u2019re participating in is actually productivity and resilience plays within existing facilities. So this is one of the best areas for our cyber security offerings. The services that we\u2019re providing in assessing and remediating and monitoring these facilities is particularly attractive to a lot of these food and beverage and consumer packaged goods companies. Pharmaceuticals, we continue to see the trends towards personalized medicine continuing on and within the Hybrid Industry segment, eco industrial with renewables and energy management water treatment that continues to be strong I think with good secular tailwinds. And then in process oil and gas, we continue to see double-digit growth ahead for the Sensia joint venture. Obviously, there\u2019s a lot of interest in the U.S. expanding our ability to provide energy both for our own domestic needs as well as potentially more export and along with traditional fossil fuels and helping them with their energy transition plans. And all of them of course have those plans. Renewables as well, and we\u2019ve talked before about customers like for solar that are continuing to build out their capabilities in renewables, and we\u2019re playing a strong role in that. So when we look at these verticals, we continue to see strength even in the face of what are certainly some macroeconomic headwinds. Scott Davis : Good answer, Blake, or good thorough answer. When you get into the detail of auto. When you think about the spend \u2013 higher spend in EV and batteries, is there a certain negative offset in ice [ph] or is there some pent-up demand? I suppose just from the COVID lockdowns and such in that part of the world where there still needs to be some money spent, some color there would be helpful. Thanks. Blake Moret : Yes, Scott, I think the brand owners are going to continue to focus on their profit makers, right? They\u2019ve got their own sources of profit that are funding these new ventures. And so when you think of the trucks and the bigger vehicles, the luxury vehicles that are providing an outsized percentage of the profit, they\u2019re going to be working to keep those areas strong through this. They\u2019re probably going to be very judicious when it comes to model changeovers and things like that, but in terms of keeping those plants up and running that\u2019s a good read for us with all the installed base that we have. Scott Davis : Okay. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you and best of luck. Blake Moret : Yes. Thanks, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andrew Obin : Hi. Can you hear me? Blake Moret : We can. Nick Gangestad : Yes, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Excellent. Just, can you just talk about maybe any one time items that you got to ship a third quarter that you\u2019re not getting to ship in the first quarter? Other than normal seasonality, a price cost, but any specific market or geography that was particularly strong in the quarter, that sort of leading to very conservative forecast on mix and revenue in Q1? Thank you. Nick Gangestad : Yes, the biggest swing we\u2019re going to see Andrew is in our Software & Control segment. Our fourth quarter, we saw good availability of components that we\u2019re benefiting our results in the fourth quarter. As we work with our suppliers there, we are seeing a decline in our Software & Control in the first quarter as we work specific \u2013 there\u2019s specific components that we \u2013 that will be during part of the first quarter that will be an even shorter supply. And that\u2019s part of what we\u2019re causing \u2013 what we\u2019re guiding in our statements about first quarter. This is really coming from our increase \u2013 as you can imagine, Andrew, throughout the year, it become even tighter engaged with our component suppliers to make sure we are making the right plans and making the right promises to our customers. And with this, we could see that there\u2019s a couple components that are going to be impacting us in partway through first quarter. Blake Moret : Yes. Nick, just to add to that, Andrew, the granularity of our analysis and out of our key suppliers, I should add continues to improve. And we think that had a bearing on Q3 and Q4 coming in as we expected in terms of the component supply. Working with these suppliers, we did identify a constraint in chip supply that will disproportionately affect offering control for a portion of Q1. The suppliers that we\u2019re working with have a high say/do ratio. They have characterized the issue. We understand it. We\u2019re working closely with them. But that\u2019s embedded in the Q1 implied guide. Andrew Obin : Got you. And just to understand in terms of your backlog and as you look into 2023, what percent of your revenue is underwritten at this point by the existing backlog? And how does it compare to sort of a normal year end? Thanks so much. Blake Moret : Yes. So, Nick will add some additional details to this. But we have about 60% of the full year in backlog. Typically, we have about a month. Most of our products are delivered off of a distributor shelf or very quickly from one of our factories either drop ship or through the distributor. And so having well over half the year of our shipments in the guidance in backlog is absolutely unprecedented. And you see the slide that we posted to kind of show the development of that across all three of our business segments. Andrew Obin : Right. Sorry, Nick. Yes? Nick Gangestad : Yes, Andrew, I don\u2019t really have anything to add to that, that those comments about less than a month and greater than half a year, that\u2019s really focused on our Software & Control and Intelligent Devices. I would call our Lifecycle Services a more normal. It\u2019s slightly elevated backlog, but that\u2019s a more normal type backlog. It\u2019s the other two segments that have the extended amounts of backlog. Andrew Obin : So it\u2019s just a real ability to ship as the gating factor. Nick Gangestad : That is correct. Andrew Obin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Hey, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Blake Moret : Hey, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Hey, I just wanted to try to deconstruct the grid \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, the bridge a little bit more if we could. In particular, just thinking about price cost, right, I think you talked about a 100 basis point tailwind there. And Nick, I guess the math that I\u2019m doing here is 4% price is kind of like over $300 million, right. So that\u2019s like $2 a share. So to get price/cost down to, call it, roughly $1 that we\u2019d be talking about cost being about half of what price is. So that gets me to like $150 million benefit on price/cost or maybe 200 basis points. I don\u2019t know if you agree with that math, but I just love some more color on what\u2019s going on in price/cost and mix and just how to really frame that number up a little bit more precisely. Nick Gangestad : Yes. Most of your math make sense and aligns with how we\u2019re thinking about it. We are expecting input cost inflation to continue in 2023, and that\u2019s reflected. And again, about half of what we\u2019re seeing at price, that\u2019s accurate REIT that you\u2019re making, Jeff. As far as the \u2013 where that inflation that we\u2019re expecting, we\u2019re expecting all or virtually all of it in electronic components, where we\u2019ve been seeing that continue to go up, and we\u2019re projecting that to continue to go up in fiscal year 2023. Things like logistics, we\u2019ve seen some benefits more recently but we\u2019re calling that closer to flat for next year because while we\u2019re seeing some rate decreases, we\u2019re also anticipating some extra fuel costs that will largely offset that on the logistics side. So in terms of the math on it, I think the only thing I\u2019d point out is that price not only affects the numerator in that equation. It also affects the denominator as well. So adjusting both your \u2013 the income benefit but also the impact it has on revenue. That\u2019s what I \u2013 that\u2019s where I get to the 100 basis point impact on margin. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thanks for that. And then just a little bit more on Q1, pretty clear on the answer to Andrew\u2019s question about supply availability but maybe just give us a little color on the cadence of investment spending. It always seems to be a bit of a parlor game every year figuring out how that\u2019s progressing over the year. It sounds like it\u2019s heavier in Q1 and then tapers off, but can you give us a little bit more color on how to think about that. Nick Gangestad : No. Our investment spend now \u2013 and you got to realize, Jeff, this is coming off a year where we increased our investment spend by 10% or a little over that. And now we\u2019re planning in our plans this year about a 5% increase on top of that. So that brings us to the cadence throughout the year. I don\u2019t see any big significant change in the cadence. When I was talking about the movement of spend, that\u2019s really more a statement on Q1 of last year to Q1 of fiscal year 2023 that will be going up. Sequentially from Q4 to Q1, I don\u2019t see our investment spend changing very much. That will stay at a pretty consistent level. Jeff Sprague : Great, thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning. Blake Moret : Hi, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : I guess, first question on backlog conversion. You sort of touched on a little bit of it, but any sort of explicit view on whether or not you guys will be working down backlog or any view on how order rates kind of progress throughout the year like is that something that you\u2019re planning on dipping into as part of that volume growth? Or is the expectation \u2013 that order rates kind of stay in the ZIP code and you kind of end up kind of flattish on the backlog situation. I know it\u2019s not normal guidance item, but we\u2019re kind of at an unusual point in time. Blake Moret : Yes, for sure. Let me just start by saying even with orders and shipments converging a bit in Q4, we still built backlog in Q4. And so we continue to expect significant backlog as we exit fiscal year 2023. We\u2019re going to continue to provide orders information through the year. We think it\u2019s an important point. But as we\u2019ve been saying and as we\u2019re now seeing as lead times in certain areas become \u2013 start coming down and our levels of customer service are increasing, we\u2019ll see those orders and those shipments converge, but they remained well above pre-pandemic order rates. Nick? Nick Gangestad : Yes. I don\u2019t think I have much to add to what Blake said there. We \u2013 I think, particularly in the second half of the year, if we started to see some reduction in the backlog driven by reductions in our lead times, we would see that as healthy. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just on the incremental margins. I think longer term targeting something a little bit higher and sort of a reference point last year. Do you expect those to accelerate? I guess, sort of the input cost environment and some of the 1Q noise around supply chain. But on the investment side, I guess, what changed or what are you guys seeing to accelerate that a little further here? Like is there a specific market or channel shortfall? Or what exactly should we kind of anchor to as the driver of maybe that slightly higher number? Nick Gangestad : The 5% increase that we\u2019re talking about in fiscal 2023, I just want to make sure I\u2019m answering the right question. Josh Pokrzywinski : Yes. Or I guess more broadly, what\u2019s driving the incrementals apart from the things that are kind of beyond your control? Nick Gangestad : Well, first, on the investment spend, that\u2019s \u2013 that I would put in a very normal range of growth for us from a historic perspective. And it\u2019s the typical things that we\u2019ve been investing in. We\u2019re investing in product development. We\u2019re investing in our SaaS capabilities, some of our enterprise digitization. We continue to invest in our sales force and as well as we\u2019ve been doing some investment in plant capacity expansion and we see that continuing to go. We\u2019re also investing in our own talent and the compensation that we are providing for the talent. That\u2019s all part of that roughly 5% increase in 2023. Now one of the big things we have \u2013 I said earlier that we have a core conversion that in the 30% to 35% range, that\u2019s in line with our financial framework that we\u2019ve laid out. One of the bigger moving items in that is just the restoration of our bonus that, that we had a noticeably less-than-planned bonus in fiscal year 2022. In this guide, we\u2019re planning for that to go back to our 100% level. And our core conversion if we were to normalize for that would be at 40%. Blake Moret : Yes. Just to add a little bit more. I touched on some of the new product introductions that we\u2019re going to be bringing out and that really are creating new streams of value for customers and investors for that matter. At Automation Fair, we\u2019re going to be introducing a cloud-native programming package for Logic. This is going to be an industry first for a major programmable controller line. It\u2019s a big deal. It went general availability, it went GA a few days ago. And this is the start of a whole new level of value for our customers for many, many years to come. A new operator interface package that came to us began really with our acquisition of ASEM, it was an extra benefit in addition to the hardware that we have from ASEM. That\u2019s going to be at Automation Fair. A brand-new line of process IO, specifically for process industries, a major step in the areas that we\u2019ve been talking about for a while now to add new process functionality to Logix control systems. On machine motion control with kinetics and PowerFlex, so these are things that customers have been asking for, for years. And we\u2019re coming out now with these items and at the beginning of these new revenue streams. In areas like cloud native software, one of the most important things you get is continued innovation and releases to the market. With on-prem software, you\u2019re often bound by annual or semiannual releases. And while we\u2019ll continue to do that with our strong on-prem offering, continuing to innovate at a faster pace with these new cloud-native offerings is a whole new source value for us. And so some of that is embedded with those investment spending increases, along with the go-to-market to make sure that we\u2019re getting the word out, and we\u2019re in front of the customers we need to be. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, Good morning. And I just wanted to circle back maybe just some of the comments on the first fiscal quarter. So I think you talked about 15% segment margins down from, I guess, 23% sequentially in Q4. And you mentioned mix a couple of times. So is the point there that the Software & Control margins are down very heavily versus that kind of 8-point firm-wide average. And then are we right in thinking it\u2019s around sort of $1.80, $1.90 of EPS in fiscal Q1? There\u2019s nothing odd happening below the line or anything like that? Just wanted to clarify that a little bit on mix and the EPS. Nick Gangestad : Yes, Julian. The biggest thing I\u2019m talking about when I talk about mix is exactly what you referenced of our Software & Control. It was a noticeable help to us in Q4 with the 30%-plus growth there, and it will become a headwind to us in the first quarter because we expect it to be growing below the rest of the company average. So that swing there will be part of what\u2019s happening. In terms of other things, like things with corporate, other, with tax rate, I don\u2019t see anything out of the norm impacting us in Q1 disproportionately one way or the other versus the full year. Julian Mitchell : Got it. So that sort of $1.80, $1.90 isn\u2019t a bad sort of starting point, if you\u2019re down from the $2.10 a year ago of EPS. Nick Gangestad : Julian, you\u2019re asking me to start to guide quarterly EPS guidance. I\u2019m trying to give as much color as I can, but I haven\u2019t pegged a exact range for EPS for Q1. We tend to guide for the full year what we expect for EPS. Julian Mitchell : Understood. And then just \u2013 thank you, Nick. Just my quick follow-up would be around the order intake. I think Blake, you made some very positive comments around the overall environment. I guess ABB had talked about kind of a normalization of discrete automation orders by their customers as supply chains are easing and maybe slightly extended kind of times for the customers to place orders because of the macro. So kind of two different drivers maybe weighing on orders a little bit. I just wondered if Rockwell had seen either of those points affecting the order intake at all. Blake Moret : Yes. I think in the first, with \u2013 as lead times come in a bit, and we\u2019re seeing that with certain of our product lines, you need less coverage, particularly if you\u2019re a machine builder, you don\u2019t need as many months of coverage of the products to complete your equipment. And so that\u2019s going to reduce the size and maybe the frequency of those orders. And I think that is a positive trend because it means customer service is coming back to where we expected to be. And graphically, you see a bit of that on some of the charts that we showed. In terms of customers with your second point, customers saying, no, we don\u2019t really need it now, not seeing much of that. I can tell you that the calls I\u2019m having with customers frequently are that they want their stuff. And so we\u2019re not seeing much at all in the way of customers saying, ship it when you can. That stuff I ordered a few weeks ago. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not getting those calls. So that would be my characterization of what we\u2019re seeing. Q - Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Nick Gangestad : Yes. Thanks, Julian. Operator : Our next question comes from Brendan Luecke from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brendan Luecke : Good morning, all. Thanks for taking my questions. Nick Gangestad : Good morning. Brendan Luecke : So I just wanted to double click on the cancellation trends. They\u2019ve ticked up a little bit over the last couple of quarters. I guess two questions here. One, is there a root cause? Or is this just noise in the numbers? And then two, just a point of clarification. The 1%, 2%, 3%, are these quarterly cancellation rates? Or is that an annualized rate? Blake Moret : Yes, those are quarterly rates and I\u2019d put them more in the noise category. I mean, these are rates that are low single digits and they\u2019re well within the range of what we\u2019ve seen historically. Brendan Luecke : Okay. Excellent. Thank you. Blake Moret : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Hey, guys. Good morning. Blake Moret : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : On the end markets, can you give us a little bit of color around very strong sales growth orders a bit less of growth. Maybe just give us a little bit of color on the orders to the extent, you know, were there any end markets that were actually down? Or are they all up on orders? Blake Moret : Yes. So we don\u2019t provide specific information on incoming orders by industry. But based on the line of sight that we have with customers in these areas where we\u2019re working specifically with them on projects, whether it\u2019s in pharmaceutical for getting new medicines to market or it\u2019s new plants for EV like the Hyundai win or oil and gas wins that we see through Sensia. We\u2019ve got pretty good line of sight to that incoming activity, and it remains robust. I mean, again, while the order rates have moderated a bit, they\u2019re still well above pre-pandemic levels in the verticals that I talked about during my tour in answer to Scott\u2019s question. Steve Tusa : Got it. And then just on this \u2013 on the S&C margin, it\u2019s just a little bit like more lumpy than what we\u2019ve heard from others. Is there anything in the rev rec, revenue recognition around the software businesses that\u2019s kind of moving these margins around at all that we have to consider for a business like this going forward that may have an influence on 4Q to 1Q, it\u2019s just the seasonality here for that business? And also, why wouldn\u2019t these supply constraints impact intelligent devices more if they were kind of based on more of the products? Blake Moret : Sure. Let me start with that and then Nick may have additional comment. The Software & Control story is really around reduced volume. There\u2019s nothing in there with software rev rec, Plex continues to perform well. We didn\u2019t talk as much about it on the call, but we\u2019re very happy with the development of Plex, with the strategic value, the industrial logic as well as the financial performance of Plex, and we will talk more about that during Investor Day in a few weeks. So there\u2019s nothing there that\u2019s causing margins to be affected. It\u2019s more about the volume. And the issue that I talked a little bit about is with a specific components that are disproportionately used in Software & Control, there\u2019s a reduced supply for a portion of Q1 that picks back up. And so really, that\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re giving a little bit more insight there. But that\u2019s what\u2019s causing the reduction after an over 30% year-over-year growth rate in the fourth quarter with Software & Control. And as we\u2019ve talked about often, all of our products are very highly impacted, positively by increasing growth. We saw that manifested in Q4 with Software & Control, and we\u2019re seeing that moderate in Q1 and then with sequential growth from there through the balance of the year. Nick Gangestad : Yes, Steve, one way, we are still seeing, from a macro standpoint, general stabilization occurring from a supply chain perspective. What I\u2019m pointing out what we\u2019re seeing with Software & Control is some particular isolated incidences where we have this visibility of what\u2019s coming at us during the current quarter, and we just wanted to highlight that to you. It\u2019s not a general trend. It\u2019s something very specific and very short term. Steve Tusa : Right. But not software, not related to software rev rec? Yes. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. Blake Moret : Hey, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Blake, there\u2019s obviously concern out there regarding a slower global economy, but your orders, as you\u2019ve talked about have remained strong. Can you give more color into what your customers are telling you about their CapEx plans? We\u2019ve already talked about some of your more cyclical end markets outperforming the semis and autos. But how much do you think reshoring is helping you at this point? And where do you think we are and let\u2019s call it the reshowing cycle, if you may? Blake Moret : Yes. I like talking about shoring rather than reshoring because it\u2019s really more about the U.S. being an outsized beneficiary of new CapEx as opposed to shuttering plants in China and other parts of Asia and bringing it back to the U.S. It\u2019s really about new lines of business, new capacity, filling out a little more of a local-for-local strategy, got a lot of manufacturers are providing, and I don\u2019t see anything with the current economic headwinds that would cause people to say just kidding. Let\u2019s go back to pushing manufacturing to other parts of the world and chase lower labor rates. I see, if anything, the U.S. continuing to be a beneficiary as people are trying to add redundant lines as people are trying to get closer to their consumers so that they\u2019re not having to rely on 10,000-mile supply chains. We\u2019re going to continue. And one of the things I look at is our own plans as a manufacturer. What is Rockwell doing? And we look at our CapEx that Nick talked about, which is up year-over-year for things that we feel like we need to do for the near-term in office to sustain share gains going forward and the continued investment in the U.S. We have a very important manufacturing that we\u2019re going to continue in the U.S. because it\u2019s our biggest market. And we continue to support manufacturing close to consumer here just as we do in Europe and in Asia and in Latin America. Andy Kaplowitz : Very helpful, Blake. And then can you give us a little more color to what you\u2019re seeing in process automation markets? It seems like you\u2019re forecasting a bit of an uptick in mining related growth for 2023? You\u2019re still forecasting double-digit chemicals-related growth despite chemical-related companies having more difficult time lately. So what are your customers telling you there? And then given the later cycle nature of Lifecycle solutions, should we expect a bigger margin tick up in that business in 2023 versus the other segments? Blake Moret : So process, we\u2019re expecting good things in fiscal year 2023. And this is an area where even apart from the recent activity, the recent dynamics backlog is very meaningful. And so when we look at backlog, for instance, in Sensia, it\u2019s very strong. It\u2019s an even higher number in terms of the percentage of revenue that\u2019s in backlog for fiscal 2023 than the Rockwell company average. And that\u2019s typical because it\u2019s engineered solutions that take longer to plan and stage and design, commission and so on. So we see that as a good read for oil and gas. There\u2019s activity in mining, and we\u2019ve had some decent wins. I wouldn\u2019t call mining back at a torrid pace there. Metal is pretty good. And we don\u2019t talk as much about metals, but metals continues to be a big automation market and especially with the release of some of the new high-performance drives, we\u2019ve got better capacity, better capabilities than we\u2019ve had in years for addressing that market. There\u2019s still some activity in forest products and chemicals, and we talked about the win with Bora LyondellBasell, where our offerings, our continued enhancement of offerings with Logix Space control systems is going to help us in chemical, the new IO that we\u2019re going to be introducing an automation fair is going to be a major step for chemical as well. So those are some of the things going on there. And then in life science, as you mentioned that, really strong growth in the fourth quarter. We\u2019ve talked about how life sciences is not as affected by the component shortages because so much of our business in life sciences is actually based on software and high-value services. And from a macro standpoint, people want to live longer, healthier lives and personalized medicine is a way to help that objective, and that\u2019s something that we\u2019re particularly strong in. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate the color. Aijana Zellner : Julianne, we will take one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our last question will come from Phil Buller from Berenberg. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Phil Buller : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. I\u2019m keen to hear what level of safety buffer you\u2019ve baked into this organic growth guide for the year. There was a bit of an overshoot this time last year. I appreciate that there\u2019s 60% of the year already in the backlog, but I guess I\u2019m surprised to see an 11% midpoint given the macro. So anything you can share in terms of overall confidence levels or safety buffer would be great and where that might reside be that on the top line assumptions or perhaps it\u2019s more in the margin side, which collectively give you the right confidence levels for the earnings for the year. Blake Moret : Sure. Well, let me start by saying that the overarching driver is what we have in backlog, over $5 billion in backlog is unprecedented. And with continued strong order entry and with continued very low cancellation rates, that\u2019s the primary story. Now in terms of the tone, I did mention during my prepared remarks that we feel like a conservative approach is appropriate. I\u2019m not going to dimension that or quantify that, but that was a deliberate comment in the prepared remarks. Phil Buller : Got it. Thanks. And just as a bit of a follow-up or a slight adjacency really is the company\u2019s appetite for M&A at this point, be that large or small, I\u2019m thinking more in the context of peers. We\u2019ve now got Emerson, who are going to have a lot of firepower. Schneider, who are looking to acquire the rest of Aviva. So does M&A need to move higher on Rockwell\u2019s agenda from a competitive dynamics standpoint? Or has your thinking evolved in terms of the need to participate more strongly in M&A? Thanks. Blake Moret : Well, we\u2019re very happy at the increased participation in M&A that we\u2019ve demonstrated over the last few years and more importantly, the way that it\u2019s helped add new value for customers as well as investors. And we\u2019ll go into this in a little more detail in a couple of weeks at Investor Day. But first, looking at the strategic fit with some well-defined priorities that we\u2019ve talked about and then the financial framework. We\u2019re very happy with the way that our M&A that we\u2019ve already completed, most recently with the CUBIC acquisition and that we have in the funnel will continue to strengthen us as a pure-play automation provider. It\u2019s one of our strengths, and the market access that we have to provide new value from M&A immediately into all of the industry segments of discrete and hybrid and process is second to none. So I\u2019m happy with the way that we\u2019re positioned with M&A. We\u2019re going to keep doing it. We have a strong balance sheet, and we\u2019ve got a great track record of turning these acquisitions into real value. Phil Buller : Great. Thanks. Operator : We are out of time for questions today. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Ms. Zellner for closing remarks. Aijana Zellner : Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. At this time, you may disconnect. Thank you.",

Later in the call, we will open up the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Aijana Zellner, Head of Investor Relations and Market Strategy. Ms. Zellner, please go ahead. Aijana Zellner : Thank you, Julianne. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's first quarter fiscal 2023 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include and our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company, and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and details in all our SEC filings. So with that, I'll hand it over to Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to our first quarter results on Slide 3. I'm pleased with our team's exceptional focus and execution as we delivered another quarter of strong growth and profitability. Organic sales and earnings were both up year-over-year and better than we expected this quarter. Rockwell's continued investments in resiliency and agility, along with a gradually improving supply chain environment, helped more than offset many of the headwinds we faced heading into Q1. Orders and backlog were up sequentially in the quarter. Order cancellation rates were flat to prior quarter and remain in the low single digits through January. We are encouraged by the continued strength of our end user demand across all business segments and regions. Total sales grew almost 7% versus prior year. Organic sales were up 10% year-over-year, better than our expectations despite a very dynamic supply chain environment. Currency translation reduced sales by 4% and acquisitions contributed about a point of growth this quarter. Consistent with our prior assumptions, the split of sales by business segment, region and industry was impacted by access to specific electronic components and the composition of our backlog. In the Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales increased about 7% versus prior year with growth in all regions and product lines. We had another quarter of remarkable order growth in our independent cart technology business, driven by large multi-year deals across many industries including EV, material handling and semiconductor. I'll cover some of these strategic wins in a few minutes. Software and Control organic sales grew almost 16% versus prior year. Better than expected growth was driven by our team's ability to quickly redesign and requalify certain Logix products to secure additional components supply with the support from key suppliers. We also continue to see a gradual improvement in electronic component supply. Lifecycle Services organic sales were up 10% year-over-year. Book-to-bill in this segment was a healthy 1.21 and was consistent across solutions, services and Sensia businesses. Information Solutions and Connected Services sales had another quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. We are seeing a significant uptick here in large multisite and multiyear deals, both in software and services. One of our Information Solutions wins this quarter was with a leading potato processing company, where a combination of our Kalypso digital consulting and enterprise analytics capabilities helped the customer increase throughput and reduce energy costs across multiple production lines. We're proud to be an important digital partner to this global company as they focus on doubling their revenue over the next five years. Our recent software acquisitions continue to land us new logos across various industries and regions. These include Plex wins in metals, food and beverage and automotive and numerous enterprise asset management wins Fiix's cloud-native offering in Asia, where we are leveraging the distribution network to amplify our sales with local customers. On the Connected Services side, we continue to build momentum with enterprise cybersecurity wins with customers across food and beverage, life sciences and consumer packaged goods, prioritizing their investments and resiliency of their operations. One of our key cyber wins this quarter was with one of the world's largest global consumer goods companies, who chose Rockwell's differentiated portfolio of hardware, software and services along with the capabilities of our partner Claroty to manage OT security at hundreds of their sites globally. This multiyear deal will also contribute to our double-digit growth in annual recurring revenue. Q1 ARR grew 14%. Segment margin of 20% was up over 100 basis points year-over-year and was better than expected. Adjusted EPS grew 15% year-over-year. Let's now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q1 end market performance. All three industry segments saw strong year-over-year growth and were above expectations, consistent with the continued gradual improvement in electronic component availability. In our discrete industries, sales were up low teens. Within discrete, automotive sales were up 25% versus prior year. We continue to win new and follow-on orders with both the brand owners and the supporting EV ecosystem, including vehicle and battery OEMs and system integrators. A good example of Rockwell's strong position in EV this quarter is our win with a leading battery supplier. Our independent cart technology was selected for the battery cell assembly and formation process to support Ford's BlueOval greenfield plants in Kentucky and Tennessee. We talked about our strategic partnership with Ford at our Investor Day last November, and we are excited about the progress we are making together. Semiconductor sales grew over 20% versus prior year. This is another vertical where we are able to expand our offerings to new applications, including independent cart for wafer transport and Logix-based automation for silicon carbide wafer manufacturing. In eCommerce and warehouse automation, our sales were down low teens versus prior year. Some of our largest eCommerce customers are in the process of shifting their investment from greenfield to brownfield, and we expect continued investments in upgrading existing facilities, including next-gen sortation systems over the course of this fiscal year. One of our large multiyear wins in eCommerce this quarter was with CMC, a leader in smart solutions for sustainable packaging. Rockwell's smart machine architecture, which includes our full portfolio of hardware and software, will help CMC produce its innovative on-demand packaging at scale. Another important win in the quarter was with Phononic, a technology company focused on unique heating and cooling systems. This customer is working with our Kalypso team to create the cloud and IoT infrastructure necessary to support Phononic's disruptive design for cold chain solutions and warehouse applications. Moving to our Hybrid industry segment. Sales in this segment grew low teens year-over-year, led by strong growth in food and beverage. Food and beverage sales were up over 15% versus prior year. As I mentioned earlier, we saw a number of large cybersecurity wins in this vertical, underscoring customers' focus on resiliency and security in their operations. Life Sciences sales grew mid-single digits in the quarter. In addition to software, we saw a high number of cybersecurity wins in this end market this quarter with several important wins coming from Europe. Tire was also up mid-single digits in the quarter. Let's turn to Process. This segment grew mid-single digits versus prior year, led by growth in metals and oil and gas. We rarely talk about our metals vertical, but we had an important sustainability win with Cornish Lithium, a pioneering mineral exploration and development company, who chose Rockwell's PlantPAx process control system for its demo plant to convert lithium concentrate into high-grade refined lithium used for battery production. We are excited to partner with Cornish Lithium on this energy transition journey. Turning now to Slide 5 in our Q1 organic regional sales. Similar to last fiscal year, our performance here is a reflection of electronic component availability rather than the underlying customer demand. North America organic sales grew 8% year-over-year, Latin America sales were up 6%, EMEA sales increased by over 13% and Asia Pacific was up 16%. Let's now move to Slide 6, fiscal 2023 outlook. Given our Q1 performance, our record backlog and a gradually improving supply chain we are increasing our top line and bottom line outlook for fiscal 2023. While we are encouraged by the improving electronic component landscape, the macroeconomic environment is still very dynamic and we continue to take a conservative approach in our operations. Our fiscal 2023 guidance projects total reported sales growth of 12%. Organic sales growth of 13% at the midpoint assumes continued supply chain improvement. The majority of our fiscal 2023 shipments are already in backlog. We continue to expect acquisitions to contribute a point of profitable growth and currency to be a headwind of about 2 points. Nick will touch more on this later. ARR is still expected to grow 15%. Segment margin is expected to increase by over 100 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow 17% versus prior year and we continue to target 95% free cash flow conversion. Let me turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q1 performance and financial outlook for fiscal 2023. Nick? Nick Gangestad : Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 8, first quarter key financial information. First quarter reported sales were up 6.7% over last year, Q1 organic sales were up 9.9% and acquisitions contributed 80 basis points to total growth. Currency translation decreased sales by 4 points. About 7 points of our organic growth came from price. Segment operating margin expanded to 20.2% and was significantly higher than our expectations. The majority of our margin improvement versus our expectations was driven by the higher revenue from the redesign activity and improved electronic component availability that Blake discussed earlier. The 110 basis point year-over-year increase in margin was driven by positive price cost and higher sales volume, partially offset by higher investment spend. Corporate and other expense was $27 million, in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS of $2.46 was ahead of our expectations and grew 15% versus prior year. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on the later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter was 17.1%. This was in line with our expectations and aligned with our full year estimate of an 18% adjusted effective tax rate. Free cash flow of $42 million was $91 million higher compared to last year, driven by higher pre-tax income. As in recent quarters, working capital continued to grow sequentially. We expect one more quarter of working capital increases this year. We expect working capital balances to decline slightly in the second half of the year as our supply chain gradually improves. One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased approximately 600,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $156 million. On December 31st, $1.1 billion remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. Organic sales grew double digits in Software and Control and Lifecycle Services, with Intelligent Devices growing 7% year-over-year. As Blake mentioned earlier, orders grew sequentially in Q1 as we saw a healthy demand driven by continued strong project activity with our customers. We continue to see customer ordering patterns consistent with the longer lead times we have for portions of our portfolio. We expect further normalization of ordering patterns as lead times and different products improve. Turning to margins. Intelligent Devices margin declined by 130 basis points year-over-year due to higher resiliency spend and an unfavorable currency impact, partially offset by positive impact from higher price cost. Segment margin for software and control increased 630 basis points compared to last year on positive price cost, the favorable year-over-year impact of Plex and higher sales. Lifecycle Services margin was roughly flat year-over-year. Similar to Q2 fiscal year 2022, we expect Lifecycle Services margin to expand through the balance of the year. The next Slide 10 provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q1 fiscal 2022 to Q1 fiscal 2023. Core performance was up $0.55 on a 9.9% organic sales increase. The impact of currency was a $0.15 reduction in earnings per share. This was slightly better than our expectations. The year-over-year impact was due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Incentive compensation was a $0.10 headwind, slightly more than our original plan and driven by our increased growth and earnings expectations for the year. Our higher adjusted effective tax rate was a $0.05 headwind and our reduction in outstanding shares added about $0.05. Let's move on to the next Slide, 11, guidance for fiscal 2023. We are increasing our reported sales guidance to about $8.7 billion in fiscal 2023 or 12% growth at the midpoint. We expect organic sales growth to be in a range of 11% to 15% or 13% at the midpoint of our range. We expect volume to be 9 points of growth and price to be 4 points of growth. This guidance takes into account our Q1 outperformance and is based on our current view of electronic component availability and the rate at which we can deliver on our backlog. By quarter, we expect organic growth rates in Q2 and Q3 to be the highest of the year with each up in the mid to high teens year-over-year, while Q4 revenue is expected to grow organically single digits. While we expect sales to be up sequentially in Q2, we expect margins to be similar to Q1 levels due to higher sequential spend on new product development, resiliency and the timing of our annual merit increase. We now expect a full year currency headwind of 200 basis points, which is 50 basis points better than our previous guidance. This updated outlook primarily reflects the strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar. We expect full year segment operating margin to be about 21%, up from prior guidance of about 20.5%. We continue to expect positive price/cost for the full year, with most of the favorability coming from the price actions we took in fiscal 2022. As expected, the majority of our year-over-year price/cost benefit this year is coming in the first half of the year. Our updated guidance now assumes full year core earnings conversion of around 35%. We continue to expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 18%. We are increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $10.70 to $11.50. At the midpoint of this range, this represents 17% adjusted EPS growth, up from the prior guidance of approximately 12% at the midpoint. We expect full year fiscal 2023 free cash flow conversion of about 95% of adjusted income. A few additional comments on fiscal 2023 guidance. Corporate and other expense is still expected to be around $120 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2023 is now expected to be about $130 million. We're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 115.4 million shares. We've also included on Slide 12 an adjusted EPS walk from our previous guidance to our current guidance at the midpoint for your reference. With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Blake? Blake Moret : Thanks Nick. In this dynamic environment, we are positioning ourselves and our customers for a more resilient, agile and sustainable future. Automation has never been more important in solving our customers' biggest challenges. A large percentage of these global investments are being made in the U.S., where we have the strongest market share, the best channel and decades-long relationships. Shoring is real for many of our most important verticals, and we see these investments, along with the early benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act, reflected in our continued, strong order rates. We are accelerating the pace of our innovation, including new product introductions across all key product platforms and our recent acquisitions. These were showcased at our very successful automation fair in Chicago, where we welcomed over 18,000 customers, partners and employees to an amazing demonstration of the value provided by Rockwell and our friends. I was also able to meet our new CUBIC team in Denmark a few weeks ago, and I am excited about the new opportunities to expand our sustainability portfolio with an increased presence in renewables, CUBIC's largest customer segment. Importantly, I'm happy with how our culture is both embraced and enriched by our recent additions. And I'm excited to see how we deliver strong growth and new customer value together in the years to come. Aijana will now begin the Q&A Session. Aijana Zellner : Thanks, Blake. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Julienne, let's take our first question. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead, your line is open. Scott Davis : Hey good morning Blake, and Nick and Aijana. Blake Moret : Hey Scott. Aijana Zellner : Good morning. Scott Davis : You guys mentioned a couple of times electronics availability as being still a gating factor. Maybe a little bit more color on that in context kind of how that compares perhaps even just the last quarter and prior quarters and also maybe just some context around the product categories or the geographies where it's particularly still acute? Blake Moret : Sure. Thanks, Scott. So we characterize the general landscape as generally improving. And I think that's still the case. We use a lot of chips across our product lines. And I think most notable for the quarter's results was our ability to mitigate the specific issue that we were concerned about affecting software and control when we talked last. We were able to move quick we had good relationships with the involved supplier that helped us mitigate that risk. But in general, we're seeing chips improve across a broad landscape, but it's not going to happen overnight. And so we continue to work with those suppliers to improve the remaining constrained chips and some of those are in software and control, some of them are in intelligent devices. And then, of course, because Lifecycle Services uses products from both of those business segments, there's some secondary effects there as well. But the view is optimistic, but all it takes is one chip and a product to keep from being able to ship it. And so it's not all clear yet. Scott Davis : Blake, is that impacting kind of customer order patterns still? I mean is there still so much fear that lead times are too long that folks are potentially holding on to a little extra inventory here and there? Or is that not an issue because they were never able to hold on to inventory because they couldn't get any product to begin with? Blake Moret : Yes, it's going to be uneven by different product lines. So, we do have product lines in our portfolio that have pretty much returned to pre-shortage, pre-pandemic levels in terms of lead times. The majority of our product offering is still at elevated lead times. We still see OEMs placing big orders for more months of coverage for their machine needs than they would like to, than they will when we return to more normal lead times there. So it's still a factor, but it's improving, and we expect it to improve through the year. Scott Davis : Okay, congrats and best of luck this year, guys. Thank you. Blake Moret : Yes, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead, your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning everyone. Blake Moret : Hey Andy. Nick Gangestad : Good morning, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Blake, as you started calendar 2023, have you noticed any change in customer conversations around their CapEx plans in any of your end markets that concerns you? And then you talk about how you're thinking about your backlog moving forward? Obviously, it continues to be unusually high. Given the current demand environment, does it seem likely at this point that you end FY2023 with still relatively high backlog that sets you up for a pretty strong 2024? Blake Moret : Yes, let me start with that one first, Andy. We're going to have far higher backlog at the end of fiscal 2023 than traditional levels. That's clear. We saw sequential growth in backlog from Q4 to Q1. And with the demand that we're seeing, then we expect backlog to continue to be high as we head into fiscal year 2024. Now in terms of customers' CapEx behavior, the industries that we've highlighted as needing to make, let's say, once in a generation changes in their capacity, that's continuing. And we do track announced CapEx investments across the verticals that are important to us, and we continue to see high levels of investment in EV and battery. Semiconductor isn't on quite the same ramp up of quarter-over-quarter growth of new announcements but it's at a very high level even as that moderates. And as we've talked about, we're seeing increasing share of wallet in those fabs. So that's good news. Food and beverage, we talked about some of the areas, particularly of new value that they are investing in, probably a split of both CapEx and OpEx when they are looking at cybersecurity and some of the information solutions that we're adding. And energy continues to be a positive area where we expect for the full year, oil and gas is going to be double-digit growth for us. Andy Kaplowitz : Very helpful, Blake. And then Nick, maybe I could just ask you for more color on how you are thinking about price versus cost. You mentioned the 7% price in Q1. I think last quarter; you said price cost would be 100 basis points positive tailwind for the year. Has that expanded at on, how are you thinking about the stickiness of your pricing as supply chain-related headwinds begin to subside? Nick Gangestad : Yes, the guidance I gave last \u2013 three months ago that we expect about 100 basis points of margin expansion through price cost, that holds. It's more or less almost exactly what we said then. The way we see it progressing through the year, we see the majority of, in fact, the vast majority of that year-over-year change improvement happening in the first half of the year. We expected and we continue to expect approximately or a little under 200 basis points of margin expansion in the first half of the year, year-over-year on price cost and that moving down to about 50 basis points of expansion from price cost in the second half of the year. That's not a deterioration as it goes on, that's more a statement of the comps we're going against in fiscal year 2022. Going beyond that, in terms of price cost, now we're getting into 2024, and I'm just not ready to be giving any guidance on how we're seeing price cost beyond that. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate it Nick. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead, your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Hey thank you. Good morning everybody. Blake Moret : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Hey, good morning. Just a couple for me. First, just on supply chain and kind of the whole redesign dynamic, Blake. Does this actually create some permanent cost advantage, or actually is the redesign work kind of a negative makeshift thing that needs to kind of be corrected further down the road when the supply chain improves more? Blake Moret : Yes, this is going to make us stronger for the future. The additional redundancy, the qualification of additional components, the work to design basically new bills and material with less constrained components with better suppliers to ensure that that flow is more resilient, long term, that's going to be a net benefit to our overall supply chain. There is some overhead in terms of additional cost that's being directed towards those resiliency efforts, and that will wane over time. But currently, that does contribute to some of the additional costs that we're seeing. But we're already seeing the benefits. And I think mid and long term, that will also continue to be a real strength as we, like all our customers, are looking to increase their resiliency. Jeff Sprague : And then maybe just another kind of a two-parter for me. First on IRA, I was a little surprised to hear you say you're seeing some benefits there. I know like in wind and some other areas things are kind of gummed up waiting on rule promulgation. So I wonder if you could comment on what you're actually seeing there. And then secondly, on semi, I think, your historical strength has been on the material handling side of the house. And I would think independent cart is a better version of material handling in many respects. But could you maybe size in percentage terms or however you could frame it, how your potential share of wallet is changing in semi with your newer offerings? Blake Moret : Sure. So Jeff, you asked about the IRA and what specifically are we seeing there. A couple of thoughts come to mind with that. One, we've showcased the work that we're doing with First Solar, including some of their greenfields, which they've stated were helped along by IRA funding for renewable energy. And so we're proud of the relationship we've had for many years with First Solar. We're doing the controls and now the digital twins in their facilities. They would not have introduced as many greenfield projects without IRA funding. And so that's an example where it helped them, which helps us because they are a good partner. The second is some of the provisions in the IRA on U.S. manufacturing. When an automobile manufacturer builds a plant in the U.S., there is a higher probability that we're going to get large content because of our strong position here. And so that's also what's helping us as well. And again, it's the increased investment in the U.S. by the brand owners. But then when it comes to the U.S., for the reasons I talked about earlier and that you're well aware of we have an unmatched position. So for the second part of your question, semiconductor and what are we doing there? For a long time, our core strength has been in areas of facilities management and control systems. So that's controlling the temperature, the humidity, the cleanliness of the clean room environment. We've done that for a long time in Asia. And as more fabs are being built in the U.S., again, we're extending that capability and share of wallet here. It's also in clean room process tools. And with some of the tooling suppliers, we've enjoyed a good relationship for a very long time. And that's a combination of hardware as well as our project management and engineer-to-order expertise. More recently, cybersecurity has been a factor and has added millions of dollars of new business as we're helping harden these facilities to make them more resilient against cyber-attacks. And the wafer transport that we've talked about a couple of times, that independent cart technology that we talk a lot about in EV and other industries, is really valuable here as well. And we're starting to win big, multimillion dollar projects in several of the largest semiconductor companies in the world. And then the final one that I mentioned was a silicon carbide becomes a scale technology. We're starting to use it in our own products. We're seeing some logic-based automation there, and that's exciting because they are using a standard architecture rather than a lot of the custom PC-based control systems that have characterized that industry for a long time. So hopefully, that gets at the heart of those questions, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : It does, thank you. Blake Moret : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning guys. Blake Moret : Hi, Josh. Nick Gangestad : Hi, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Blake, just trying to balance out here some of what you're seeing out there versus what we're seeing in the macro, I guess the Fed is trying to create some more employment flag deliberately, and you would think that productivity and automation are sort of a foil for that, but it doesn't really seem to be showing up in orders. And I know some of the markets you mentioned in the prepared remarks where things like food and beverage and life science and EV, and maybe there's just not as much demand variability there. But how do you see kind of this cyclical versus secular balance? And are customers making these investments kind of with the expectation that demand will slow down and these are imperatives anyway? Blake Moret : Yes, I think, there is a blend of things going on. First of all, there is the investment in new technologies that all of the players in the industry, like EV, have a real fear of missing out on. We\u2019ve got the idea that they're going to take a pause based on the macroeconomic concerns and let their competitors build out their fleets and be far ahead of them in terms of their ability to turn out hundreds of thousands of vehicles a year, they just can't wait. And so they are having to power through a still dynamic economic environment. And of course, that's EV and battery. I would say it's also semiconductor as well, where they have to build this capacity. In general, we're seeing across a broader spectrum of verticals the idea that automation is going to help them be more resilient and is going to enable greater productivity from their workforce. So it's not so much about the direct substitution of automation for labor, it's making that labor more productive. And I think that's a general trend that we're seeing across other of our verticals, food and beverage, pharma, and so on. So we're seeing that. We're not tone-deaf to the concerns about the economy. And in terms of our own operations, when I talk about taking a conservative approach, we're watching that. We're prudently adding resources as needed to fuel new growth, but we're very aware of the macro. It's just not going to have as much of an effect on us in the current fiscal year because of a huge backlog that we have, and we're building backlog that's going to go well into 2024 and beyond. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got you. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on maybe putting some of these announcements we see out there in context. I think the White House put out something fairly recently, talking about across different verticals like ones you mentioned, some $350 billion [ph] or $400 billion [ph] worth of projects over the next several years. What's sort of the automation exposure within that for some of these bigger announcements? Is it 2% of the spend? 10% of the spend? Just trying to maybe kind of dimensionalize that versus kind of the bigger numbers that we see? Blake Moret : Yes. Josh, I wish I could construct an equation that would give you the percentages by vertical and give us our guide for us. But unfortunately, there's a huge amount of variability between the different industries. And of course, between greenfield, brownfield and so on, a lot of the brownfield-type investments are going to carry with it a higher percentage. So some of those are dedicated to the things that we offer in terms of automation and information management and the related services. The percentage spend for a new fab or a major new EV complex, it's going to be a small percentage of the total. And our job is to maximize the wins in our traditional value, but work really hard as we're doing in areas like semi and EV to add share of wallet, like we're doing with independent cart really in both of those as we're doing in software on the EV side and so on. So I hope that while that percentage of the total CapEx remains fairly low, it's high value, it's profitable and it's growing each year. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Very helpful as always. Thank you. Blake Moret : Yes. Thanks Josh. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to circle back to the margins, as that was the main area of surprise, I guess in the quarter. So I think Nick, you talked about a 20% segment margin in the first half and sort of 22% in the second half. Is it life cycle services that's seeing that biggest kind of half-on-half ramp? And then also, any help you could give us on thinking about the Software & Control operating leverage? I think that averaged about 70% in the last three quarters, so exceptionally high performance. How should we think about that on a sort of run rate ahead? Nick Gangestad : Yes. Julian thanks for the question there. In terms of moving from roughly 20% margin in the first half of the year to 22% margin in the second half of the year, yes, lifecycle services is one of the bigger contributors to that step up as we see lifecycle services going up through the year. But we're expecting margin expansion in all of our segments year-over-year in fiscal year 2023. And lifecycle services just a little bit over the total average for margin expansion that we're expecting. So that's how we're seeing it. In terms of Software & Control, like Julian, just one of the things I just want to point out, as you look at some of the leverage that we're getting, if you're looking at the base, that was including what I was calling out a year ago of some of our incremental expenses related to Plex. So as an example, in our a little over 600 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year in the first quarter in Software & Control, there's about 200 basis points of that, that came from the year-over-year change in what we're experiencing in Plex as we're largely driven by some of those onetime expenses that we had in 2022. In terms of the overall leverage and conversion that we expect in Software & Control, we don't really give it down to that \u2013 at a segment level like that. We \u2013 you've often hear me talk about our 30% to 35% core conversion. That's more inclusive of everything. But as we grow Software & Control, we continue to expect that that's going to create margin enhancement. That's one of the things that we expect that will enhance our margin. It is also a business that is attracting more of our incremental growth investments as well as we put more investment in that. So Julian, that's just part of the balance. I'd like you to keep in mind on that. Julian Mitchell : That's very helpful. Thanks Nick. And then maybe one just for Blake, on the sort of process industry vertical. So I think you talked about mid-single-digit growth there in the first quarter, and you'll pick up steam as the year goes on. Is that just a function of kind of sort of faster backlog recognition in Process Industries as the year goes on? Is there any sort of particular vertical within process that you think will drive that pickup over the balance of the year versus what you saw in the first quarter? Blake Moret : Yes. Julian, oil and gas is where we expect a particularly strong ramp from mid-single digit to double-digit. We also see a little bit of that in related chemical industries, particularly the fine chemical applications that are really our sweet spot. Orders continued strong for oil and gas and other verticals in process. They continue, as I mentioned before to see some supply chain shortages that put a little bit of pressure on the shipments in the quarter. But we're comfortable and confident with the continued orders and with the really strong backlog that we'll see the double-digit growth for the full year. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Blake Moret : I should mention \u2013 I should just mention, since we're talking about process if you were at Automation Fair, you saw the new high availability Process IO. So it's not just the traditional value that we're providing, but the strength of some of our recent acquisitions and new product introduction. And as we release over the coming months that high availability IO, that's a major step change in our capabilities in our PlantPAx system. So that's something that had been a gap for a period of time, and we're very happy with the way that the IO has turned out and the endorsement by process customers. Julian Mitchell : That's a good remainder. Thanks Blake. Blake Moret : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Hi. Good morning. Blake Moret : Hi Steve. Nick Gangestad : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : Congrats on the execution on the quarter. Blake Moret : Thank you. Steve Tusa : Just on the orders, maybe just a little bit more color. I mean it looks like the lifecycle services orders were up sequentially. You said that total orders were up sequentially. I mean any kind of frame of rough magnitude? I mean should we assume kind of modest sequential growth? Maybe just give us color on total book-to-bill. Was it in around that kind of 1.1 type of area? Maybe just a little bit more high-level color on where the orders landed? Blake Moret : Yes, the orders were strong. We continue to give the book-to-bill specifically for lifecycle services, which was at 1.21. And overall, for the company, as we talked about orders and backlog being sequentially up, meaning, obviously, orders were in excess of the shipments for the quarter, it's across the segments and it's across the regions as we see that continued demand. And we will see continued high backlog levels even with the strong shipments and the increased guide, we'll see very strong backlog at the end of 2023 as we go into 2024. Steve Tusa : Okay. Like up low-singles for total order, something in that range? Blake Moret : Yes. We haven't talked about it other than to say it\u2019s healthy sequential orders because we think the sequential information and the cancellation rates, which we also talked about being flat and remaining in low-single-digits, we think those are the most important factors going forward. Steve Tusa : Right. And the price embedded in those orders, I mean, to get from up \u2013 I think you said 7% this quarter to up 4% in the year, it looks like that prices obviously decelerating. I mean the comps on price get tougher. Is the price in the orders somewhat similar to the price you're booking in revenues today? And are you pretty much booked when it comes to future price increases at this stage? Nick Gangestad : Yes, Steve, as far as the pricing, what the pricing that we're going to experience for the balance of fiscal year 2023 is all or virtually all of it already baked into our backlog based on the orders that we have and the pricing we put in that. And that will be showing sequential price improvement from what we're seeing right now, just based on how that backlog is playing out. In terms of the guide I'm giving for the full year that is not representing an aspect of price starting to come down from the pricing level we're seeing in the first half. It's just a recognition of \u2013 we had virtually no price growth in the first half of fiscal year 2022, and then we had more significant price growth in the second half of fiscal year 2022. So that change from the \u2013 it's all based on comp, not on any kind of deceleration there. Blake Moret : And if I could just add to that, yes, we did have an additional price increase in December, so in this fiscal year. And apart from the announcements of specific price increases, we've talked over the last year of being more agile in terms of getting the recognition of the prices by changing our methodology with customers and with the channel. And I would just say that's proceeding smoothly and with our expectations in terms of being able to be more agile as future price increases are introduced. Steve Tusa : Sorry, one more quick one, because you guys mentioned it at the Investor Day, any feedback from the channel on how \u2013 on the behavior around this January cancellation policy change? Blake Moret : Yes. As we talked about the new cancellation policy on orders, that's more of a hygiene type of issue. We didn't expect it to affect order patterns, and that's exactly our experience is that it did not have a significant impact on order patterns. But we got it in, and I think it's a healthy part of our processes. Steve Tusa : Yes. All right. Thanks guys. Appreciate it. Blake Moret : Yes. Thanks Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from Brendan Luecke from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brendan Luecke : Good morning all. Thanks for taking my question. Blake Moret : Hey Brendan. Brendan Luecke : So question, as you look through this current cycle for CapEx, how are you thinking about recurring revenues on the back of your expanded installed base? Blake Moret : Yes. So we've had a big focus on adding ARR. We've talked much more formally about it here in the last couple of years. And while it's still a relatively small part of our total business, I like starting each year with that recurring revenue. It gives you a reason for being constantly intimate with our customers and the whole land and expand motion is well understood to be a good source of ongoing value. We like our position in terms of having that, growing double-digits, and being able to complement it with the physical goods that we're shipping that are still being sold on a perpetual basis, a one-time PO. But over time, we expect to add additional software and services to our annual recurring revenue streams as well as hardware where that makes sense. One of the phenomenon is as we're in our second year of double-digit growth, because our overall business is growing so fast, the ARR as a percentage of the total is not increasing a huge amount, but it is more than keeping pace. And so we're happy with it. We're retooling our internal business processes to be able to take orders with a mix of hardware, software and services to make it easier and easier for customers and channel to be able to restack and expand the content in those subscriptions and so on. So we're happy with the progress there. Brendan Luecke : Thank you. Aijana Zellner : Julienne, we'll take one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our last question will come from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Noah Kaye : Thanks so much. So I just want to clarify a couple of quick questions. Number one, you mentioned that after implementing the cancellation policy, it didn't really appear to impact order patterns. So just to clarify, you've seen orders trending still healthy here so far in 2Q? You've not seen any pull forward? Blake Moret : We see some pull forward that was in Q1 that was more a factor from the price increase. But even without that, we had orders that would have contributed to strong sequential growth. So any pull forward would not have had much to do with the cancellation policy, but there would have been some pull forward in Q1 that would have been a factor of the price increase that we introduced then. We are also seeing, as I mentioned in Q1, strong project activity with multi-site and multiyear deals, and that was significant in Q1. Noah Kaye : Right. And then a lot of talk positively around IRA and its long-term impacts; do you get any sense that, that some of the customer base is still waiting on treasury guidance for some of these credits and the like to make some decisions around investment? Any sort of sense of what that forthcoming guidance could mean in terms of opening up orders? Nick Gangestad : Yes, I know I think that's a fair assumption. Like we clearly have seen some activity of what we think of increased activity as a result, but there still is some portions waiting to be clarified. And I think it's a very fair assumption to think that some of our customers are waiting to see what that clarity is. I know, in our own case we're doing more evaluation and waiting to what some of the provisions means to us. So I think it's fair to assume our customers are doing the same thing. Noah Kaye : Yes. So very helpful. All right, thanks so much. Blake Moret : Thanks Noah. Operator : We are out of time for questions today. I would like to turn the call back over to Ms. Zellner to close out the call. Aijana Zellner : Thanks Julienne. That concludes today's call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. At this time you may disconnect. Thank you.",

Later in the call we will open up the lines for your questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Aijana Zellner, Head of Investor Relations and Market Strategy. Ms. Zellner, please go ahead. Aijana Zellner : Thank you, Julian. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's second quarter fiscal 2023 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include and our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and details in all our SEC filings. And with that, I\u2019ll hand over to the Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks Aijana. And good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to our second quarter results on Slide 3. We had an outstanding quarter of strong growth in both sales and earnings. Our double-digit sales and margin growth continue to reflect Rockwell's strong execution and focus on business resiliency as well as overall improvement in electronic component availability. The demand for our differentiated offerings continue to be strong even in this uncertain economic environment. Through the first half of this fiscal year, our total orders were $4.8 billion, spread evenly between the 2 quarters once we adjust for the estimated price-related pull forward in our fiscal Q1. As expected, our order cancellation rates remain in the low single digits through April. Total sales grew over 25% versus prior year. Organic sales were up over 27% year-over-year and were above our expectations. Currency translation reduced sales by about 3% and acquisitions contributed over 1 point of growth this quarter. As in the prior quarters, the split of sales by business segment, region and industry, was largely driven by access to electronic components and the composition of our backlog. In the Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales grew 27% versus prior year with broad-based growth across all businesses. We continue to see wider adoption of our independent cart technology in new applications across semiconductor, food and beverage and life sciences. One example of the new application is way for transport in semiconductor fabs. We continue to see increasing demand for this offering including important win with a large U.S company this quarter. These customer investing in modernizing and expanding its material handling systems and our independent cart technology helps increase wafer output and more efficiently utilizes existing fab space leading to increased capacity and significant savings. Software and Control organic sales increased over 40%. Strong growth versus prior year was led by logic, where we continue to see the benefits of our resiliency investments and an overall improvement in supply chain. Lifecycle Services organic sales were up 12% year-over-year. Book-to-bill in this segment was 1.27, led by strong order intake in our Sensia business. Information Solutions and Connected Services sales grew about 10% versus prior year. We had another quarter of competitive multiyear wins across our software and cybersecurity services portfolio. Within Information Solutions, I am pleased with the increasing breadth of our new Plex customers as we continue to expand our SaaS, Smart Manufacturing platform to new industries and geographies. One of our Plex wins this quarter was with AB-InBev, the world's largest brewing company and its start-up business EverGrain, focused on upcycling grain by product into sustainable supply of nutritious food ingredients. Our modular and cloud-native Flix software is helping EverGrain quickly deploy mission-critical quality management capabilities today while providing the functionality for the business to scale in the future. In Connected Services, we saw another quarter of customer demand for our recurring cybersecurity and infrastructure as a service offerings as customers across many industries are continuing to invest in safety and security of their operations. One of these wins was with Darling Ingredients, a food processing company focused on reducing food waste by collecting and repurposing animal-based products. Our annual recurring revenue grew 15% year-over-year in Q2. Segment margin of 21.3% was up over 560 basis points year-over-year and was better than expected. Adjusted EPS grew over 81% year-over-year. We also completed the acquisition of Knowledge Lens this quarter, which adds significant scale to our Kalypso digital services business. Let's now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q2 end market performance. Consistent with my earlier comments on the gradually improving supply chain environment, all 3 industry segments grew strong double digits versus prior year. Our discrete sales were up about 20% in the quarter. Within discrete, automotive sales grew over 40% versus prior year. We saw a number of strategic wins in EV and battery this quarter both in the U.S. and China, where a combination of our core automation and strong partner ecosystem helped edge out our biggest competitors. While some customers are optimizing operating costs in the near term, they still continue to invest in building out new capacity to meet their production goals. Semiconductor sales were up mid-teens year-over-year. I already mentioned one semiconductor win. Another example of how Rockwell is expanding our existing semi footprint now with wafer transport applications is our multiyear project win with analog devices. Our independent cart technology was chosen to automate ADI's material handling applications at several of their global fabs. By implementing our technology, ADI will improve operator productivity by at least 20% by moving away from manually delivering lots across the fab. In e-commerce and warehouse automation, our Q2 sales were down mid-single digits versus prior year. While we continue to see a pause in greenfield announcements, e-commerce players, traditional retailers and many consumer packaged goods companies continue to invest in modernizing their warehouses. Turning to our hybrid industries. Sales in this segment increased 35% year-over-year, led by strong growth in food and beverage. Food and beverage sales were up almost 40% versus prior year. We also saw a number of large orders this quarter with customers in this vertical continuing to invest in making their brownfield facilities more efficient and resilient. Demand in our dairy and agriculture processing business remains especially strong. Life sciences sales grew 20% year-over-year. One of the important wins this quarter was with a leading European health care company, where our Kalypso digital services used our Emulate3D simulation software to model and test multiple plant layouts to eliminate potential bottlenecks and increase worker safety. Tire was up over 50% in the quarter. Moving to process. This segment was up over 25% versus prior year, once again led by growth in oil and gas and metals. Within process, we had an important sustainability win. Through Occidental Petroleum's 1.5 subsidiary, Rockwell is providing control systems for direct air capture units that help remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We are proud to be a part of Occi\u2019s low-carbon strategy to deliver large-scale carbon management solutions that accelerate net zero economy. Turning now to Slide 5 and our Q2 organic regional sales. Similar to prior quarters, our growth by region reflects the electronic component availability and what's in our backlog rather than the underlying customer demand. North America organic sales grew 23% year-over-year. Latin America increased 16%, and EMEA sales grew 42% and Asia-Pacific was up 32%. Let's now move to Slide 6, fiscal 2023 outlook. We have previously said that the fiscal '23 sales performance is primarily based on our ability to ship backlog. Given our performance in the first half, improving ship supply and the benefits of our resiliency actions, we are increasing our sales and earnings outlook for fiscal '23. Our fiscal '23 guidance projects total reported sales growth of 14.5%. We expect organic sales growth of 15% at the midpoint. We expect acquisitions to contribute over 1 point of growth and currency to be a headwind of 1.5 points. Nick will touch more on this later. Organic ARR is expected to grow 15%. Segment margin is expected to increase by over 150 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow 25% versus prior year, and we continue to target 95% free cash flow conversion. Before I turn it over to Nick, let me share some of our thoughts on the setup for fiscal year '24. With more than half of this fiscal year behind us and through our continued discussions with end customers, we believe we have better visibility into our full year orders and backlog levels. We expect our fiscal '23 orders to be about $9 billion, which implies a slight moderation of orders in the second half of this year. This is consistent with our expectations of improving component availability and the subsequent reduction in customer lead times. With our current orders outlook, we anticipate exiting the year with backlog levels of around $5 billion, positioning us well for fiscal year '24. Also, as the largest pure play, we have an impressive record of earnings growth, and we expect that to continue given our unique market focus and differentiation. Let me turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q2 performance and financial outlook for fiscal '23. Nick? Nick Gangestad : Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 8, second quarter key financial information. Second quarter reported sales were up 25.8% over last year. Q2 organic sales were up 27.3%, and acquisitions contributed 130 basis points to total growth. Currency translation decreased sales by 2.8% about 6 points of our organic growth came from price. Segment operating margin expanded to 21.3% and was higher than our expectations. The majority of this outperformance was driven by the higher revenue. The 560 basis point year-over-year increase in margin was driven by higher sales volume and positive price costs, partially offset by higher incentive compensation and higher investment spend. Corporate and other expense was $29 million, in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS of $3.01 was ahead of our expectations and grew 81% versus prior year. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter was 17.4%. Free cash flow of $156 million was $110 million higher compared to last year, driven by higher pretax income, partially offset by higher working capital. The increase in working capital was primarily driven by higher accounts receivable given our Q2 sales outperformance. We improved our days on hand in inventory by 7 days in Q2, and we expect reductions in inventory days to continue for the balance of the year. One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased approximately 140,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $38 million. On March 31, $1.1 billion remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our 3 operating segments.  Organic sales grew double digits year-over-year in each of our operating segments. Turning to margins. Intelligent Devices margin increased by 560 basis points year-over-year due to positive price cost and higher sales volume, partially offset by higher investment spend and incentive compensation. Segment margin for software and control increased 900 basis points compared to last year on higher sales volume and positive price costs partially offset by higher investment spend and incentive compensation. Lifecycle services margin decreased by 180 basis points year-over-year as the benefit of higher sales was more than offset by higher incentive compensation and onetime items to expand future profitability. We expect lifecycle services margin to expand sequentially and exceed 10% in Q4. The next Slide, 10, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q2 fiscal '22 to Q2 fiscal '23. Core performance was up $1.95 on a 27.3% organic sales increase. The impact of currency was a $0.15 reduction in EPS. The year-over-year headwind reflects a stronger dollar versus Q2 of last year. Incentive compensation was a $0.40 headwind. This year-over-year increase reflects our lower bonus in Q2 of last year and our higher growth and earnings expectations for this fiscal year. Higher interest expense was a $0.05 impact. Our adjusted -- our higher adjusted effective tax rate was a $0.05 headwind and our reduction in outstanding shares added about $0.05. Let's move on to Slide 11, guidance for fiscal '23. We are increasing our reported sales guidance to approximately $8.9 billion in fiscal '23 or 14.5% growth at the midpoint. We expect organic sales growth to be in a range of 13% to 17% or 15% at the midpoint. We expect volume to add 10 points of growth and price to add 5 points of growth. This guidance takes into account our performance through the first half of the fiscal year and is based on our current view of ongoing supply chain improvement. In terms of the second half, we expect mid-teens organic growth in Q3 and high single-digit growth in Q4. This calendarization includes our view of chip availability in each of the next 2 quarters and our Q3 transition from one third-party logistics provider to another at 1 of our distribution centers. We now expect a full year currency headwind of 150 basis points, which is 50 basis points better than our previous guidance. This updated outlook primarily reflects the strengthening of the Euro against the U.S. dollar. We expect full year segment operating margin to be about 21.5%, up from our prior guidance of about 21%, driven by higher volume and higher benefit from price costs for the full year. We now expect an over 200 basis point improvement to margin year-over-year from positive price cost. This represents a 100 basis point increase versus our prior guidance, split evenly between price and cost. Our updated guidance now assumes full year core earnings conversion of close to 40%. We now expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17.5%, down from our prior forecast of 18% due to discrete items that were realized in Q2. We are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance to $11.50 to $12.20. At the midpoint of the range, this represents 25% adjusted EPS growth, up from prior guidance of approximately 17% growth at the midpoint. We expect full year fiscal '23 free cash flow conversion of about 95% of adjusted income. A few additional comments on fiscal '23 guidance. Corporate and other expense is still expected to be around $120 million. Net interest expense for fiscal '23 is still expected to be around $130 million. And we're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 115.6 million shares. Turning to Slide 12. Versus our prior guidance, we are increasing the midpoint for EPS by $0.75. Our guidance reflects an increase in our core of $1.05 driven by higher organic sales and our improved outlook in price/cost. We also deployed additional investments in sales and new product development as well as digital infrastructure that will generate future revenue growth and profitability. Currency is adding $0.05. Given the stronger outlook, our incentive compensation is increased by $0.40. And finally, our 50 basis point drop in our adjusted effective tax rate will add $0.05. With that, I will turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Blake? Blake Moret : Thanks, Nick. We are still operating in a dynamic environment and are laser-focused on execution through the rest of this fiscal year. With that said, we are continuing to accelerate new product development and investments in cloud-native technologies. Revenue from our new offerings, both organic and inorganic is becoming a more meaningful contributor to growth and share gains. We are the largest pure-play automation company with market-leading solutions across discrete, hybrid and process industries and we are adding scale to our differentiated offerings through strong partnerships and strategic acquisitions. Our recent acquisition of Knowledge Lens is adding 600 resources with cutting-edge data science, AI and cloud solutions to our existing digital services business. This expanded team is already working with our key customers on their next-generation plans. I want to welcome all Knowledge Lens employees to Rockwell. Our close relationships with end customers, our best-in-class ecosystem and our talent give us confidence in the continued momentum for growth and profitability this year and beyond.  Aijana will now begin the Q&A session. Aijana Zellner : Thanks, Blake. We would like to get as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to 1 question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Blake, so just focusing on your comments in terms of the setup for '24. I know there will be some investors who will think about the $9 billion of orders and say, look [Indiscernible] point to order deceleration in the second half. But how do you think about the cycle in the context of your $9 billion-plus solution, as we call it, that you're coming close to hitting this year and the $5 billion of backlog you end the year with. I know you suggested you're set up '24 earnings growth, but can you talk about how you're thinking about the durability of the automation cycle based on the conversations you're having? And do you have the capacity to grow beyond that $9 billion? Blake Moret : Sure. Well, let me take that first, Andy. We're continuing to add capacity. So at the same time that chip supply is improving. We're continuing to make sure that our labor and our facilities, our redundancy across our integrated supply chain operations is ready to handle continued growth. So let me start there. Now in terms of the demand, this is playing out like we thought it would. We have said for some time now that we did expect orders and shipments to converge as lead times improve. And so that's exactly what you're seeing, but the orders are continuing at a strong pace. And to look at that, let's take kind of a vertical by vertical view, we've talked about the historic generational spending levels in certain of the verticals that are important to us, things like electric vehicle and battery and semiconductor. We're seeing additional expenditures in energy, both as the fossil fuel providers decarbonized and as renewables become a bigger part of our business as well. But we're also seeing across all verticals an increased focus on automation, and that's due to large durable trends, things like scarcity of trained workforce and so the need to complement people with the technologies and the software and the services that we provide. So as I look across that while we continue to pay close attention to macroeconomic conditions, we think the setup for multiyear growth in automation and information is there. Andy Kaplowitz : And then maybe Blake or Nick, can you give us a little more color on your margins in the segments. If I look at software and control, it seems like when supply chain headwinds are not impacting that business, you can do sort of low to mid-30s and lifecycle, obviously, still kind of lagging behind a little bit. So do you get lifecycle up now starting in the second half of the year? And is that a fair assessment of software and control when it's sort of firing on all cylinders, it's an above 30% margin business. Nick Gangestad : Yes, Andy, let me take that. As far as software and control with what we're seeing in that business and the mix of what we're selling and the strength in the overall market there, we do see over 30% as a sustainable margin for that business. In terms of lifecycle services, we see that -- that's going to be sequentially going up. And we had talked earlier about getting this to double digits. We see that happening in the fourth quarter. And we think that's a good trajectory we're going to expect to see happen beyond '23 as well. So that's where we're seeing margins in those two segments. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : So Blake, just on some of the order commentary, I want to square the circle here a little bit. Talking about, I guess, you kind of comp the comp sequentially. You had the pull forward that probably happened around the price increase. As you said, lead times are coming down a little bit. So presumably, customers sort of altering plans accordingly, but you still have, call it, flattish sequential order. So something seem to have gotten better. It seems like it's the same markets that get mentioned over and over again, like EV and battery and Life Sciences and a few others that come in there. But did anything, I guess, build momentum quarter-over-quarter and anything in terms of March or April exit rates that we should be aware of? Blake Moret : Yes, a couple of things. Josh, it was fairly broad, but in addition to the usual suspects, the things that we've been talking about for a while now, I'd say oil and gas orders were quite good. We had some major competitive wins in our Sensia business that built some great backlog there. And I would also say within the orders -- North American orders were relatively stronger than Europe and Asia, and we expect that to continue for the rest of the year. Josh Pokrzywinski : And then I guess there's the obligatory question for Nick on investment spending since I think that gets pulled around a little bit, especially when things are a little better than expected. Nick, was there any kind of reallocation of investment spending to get more in this quarter? And how should we think about the rest of the year? Nick Gangestad : Yes. The investment spend for this particular for second quarter, it came up a few million dollars more than what we had in our initial plan for Q2. We are upping our investment spend in the third and fourth quarter. We started the year with, what I would call, a pretty conservative view of what we were going to do on spend, and we were holding some things in our back pocket that if things improve, we would be ready to invest in, and we are releasing that in the second half of the year. All in, that we see total investment spend up for the full year versus what we had previously estimated up by roughly $50 million. It's up year over year $180 million. I previously in the last guidance said it would be up $130 million, it's now up $180 million. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andrew Obin : Just we are getting questions on lead times. So how should I think about this $5 billion number? Is that just a nice round comp to where you were versus fiscal -- the end of fiscal '22 where you sort of showed you were slightly above $5 billion, right, and then sort of $9 billion matches, $9 billion is just very simple math. Or is there a sort of dynamic update to this number throughout the year? Is it just basically a placeholder to help us think about the big framework? Or is that a number sort of somebody manages to an update inside the company every quarter? Blake Moret : Yes, Andrew, you should think about that as a slight reduction of the current backlog, which sits at about $5.6 billion, but still held up by continuing strong order rates. So it's not intended to be precise, but on the other hand, it does reflect the trends that we're seeing and that is that as lead times improve, we're able to clear past due backlog, but the overall number stays quite high due to the continuing strength of orders. Andrew Obin : And just a question on Plex because you guys had a great demo at Hanover show. Can you just a, 15% IRR is pretty impressive. But can we just talk about Plex is doing? And how does Rockwell sort of manage historical focus on large enterprise and try to sort of feel is the product and SMB end market, just evolution of Plex what the experience has been, as I said, because clearly, a big focus at Hanover show. Blake Moret : Sure. Well, Plex continues to be a really exciting addition to our offering, and it's playing out like we hoped it would when we made that acquisition. Plex is smart manufacturing platform to be sure, has MES capability, but it also has quality management, supply chain and even ERP functionality for small- and medium-sized businesses. When we bought Plex, they had a great track record in certain verticals like tier automotives, but we knew that with our existing market access, we could expand that into food and beverage and EV and mining. And we also knew that we had the opportunity to geographically diversify their customer base and we're doing just that with wins in Asia and with putting Plex on to Azure in Europe where we've already seen some nice wins there. So it's that synergy that's playing out, and there is lots of room to run with that. So it's working well. I've mentioned before, one of the things that we've done is to take the seasoned veterans of selling cloud-native SaaS software and given them enterprise-wide roles within Rockwell. So software sales leadership, our Chief Marketing Officer and a number of other functions are coming from Plex. So it's not just the technology and the business -- it's also the expertise that we're making sure that we don't vary in the organization. Andrew Obin : And growth rates sort of commensurate was 15%. Is it in line with 5% for the rest of the business, better worse, if you could just sort of benchmark that if you're [Indiscernible]. Blake Moret : Sure. Plex and Flix are very supportive to the overall growth of our software business. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just wanted to try and drill into that book-to-bill element a little bit more for the back half being well below one. It doesn't sound like you're perturbed by that. but just trying to understand, if we look at it in a little bit more detail, anything you'd call out around sort of hybrid versus process versus discrete markets, maybe where you see that book-to-bill or year-on-year orders pressure being most severe. And just maybe a question sort of more broadly on that for Blake. You've had this component flush driving this huge revenue surge right now. Is there sort of a view on the world or the demand environment post that flush changed at all in recent months? Blake Moret : Yes. So Julian, let me start. I wouldn't characterize the reduction in backlog is pressured. It's playing out in a way that we would hope it is in that we're clearing past due backlog and improving customer service levels and adding additional orders in the business. So you know historically that Rockwell has been fortunate to be able to ship out products pretty much in the same quarter that we get the order. So this is unusual to have product backlog, and we intend to continue to reduce the lead times and products just as much as possible. At the same time, a 1.27 book-to-bill in our Lifecycle Services business gives us good confidence about continuing demand for longer cycle projects there. So I feel good about the way that this is working. We obviously are focused on execution as well as creating additional demand going forward, but we feel this is a very healthy environment. To your second question about, has anything changed in terms of the component world, being able to get chips. I mean we're always going to have a larger effort than we did pre supply chain constraints on making sure that our designs are resilient, both in terms of reevaluating existing products as well as new products and to make sure that they will go forward unless we have new levels of resiliency in component supply and robust designs to be able to reduce dependencies on any one vendor. So that's here to stay. We do believe, as Nick talked about, working capital with some of the inventory increases to go down, and that supports the good cash flow for the year. So certain of those things aren't going to change all the way back to, let's say, prepandemic, but we do expect a return to more normal levels in working capital and so on as we go forward as the chip constraints continue to resolve themselves. Julian Mitchell : And when you sort of look at the two components of customer demand being strong and a good pipeline of projects coming up, plus at the same time, a sort of accelerated backlog conversion into revenue because of supply chain, do you think we could be in for quite a prolonged period of having that book-to-bill below one? Or you're sort of thinking, no, we get some adjustments for a couple of quarters and then it moves back into seeing sort of one-to-one like Rockwell's classic business model. Blake Moret : Yes. Beyond kind of unusual levels of disclosure about the setup for '24 we've already given. I'm not going to guess further about that, but we do believe that the demand for automation in the specific verticals that I've talked about and as well as a general setup is something that's a positive read going forward. And our intention is to reduce product level lead times closer and closer to what they were before these constraints, but with an incoming order rate far above what they were prepandemic. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Congrats on the execution on this backlog. I missed a part of the call. But did you guys talk about the sequential change in that -- in the backlog from 4Q -- or sorry, 1Q to 2Q? Nick Gangestad : Steve, what we talked about is that the backlog at the middle of the year for us now stands at $5.6 billion. That's versus $5.2 million that it was at the beginning of the year. So up $400 million for the first 6 months of the year. Steve Tusa : And then just on the margins at F&C, how much of that is like did you break down at all how much of that was the products-related price/cost spread? Maybe just a little bit more color on the year-over-year margin drivers? How much came from the products in that business and how much came from the software there? Nick Gangestad : I haven't provided the product versus the software mix. But in terms of the things that are causing the margin expansion. The biggest factor by far is the volume growth that we're experiencing and the leverage we're getting on that. The second biggest thing that is improving that margin is the favorable price/cost versus where we were in second quarter last year. And then offsetting that, to some extent, to bring it down to a 900 basis point year-on-year increase. We have increased investment spend year-over-year in software and control, and we also are facing noticeably higher incentive compensation. Those are the 2 negative things on the margin in the year-over-year Q2 for Software and Control. Steve Tusa : And then where do you expect that margin to end? Where do you expect that margin to finish the year just for the annual F&C margin? Nick Gangestad : Yes. We think it will be over 30%. It's -- and that's up from what I have said in the past that we see that margin being able to sustain into the second half of the year. At levels fairly similar to what we're seeing in our second quarter. So full year, we're going to be above 30% could be a few percentage points above 30%. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : So I see some of the call, so I apologize if we're going to be sort of like, I will be asking the question we've asked about 3 times. But just wondering about the backlog kind of conversion means supply chains, where are we versus normal in terms of lead times? And converting this backlog, is it more constraint of just the lead times? Is it labor? Is it customer acceptance, project timing? What could cause the backlog to convert even faster in the second half of the year? Blake Moret : Yes. Nigel, this is a good development in that as the chip supply is easing that's really the primary limiting factor as we're clearing older backlog there. As we've said, we've got about $5.6 billion worth of backlog, and we're expecting that to go down to around $5 billion by the end of the year, but it's held up by continuing good order intake there. And also the contribution from lifecycle services with its strong book-to-bill. So it's primarily the chip supply. We feel good about our ability to continue to add labor in our facilities around the world. We've been adding for some time now, additional equipment. But as you know, we're not really a very capital-intensive operation. So it's not like if we're having to add a lot of heavy equipment because we're primarily an intellectual capital company. And so the equipment that we need has relatively shorter lead times than if we were in heavier manufacturing type operations. Nigel Coe : And then just another stab at the backlog. Are we seeing the mix of the backlog shifting to some of the larger projects, particularly with the systems, ED plants, et cetera. I mean, so are we seeing some of those larger systems orders coming through in the backlog? And then just kind of another part of that would be you point to $9 billion of orders, so obviously $4.8 billion in the first half, $4.2 billion the first half, $4.2 billion in the second half. What's -- I mean, 4.2% is still a very level, no question about it, but -- what's causing that drop down? Is it project timing? Is it lead times for customers channels are just not placing kind of the same rate of orders. What kind of visibility do you have to that second half deceleration in orders? Again, very healthy level that you are pointing to declining orders. Blake Moret : Yes. So first of all, in terms of the composition of the backlog, I don't think we're seeing any fundamental change in the type of orders. Now obviously, as we move through the backlog has a richer pricing as we work through the year. So that's a good read. But in terms of the number of big EV projects or semiconductor, facilities management systems or independent card or just continuing MRO, I don't think you're going to see a big change because a lot of these investment cycles in those areas are multiyear. We're in it for the long haul with some of these positive areas. Now in terms of where you might see a little bit of the contribution from the moderation in orders, probably the most specific area is as lead times improve, as they are across a lot of our product lines, you'll see machine builders not having to provide orders of the same size to have as many months of coverage of their backlog. So as they're concerned about their cash flow and they can look at shorter lead times, then they can reduce the size of their orders because they don't need as many months coverage for the machines that they've already booked. So I think that's probably the most specific contribution to some of the orders moderation. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob Mason from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Rob Mason : I called out Sensia several times in and around oil and gas. So it sounds like things are positioned to accelerate further there. But any thoughts just on -- it still looks like maybe we're pulling through an operating loss just based on the minority interest, how profitability might shift as we go forward over the next 6, 12 months at Sensia. Blake Moret : Yes. You said it. I mean, we're seeing some good growth there. We had a particularly strong orders, and there's a very strong backlog in the business. And so as we move through the coming quarters, we expect the positive contribution of Sensia both in terms of growth and profitability to have an impact first on lifecycle services and then more broadly across Rockwell. Nick Gangestad : And Rob, just to build on that. In my prepared remarks, I talked about some onetime costs that we took in the second quarter to expand profitability. Some of that is focused in the Sensia area where we made some investments to simplify business infrastructure for Sensia that we think will make it even more -- build it for more profitability in the future. And so that's part of what we're seeing in our second quarter results for Sensia. Rob Mason : Excellent. Just as a follow-up to, any thoughts, I didn't hear any commentary specific to China, just exactly what you're seeing on the ground in China and how that recovery is playing out in your business? Blake Moret : Yes. So a couple of things. First of all, in general, the growth is strong in China across the business. And it's a lot of the same contributors that we've seen in the past with areas like EV and life sciences and so on. So we think that our business there is posed for continued growth. Operator : Our next question comes from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : This is Andre on for Noah. On the M&A pipeline, you've previously defined ISGS and market access in Europe and Asia and Advanced Material Handling as priorities. Could you give us any color on what's most near term for you as a focus and how active that pipeline looks today? Blake Moret : Yes. Andre, it's a good pipeline, and you said it. Those are the priorities. That's fairly broad. But within that, there's a lot of information management software in the production world. So there's some decent targets there. Cybersecurity has been extremely successful for us both organically and as we've added additional capabilities through some acquisitions, advanced material handling. We talk all the time about our independent cart technology, about some of the things we're doing in robotics applications as the lines get blurred between robot control and programmable line control, and we think there's some very interesting things going on there. Obviously, you had AI and autonomy to some of these areas, and there's new dimensions for value for customers. And then New York and Asia, we're very happy, for instance, with what we're doing in -- with awesome, the Italian manufacturer of industrial PCs that also has some great software that's forming the basis for some of our most exciting new introduction. So I would say that the pipeline is good across all of those fronts. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you also just get an update on pipeline and customer needs in the EV transition starting with the upstream opportunity in lithium and any impact of the IRA and domestic battery and vehicle production where customers in that vertical focused most right now? Blake Moret : Well, they're all focused on building up their fleet capacity so that they can get a return on these giant investments. You don't get that unless you put more jobs per hour on the door and so they're all working to be able to expand their production output. But if you look on the on the road today, you still don't see a ton of electric vehicles and all of them, if you listen to those goals and you look at the trends, this is a multiyear process and from start to finish lines and the basic materials that are needed for the batteries, through the battery making facilities through the electric vehicle assembly. All of that has to build out to be able to get us to a point where you start seeing electric vehicles come anywhere near approaching internal combustion vehicles on the road. So this is multiple years and all of these manufacturers are focused on debottlenecking that whole supply chain, which is going to be in the news for years to come. I think the one other question. I mean the IRA, obviously, that helps there as well as it does with other renewable providers. We've talked before about First Solar, for instance. We talked about Oxy's 1.5 initiative. So we're seeing more and more of these come online across our verticals and people are doing it because it's important for their business models. And again, that's not a femoral thing. That's going to be over multiple years. Operator : Our next question comes from Phil Buller from Berenberg. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Phil Buller : I was hoping you could expand on the topic of, I guess, the order funnel or pipeline rather than the backlog. I'm wondering if you're more excited about the funnel in process markets, generally speaking, more so than discrete or hybrid at this point. You've thought very helpfully about different customer examples in those like EVs and such. I'm just trying to get a handle on how it aggregates into those big process versus discrete buckets. So which funnel is getting fuller, if you will? And perhaps you can remind us if there's any structural margin differential between those that would be great. Blake Moret : Sure. Yes, it's broad-based. I mean, we're very happy with the way that our business is balanced between discrete and hybrid and process applications with big opportunities in all of them. I mean, as we talk about EV and battery in discrete, we talk about food and beverage and life sciences, food and beverage is our single biggest vertical in hybrid. And then in process, I highlighted some particularly strong order activity with Sensia, but we also continue to see good activity in metals as well. So it's across all of them. Now in terms of the margin, one to the next there's high-margin opportunities in each one. I would say that the engineered systems are concentrated a little bit more heavily on the process side. Those customers are more often looking for engineering content to complement the hardware coming from the same provider. So you'd probably see a little bit lower margin there due to the people intensivity of that, but good opportunities in the funnel for near and midterm orders across all of the industry segments. Phil Buller : And just in terms of the different topic margins here. I know you've touched on the Software and Control margin. The drop through between the three different businesses is quite different, depending on which one you're looking at. And I know that there's been a lot of things bouncing around at the moment. So I guess I was just trying to get a handle on how you think about the H2 margin evolution for each of the three businesses relative to H1. Is there anything that you could point out that we should be bearing in mind beyond Software and Control, please? Nick Gangestad : Beyond Software and Control, which I've already covered still, when I look at intelligent devices, that's been a little over 20%, about 21% margin in the first half of this year. I think for the full year, it's going to be close to that, maybe between 20% and 21% for the full year margin for Intelligent Devices. Some of the things happening there, we continue to see good volume, good price growth, but as I talked about earlier, for the full year, we'll also be seeing higher incentive comp and higher investment spend. This is one of the places where we've been focusing some of our investment spend in resiliency and we'll see that continuing. So between 20% and 21% for Intelligent Devices. And then soft -- excuse me, lifecycle services. I've talked about sequential improvement. I don't see us crossing the threshold into double-digit margin until the fourth quarter. So I see Q3 being a move in that direction from where we were in the first half where we're in the little over 5% margin. We'll be stepping it up, but not all the way to 10% and then going to 10% or over in the fourth quarter. Aijana Zellner : Julian, we will take one more question. Operator : Certainly, our last question will come from Jairam Nathan from Daiwa. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jairam Nathan : So I just wanted to spend a little time on the automotive. We are seeing, as the transition towards EVs, we are seeing the number of process steps coming down. And I understand Rockwell probably does not have a lot of content on welding, but do you see any implications as EVs or auto companies go from spot welding to giga casting and things like that? Blake Moret : Yes. So the net opportunity for Rockwell actually goes up as we go from internal combustion engines to EVs, and that's for a couple of reasons. First of all, the traditional drivetrain operations. That's a more subtractive manufacturing process, that's boring cylinders, that's finishing metal surfaces and things like that. And that's largely done with computer numerical control, which is not a technology that Rockwell directly has. We have good partnerships, but it's not something that we provide directly. And so when that's replaced by some of the operations in electric vehicles, most notably, the battery formation and packing and assembly. That's more of an assembly type operation. And there's aspects at the front end of that with batch processes. And those are all applications that Rockwell has great readiness to serve. Then when you look at what you specifically mentioned in the joining part of it, it's more complex press operations, and Rockwell has great press control systems. So as the metal formation becomes more complex, again, those are really good applications for Rockwell with our program of control as well as our expanded drive control. So we feel good about those opportunities. And then added to those basic automation applications. It's the software that's a more pervasive part of the electric vehicle and battery manufacturing process, and we have really good solutions there. Jairam Nathan : And one more, if I may. So I mean all the -- given your outlook, I think the 1 area which actually decline seems to be chemicals. I think you went from a high single digit from a low double -- double digits. So can you explain that a bit? Blake Moret : No. I don't have a specific answer for where chemical is moderating other than to say our focus in chemical is more on the specialty chemical, fine chemical as opposed to bulk chemicals. Operator : We have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Zellner for closing remarks. Aijana Zellner : Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. That concludes today's call. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. At this time, you may disconnect. Thank you.",

Later on the call, we will open up the line for questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Aijana Zellner, Head of Investor Relations and Market Strategy. Ms. Zellner, please go ahead. Aijana Zellner : Thank you, Julianne. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's third quarter fiscal 2023 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include and our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings. So with that, I'll hand it over to Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to our third quarter results on Slide 3. We saw good double-digit growth in both sales and earnings this quarter as component shortages continue to ease. Lead times also continued to reduce across our product lines with recovery to pre-pandemic lead times expected for all products by the end of the calendar year. We did miss almost a week of planned shipments in May because of a longer-than-expected changeover to a new third-party logistics supplier at our North American distribution center. Shipments from this distribution center recovered in June and we now have higher capacity in place for Q4 fiscal year 2024 and beyond. Both total and organic sales grew over 13% versus prior year with currency and acquisitions roughly netting each other out. Currency translation decreased sales by less than a point and acquisitions contributed over a point of growth this quarter. Similar to prior quarters, the split of our sales by business segment, region and industry was largely driven by the composition of our backlog. In the Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales were up 8% versus prior year. The changeover in our distribution center had the biggest impact on this segment in the quarter. Within the Intelligent Devices segment, Independent Cart Technology continues to be a disruptive technology, and we had several more strategic material handling wins in the U.S. this quarter. The recent launch of our On-Machine Armor Kinetix motion control products adds to our innovative material handling portfolio. We also had an important win in Europe with SIDEM, one of the world's leading desalination companies where our PowerFlex drives and services expertise are helping this customer deliver economical and sustainable drinking water to millions of people in developing regions. Software & Control organic sales grew over 24% year-over-year. Logix sales were almost 40% this quarter, reflecting the strong differentiation of our control platform and the continued benefits from supply chain resiliency investments we've made over the last year. Another example of our many ways to win within Software & Control is recent success at a well-known global parcel delivery company, where the combination of our awesome industrial PCs ThinManager and View software unseated a long-standing competitor as the customer standardizes its North America facilities on a Rockwell visualization platform. Lifecycle Services organic sales increased 8% versus prior year. Book-to-bill in this segment was 1.08, led by strong orders in Sensia and our services business. Sensia had another good quarter of orders and sales with multiple large deals across EMEA and Asia. We also delivered higher sequential margins in Lifecycle Services this quarter. Information Solutions & Connected Services sales grew 10% versus prior year. We had multiple wins across our entire Information Solutions portfolio in Q3 and including both our on-prem and cloud-native software. This quarter, one of the world's top tire manufacturers located in Asia-Pacific, selected Rockwell's FactoryTalk production center to develop its new global MES platform. Another important IS win in Asia was with a Japanese global leader in HVAC where our cloud-native Plex platform is being deployed on Microsoft Azure at one of their greenfield plants. The customer chose our SaaS solution to quickly start up a manufacturing execution and quality management system without the need for extensive on-premise hardware, software and support. We saw Plex synergy wins continue to ramp up in the quarter as our strong market access machine is contributing to new SaaS logos. In the quarter, we saw the benefits of our software partnership with PTC with numerous recurring revenue wins through a combination of our Digital Services business and PTC's ThingWorx visualization platform. Also regarding PTC, we continue to monetize the investment we made in 2018. We now own less than 5% of total shares outstanding and in accordance with the terms of our agreement, I\u2019m stepping off of their Board. Our commercial relationship remains strong and was extended in June. In Connected Services, we had an important cybersecurity win with ADNOC, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. This customer is leveraging our network of security services and expertise along with an intrusion detection system from our partner Dragos to help secure its network infrastructure and comply with cyber governance regulations. Our total annual recurring revenue grew a very strong 17% year-over-year this quarter. Segment margin of 21.1% was flat to last year and in line with our expectations despite the shipment shortfall. Adjusted EPS grew over 13% year-over-year. Backlog is beginning to reduce as lead times improve. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q3 end market performance. Our discrete sales were up about 10% versus prior year. Within discrete automotive sales grew mid-teens year-over-year. One of the notable customer wins here this quarter was with the Korean Tier 1 supplier working on an EV battery project for a European brand owner. This customer is using our core automation offerings including motion control to provide tooling for battery thermal management. Another automotive win this quarter was with Jaguar Land Rover where Rockwell was selected to support the JLR electrified architecture for three of their EV body shops in the UK. Semiconductor sales grew high-teens this quarter, building on strength over the last few quarters, we continue to see broader adoption of our wafer transport solutions by the world\u2019s leading semiconductor manufacturers. This quarter, we also had an important Plex win in semiconductor at SOC, Saudi Arabia as the customer implements our smart manufacturing platform at its site in Riyadh. In e-commerce and warehouse automation sales were down high-teens versus prior year, driven by continued delays in some cancellations at our e-commerce customers. Moving to our hybrid industry segment. Sales in this segment grew 15% year-over-year led by strong growth in food and beverage and tire. Food and beverage sales were up mid-teens versus prior year. We continue to see both greenfield and brownfield investments in this vertical. With one of our most important multi-year wins this quarter focused on a customer\u2019s global fleet modernization program, a leading global food processing company is standardizing over 50 of its sites on our PlantPAx control platform. This competitive DCS win is a testament to our progress in process control applications in both technology and domain expertise. Life sciences sales grew mid-single digits versus prior year. This industry continues to see strong investments in CapEx and OpEx projects across all regions, both in traditional pharmaceuticals and newer advanced therapy, medicinal products. We had a strategic win with Biosero a member of the BICO Group in North America where our combined technologies increased the speed and accuracy of new drug development. Biosero selected our independent cart technology to automate lab workflows for a cell and gene therapy program. Tire was up over 35% in the quarter. Turning to process industries. Process sales were up 15% year-over-year led by growth in oil and gas and mining. Turning now to Slide 5 in our Q3 organic regional sales. As I said earlier, our growth by region this quarter and for the full year fiscal year 2023 reflects the composition of our backlog rather than the underlying customer demand. North America organic sales grew about 2% year-over-year against higher comps. Latin America was up 7%. Through Q3, our orders in the Americas are outpacing the rest of the world. EMEA sales grew 34% and Asia-Pacific was up over 44%. We did see an uptick in order cancellations in China this quarter. Let\u2019s now move to Slide 6 fiscal 2023 outlook. We are confident that shipments in the fourth quarter will recover the shortfall in Q3 caused by the distribution center change. Shipments in July were in line with our forecast for the full year. Our fiscal 2023 guidance assumes a total reported sales growth range of 14% to 16%, and we continue to expect organic sales growth of 15% at the mid-point. We now expect the impact from acquisitions and currency to offset each other. Nick will cover this in more detail later. We have said all along that we expect further normalization of ordering patterns as lead times and constrained products improve, and that\u2019s what we are seeing right now. With improving lead times, machine builders do not need as many months of products on order and are no longer placing unusually large advanced orders. Their incoming orders and front log remain strong and improving component lead times will help them improve their cash flow. We also expect distributor restock orders will pick up as they receive the last constrained items that allow them to clear their committed inventory and complete customer orders. Our order cancellation rates remain low. We now expect our full year fiscal year 2023 orders to be in the $8.5 billion to $9 billion range. Given this updated order outlook, we now expect to finish the year with about $4.5 billion to $5 billion in backlog with about 80% of that backlog shippable in fiscal year 2024. We expect organic ARR to grow 15%. Segment margin is expected to increase by 160 basis points year-over-year. We are increasing the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 and now expect adjusted EPS to grow 25% versus prior year and we now expect 80% free cash flow conversion due to higher working capital. Let me turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q3 performance and financial outlook for fiscal 2023. Nick? Nick Gangestad : Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll start on Slide 8, third quarter key financial information. Third quarter reported sales were up 13.7% over last year. Q3 organic sales were up 13.2% and acquisitions contributed 120 basis points to total growth. Currency translation decreased sales by 70 basis points, about three points of our organic growth came from price. Segment operating margin expanded to 21.1% and was in line with our expectations as improved productivity offset lower than expected sales. The 30 basis point year-over-year increase in margin was driven by higher sales, volume and positive price cost partially offset by higher investment spend. Corporate and other expense was $32 million in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS of $3.01 was below our expectations due to our shift in shipments from Q3 to Q4. Adjusted EPS grew 13% versus prior year. I\u2019ll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter was 14.1% and in line with the prior year. Free cash flow of $240 million was $87 million lower than prior year, driven by increases in working capital and income tax payments, partially offset by higher pre-tax income. The increase in working capital was primarily driven by higher accounts receivable and inventory. Inventory grew by six days, primarily in finished goods as a result of the shift in planned shipments from Q3 to Q4. One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased approximately 220,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $62 million. On June 30, $1 billion remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. Organic sales growth was led by software and control, which grew 24% year-over-year. Turning to margins, intelligent devices margin decreased by 290 basis points year-over-year due to higher investment spend, unfavorable mix and higher incentive compensation, partially offset by positive price cost. Segment margin for software and control increased 340 basis points compared to last year on higher sales volume and positive price cost partially offset by higher investment spend. We continue to accelerate top line growth and profitability from acquisitions in the past few years, including Plex, Fiix and ASEM. Lifecycle services margin was similar to last year and improving sequentially through the year as planned. Our focus on productivity is yielding benefits now and into the coming quarters. We continue to expect lifecycle services margin to expand sequentially and exceed 10% in Q4. The next slide, 10, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q3 fiscal 2022 to Q3 fiscal 2023. Core performance was up $0.90, excluding increased investment spend of $0.35 on a 13.2% organic sales increase. Incentive compensation was a $0.20 headwind. This year-over-year increase reflects the higher expected bonus payout this year versus a below normal payout last year. The year-over-year impacts from tax, interest expense, currency and share count were each immaterial to EPS this quarter. Before we turn to our fiscal 2023 guidance, let\u2019s spend a few minutes talking about our orders trends on Slide 11. We think it will be helpful to provide more color on our orders progression over the last couple years and going forward. First, in fiscal 2020, we saw reduced orders caused by the constraints on customers operations and uncertainty that the pandemic created. Then in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, we saw increased orders driven by the combination of three things. First, historically high levels of investment in certain verticals like EV and semi, as well as an increasing need for more automation to address workforce shortages and business resiliency. Second, catch up on projects that many of our customers deferred during fiscal year 2020. And three, large advance orders due to extended lead times caused by component shortages. In fiscal year 2023, we are continuing to see strong underlying demand, but we are now seeing the long anticipated moderation in orders driven by our improving lead times for products. As we stated earlier, we expect lead times to continue to normalize in the next two quarters and we expect virtually all of our product lead times to be back at pre-pandemic levels by the end of calendar year 2023. Once our lead times are back at normal levels, we expect customer orders to closely align with the strong underlying demand. I think it\u2019s worth noting that over the fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2023 time period encompassing the ups and downs of the order cycle, we will have grown revenue at a compound annual growth rate of 8% plus a backlog that is more than tripled during that timeframe. Let\u2019s now move to the next Slide 12, guidance for fiscal 2023. We are increasing the midpoint of our reported sales guidance from 14.5% to 15%. We expect organic sales growth in the range of 14% to 16% and we now expect a full year currency headwind of 100 basis points, 50 basis points better than our previous guidance. This updated outlook reflects the weakening of the U.S. dollar in recent weeks. We continue to expect volume to add 10 points of growth and price to add 5 points of growth, and we still expect full year segment operating margin to be about 21.5% unchanged from prior guidance. Our updated guidance still assumes full year core earnings conversion of close to 40%. We continue to expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17.5%, unchanged from our prior guide. We are narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance range to $11.70 to $12.10. This increases the midpoint of our EPS guidance to $11.90, up $0.05 from prior guidance and up 25% from last year. The $0.05 increase is driven by currency. We now expect full year fiscal 2023 free cash flow conversion of about 80% of adjusted income. This updated guidance reflects the new calendarization of our revenue and our updated projection of inventory days on hand. We do expect our inventory days on hand to drop by the end of the year to 125 days. This will be lower than the approximately 130 days of inventory we had at the end of fiscal year 2022, but will likely not reduce to the 112 days we originally expected. Our outlook for cash tax payments also increased as we realized capital gains on our sales of PTC shares. Income tax payments tied to these gains are reflected in our free cash flow results. A few additional comments on fiscal 2023 guidance. Corporate and other expense is still expected to be around $120 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2023 is still expected to be about $130 million, and we\u2019re still assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 115.6 million shares. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Blake? Blake Moret : Thanks, Nick. As we continue to stay close to end users, machine builders and distributors, a few key themes emerge. First, demand remains strong. We\u2019ve mentioned softness in e-commerce and in parts of the Chinese economy, but investment by end users and machinery builders continues across the majority of regions and serve verticals. Second, the global supply chain is improving, but it will take some months to flush the inefficiencies that have built up over the last few years, especially inventory. This is seen at machine builders, distributors and in our own operations. Third, the opportunities for automation to play a strategic role in our customer success have never been higher. Workforce scarcity, American shoring of manufacturing and the premium being placed on business agility are all positive reads for Rockwell. We\u2019re moving fast to meet these needs with new capacity and capabilities. It\u2019s hard to believe, but our Annual Automation Fair and Investor Day are only about three months away, and you should look forward to hearing more about the exciting next leg of our journey. I want to thank all our employees and also our unmatched distributors who have worked so hard to bring us to this point and who collectively make the difference at our customers. Aijana will now begin the Q&A session. Aijana Zellner : We would like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Julianne, let\u2019s take our first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. Blake Moret : Hey, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Blake or Nick, can you give us more color into the order of visibility you have that allowed you to construct Slide 11. If I add all the timing, it looks like you expect a relatively significant orders inflection higher, maybe even in the first half of 2024. And it also looks like you think orders could reach the peak levels again, that you saw in 2022. Is that what you\u2019re attempting to say? And then what markets would you most likely see an uptick in bookings? Blake Moret : Yes. Andy, there\u2019s a few factors that contribute to that outlook for orders. First are the continued high investment levels and some important verticals for us. We see continued investments as we track new CapEx announcements in areas like semiconductor, in EV, in renewables, while we see a general focus on automation at many of our other verticals like food and beverage, life sciences, energy and so on. We also have had a number of conversations with customers and distributors that give us a consistent view that demand remains strong. As I and members of my team have talked directly to machine builders and end users, they\u2019re all proceeding with plans based on the consistent demand for their products. We described in my remarks what we\u2019re seeing in terms of machine builders who are not placing the unusually large advanced orders that they did of say a year ago. And we\u2019ve also had direct conversations with our distributors and in North America, some of our largest distributors are actually seeing year-over-year order increases. So again, that consistently strong demand picture informs that view that we showed you on Slide 11 of orders recovering, complimenting the remaining strong backlog. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks for that Blake. And then Nick, can you quantify how much impact the change in U.S. distribution you made had on sales and earnings in Q3? And then specifically could you go over how to think about margin moving forward for your segments? It looks like you talked about the change impacting intelligent devices, but moving forward should we be thinking 20% to 21% for that segment, which was your prior guide? And then conversely, software margin continues to go up, can you sustain mid-30% margins in that segment? Nick Gangestad : Yes. As far as the sales impact, we had originally planned when we guided what we expected for growth expectations between Q3 and Q4, we had expected some disruption. We were planning close to a week of disruption that this would be causing in the loss of capacity during our third quarter. That ended up extending by several more days in terms of the total impact it had on us. All in something in the range of $50 million to $100 million of revenue is I think a good ballpark to think about of what we\u2019re seeing of a shift of revenue there between the third and fourth quarter from what we were anticipating three months ago. And then in terms of margin progression, Andy, for the rest of this year, we continue to expect that margins will expand. We think fourth quarter margins will be our highest margin for the year. We continue to expect to see strong margins in our Software and Control business, something similar to what we\u2019ve been seeing the last couple quarters. And as I\u2019ve said for the last couple quarters, we expect sequential margin improvement in lifecycle services. We expect that will be over 10% in Q4. And then intelligent devices as we recapture some of that revenue that shifted from Q3 to Q4, we think added revenue there will be bringing that margin up from where we were in the third quarter. All in, we still expect ITV smart intelligent devices margin to be a little under 20% for the full year, software and control to be well over 30% and lifecycle services will be below 10% for the full year. And it\u2019ll be similar to a little less than what it was in fiscal 2022. But all in progressing nicely with the focus we\u2019re having on productivity there. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks, Nick. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning all. Blake Moret : Hey Josh. Nick Gangestad : Hey Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Blake, so just on the order normalization and customers, including some of the OEMs adapting to shorter lead times. I sort of get that that\u2019s kind of a \u2013 maybe a bit of a one-time accordion squeeze as those folks don\u2019t need to go out the same length of time or even pull that in. Any sense of sizing what that is? What that impact might be on that implied second half order outlook? Just trying to distinguish between the supply chain and sort of the back end of that phenomenon versus maybe what run rate orders might be? Blake Moret : Yes. I mean giving a little bit more color on how this plays out, during the most constrained period of component shortages, we saw some OEMs that were placing orders for a year or more of their equipment demand, where in normal times when lead times were at, let\u2019s say normal for the products that they put in their equipment, that might be only three or four months of demand. Now, that\u2019s not across the board, but we did see cases of those larger orders. As the lead times have recovered actually a little bit faster than we expected over the last quarter or so and as we expect them to continue to improve, then we see OEMs no longer needing to place such long orders. And as they focus, as I said, on flushing some of the inventory and WIP that they have in their operations, importantly, their front log remains strong. And as I visited machine builders and my staff has visited machine builders over the last couple of months that\u2019s a consistent message that their demand remains strong. It\u2019s just they don\u2019t need to place such a large block of orders. Now, I want to put this in perspective. OEMs are in the neighborhood of a third of our business. So we don\u2019t see the same patterns or need for those large orders at users, but that is an effect that\u2019s impacted our machine builders. And in a little bit of a similar timeframe with our distributors, their inventories will relieve as they get those last constrained items over the next couple of months and are able to shift their committed inventory that\u2019s inventory that\u2019s already been committed to specific end user projects. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe for a follow-up, just want to take a step back. I mean, there\u2019s a lot of \u2013 there are a lot of elements of the business now where you can sort of see this before and after in terms of investment. We talk a lot about nearshoring, energy transition, you see process orders looking strong on that. But I can\u2019t help notice that 30% of the business is food and bev and consumer packaged goods, where I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s quite as obvious that we\u2019re seeing nearshoring or some fundamental breakout. I know you called out a bigger food and bev win. But maybe just talk about how that piece of the business has seen a secular shift or perhaps hasn\u2019t? If you want to put backlog in context or anything else that would be helpful. Blake Moret : Sure. So you\u2019re right. I mean that as part of our Hybrid Industry segment is the single largest segment of our end market demand. And what we\u2019re seeing in food and beverage and home and personal care is an increased focus on efficiency and resilience. So even though we don\u2019t see the same amount of greenfield investment that we do say with electric vehicles or batteries, those big food and beverage companies are investing in their resilience. So they\u2019re adding some measure of redundancy. They\u2019re investing heavily in OT cybersecurity, which is one of our very fastest growing businesses and meaningful multimillion dollar orders. They\u2019re also dealing with workforce shortages. So we\u2019re all aware that unemployment remains very low. And I think in general, that's a positive read for us, but it creates continuing problems with these manufacturers in staffing those lines. And so they're looking for augmenting the technology that we're providing with highly trained workers as those workers are more scarce. And we're seeing our offering result in some important competitive wins. We've added more ways to win. So it's not just our core technology, it's our cybersecurity services, and we talked about several wins with Plex as the synergy wins ramp up there as we turn on that market access machine. So those are some of the things that are driving the good food and beverage and home and personal care growth that we're seeing this year. Josh Pokrzywinski : Understood, appreciate it. Best of luck. Blake Moret : Yes, thanks Josh. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much. Maybe not taking a step back. If we look at Slide 11, you've got the order trends line chart there. Trying to think about backlog-to-sales coverage and where you think that normalizes. As you said, pre-COVID you were 20% odd backlog to sales. Recently, you've been well over 50%, but that will come down. And I just wondered your sort of best views on where it settles out. Because I guess, if we look at some of your peers like FANUC, they've all seen this huge orders slump as well, and they're talking about customer inventory depletion through next year. And I guess, one could also make the case perhaps that more localized supply chains can mean shorter lead times and order patterns, not longer ones. So just wondered sort of your perspectives on that and testing that conviction around why the orders improve from early calendar 2024? Blake Moret : Sure. I'll make a few comments, Julian, and then Nick may have some additional detail. As you think about the composition of our business, for a starting point, we said the backlog that we expect to finish the fiscal year in a couple of months with is remaining high between $4.5 billion and $5 billion, and 80% of that is shippable in fiscal year 2024. I think your question is, okay, how does that develop? And what is beyond that? Think about the product backlog as lead times return to normal for products at the end of this calendar year is getting back to its normal low levels of backlog. We traditionally looked at products as having lead times of days or weeks that either ships directly off our distributor shelves or we build it very quickly in our factories. And I think that gets back in fiscal year 2024. There's a portion of that product business within Intelligent Devices that is configured to order. And that continues to have lead times that are measured typically in weeks, sometimes in a couple of months. That business has been really strong for us here recently. We think we're gaining considerable share there. And so that's going to be a somewhat meaningful component of backlog even after 2024 within the Intelligent Devices area. And then as Lifecycle Services becomes bigger, continues to grow, then we typically have seen somewhere in the neighborhood of half a year of backlog for Lifecycle Services. So backlog becomes smaller as we leave fiscal year 2024, but it remains considerably larger than the $1.5 billion or so that you remember from pre-pandemic. Because we're a bigger company and we have some of these new components, I would also say there's software and recurring revenue that continues to grow nicely. We talked about ARR growing 17% this quarter. And so that's a part of the equation as well. Nick? Nick Gangestad : Yes. And Julian, to frame it up a little in the way you asked the question where pre-pandemic backlog closer to 20% of our revenue and more recently this year where we're around 50% or higher than 50%. I don't \u2013 based on the things Blake was just describing, I don't think it will go back down to 20%. But something in the 30% or low 30s percent. I think that's a reasonable estimation right now for us, Julian, of where to think where our backlog is in a more normal state. Julian Mitchell : That's very helpful. Thanks. And I appreciate it's very difficult to call. Thank you for the thoughts. Maybe on the areas or markets where you're seeing or expecting the most severe orders normalization, do we assume it's mostly discrete markets globally? I think China, there's obviously some orders pressure that your peers have talked about, but is it sort of a global phenomenon across various discrete markets? Is that the way to think about it? Blake Moret : Yes. I think it's the phenomenon that we described with machine builders, which is not exclusively in discrete. We have a good business with skilled OEMs, process machine builders as well, but they're buying product. It's less weighted towards engineered solutions. So I think that's where you've seen that phenomenon as they were placing orders for a year or sometimes more of their machine coverage, and they don't need to do that anymore. And so they're looking at opportunities to improve their cash flow, get the existing equipment out as the constrained products from us deliver and then to fill their forward machine needs with smaller orders because they can depend more on the lead times. Julian Mitchell : Great, thank you. Blake Moret : Yes, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning. Hello, everyone. Blake Moret : Hi, Jeff. Nick Gangestad : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Good morning. Sorry if I missed it. I was on a few minutes late, but a lot of talk about future backlog. But could you just square us up on where the backlog actually ended in the quarter, and also kind of what the price volume complexion was in the actual quarter? Nick Gangestad : Jeff, I'll take the second part of your question first. Of our 13% organic growth, 10% of that was volume and 3% of that was price. And it was very much like as we expected. This was the quarter where we are starting to lap ourselves against the more significant price increases that we were realizing in the second half of our fiscal year 2022. In terms of the backlog, we haven't put out a specific number on it, Jeff. It did come down some in Q3, and we expect it to come down further in Q4 to that $4.5 billion to $5 billion range. But we haven't put a specific number on that, partly weaning ourselves off of like frequent updates on all of that, but giving you a trend of where that's going. Jeff Sprague : Okay. Great. Yes, it's just helpful to have the anchor if we're going to talk about the future, right. So we can all relate to that in future conversations, but I get it. And then just on investment spending, is there actually a change in the year outlook on how you'll \u2013 the level of investment spending or just a timing between quarters? Nick Gangestad : Jeff, investment spend is staying almost exactly where we've been expecting, both for the year and by quarter actually. It's very, very much following our plan. Jeff Sprague : Okay, great. I'll leave it there. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it. Blake Moret : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andrew Obin : Hi, guys, good morning. Can you hear me? Blake Moret : Yes, Andrew. Nick Gangestad : Hey, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Hey, just as you think about it seems that you are about to embark on a multi-year growth spurt. How should we think \u2013 how do you guys think about your cash conversion just structurally going forward? Do you just need to accept permanently lower cash conversion? We just need to invest in working capital and growth, and if not, what levers can you pull to sort of get it back to this 95% level that we've had? Nick Gangestad : Yes. Andrew, thanks for that question. The \u2013 our longer-term plan and expectation is that we should be at 100% free cash flow conversion or averaging that, that over time, even in a period where we are growing more substantially than we have, I\u2019ll say pre-pandemic. And with where we stand now with our working capital, where we\u2019re estimating it to exit fiscal year 2023, we think that creates some tailwinds for us in cash conversion in the next couple years for us that even in a higher growth world, we can still be generating something from an operational standpoint closer to the 100% free cash flow conversion. There are a couple headwinds, I\u2019ll just want to make sure you\u2019re aware of Andrew. One is we are at the point now where we are making more substantial cash tax payments on the transition tax that was part of TCJA. Some companies adjust that out of their free cash flow conversion. We don\u2019t \u2013 we keep that in there. And we\u2019re also being impacted by the recent requirement that we capitalize for tax purposes, our R&D expense, and that that\u2019s having a several percentage point between 5 and 10 percentage point impact to our free cash flow conversion in the next few years. It\u2019s something after five years or six years we work our way through, that just becomes part of the base, but it is having that between 5% and 10% impact to free cash flow conversion. And then the last I\u2019ll note is as we\u2019ve been liquidating our PTC shares, realizing the gain, the nuances of how free cash flow reporting is that gain is not part of our denominator in that equation, but the cash taxes is part of that \u2013 of the numerator in that equation, and it\u2019s just a nuance in pointing out that has impacted us this year and could impact us in coming quarters as well. But I\u2019ll call those more noise versus your underlying question, I think on our \u2013 the ability of our business model to be generating 100% free cash flow conversion. Andrew Obin : Great. And then just on your ARR I think 17% very healthy. Could you give us a look sort of under the hood what the components are, which portions of your business is doing better? Maybe talk about MES, talk about Fiix, Plex, whatever it is you guys want to talk about, but just give us a sense of what\u2019s driving the software growth. Thank you. Blake Moret : Sure. So I mentioned a few wins with Plex in the quarter. And Plex has continued to be a good performer for us both in terms of the expansion of existing customers, as well as new logos where Rockwell\u2019s market access gave us opportunities there. So Plex was a strong performer in the quarter. Fiix as well with the asset management. These are two SaaS applications that are doing quite well for us, and contributed substantially to that 17% ARR I mentioned some wins with PTC. Those are subscription wins. And those were some major competitive victories for us in the quarter. And then on the high value services side, cybersecurity services, and I\u2019ve talked about that that\u2019s been right at the top of our fast growing businesses and we have a recurring revenue component of cyber. So those things were probably at the top of the list and contributing to what you\u2019re right, was really good ARR in the quarter. Andrew Obin : Thanks so much. Blake Moret : Yes. Thanks, Andrew. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Hi, good morning. Blake Moret : Hey, Steve. Steve Tusa : Hey, can we just start \u2013 can you just remind us, I mean, you guys were relatively \u2013 we never really had this orders discussion before COVID, what, like, your book-to-bill was generally like around one back then, right? Is that about right? Nick Gangestad : Yes, Steve, that, that is correct. The only exception is our lifecycle services business component that could have some nuances from quarter-to-quarter, but generally we were pretty much a one-to-one book-to-bill. Steve Tusa : Right. So like eating in the backlog this quarter, you mentioned, so obviously your orders were like what were they like a little bit above two or something like that? Blake Moret : Yes. We haven\u2019t given the specific order value for Q3, but we gave the full year expectation of $8.5 billion to $9 billion of orders. Steve Tusa : Okay. And when we look at this kind of like daily order volume, I mean, like that, that would kind of equate to the quarterly order numbers I would think, because that\u2019s not like scaled or adjusted for seasonality or anything like that, right? Nick Gangestad : That that is correct. We\u2019re not adjusting for any seasonality here. Steve Tusa : Yes. Okay. That, that, that\u2019s fair. And then just the last question, just philosophically, you guys went from like not really giving orders to maybe not even \u2013 not disclosing them this year at one point, I think you guys were thinking about that. Now you\u2019re disclosing them and now you\u2019re kind of like forecasting them. I guess, are we going to continue to get this level of color as we go through the next couple of quarters? Like maybe like just philosophically any view on like maybe normalizing some of this disclosure billion it just seems like there\u2019s more provided, but it\u2019s in different forms and it just seems like it\u2019s not particularly as straightforward as maybe it could be. Blake Moret : So Steve, we\u2019re continuing to provide the information that we think is most important to investors and over the last few years, as you said, orders have become a more important component as they have decoupled from shipments at different times. And so we felt it was important to provide that additional information. As we look at going forward, we\u2019re going to continue to look at where orders remain material to investor decisions and to provide that kind of information. And we continue to look at how we\u2019re making decisions about running the business going forward and providing you some insight into that. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s going to take some different forms as time goes on, because the value of it and the horizon of that I think are important. So this quarter we made the decision to give a little bit of a view going forward and showing on that Slide 11, the relationship between orders and big macro events going forward so that you and investors can put that into perspective. Steve Tusa : Yes. And it is helpful. So we thank you for all the extra disclosure here regardless. So thanks Aijana for that. Really appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Noah Kaye : Thanks for taking the question. I just want to go to lifecycle services, several quarters continuing of positive book-to-bill. You commented on margins for this year. How do we think about incremental margins going forward, especially as you start to get this sort of richer mix, right? I know a lot of revenue associated with what comes out of this ends up in SMC but just help us think about incremental margins going forward. Nick Gangestad : Yes. As I think about where we\u2019re going with margins in our lifecycle services business in the next couple years, we expect that lifecycle services will be an outsize contributor to our margin expansion in the coming years. So we \u2013 one way we think about our margin expansion is through our core conversion of the 30% to 35% range. That would imply that lifecycle services is going to be helpful to that number. So if as I look over the next couple of years, I believe lifecycle services will be our highest margin expansion business segment of the three segments. Blake Moret : Yes. And I would say that, the Sensia contribution, which is in lifecycle, we have seen improvement there and we expect to see continued improvement. So that\u2019s a major component. Noah Kaye : Thanks. And maybe just want to step back and ask a broader question about the demand environment. In past quarters, you and the industry and trade press and all sorts of folks have talked about the long runway here from IRA, IIJA shoring all these trends. And when you look at a quarter like this and see, some of the order dynamics and understand a lot of that\u2019s just supply chain normalizing. I guess, when we step back, where do you think we kind of are in this wave of manufacturing investment and specifically in the United States? Blake Moret : Yes. I think \u2013 I like looking at a vertical by vertical approach of this, because it breaks it down into, I\u2019d say, more objective components EV and battery by any objective measure, there is continued strong investment as people are building out the capacity to build more electric vehicles. If you look at any city in the U.S., the number of electric vehicles remains low, all projections of that\u2019s going to increase. And there\u2019s nowhere near as much capacity needed to serve that demand, even with the announcements of new greenfields that have already been made. So we see that as a multi-year trend, semiconductor for national security reasons and to be able to reduce geopolitical risk impacting the semiconductors that make our world go. We see that as a multi-year trend. And importantly, it\u2019s not just the fabs, it\u2019s all the supporting infrastructure that\u2019s needed to make that stick as well. We talk about redundancy and resiliency in some of the other industries, food and beverage, life sciences with offerings not just the core automation, but the additional software and the services. I think these are multi-year trends. Workforce, again, with unemployment as low as it is, it\u2019s just not possible to build the things that we need to preserve a standard of living without the technology augmenting a highly engaged workforce. Those two things are going to be required across a broad swath of the industries that we serve. So I think the outlook for automation remains good over a multi-year period. We\u2019re seeing the current impact of some of the ordering dynamics that we\u2019ve talked a lot about on this call, but the fundamental outlook for automation and Rockwell\u2019s ability to outperform, I think is very strong. Aijana Zellner : Julianne, we\u2019ll take one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our last question will come from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Aijana, thanks for fit me in here. Hi guys. Good morning. So yes, we\u2019ve covered a lot of ground here. But just North America was 1% organic, so even if we factor in the $50 million to $100 million impact from the DC, it still seemed quite weak. And I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some inventory headwinds there, but are we seeing any push out in projects, some of the larger projects in North America? Blake Moret : The main contributor to the growth in North America is really the composition of the backlog. And in fact, as we look at the orders in North America, they found pace the rest of the world year-to-date in fiscal year 2023. There are certainly anecdotes of projects that have been pushed, but we have not seen that as a prevalent trend and we continue to see low cancellation rates among within our backlog. Nigel Coe : Okay. That\u2019s very clear. And then Nick, your comments on sort of what a normal backlog is, and obviously higher than what it\u2019s been in the past, but seems to suggest that we should be expecting backlog to maybe burn down towards maybe close to $3 billion. Is that fair? Nick Gangestad : Yes. It\u2019s dependent on what revenue is, but for those reasons that that Blake went through in our mix, we just don\u2019t see it getting back to that 20% that it used to be, but something in the 30% to 35% range and yes, multiply that by our revenue, and that\u2019s our best estimate now. I think in the coming quarters, we\u2019ll keep learning more about that, but we ask for our best estimate right now. That\u2019s where we are. Nigel Coe : Okay. Thanks guys. Cheers. Nick Gangestad : Thank you. Aijana Zellner : Thank you everyone for joining us today. That concludes today\u2019s conference call. Operator : At this time, you may disconnect. Thank you.",

I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. Later on the call, we will open up the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Aijana Zellner, Head of Investor Relations and Market Strategy. Ms. Zellner, please go ahead. Aijana Zellner : Thank you, Abby. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2023 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our Web site. Both the press release and charts include and our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available on our Web site for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our Web site at the conclusion of today's call. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings. So with that, I'll hand it over to Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to our fourth quarter results on Slide 3. We delivered strong double digit growth this quarter, with both sales and adjusted earnings growing by over 20% year-over-year. Our solid execution and improving supply chain helped us exceed our Q4 expectations, resulting in double digit sales growth across all regions and business segments.  With lead times significantly improving across our product lines, we were able to deliver products to customers faster than expected this quarter, contributing to over $2.5 billion in total sales. This record shipment reflects Rockwell's continued capacity investments, and demonstrates our organization's ability to scale for sustained growth. Total sales were up 20.5% versus prior year. Organic sales grew almost 18% year-over-year. Currency translation and acquisitions each contributed about a 1.5 of growth in the quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the split of our sales by business segment, region and industry was largely driven by the composition of our backlog.  In our intelligent devices business segment, organic sales increased 18% versus prior year with strong growth across all regions. Within this segment, Independent Cart Technology had another strong quarter, finishing this fiscal year with over 50% growth in sales. This offering continues to be an integral part of our advanced material handling and production logistics offering.  We are excited about our latest addition to this differentiated portfolio with our acquisition of Clearpath Robotics, and I will cover some strategic highlights of this deal later on the call. Software and control organic sales grew 23% year-over-year.  We continue to innovate in both the software and hardware portions of our architecture, with significant new offerings such as high availability, process IO, FactoryTalk optics, and FactoryTalk data mosaics. We are pleased with how our organic and inorganic investments in this business are delivering new customer value and continued share gains.  Lifecycle Services organic sales were up over 10% year-over-year. Book to bill in this segment was 0.97 and above the historical average for Q4. Within this segment, our Sensia joint venture had a strong finish to the year with over 50% year-over-year order growth in the quarter. This growth was driven by strategic wins in process automation and artificial lift control systems, positioning this business for continued double digit growth and improved profitability in fiscal year '24. Information Solutions and Connected Services sales grew 10% versus prior year. One of the largest Information Solutions wins ever was with Prometeon Tyre, a global leader in tyre manufacturing headquartered in Italy. This customer was already using our cloud native Plex quality management system, and has recently selected our on-prem MES software to digitize the manufacturing processes at a number of their global sites. This win not only demonstrates the standalone differentiation of our modular offerings, but also highlights the value from the integration of our entire portfolio, making it easier for customers to standardize their global operations.  Within Connected Services, we continue to grow our cybersecurity practice with Q4 sales growing 30% year-over-year. Our industrial cybersecurity software and expertise along with differentiated partnerships on the IT security front are helping us grow our cybersecurity services into a business of well over $100 million this fiscal year, with a significant portion of this being recurring revenue. Total annual recurring revenue grew 16% year-over-year. That's a good number, and ARR is a meaningful contributor to our future growth framework.  Segment margin of 22.3% was in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS of $3.64, which is a company record for quarterly earnings, grew almost 20% year-over-year. Significantly improving lead times in our Q4 shipment over performance contributed to rapid backlog production in the quarter. We are ending the year with over $4.1 billion in backlog, over 40% coverage of annual sales, which is still well above pre-pandemic levels. A return to superior customer service remains our highest priority.  Let's now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q4 end market performance. Our discrete sales grew over 15% versus prior year. Within discrete, automotive sales were up 30% year-over-year, reflecting continued strength of our offerings in both electric vehicle and battery. Our EV business was close to 40% of our total automotive revenue in the quarter, growing double digits both year-over-year and sequentially.  One of our strategic battery wins was with Nanotech Energy, a startup with new and innovative energy storage technologies. Nanotech has chosen Rockwell as their exclusive automation partner to build new battery Gigafactories. Semiconductor sales grew high single digits. We continue to take share in facilities management control system applications and major semiconductor companies across the globe.  In addition to our existing portfolio, we continue to win and build down a strong funnel of advanced wafer transport solutions, leveraging our Independent Cart Technology across customers' greenfield and brownfield projects. We're also participating in the rapid build down of data centers to support cloud computing and artificial intelligence.  Our control systems are used to control and optimize the environment and safety systems in these facilities. And our recent CUBIC acquisition extends our reach into the power distribution portion of data centers. We've seeing some strategic wins in Asia and in the U.S. in the quarter with more to come.  In our e-commerce and warehouse automation vertical, sales declined mid-single digits versus prior year. After several quarters of customer delays and cancellations in the e-commerce portion of this vertical, we're starting to see new investments, especially in North America, positioning us for low single digit year-over-year growth in fiscal year '24.  Turning to our hybrid industries, strong sales in this segment were paced by good growth in food and beverage, our largest customer vertical. Food and beverage sales grew low double digits versus prior year. In addition to continued cybersecurity and infrastructure modernization wins in this vertical, we had several wins in Q4 incorporating generative AI functionality, where our digital services business is helping our CPG customers use real-time AI assistance as they develop new products, formulations and recipes.  Life Sciences sales grew mid single digits in the quarter. This vertical is a great example of how we are delivering expanded customer value through a combination of software, hardware and digital services capabilities. This quarter, our PlantPAx system was selected by [indiscernible], a global biotechnology company developing innovative and affordable cancer medicines for their process control and environmental monitoring solutions at a greenfield site in New Jersey. Tire was up high teens in the quarter with multiple wins across the globe, including the large software deal at Prometeon Tyre I mentioned earlier on the call. Moving to process. Sales in this industry segment grew over 25% year-over-year, led by strong growth in oil and gas, mining and metals. Oil and gas sales were up over 30% in the quarter. This growth was driven by a combination of digital oilfield solutions, including process safety and lift control in EMEA and Asia, as well as several new carbon capture wins in North America. We continue to grow our process industry footprint with the combination of Sensia and Rockwell oil and gas capabilities.  We had a notable win this quarter at Multitex Filtration Engineers, an India headquartered global EPC company working on onshore and offshore projects. This was a competitive DCS win for Rockwell, with one of the largest government-owned oil and gas explorer and producers in India. And we are excited to partner with Multitex as they increase their footprint in the U.S. and Middle East. Turning now to Slide 5 and our Q4 organic regional sales. Once again our sales by region in Q4 and for the full year fiscal year '23 reflect the composition of our backlog rather than the underlying customer demand. Our full year orders in the Americas outperformed the rest of the world. North America organic sales were up over 12% year-over-year, but Latin America and EMEA sales grew over 20% in the quarter and Asia Pacific was up over 31%. While we saw strong sales growth in China in fiscal year '23, we continue to see high order deferrals and cancellations in China. Let's move to Slide 6, key highlights of fiscal year 2023. We had a record year of sales and earnings with our total sales exceeding $9 billion. We achieved this milestone ahead of the timeframe we anticipated when we introduced our framework for accelerated profitable growth at Investor Day in 2019. Both reported and organic sales grew 17% this year, well above our original expectations.  Information Solutions and Connected Services were up 9% year-over-year, reaching over $870 million, demonstrating our customers' accelerated adoption of new digital offerings. This is almost 3x what this figure was in 2018. Total ARR grew 16% with strong growth in both our software-as-a-service and recurring services offerings. Our strong operating performance resulted in 140 basis points of segment margin expansion versus prior year. Adjusted EPS of $12.12 was up 28%. We generated a record $1.2 billion of free cash flow this year. The much better free cash flow conversion in the quarter was primarily driven by improved working capital. This represents 86% free cash flow conversion for the year, and Nick will provide more detail in his remarks. And last but not least, we continue to invest in key areas of growth. In the last few months, we made two acquisitions, Clearpath and Verve, to further expand our value and accelerate top line growth.  While we'll talk more about those investments at our upcoming Investor Day, let's turn to Slide 7 and take a few minutes to share why we are excited about the impact Clearpath will have on both our near and longer term growth. As we've shared with you earlier in the quarter, Clearpath is a leader in autonomous mobile robots, or AMRs, serving customers across many industry segments.  Their differentiated portfolio of auto brand AMRs is focused on the production logistics space, where customers traditionally have relied on manual labor to move raw materials and subassemblies to the right place on production lines, and also to move finished goods to shipping docks and warehouses. These workflows have been identified by many automotive companies, semiconductor fabs, and consumer packaged goods suppliers as their top opportunity for efficiency and increased safety.  Given the workforce shortage and skills gap, along with the overall move to more autonomous operations, the market for industrial mobile robots in factory floor applications is expected to grow over 30% for the next five years, and we believe no one is better positioned to capitalize on this growth than Rockwell and Clearpath. Together, we are the only end-to-end provider of autonomous operations in this space. We'll bring together our FactoryTalk design capabilities to configure and simulate the production environment, including these AMRs, integrate with our cloud native operations management software, like Plex and Fiix, and optimize the production process with our logics and embedded AI capabilities, all with one technology platform.  This is an important milestone for Rockwell, and you will see more of what this can do for industrial operations at Automation Fair and Investor Day next week. We closed this acquisition in early October and expect it to contribute about a point of growth to our top line performance in fiscal year '24.  As we move to Slide 8, let's review our fiscal 2024 outlook. Consistent with what we shared with you on our last earnings call, our orders continued to decrease in fiscal 2023 reaching what we believe to be a trough in our fourth quarter. Orders for the full year were $8.2 billion. We expect fiscal year '24 orders to increase low single digits year-over-year. Order growth is expected to be highest in the Americas. Asia orders are expected to be down year-over-year due to China. However, a relatively low exposure to China helps to reduce the impact on our global results. The lead times on our products have largely returned to pre-pandemic levels, with the remainder of our SKUs getting back to normal lead times around the end of our fiscal Q1. This addresses the final golden screw constraints to shipping past due backlog and clearing committed inventory at our distributors. Based on our analysis of lead time reduction by product line, distributor inventory and underlying demand at our largest machine builders and end users, we expect orders to begin to recover in Q1 and build in Q2.  Customers continue to move forward with plans for both greenfield and brownfield capacity investments and also with resilience projects requiring increased cybersecurity and digitization. In the U.S., we've been adding commercial resources specifically focused on projects that are incented by recent stimulus authorized by legislation, including infrastructure, IRA and the CHIPS and Science Act. This team won new business during the second half of fiscal year '23 with the strong funnel of additional projects expected to close in fiscal year '24.  Our fiscal '24 guidance assumes total reported sales of about $9.4 billion at the midpoint. Organic sales are projected to grow 1% at the midpoint. Currency is expected to increase sales by 1.5% and acquisitions are slated to contribute about a point of growth. We are projecting ARR to have another year of double digit growth. Segment margin is expected to increase slightly versus prior year. Nick will cover this in more detail later.  Adjusted EPS is slated to grow 5% year-over-year at the midpoint. At a high level, we expect strong conversion on slightly higher year-over-year organic sales. Good performance in reducing backlog during Q4 of fiscal '23 put forward about $100 million of revenue and $0.25 of earnings. Clearpath is expected to reduce fiscal year '24 adjusted earnings by a similar amount.  Let me turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q4 performance and financial outlook for fiscal '24. Nick? Nick Gangestad : Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 9, fourth quarter key financial information. Fourth quarter reported sales were up 20.5% over last year. Q4 organic sales were up 17.7% and acquisitions contributed 140 basis points to growth. Currency translation increased sales by 140 basis points. About 6 points of our organic growth came from price.  Segment operating margin was 22.3% compared to 23.3% a year ago. The year-over-year decrease reflects the impact of higher sales volume and higher price being more than offset by higher incentive compensation, investment spend and restructuring actions. Adjusted EPS of $3.64 was above our expectations, primarily due to higher organic sales, partially offset by higher investment spend and incentive compensation. We also took a restructuring charge in the quarter of just over $20 million, which is expected to yield more than $40 million of benefits on an annualized basis. All-in, adjusted EPS grew 20% versus prior year. I'll cover our year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide.  The adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 17%, slightly below the prior year rate. Free cash flow of $776 million was $417 million higher than prior year. Our strong free cash flow generation in the quarter was driven by higher income and reductions in working capital. As you know, due to supply chain volatility, we have seen working capital balances grow over the last couple of years. And we are pleased to see our action starting to bring working capital down.  One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased approximately 200,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $55 million. On September 30, $900 million remained available under our repurchase authorization.  Slide 10 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. Blake discussed our top line performance in the quarter, so I'll focus on our margin performance. Given our pay-for-performance culture and strong results, all of our business segments saw higher bonus expense this year. In Q4, this represented between 200 and 300 basis points of year-over-year margin headwinds for each of the segments. Intelligent devices margin decreased by 100 basis points year-over-year, and was up 450 basis points sequentially, because of higher volume. Within intelligent devices, we are investing in our next generation portfolio of drives in IO. Software and control margin of 33.5% decreased 100 basis points year-over-year.  Our strong Q4 margin was driven by 25% year-over-year top line growth. This is the segment with the highest share of incremental investment as we continue to invest in next generation logics performance and our cloud native software portfolio. Lifecycle Services margin was 8.4% and was under the 10% exit rate we anticipated. In addition to a higher bonus, this segment was the most impacted by the restructuring charges taken in the quarter. Absent those two items, the margin for this segment came in as we planned.  Before moving to the adjusted EPS walk, I'd like to talk about our Sensia joint venture. Challenged by the pandemic and global supply chain constraints, this joint venture underperformed our initial expectations for 2020 through 2023. Our updated outlook, which includes this lower base, resulted in a partial goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter.  Sensia's one-time items and supply chain-related inefficiencies in recent quarters are largely behind us. Sensia delivered double digit top line growth in fiscal '23 and has strong orders growth, as Blake mentioned. Going forward, we expect profitable double digit growth from Sensia.  The next slide, 11, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q4 fiscal '22 to Q4 fiscal '23. Core performance was up $1.05 on a 17.7% organic sales increase. Incentive compensation was a $0.45 headwind. This year-over-year increase reflects the higher bonus payout this year versus a below target payout last year.  The year-over-year impact from currency was a $0.05 headwind offset by a $0.10 tailwind from interest expense. Share count and tax rate were each immaterial to the year-over-year change in EPS this quarter. Slide 12 provides key financial information for the full fiscal year 2023. Reported sales grew 17% to $9.1 billion, including over one point coming from acquisitions. Currency negatively impacted sales by approximately $100 million or 1.4 points. Organic sales were up 17%.  Full year segment margin of 21.3% increased 140 basis points over last year. The increase was due to higher sales, partially offset by higher investment spend and higher incentive compensation. We accelerated growth investments for fiscal '23 above our original expectations as our revenue outperformed. Adjusted EPS was up 28%. A detailed year-over-year adjusted EPS walk can be found in the appendix for your reference.  As discussed earlier, free cash flow conversion was ahead of our expectations with free cash flow conversion of 86% in fiscal '23. Free cash flow increased $532 million since fiscal '22. The increase in free cash flow was driven by higher pre-tax income. Working Capital peaked in Q3 at 24% of sales and came down to 20% in Q4.  Return on invested capital was 20.9% for fiscal '23 and 570 basis points better than the prior year, primarily driven by higher net income. For the year, we deployed about $850 million of capital towards dividends and share repurchases and made inorganic investments of $170 million. We also paid down debt by about $870 million. Our capital structure and liquidity remains strong. This strength is what allowed us to fund our acquisitions in the first quarter of fiscal year '24 without any new long-term debt.  Before we turn to our fiscal '24 guidance, we want to update you on Q4 orders and our current thinking as we look forward. In Q4, orders decreased quicker than we expected as machine builders and distributors continued to work through inventory in response to our rapidly improving lead times. As Blake said, we believe Q4 was the trough and orders in October support that view. We expect fiscal year '24 orders to grow low single digits with an order profile similar to what we discussed in Q3. Let's now move on to the next slide, 13, guidance for fiscal '24. In fiscal year '24, we are focusing on growing earnings, even in a year of low top line growth. At the same time, we'll continue to invest in our own resilience, in our most important innovation projects to extend our differentiation and in customer-facing resources to capitalize on continuing strong secular demand for automation. We expect our reported sales growth to range from 0.5% to 6.5%. We expect organic sales growth in the range of negative 2% to positive 4%. We expect acquisitions to add 100 basis points to growth, in addition to a full year currency tailwind of 150 basis points. From a segment perspective, given our exceptionally strong backlog execution in software and control that resulted in 25% top line growth in fiscal year '23, we expect this segment to see the lowest growth in fiscal year '24. We expect positive organic sales growth in both our Intelligent Devices and Lifecycle Services segments. We expect price will be a positive contributor to growth for the year. Segment margin will be around 21.5%, up slightly from fiscal year '23. This includes a 60 basis point headwind coming from the acquisitions of Clearpath and Verve. Verve's impact to adjusted EPS is relatively flat in fiscal year '24.  Clearpath will reduce earnings per share in fiscal year '24 by $0.25 on an unlevered basis. This impact reflects continued R&D and commercialization investments as well as integration expenses. We expect the Clearpath acquisition to become accretive to earnings in fiscal year '26. We expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17%. Our adjusted EPS guidance range is $12.00 to $13.50.  We expect full year fiscal '24 free cash flow conversion of about 100% of adjusted income. This reflects our expectation that inventory days on hand will drop to 125 days by the end of fiscal year '24 compared to approximately 140 days of inventory we had at the end of fiscal year '23. Our outlook for cash tax payments is higher due to a tax payment for realized capital gains on the sale of our stake in PTC and higher tax payments required under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We expect free cash flow conversion in the first half to be well below 100%, mostly tied to the timing of our incentive compensation payout and income tax payments.  From a calendarization perspective, we expect year-over-year organic sales to grow in the low single digits in Q1, followed by sequential growth in sales volume as we progress through the year. As a result of our strong Q4 backlog performance, volumes will be down from Q4 to Q1. Given this dynamic, Q1 is projected to be our lowest margin quarter with sequential improvement throughout the year.  For the full year, let's turn to Slide 14 for our adjusted EPS walk. Our core is expected to have a modest positive impact on earnings of about $0.05 from fiscal year '23 to fiscal year '24. Structural productivity from our Q4 actions is expected to increase earnings by $0.25, while increased growth investments will reduce earnings by $0.55.  Incentive compensation for fiscal year '23 was above target due to strong performance. So this represents a tailwind of $0.85 for fiscal '24. Acquisitions will be dilutive by $0.25. Our 150 basis points of sales growth from currency will add $0.25, and the net of interest tax and shares will contribute about $0.05.  A few additional comments on fiscal '24 guidance. Corporate and other expense is expected to be around $120 million. Net interest expense for fiscal '24 is expected to be about $115 million. We're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 115.3 million shares. We expect to deploy between $300 million and $500 million to share repurchases during the year.  With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Blake Moret : Thanks, Nick. As I reflect on 2023, it's clear our continued investments in talent and technology are paying off. I'm proud of how our tight knit organization has navigated through a dynamic environment and helped us deliver a record year of sales and earnings exceeding expectations. Looking at the year ahead of us, we are aware of the macroeconomic backdrop and the geopolitical situation that continues to change every day. You heard us talk today about focusing and optimizing our workforce productivity so that we can continue investing in key areas of growth.  Our customers rely on our continued innovation and differentiation to provide energy and critical infrastructure security across the globe to help bring new life saving drugs to market and to use leading technology to augment and enable their workforce. We look forward to seeing a lot of you at our Investor Day in Boston next week, where we will be sharing our long-term business strategy and some of the most exciting developments across our key markets and applications.  Aijana will now begin the Q&A session. Aijana Zellner : We would like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow up. Abby, let's take our first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Hi. Good morning, guys, and Aijana. Blake Moret : Good morning, Scott. Nick Gangestad : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : A lot here, and I'm glad you're doing the Investor Day, because I think there's a lot to dig in here. But until we get there, can you give us a little bit more color on the China comments just around delays and cancellations? It's not a shock, given what we're reading, but maybe a little bit more granularity on what you're seeing there? Blake Moret : Sure. So just for context, China's about 6% of our worldwide sales, so big manufacturing economy but relatively low exposure for Rockwell there. And we saw very strong sales in China for the year. But in China, the orders were lower. And that is the source of the cancellations that we did see. While our worldwide cancellations are roughly in line with what we've been seeing, China is the highest component of that. And I would say it's broad based. It's not one particular industry. We still see wins and investments in areas like EV, but the distributors that most of our products go to market through in China still have relatively high inventories and they're working that off. Scott Davis : Okay, that's helpful. And you mentioned that the goodwill impairment on Sensia, but it looks like the next few years, the outlook there is pretty darn good. How do you kind of pair that up? And I would imagine you don't take it too lightly when you take a goodwill impairment. So I'll just stop there. Blake Moret : Sure, Scott. So we launched the entity with at the time Schlumberger a few months before the pandemic, so that was in 2019. And the lower base that resulted from COVID shutdowns and the subsequent supply chain shortages along with a refinement of some of the original mix assumptions caused us to take the impairment. We've changed out the management team at Sensia. And we've seen the last couple of quarters of encouraging improvement. We have great orders, good backlog, and improving profitability. And so we expect over the next few years that Sensia will actually be quite a large contributor to the improved profitability in Lifecycle Services. Scott Davis : Yes, I would assume that too. Okay, I'll pass it on. Thank you. I appreciate it. Good luck. I'll see you next week. Blake Moret : Thanks, Scott. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. Blake Moret : Hi, Andy. Nick Gangestad : Hi, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Blake, just focusing on your guidance of low single digit order growth in FY '24 on your confidence of a trough in orders in Q4 '23, could you give us more color in terms of what gives you that confidence? You mentioned orders in October are supporting your view. Maybe you could elaborate on what you're seeing. And then obviously, there have been many conversations regarding mega projects and where we are in that cycle. Do you see your orders being more lumpy centered around mega projects in FY '24 and what are the verticals that they're most likely to come from? Blake Moret : Sure. Thanks, Andy. So first of all, in terms of the orders development, we saw orders ramp up throughout Q4. And then we saw October orders up sequentially from that, and supportive of our view that Q4 was the trough. We expect orders to continue recovering throughout Q1 and building in Q2. So that's the view in terms of the orders development. And that's based on what we're seeing what I just described, as well as direct discussions with our end users and machine builders that have the largest contribution to our business. So we went and did a detailed analysis of their CapEx expectations, their OpEx expectations, what projects that we have the opportunities with. And that coupled with our own personal views and with our distributor feedback are all supportive of this shape of the order recovery curve. In terms of the mega projects, I don't know that that's going to contribute so much to the lumpiness. I think it's going to be a positive, additional amount of business that builds throughout fiscal year '24 and beyond. The majority of the projects that we're tracking, and we're tracking literally hundreds of projects that are incented by some of the recent stimulus, the majority of those projects have not made a decision or have not released the automation equipment. So when you look at those projects, certain equipment, which would probably include switchgear, things like that, would be led earlier in the project cycle with automation to follow after that. So we think that we're still in the early innings with respect to those mega projects. And our tracking processes and our early wins are very encouraging. Andy Kaplowitz : Very helpful, Blake. And Nick maybe just going over your margin expectation a little more for the segments in '24. You already answered Scott's question on Sensia. But what's your confidence level that we do you see a step up in '24 in Lifecycle Services? And then particularly in Intelligent Devices, obviously, that segment has had let's call it some perturbation, some supply chain, do you see more normal environment and improvements in '24 in that segment? Nick Gangestad : Yes. In terms of expectations by segment for fiscal year '24, we do expect that Lifecycle Services will be the most significant year-on-year margin expander. And to answer your question, we are highly competent in that based on the actions that we have taken in '23 and based on the outlook we have for that business in '24. On the opposite side, software and control, we saw outstanding growth in fiscal year '23, as we had strong execution on our backlog. And we expect that business to be the one with the lowest organic growth and then that will translate into lower year-on-year margin in our software and control business, primarily driven by that lower growth. And it happens to also be the segment where we're putting the majority of our incremental investments. From an Intelligent Devices perspective, that's one where we expect the margins year-on-year to be flat to up slightly. And that is with the impact of Clearpath in there. Clearpath is for this segment alone about 100 basis point headwind. And that will be impacting throughout the year. But we'll definitely be seeing that impact in Q1 in Intelligent Devices. And the actions that we've been doing in Intelligent Devices around our productivity and our investments in products, that's what's leading us to expect margins to be flat to up slightly. Andy Kaplowitz : I appreciate the color, guys. Blake Moret : Thanks, Andy. Operator : We will take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, all. Blake Moret : Hi, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Good morning. I just want to come back to kind of orders and backlog. I'm just kind of confused by the comment that orders ramped during Q4, right? The ending backlog is 4.1 billion. You were guiding 4.5 billion to 5 billion. I know you pulled forward 100 million in sales, right? But maybe just bridge us on what happened other than that sales pull forward. How much of it was cancellations versus just kind of regular way order normalization, if there's a way to do that? Blake Moret : Sure. Let me make a couple of comments, Jeff. And then Nick may have some to add as well. So we saw orders increasing. If you look at beginning of the quarter of Q4 to the end, we saw orders exit at a higher rate than at the beginning of Q4, and then with a good uptick from that sequentially in October. So that was the ramp we were talking about, and why we believe that Q4 was the trough for orders. Nick Gangestad : Yes. And, Jeff, just to go a little deeper in that, what we're seeing -- one of the dynamics we're seeing in Q4 and we expect to continue through Q1 as well is our channel partners, our distributors working to right size their inventory as we are seeing -- as they are seeing good reductions in our lead times. They're doing the right actions of bringing their inventory levels down. And that's resulting in lower orders being placed on us. And we expect that to continue through Q1. And we think Q2, as we -- and as we discuss with all of our distributors, Q2 is where that will start to change where the inventory levels at our distributors will be reaching the normal level that they expect. So partly I say that just to say, we don't really see this level of orders we're seeing now as normalized. We're seeing them the correct reaction to the actions they're taking to bring their inventory levels down. Blake Moret : And if I can add to that. So our distributors are seeing a higher level of incoming orders than they in turn are placing on us due to their high inventory levels. So we have, as you would imagine, very good visibility into our distributors' incoming orders from their customers, from their end users and the machine builders. And that order activity is higher than what they're in turn placing on us. So that gives us additional confidence that orders will ramp up as their inventory situation comes down. Jeff Sprague : And then maybe just on the guide. If I heard right, I think you said you're expecting positive organic growth in Q1. Obviously, you have a negative in your guide range. I would have thought if that negative were to happen, it would actually happen in Q1 with this order normalization. So maybe just kind of talk about your thought process of what gets you to the negative organic growth for the year versus being positive in Q1? Blake Moret : Sure. So at the negative end, you would see a slower reduction of inventories at our distributors and a deterioration in the macro. At the upper end of the range, you would see distributors stabilizing their inventory at higher levels than they did before. So getting back to that equilibrium and placing orders that are more reflective of the underlying demand from users and integrators and machine builders. And you would also see at the high end some of the impact from the big projects being spurred by stimulus, specifically in the U.S. I should add as well that on the high end if we talk about total sales, some of the performance in terms of new acquisitions I think there's some opportunity there as well. Nick Gangestad : And, Jeff, to follow up on the one question about why Q1, why we think that will be low single digit growth? Yes. If we were only looking at the orders, your question would -- that would make sense why not negative. However, we also continue to have a 4.1 billion backlog that we're entering the year with. And so what we're seeing in our Q1 revenue is a combination of continued sales of some of that backlog coupled with the lower orders we're expecting in Q1. Blake Moret : Yes. And if I could just add one additional piece. We do expect shipments to ramp sequentially in terms of volume through the year. You get into a little bit of the math of comparables based on having such strong shipments at the tail end of the year that enters into the math of the year-over-year growth as well. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thank you for the color. Blake Moret : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : And we will take our next question from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Andrew Obin : Yes. Good morning. Blake Moret : Good morning. Nick Gangestad : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Maybe just to unpack this minus 2% growth rate limit further, historically, there's been a strong connection between CapEx and your sort of view of the growth rate. I'm sure you'll tell us a lot more about it at the Analyst Day in your new framework. I fully appreciate it. But what kind of macro do we need to see for minus 2% to manifest itself? Does this imply push outs of EV batteries? Could you just describe the macro environment behind the minus 2% [indiscernible] forecast? Thank you. Blake Moret : Yes. I think that would contemplate push outs that turn into cancellations quite frankly, whereas if a project is pushed by a couple of months, it's not going to have a big impact in the year. But if some of those projects or a larger amount of those projects rolled over into deferrals or cancellations, if people said [indiscernible] just kidding about EV, we don't need to build out the semiconductor industry process, which is 35% of our business, if people aren't looking to increase energy, both hydrocarbon and renewable energy forms in the U.S. If we saw a significant reduction of those projects, I think that would contribute to that minus -- that downside part of the range. Andrew Obin : Got you. And just to follow up, ARR of 16%, which is pretty decent for an industrial software company, nice exit rate. So what kind of software growth is embedded? What kind of ARR assumptions are in your '24 forecast? Thank you. Blake Moret : Yes, we're looking at 15% ARR. And we're very proud of that ARR number, because it's broad based. It's not just the newer acquisitions like Plex and Fiix, but it's our traditional offerings as well, some of the on-prem software. And as we go through the year, based on overall Rockwell, we do expect ARR to increase to above 9% of our total sales in the year. It's a combination, both of the software as well as the high value recurring services. We made some organizational changes to supercharge that area. And that along with some of the new developments and offerings that we have, make us very optimistic about the contribution that ARR is going to have to our overall growth. And obviously, we like the resiliency that it gives our results by not starting each year at zero with respect to software sales. Andrew Obin : Thanks so much. Blake Moret : Thanks, Andrew. Operator : We will take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much. Maybe I just wanted to follow up first off on Nick your comments on the first quarter. So is the right assumption sort of low single digit organic growth in Q1, as you said? And then margins for the year are guided flattish for the total company. Are we assuming kind of Q1 is similar to that year-on-year just given the acquisition headwinds and so forth? So you have sort of sales up and little bit margins flat and then earnings up a little bit year-on-year then. Nick Gangestad : Julian, thanks for asking that question. Q1 organic growth year-on-year we think will be low single digits. On the margin question, Q1 of last year, we had a margin of 20%. We expect that to be lower year-on-year in fiscal year '24. And there's three things that are going to be mainly contributing to it being lower. One is our Clearpath acquisition and the impact that will have. The second is mix that we see a less favorable mix in the first quarter of the products that we will be selling. And we think we'll be having lower utilization in our factories as we're adjusting our production to these lower orders. And we think those three things in combination are going to be resulting in lower margin year-on-year. Julian Mitchell : That's very helpful. Thank you. And then I just wanted to come back to the revenue outlook. So one question maybe, we look at North America. I think the guide implies maybe sales are up mid single digits there or something this year. And in '23, North America was the lowest growth region globally. And so we're sort of seven years on from U.S.-China tariffs, two years on from the IIJA. Is it just the pace of these onshore and stimulus projects is so much slower than perhaps people often hope or assume? And just wanted to check that for the year, are you assuming -- it looks like the book to bill will be about 0.9x. Is that correct and what's embedded in the orders and sales color? Thank you. Blake Moret : Let me start with the Americas discussion and then Nick can follow up with a little bit on the book to bill. So the Americas actually outpaced the rest of the world with respect to orders. And we expect that to continue in fiscal year '24. We've talked about for a few quarters now based on shipping from backlog, in some case fairly aged backlog, that our distribution of growth by region and by industry segment is more a factor of the backlog than the current underlying demand. And you're correct that we do expect the highest growth region to be the Americas going forward. With respect to the impact of stimulus, we're still in the early innings there. The business that we're winning there is really just ramping up. We saw some good development in the second half of last year. But by far, there's more business to come based on the projects that we're tracking. Nick Gangestad : And, Julian, the question on the book to bill, yes, your math is right. Approximately 90% book to bill for the full year below that in the first half of the year and above that in the second half of the year. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Blake Moret : Thanks, Julian. Operator : And we will take our next question from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Blake Moret : Hi, Nigel. Nigel Coe : So we got about thousands questions on backlog, so why not have one more? So the 0.9x book to bill for the full year seems to suggest that we're going to be down sort of the low $3 billion for the year -- by the end of '24. I'm wondering, do we go below that level first half once distributors' kind of stop cutting inventories and then rebuild? Just wondering where you see the backlog stabilizing? Nick Gangestad : Yes, we see the backlog stabilizing, I think I said this on the last quarter earnings call as well, that at 30% to 35% of annualized revenue is what we think is the normalized backlog level we will be at given the mix of our businesses that we have. Blake Moret : So that would indicate an exit of the fiscal year at above $3 billion. Nick Gangestad : Correct. Nigel Coe : Okay. And that is consistent with what you've said as well. And then just on sort of the -- and Nick, we're talking about $1.4 billion of orders in the fourth quarter fiscal, if you can just kind of verify that, that'd be helpful. And then on the FY '24 bridge, a couple of things. FX, you're assuming 1.5 points of a tailwind. The math we're getting is probably more like a minus one for the full year. So just wondering where are we wrong there? And then on the Lifecycle Services margin expansion, I think it makes sense if based on history, but just wondering what drove improving margins there in '24? Nick Gangestad : Yes, I'll try to do those in reverse order. In terms of the things drawing down the margin in the fourth quarter, the two main things were our restructuring actions that had an outsized impact on the Lifecycle Services as well as the increased bonus expense that we were facing. Now as we flipped into '24, the bonus expense will be a tailwind to all businesses and Lifecycle Services margin will benefit from that. But also from the actions that we took in 2023, we think those will also be a propellant of Lifecycle Services margin expansion into '24. On the currency side, given our mix of businesses and what we're projecting, many of the currencies were just using what the current spot rate is going forward. In some currencies, such as the euro, what we will use is a group of banks and what they're expecting for a particular currency in the coming year. And so roughly 1.5% year-on-year benefit is coming from our expectations for currencies in fiscal year '24. And then in terms of the orders, we haven't been giving it by quarter. We did say orders were 8.2 billion for the full year. At the midpoint of the year, we had said they were 4.8 billion. And therefore, we're at 3.4 billion in the second half of the year. The third quarter was above that average, the average of 1.7 was above that. Fourth quarter was slightly below that level. So we saw from Q3 to Q4, it goes down further. But we haven't been giving it by quarter what our orders are. Nigel Coe : Okay. Thanks, Nick, helpful. Operator : We will take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Hi. Good morning. Blake Moret : Good morning. Nick Gangestad : Hi, Steve. Steve Tusa : Just on the bridge, can you just maybe -- the incentive comp is a big tailwind, it make sense. It was a headwind this year. Can you just maybe help us with how that breaks out in the first and second quarter here? What type of tailwind you expect there? Nick Gangestad : Yes. First, for the full year, I'll just actually say actual numbers. Our total bonus expense in fiscal year '23 is approximately $240 million. And in our plans for fiscal year '24, it's dropping to $120 million. And that expectation of $120 million, that's spread exactly equally across the four quarters of '24. In '23, that $240 million was -- I can give you the actual numbers of how that broke out, Steve, if that helps. Steve Tusa : Yes. Nick Gangestad : 50 million in Q1, 58 million in Q2, 56 million in Q3 and 80 million in Q4. Steve Tusa : Wow, great detail. Thanks for that. On the orders, how much of the headwind were actual cancellations? I'm not sure I caught that earlier. What the actual cancellation number was? Blake Moret : Yes, the cancellations were in a similar range to what we've been talking about, which is to say they were not the major contributor to the orders, a decrease. The main contributor by far to the orders decrease is the high inventory levels at the distributors. So cancellations were a relatively small piece of it. At this point, clearing those final golden screw or fourth wheel constrained components to be able to allow distributors to shift, complete bills and material is also a smaller component of the overall contributor to the orders down in Q4. Steve Tusa : Okay. One last one just on the bridge, the $0.25 of acquisition headwind is pretty big for the Clearpath business, given it's a relatively small revenue number. That's all kind of incremental investments you are making, or that's how much money the business is losing or what's driving that? So to heed, the $0.25 is a pretty big number. Blake Moret : Yes, Steve. First of all, as Nick said, we expect the Clearpath contribution to be accretive in fiscal year '26. This is an important strategic move for Rockwell, and one that I think will be apparent as we talk about it and demonstrate it next week. The dilution in fiscal year '24 is based on a combination of them ramping their capability. So think of it as somewhat of a startup mode, but also as making sure that we surround it with the right resources to fully integrate it as quickly as possible into Rockwell to be able to provide that value for customers. So that's not only the technical resources, but it's the commercial resources, it's the infrastructure to help them drive cost out of their operations and drive unit cost out of those AMRs. And so it is some additional investment from Rockwell's part to make sure that we integrate this really thoroughly, because this is a major milestone for us. Steve Tusa : Great. Thanks for the color, guys. Really appreciate the details. Aijana Zellner : Abby, we will take one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will come from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Noah Kaye : Okay. Thanks for all the details in the guide. Just one housekeeping item. What is the price rollover contribution for 2024, or what is the total contribution of price to organic growth for '24? And then what are you assuming for cost inflation? Nick Gangestad : Yes. We are assuming that price growth will be slightly over 1% year-over-year. And in terms of input costs, we're expecting that to be very neutral year-over-year, causing the net price cost to be a little over 100 basis points accreted to margin. Noah Kaye : Perfect. Thanks, Nick. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session today. I will now turn the call back to Ms. Aijana Zellner for closing remarks. Aijana Zellner : Thank you everyone for joining us today. That concludes our call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, you may disconnect. Thank you for your participation.",

Later on the call, we will open up the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Aijana Zellner, Head of Investor Relations and Market Strategy. Ms. Zellner, please go ahead. Aijana Zellner : Thank you, Juliane. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include, and our call today will reference, non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. So, with that, I'll hand it over to Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks Aijana and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to our first quarter results on Slide 3. This quarter, we saw double-digit sequential growth in orders, with all business segments and regions up from the trough in Q4 of last year. While we are continuing to see the impact of excess inventory in the channel, the underlying demand from machine builders and end-users remain strong. Total sales were up 3.6% year-over-year. Organic sales grew 1% in the quarter, led by North America. China was the single largest drag on our shipments. Currency translation increased sales by over 1 point, and acquisitions contributed almost 1.5 points of growth. Our organic sales did come in below our expectations, largely due to the timing of our recovery to a more normal product book-and-bill process. As a source of our demand shifts from older backlog to new orders that need to be shipped as soon as they are received, we are working through some lingering shortages and line constraints. Our supply chain team is expected to complete this transition in Q2 with little impact on the full year. In our Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales were down 4.5% versus prior year. While product shipments in this segment experienced the biggest supply chain constraints in the quarter, we were able to offset some of that impact with strong performance from our configure-to-order businesses and from recent acquisitions. Our Clearpath and CUBIC acquisitions had a strong quarter, both on topline and bottom-line, showcasing the tremendous value these offerings are bringing to our customers across new verticals and applications. Last quarter, I talked about our presence in datacenter build-outs and CUBIC's momentum with large cloud service providers continues to fuel our growth in this end-market. I'll touch on some of the important Clearpath wins later on the call. Software & Control organic sales increased 4% year-over-year and were in line with our expectations. Logix continues to demonstrate unique value in the marketplace, and we've made some major software investments in this segment over the last few years. We are seeing the value from this innovation, demonstrated by double-digit sales growth in our cloud-native and on-prem information software offerings. Lifecycle Services organic sales grew over 8% versus prior year, better than we expected. Book-to-bill in this segment was 1.13, with strong order activity across solutions, services, and our Sensia joint venture. I'm pleased with how our Sensia team is making progress, with profitable growth in the quarter. Q1 orders and sales were up over 25% year-over-year. One of the strategic Sensia wins this quarter was with Mellitah Oil & Gas joint venture, one of the largest oil and gas companies in Libya. Sensia's advanced measurement technology is helping this customer modernize all of their liquid metering skids and establishes Sensia as one of the key players in the region for major metering turnkey solutions. Another highlight of the quarter was our continued growth in ARR. Total annual recurring revenue was up 20% year-over-year, with strong growth across our Plex and Fiix SaaS offerings and recurring services, including our growing cybersecurity business. The impact of these contracts on our financial performance is also increasing, especially in a year with relatively low product growth. This quarter, our Plex SaaS platform was selected by EOS Energy, an energy start-up focused on grid scale storage for utility companies. EOS Energy, in partnership with Acro Automation Systems, has selected Rockwell Automation to provide Plex MES and QMS information software to compliment Acro\u2019s battery manufacturing solution built on Rockwell\u2019s control platform. Acro is currently building out the first state-of-the-art manufacturing line that will manufacture EOS Energy\u2019s next gen Z3 batteries. Segment margin of about 17% and adjusted EPS of $2.04 were both down versus prior year. The adjusted EPS was below our expectations, and Nick will discuss this further in a few minutes. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q1 industry segment performance. Before we get into the individual verticals, keep in mind that the more product-intensive industries were the most impacted by planned shipments moving to Q2 and later in the year. Our discrete sales were down 10% year-over-year. Within discrete, automotive sales were down high single-digits. While auto customers are focused on near-term profitability and temporary slowdown in EV demand, they continue to fund new EV and battery CapEx programs. In addition to these investments, we are seeing increased activity across our traditional ICE and plugin hybrid platforms as brand owners and tier suppliers are looking to diversify their exposure in response to consumer demand and infrastructure limitations. As you know, Rockwell has a substantial installed base with these established automotive customers, and is well positioned to capture additional market share, regardless of the application. This quarter, our Logix platform was selected by Akasol/Borg Warner, a global battery producer and automotive tier supplier developing innovative battery manufacturing processes for their production plants in Seneca, South Carolina and Darmstadt, Germany. This customer plans to increase their production volume in Europe and North America and scale to more plants globally. Another exciting automotive win this quarter came from Clearpath Robotics, where a large brand owner will be using over a hundred of our Otto autonomous mobile robots in their US sub-assembly applications. Semiconductor sales were also down high-single-digits versus prior year. While the industry is still navigating through a myriad of challenges, including geopolitical risk, excess memory capacity, and workforce shortages, we continue to see new announcements and orders for greenfield projects and legacy fab upgrades, along with continued momentum in our wafer transport solutions. Within our eCommerce and Warehouse Automation industry, sales declined mid-teens and were in line with our expectations. Customers across many verticals continue to modernize their existing operations to match the current market\u2019s needs. In addition to a strong funnel of these warehouse transformation projects, we are starting to see renewed CapEx plans from our eCommerce customers for fulfilment center builds later in fiscal year 2024 and in fiscal year 2025. Moving to our hybrid industries. Within this industry segment, growth in life sciences and tire were offset by declines in food and beverage. Food and beverage sales were down high-single-digits versus prior year. Given the mix of products serving this customer segment, our Q1 performance in this vertical was most impacted by our internal capacity constraints mentioned earlier on the call. Similar to previous quarters, we continue to see large end users investing their digital and cyber capabilities across their global footprint. This quarter, we had another sizeable Clearpath win at one of the largest food and beverage manufacturers in the world, where the customer chose our Otto AMRs to replace their existing AGV system to increase throughput and flexibility, while enhancing material movement security. It is clear our customers across many industries are focused on augmenting their existing workforce through autonomous and innovative solutions to drive further productivity, safety, and sustainability in their operations. Life sciences sales grew 10% in the quarter. Note that our life sciences revenue is more weighted to software and services versus products. In addition to our MES and cybersecurity services momentum, we are continuing to see increased investments in high-growth areas, such as Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products and GLP-1 diabetes and obesity drugs. Tire was up high-single-digits. Moving to process. Sales in this industry segment grew over 10% year-over-year, once again led by strong growth in oil and gas, metals, and mining. Oil and gas sales were up over 25% this quarter. I already mentioned our performance in Sensia, and we continue to see follow-on orders from our customers\u2019 decarbonization and digitization projects worldwide. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 5 and our Q1 organic regional sales. North America organic sales were up over 4% year-over-year. North American manufacturers are continuing to invest, and we expect this region to be our strongest-performing market this year. Latin America was down half a point. EMEA sales were down about 2%, and Asia Pacific sales declined over 7%. Similar to the last few quarters, we continue to see challenges in the Chinese manufacturing economy, with high cancellations and pushouts relative to the rest of the world. Sales in China were down high teens versus prior year. Moving to Slide 6 for our fiscal 2024 outlook. We continue to expect our full-year orders to grow low-single-digits versus prior year, with strong sequential growth through the balance of this fiscal year. Factoring in our performance through January, our continuous analysis of distributor inventory levels, and strong pipeline of customer projects, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2024 sales guidance range with organic sales projected to grow 1% at the midpoint. Currency is also expected to increase sales by 1%, and we now expect acquisitions to contribute a 1.5 of growth. ARR is still slated to grow about 15%. Segment margin is expected to increase slightly versus prior year, with significant second half increases coming from increased product volume, spending discipline, and the growing benefit of productivity initiatives being taken in Lifecycle Services. Nick will share additional calendarization detail in his section. Adjusted EPS is slated to grow 5% year-over-year at the midpoint, again weighted to the back half of the year, and we still expect Free Cash Flow conversion of 100%. Let me turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q1 performance and financial outlook for fiscal 2024. Nick? Nick Gangestad : Thank you, Blake and good morning everyone. I'll start on Slide 7, first quarter key financial information. First quarter reported sales were up 3.6% over last year. Q1 organic sales were up 1%, and acquisitions contributed 140 basis points to total growth. Currency translation increased sales by 120 basis points. About 3 points of our organic growth came from price, in line with our expectations. Segment operating margin was 17.3%, compared to 20.2% a year ago. This 290 basis point decrease reflects higher investment spend, mix between products and solutions, and lower supply chain utilization. While our Q1 spend was down sequentially, we had a difficult year-over-year comparison due to an abnormally low investment spend in Q1 of last year. Key areas of year-over-year spending increases include investments in new products, digital infrastructure, and commercial resources. I'll comment later on the expected progression of our investment spend when I cover our full year outlook. As Blake mentioned, orders inflected upward sequentially, and we expect strong sequential order growth through the remainder of the year. The expected slope of orders is consistent with what we have discussed over the last couple of quarters. Adjusted EPS of $2.04, down 17% compared to last year, was below our expectations, primarily due to lower-than-expected sales and lower segment operating margin. The devaluation of the Argentine peso was an additional $0.10 adjusted EPS headwind in Q1. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter was 18%, slightly above the prior year rate. Free cash flow was negative $35 million, compared to a positive $42 million in the prior year. Our lower year-over-year free cash flow generation in the quarter was driven by higher incentive compensation payout during the quarter, which was tied to our fiscal 2023 performance. Working capital decreased in Q1, driven by lower accounts receivable, partially offset by lower accounts payable. One additional item not shown on the slide. We repurchased approximately 400,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $120 million. On December 31st, $800 million remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 8 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. Blake discussed our top line performance in the quarter, so I'll focus on our margin performance. As I mentioned earlier, our investment spend in the year-ago quarter was lower than normal as most of the incremental fiscal 2023 investments started in Q2 of last year. This resulted in a difficult year-over-year margin comparison in Q1 for both Intelligent Devices and Software & Control. Intelligent Devices margin decreased to 16.2%, compared to 22.4% a year ago. The decrease from prior year was driven by lower sales volume, the timing of prior year investment spend, and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by positive price/cost. Our Clearpath and CUBIC acquisitions, both part of Intelligent Devices, are performing well and are making commercial -- and we are making commercial and technical investments here to accelerate profitable growth. Software & Control margin of 25% decreased from 29.2% last year. The lower margin was driven by the timing of prior year investment spend and lower supply chain utilization, partially offset by price/cost. Lifecycle Services book-to-bill was 1.13. Lifecycle Services margin of 10.4% doubled from the year-ago margin of 5.2%. Strong margin performance was driven by higher sales, lower incentive compensation, and higher margins in Sensia. We are realizing productivity benefits from Lifecycle Services restructuring actions we took last year and those benefits are coming in as expected. The next slide, 9, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q1 fiscal 2023 to Q1 fiscal 2024. Core performance was down $0.10 on a 1% organic sales increase as positive price/cost was more than offset by negative product mix and lower supply chain utilization. Higher investment spend was a $0.40 EPS headwind. Incentive compensation was a $0.20 tailwind. This year-over-year improvement reflects a lower projected bonus payout this year versus an above-target payout last year. The impact from acquisitions was a $0.10 headwind and aligned with our expectations. The year-over-year impact from currency was a $0.05 headwind, with the $0.10 headwind from the Argentine peso revaluation more than offsetting the positive impact from other currencies. The $0.05 -- the net $0.05 currency headwind was offset by a $0.05 tailwind from interest expense. Share count and tax rate were each immaterial to the year-over-year change in EPS this quarter. Let's now move on to the next slide, 10, guidance for fiscal 2024. We are reaffirming our guidance for fiscal 2024 of reported sales growth of 0.5% to 6.5%, and organic sales growth in the range of negative 2% to positive 4%. As Blake mentioned earlier, we now expect acquisitions to add 150 basis points to growth, up from 100 basis points in our prior guidance, as the growing pipeline of projects from Clearpath is leading to higher expected growth. Given this improvement, Clearpath is now expected to dilute adjusted EPS by $0.20 versus our prior expectation of $0.25. We now expect a full year currency tailwind of 100 basis points, down from 150 basis points in our prior guide because projections for the euro and the Canadian dollar have weakened slightly for the year. We continue to expect price to be a positive contributor to growth for the year. We expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17%. And we are reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance range of $12 to $13.50. We expect full year fiscal 2024 free cash flow conversion of about 100% of adjusted income. This reflects our continued expectation that inventory days on hand will drop to approximately 125 days by the end of fiscal year 2024, compared to 140 days of inventory we had at the end of fiscal year 2023. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion in the first half to be well below 100%, mostly tied to the higher incentive compensation payment made in Q1 relative to our fiscal year 2023 performance, and higher income tax payments related to the realized capital gain on the sale of our stake in PTC, as well as our Tax Cuts and Jobs Act transition tax payment. From a calendarization perspective, we expect Q2 sales dollars and segment margin to be similar to Q1 levels. We previously expected the lead-times on our last constrained products would return to normal by the end of Q1. This is now being pushed back to the middle of the year. This means that our split between first half and second half revenue will be even more weighted towards the second half. Our plan was and continues to be for balanced spend across the four quarters of fiscal year 2024, compared to our upward trajectory of spend in fiscal year 2023, as confidence in supply chain recovery pace grew. Given the split of sales between first and second half, that means first half margins will be noticeably lower compared to the year prior and second half margins noticeably higher. We expect margins in Q2 to remain similar to what they were in Q1 and then increase to the mid-20s in Q3 and Q4. That expansion in margin is virtually all -- driven virtually all by revenue returning to levels consistent with end demand. We anticipate investment spend to be relatively flat across the four quarters of fiscal year 2024. From a year-on-year perspective, Q2 and Q3 increases in investment spend will be approximately $10 million each and then a year-over-year decrease in Q4. A few additional comments on fiscal 2024 guidance. Corporate and other expense is expected to be around $125 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2024 is expected to be about $120 million and we're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 115.1 million shares. We expect to deploy between $300 million and $500 million to share repurchases during the year. With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Blake? Blake Moret : Thanks Nick. Despite geopolitical volatility, our detailed discussions with our distributors, machine builders, and end-users point to fairly healthy market conditions. Our outlook for fiscal year 2024 is based on an acceleration of new product orders as distributors and machine builders reduce excessive inventory. Our operations team is working around the clock to ensure we can convert these new orders into shipments at lead-times that are as good or better than pre-pandemic lead-times. We continue to gain share across our key platforms, especially here in North America. We are seeing early orders from customer projects facilitated by economic stimulus, and automation continues to be an important way to maximize the productivity of available workers. Our recent acquisitions are performing well on both revenue and cost, with Clearpath Robotics being a standout addition to Rockwell's portfolio. We've seen multimillion dollar wins across diverse end-markets, including automotive, food and beverage, and even warehousing and logistics and this is just the beginning. We have a unique portfolio of high-value assets that we've built and bought with the best partner ecosystem in the business. Our focus is now to integrate these elements as only a pure-play can, growing share, profitability and cash flow by driving efficiency and synergy. Aijana, we'll now begin the Q&A session. Aijana Zellner : Thanks Blake. We would like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Juliane, let's take our first question. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead, your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning everyone. Blake Moret : Hey Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Blake and Nick, you mentioned that your orders were up double-digits sequentially. Could you tell us where backlog was ending Q1? And regardless, you did reiterate your low single-digit order growth for FY 2024. So, are you beginning to see a more substantial turn in orders here in fiscal Q2 as your distributors bottom out their inventory levels? And if so, what end-markets would you say are inflecting the most? Nick Gangestad : Yes, Andy, we ended last year with a backlog of $4.1 billion all in, and it went down high single digits in -- during the first quarter. In terms of what we're seeing with orders, you're exactly right, we're seeing an inflection up in the orders from the Q4 trough. And we're expecting that to continue into the second quarter of double-digit growth into the second quarter. In terms of where that -- where we're seeing that, I'll turn that over to Blake. Blake Moret : Yes. Let me just mention additionally, Andy, that distributor inventory is coming down. So, as we've talked about before, we have good visibility into our distributor inventory based on our channel model, and we are seeing that going down as we expected. As we're seeing the orders, it's a good mix across industries, including some of the industries that were pressured by the lower shipments in the first quarter like auto and food and beverage, we're also seeing it across the entire portfolio, as we talked about annual recurring revenue, very strong from a software and a high-value services standpoint and other aspects of Lifecycle Services. But we do expect that that order recovery is going to be broad-based across our key industries, including in discrete and hybrid, to complement the continuing good performance in process such as oil and gas. Andy Kaplowitz : Very helpful, guys. And then you didn't change your adjusted EPS guidance for the year, but you did mention that you expect modest EPS growth that's back-end loaded. I know, Blake, you suggested that your supply chain team should catch up with a more book-and-bill type environment in Q2, and Nick, you talked about the margin jump starting in Q3. But maybe you could talk more about confidence level in getting that margin jump you expect in Q3. And does a relatively slow start for EPS for the year suggests modest EPS growth for FY 2024, meaning somewhat lower in that $12 to $13.50 EPS range? Or are you not trying to single that? Blake Moret : No. Well, we're reaffirming the guide that we introduced in November. The significant increase in EPS in the second half of the year is based on the increased volume. You'll recall last year, we went from roughly $2 billion of shipments in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 to an exit of around $2.5 billion. And we're expecting to see something similar in this year, in fiscal year 2024, from the Q1 that we were talking about of $2 billion roughly of shipments to around $2.5 billion at the end of the year. That's what's going to drive the higher margins and EPS. Last year, the causal for that ramp was based on getting chip supply. This year, it's the ramp of orders. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate it guys. Blake Moret : Thanks Andy. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead, your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Blake Moret : Hi Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Can we just drill back into the supply chain comments? They seem inconsistent, right, when we think about it. Revenues this quarter are lower than revenues in the prior three quarters, right? So, you're getting a lot more out the door the prior three quarters. So, can you just elaborate a little bit more on what exactly happened in supply chain? What kind of bottlenecks you're dealing with? Are they at the Rockwell factory level? Are they at a supplier level? Just please clear that up for us, if you could. Blake Moret : Sure Jeff. So, what we're seeing is the shift in the timing going from a dynamic of shipments that's been based entirely on reducing large amounts of backlog, to a recovery to a more normal product book-and-bill process. So, the big shipments that we saw over the last year were based on chips coming in with a very visible really mass of past-due backlog that was in a relatively concentrated set of SKUs for us. So, whether it was variable speed drives or motion control or Logix IO. We had very good visibility into what we needed to ship as soon as we got the chips. We're seeing the shift in Q1, which should be complete in Q2, of moving to a more normal distribution of having the vast majority of our shipments in the quarter based on book-and-bill, that is, new orders coming in that get turned around in the quarter. The things that hampered us in Q1 were the lingering tail of those past-due backlog items that we talked about taking a little bit longer than Q1 to clear out, as well as some continuing component challenges, and then the shift to being able to build safety stock to be able to handle those incoming orders. That progress continues in Q2. We expect to be substantially complete with that in the quarter. But that's the difference of what we were shipping out last year versus what we're shipping out now. I should also mention, we've talked in the past about our capacity being over $10 billion and that remains true. Our capacity to ship in terms of physical plant and labor is over $10 billion and that's going to be important as we continue to grow. Jeff Sprague : Okay, right. And then again, if we could just talk a little bit more detail, maybe it's for Nick. I think you're pretty explicit on sort of the margins for Q2. Maybe just give us a little bit of color though on kind of the mix and what's driving that. I mean it does sound like you're expecting some sequential revenue lift in Q2. So, why would margins be roughly similar to Q1? Nick Gangestad : Yes, we're expecting dollar revenue to be very similar in Q2 to what it was in Q1 and a very similar margin. The mix of what we're selling in Q1 to Q2, in Q1, we had more of it coming out of our backlog and less from current quarter book-and-bill. In Q2, that will be shifting -- that mix will be shifting to more coming out of current quarter orders as we continue to bring that backlog down. On the margin front, many of the things that we saw in the first quarter, we're going to be keeping investment spend very similar to what -- in Q2 very similar to what it was in Q1. The year-on-year change of that will come down, but the sequential will be almost identical. And then mix will probably not be as -- was a drain -- was a negative to us in Q1. And we expect mix to continue as a negative into Q2, both from a segment mix where we expect higher growth in -- our highest growth in Lifecycle Services, but also within segments where we're seeing more of our sales in Intelligent Devices coming from our configure-to-order business. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thank you Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead, your line is open. Andrew Obin : Yes, good morning. Blake Moret : Morning Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just to follow-up, I guess, on Jeff's question. If we go back to your Analyst Day, I think the message is that this is a transition year, and then revenue growth mean-reverts to plan next year, which means it's going to accelerate very nicely. Can you just expand, how do you make sure that, over the next 18 months, Rockwell can actually deliver the volumes? Are there any structural changes that you're making to your internal processes and supply chains to sort of ensure a smooth ramp-up? Blake Moret : Yes, Andrew, there is. As I mentioned before, the first is to make sure that we have the fixed assets in place. We've been working on that for over a year, which allowed us to get to the $9 billion worth of shipments last year, which was a fairly healthy step-up from prior. And we've kept going to where, today, we feel like we have over $10.5 billion worth of capacity in terms of the assets. As you'll recall, we're a fairly asset-light manufacturing process. It's assembly, it's test fixtures, it's surface mount machines and so on. And we're making sure, not only in our organic business, but also with the acquisitions where we're seeing such strong growth, that we're making the investments to be able to fuel that growth. Labor is the other area. We have adequate product labor in place currently. We are continuing to ramp up based on the growth in our engineered-to-order business and the share gains that we're seeing there, the labor through the year in that. And in some cases, we're holding labor in place to make sure that it's there as we see that order ramp continue through the year. From a structural standpoint, we are working through ways to drive efficiency, to get scale throughout the organization. Some of this is standard lean concepts. But it's also adding the things that we've learned about needing resilience in terms of redundancy across multiple plants, in some cases, redundant sources of supply to be able to reduce the dependence on single suppliers in single parts of the world. So, we're working all of those plays in operations as well as with the engineers. Andrew, going back to your first comment, we do expect to be exiting fiscal year 2024, as we go through this transition, with margins that are very encouraging, as Nick talked about, as well as volume that supports continued growth in 2025 and beyond. Andrew Obin : Thank you. And just a follow-up question. We've been getting some incoming calls, just folks concerned about slowdown in packaging CapEx. I think there were specific headlines. Also mining, another area of concern, I know sort of discrete and process. But can you just comment about these two specific markets, maybe a little bit more granularity what you are seeing around the world? Thanks so much. Blake Moret : Sure. So, for us, packaging is typically being incorporated as part of our vertical industries of food and beverage, consumer packaged goods. And we are seeing the machinery builders in those areas, in Life Sciences as well, I should mention, there's packaging of medicine in Life Sciences, of course. And we are seeing those machine builders, similar to our distributors work, through inventory in their system. It's in a similar kind of profile to what we're seeing with our distributors, in that we expect over the coming few months, that works off and exposes what we continue to see from direct conversations with those customers, with those machine builders strong underlying demand. With respect to mining, we actually are seeing relative strength in mining in the areas that we focus on. Some of that is driven by materials for batteries. But in general, we do expect to see low single-digit growth in mining in the year. Andrew Obin : Thanks so much. Blake Moret : Thanks Andrew. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. Sorry about that. Thanks for the question. I'm sorry, I missed a part of the call, Nick, where you were running through the guidance point. Did you call out the degree of order acceleration? I know you called out double-digit growth sequentially. Just wondering if you quantified the order and backlog exiting the quarter. Nick Gangestad : Yes, I did call some of that out. First, we saw double-digit order growth sequentially in Q1, and we expect double-digit order growth sequentially in Q2. And then further ramp into Q3 and Q4 for orders. And that's being driven by the progress we're seeing with excess inventory in the channel coming out. In terms of the backlog, we ended fiscal year 2023 with a backlog of $4.1 billion, and we saw that come down high single-digit percent in the first quarter. Nigel Coe : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks and sorry I missed that. Are we still looking at $3 billion as the point where this stabilizes and where we start to see that real inflection in order rates? Blake Moret : I'm sorry, the $3 billion? Nigel Coe : Yes, $3 billion of backlog. I think that's what you called out as sort of normal-ish level. Nick Gangestad : Yes, what I said on the last call is that we expect the backlog in a more normal range of 30% to 35% of our revenue. I think that we still see that as a good point. I'd say our current projections see us at the high end, closer to the high end of that 30% to 35% range now for fiscal year 2024. Nigel Coe : Okay, that's great. And then my follow-on question, Nick, is I understand that the mix impacts from Lifecycle services are growing, the Software Control and ID. But maybe the 240 basis points of gross margin compression year-over-year, maybe just unpack that for us in terms of mix versus M&A impacts. Just curious because that -- given that pricing was 3 points, price/cost positive, that's a fairly big delta. Nick Gangestad : Yes. So, if you look at our press release, we have gross profit down 240 basis points year-on-year. About a third of that is coming from the investment spend that I talked about year-on-year, that that's because our R&D spend is part of that growth. So, that's about a third of that decline in the margin there. Our acquisitions, Clearpath and Verve, are 30 basis points are a small part of that. And then the rest of it would be coming from mix and underutilization of our -- underutilization of our supply chain in the first quarter. Nigel Coe : Okay, that makes sense. Thanks Nick. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open. Steve Tusa : Hi, good morning. Blake Moret : Morning. Nick Gangestad : Hey Steve. Steve Tusa : So, I guess just from a stability perspective on the deliveries. Is there a particular end-market or anything like that that's driving this what kind of looks to be a very choppy outcome on delivery? Is it like are there certain segments of the market or product types that are not maybe flowing as smoothly as they have in the past? Blake Moret : No, Steve, it's really -- I mean, it is product and it's centered in the Intelligent Devices. So, where you have the greatest diversity of SKUs between variable speed drives, motion control. And these are the areas where you're seeing that shift that I mentioned earlier, where we were bringing down a significant amount of past-due backlog, and now we're moving towards what is a more normal book-and-bill environment. But there's no unsurmountable challenges that we don't expect to be resolved in Q2. It was the shift that we saw really Q1 and a little bit into Q2, is that move from having the vast majority of our shipments as past-due backlog moving to more book-and-bill, centered within the Intelligent Devices segment. Steve Tusa : Okay. I guess just also, just, Nick, from an earnings perspective, first half is going to be relatively low, is how much of a linear step-up do you think for 3Q and 4Q as we just think about the seasonality here? Nick Gangestad : Yes, it will really be bringing us where the first two quarters of this year are, I'd say, under-reflecting end-demand for our products as that excess inventory is being worked through. And then Q3 and Q4 are getting back to a more normal. So, yes, that makes it more heavily weighted to the back half of the year. But given our plans of what we'll be doing from spending, the type of earnings growth, is very consistent with what we expect with that kind of uptick in revenue into Q3 and Q4. Steve Tusa : Okay. And just lastly, just on the orders, we're getting to something in the kind of 1., I don't know, 1.6, 1.7 range. Is that about right? Blake Moret : Yes, we haven't given the specific number, Steve. We talked about double-digit sequential growth from the trough in Q4 to Q1, with expected continuing double-digit sequential growth from Q1 to Q2, and really continuing through the year. Steve Tusa : Okay. Thanks a lot. Blake Moret : Yes, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Snyder from UBS. Please go ahead, your line is open. Chris Snyder : Thank you. I wanted to ask about the guided step-up in margins from the high teens level in the fiscal second quarter to about mid-20s in the fiscal third quarter. I understand volumes are getting better sequentially, but that implied sequential incremental is much, much sharper than what we would kind of say is normalized for the company. So, can you just sort of talk about other drivers of that sequential margin uplift into the back half beyond just volume? Nick Gangestad : Yes. There's three things I'll point out on that, Chris. The vast majority, I'll say 75% of that margin expansion, is just coming from the volume increase in holding investment spending flat across the year. The second and third pieces are pretty equal. One is coming from the improved utilization of our factories that we'll -- and our supply chain that we'll see as a result of that. And then the third is we saw good progress on our Lifecycle services margin, and we expect that to continue, and that's also going to be part of our continued margin expansion from the first half to the second half. Chris Snyder : Thank you. I appreciate that. And then on some of the supply chain constraints you guys called out that weighed on shipments in the first quarter. I don't think I caught it, but could you provide any sort of magnitude on how much sales were impacted by that? And it does not seem like that's coming back in the second quarter. It seems like they are then kind of deferred into the back half of the year. Is that right? Thank you. Nick Gangestad : Yes, I would put the -- we had originally guided that we expected low single-digit growth in the first quarter. We came in at 1. So, there is -- there's a portion, but it's probably in the $50 million to $70 million range of what we're talking about there. And yes, much of that is going into the second half of the year. That is correct. Chris Snyder : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. I just wanted to try and square sort of the comments on capacity utilization and the supply constraints with inventories. I think they're running -- we'll wait for the Q for the end-December balance, but it sounds like those are sort of stable sequentially maybe. And they've been running at a mid-teens share of sales versus sort of 8%, 9% pre-COVID. And they rose a lot the last 12 months even as sales rose. So, I just want to understand sort of -- it sounds like inventories to sales, inventory days, should fall in the balance of the year. But do you need sort of some -- is that based on a much faster sell-through out of the plant? You need to sort of underproduce somewhat to get the inventory back down? Or do you think that inventories will stay much higher now as a share of sales medium term than pre-COVID for some reason, even though lead-times are normal? Nick Gangestad : Yes, Julian, there's a few things that will change there. First of all, you know our projection that we're going to move from 140 days of inventory down to 125. That's been there and that's unchanged. Now, the mix of that, as we're looking at this shift to more and more of our revenue coming from current quarter orders that we're booking and billing, part of our action plans there is we see some increased needs for safety stock of those finished goods. So, as we go through the balance of this year, there will be some places where finished goods go up. But that will be more than offset by the reductions that we're seeing in our components driven by the improved lead-times we have for those components as well as our work in progress. So, we're expecting, as we progress through 2024, just to be seeing that kind of shift. The 125 days will still be well above our pre-pandemic levels where we were typically under 100 days of inventory. Julian Mitchell : I see. But I guess -- I get it. Sort of two years ago, sort of people would have said you need higher inventory because backlogs are very high and you need inventory to sort of satisfy projects and backlog. But now you're saying as you go back towards a more normal book and ship business, that also requires sort of higher inventories. I just want to sort of understand what's kind of changed in the thinking there. Nick Gangestad : Yes, in order to have sufficient inventories to be able to ship products very quickly to our customers and our distributors when they want it, we've been working on getting our products recovery back to where we can ship. Now, part of the progress we're making in the next couple of quarters is getting all of our safety stocks on our -- for our finished goods to where we feel they should be in order to make sure we're performing and executing to our customers' expectations. That's part of that plan. And so finished goods will not decline, but we expect all of our decline to be coming in the -- in our raw materials and work in progress. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. And just the follow-up on that would be, when you look at your sort of customers and distributors, how are you seeing them managing their inventories of kind of your product? And how are they feeling about those inventory levels today, please? Blake Moret : Yes, we expect our distributors to be carrying a little higher amount of inventory given the customer service challenges that the industry has had over the last couple of years, we expect that equilibrium that distributors get to be a little higher level than it was pre-pandemic. And that's with very specific discussions with them about how they're thinking about the balance of customer service and working capital. We're also seeing with our machine builders that, as I mentioned before, some of them are still continuing to work down inventory in their own system, but we expect that to be complete over the coming months. I don't know of any difference in the way machine builders are looking at carrying levels of inventory and working capital. But with our distributors, we do expect them to normalize at a little higher level than they would have traditionally. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Blake Moret : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, your line is open. Noah Kaye : Thanks very much. I just want to ask one final one on the production constraints. Can you help us understand a little bit better, what is different about the configure-to-order business versus the type of products that you've been working down a backlog? Is there focus on different lines? Does it require different personnel? Just help us understand some of the actual operational dynamics you are going through as you kind of reconfigure for a more normal book-and-ship environment? Blake Moret : Sure. Let me just clarify that. The shift that's going on that we saw challenges in the first quarter was the move from servicing backlog of products to shipping out book-and-bill of products where the orders come in in the quarter. We continue to have a certain amount of configure-to-order business, our motor control centers, our big drives, our independent cart technology and so on. That isn't representing the biggest challenge to us. Those are very different processes. Those configure-to-order businesses come in with varying degrees of customization specific to a customer. But the big dynamic that we've been talking about in Q1 is the move from a somewhat concentrated list of SKUs that we have backlog building -- that backlog built up because we couldn't get the chips, moving to book-and-bill of a more diverse set of SKUs as we see the largest portion of our shipments coming from orders received in that quarter, not one or two or three quarters prior. So, that's the main dynamic that we're working through. You have much less visibility to what's coming in from that book-and-bill profile. So that's one of the changes. And what Nick was talking about in the previous question is we're in the process of building up safety stock in those areas so that we can deal with the ebb and flow of the normal order book, in a quarter being able to turn that around and convert those orders to shipments in the quarter. So, those are the processes that are somewhat different from what -- the world we've been living in for the last year or so, to what we're transitioning to and we'll continue to operate in, we hope, for a long time. Noah Kaye : Thanks Blake. If I could ask just one follow-up. I think you're not -- you reiterated your organic industry segment outlook essentially for the full year. Is there any change or shift you've seen in the timing of demand and orders for any of the major segments or subsegments? It does seem like most of the cadence here is really driven by your own production considerations and where channel inventory is. But is there any shift in timing you can see among the end-customers? Blake Moret : Yes, I think you said it right. The largest impact is based on getting those shipments out the door, being able to see the distributors return to equilibrium. We continue to see good activity in process applications. We talked about oil and gas, specialty chemical, mining. These are all areas that are relatively strong. Certainly, we've seen some slowdown in certain of the EV projects, but those projects are continuing. We're continuing to win new business in those areas. And as I talked about in my prepared remarks, in traditional internal combustion engines and in hybrid manufacturing, we have very good readiness to serve in those areas as well, with a lot of experience. So, in a year of low growth, we're not seeing any big ebbs and flows in the vertical end-market needs being the predominant factor in any changes through the year. Noah Kaye : Understood. Thanks Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks. Aijana Zellner : Juliane, we'll take one more question. Operator : Our last question will come from Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, your line is open. Joe O'Dea: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First, I just wanted to ask about the back half of the year margin profile. And it does seem like a transition from maybe a higher concentration of a narrower band of products that you would have had shipping out of backlog in 2023 compared to more kind of book-and-shipping quarter in 2024 is a bit of a mix headwind. And so when we think about back half of 2024 margins being better than back half of 2023, can you expand on that a little bit? Is it Devices is up, Lifecycle is up, maybe Software and Control is down a bit year-over-year? Just trying to contemplate what could still be a year-over-year mix headwind as you broaden out the book and ship? Blake Moret : Yes, I think what you're seeing from a positive standpoint is the greater percentage of products as those orders increase through the year. To be sure, we are seeing some headwind based on the comparables with the year where Logix grew over 30% last year as one of our most profitable product lines. But the other point is that, recognizing the puts and takes in this year, we did take cost out beginning in Q4 of the last year. And so that gives us help to being able to push those margins at the exit of 2024 higher than they were. That's in -- across our business and functions, most noticeably in Lifecycle Services. Joe O'Dea: Great. And then just on the sort of channel inventory observations, and it sounds like taking a little bit longer than previously anticipated to get channel inventories to targeted levels, what are your observations of why that is in terms of kind of end market demand patterns or maybe a little bit more inventory out there than you appreciated for why it would be more middle of the year versus first half of the year where we would have seen channel inventory correct? Blake Moret : We're really talking about variability that could be in the area of weeks or a month. I wouldn't read too much into talking middle of the year versus second quarter. We did see a good double-digit sequential increase in orders in Q1. We expect that again in Q2. January represents a sequential increase based on what we've seen so far from Q1. And so we continue to see that inventory at our distributors coming down pretty much as we expected. Nick Gangestad : Yes, Joe, I'll just add. I mean, we're obviously in close dialogue with all of our distributors, and a high percentage of them are affirming to us that they expect to be done with -- they're reducing excess inventory sometime during Q2 and that they're at an equilibrium point there. Joe O'Dea: That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. Aijana Zellner : Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. That concludes today's conference call. Operator : At this time, you may disconnect. Thank you.",

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Aijana Zellner, Head of Investor Relations and Market Strategy. Ms. Zellner, please go ahead. Aijana Zellner : Thank you, Julianne. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our CFO.  Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include and our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call.  Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings. So with that, I'll hand it over to Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before we turn to our second quarter results on Slide 3, I'll make some initial comments. At a high level, our performance in Q2 was good, but I am not happy with the reduced guidance for the full year. The impact of high inventory levels at machine builders is larger than we expected. Orders are still expected to return to year-over-year growth in Q3 and continued to increase during the year, but the slower ramp is impacting shipments for the second half.  Consequently, here's what we are doing. We are accelerating actions to bring costs in line with the revised outlook on current year orders, aligned with the more comprehensive program to expand margins introduced during our Investor Day in November. We will save $100 million in the second half of this year from accelerated actions being taken now, creating a beneficial starting point for fiscal year '25. We will see incremental savings of $120 million next year from these actions alone plus a larger amount of additional savings from the more comprehensive program targeting sourcing, manufacturing and SG&A. And we will provide a more detailed view of this program on our next earnings call. We are improving our forecasting with new perspectives on the team, processes that include a deeper analysis of channel information and better decision support technology. I'm optimistic about our position when we exit fiscal year '24, regardless of next year's growth for several reasons. Rockwell has built an unmatched portfolio to meet the world's growing need for smart manufacturing. Our home market, North America is expected to grow faster than the worldwide PAM. We are winning major new business today with both our traditional offerings and new sources of value across discrete, hybrid and process industries. As we couple this with our focus on margin expansion through cost discipline, operational excellence and organic growth, we will achieve the longer-range targets introduced in November and create significant shareowner value.  Turning to the quarter. As we indicate on Slide 3, we returned to good operational performance in the second quarter with both organic sales and adjusted EPS above our expectations. Sales of product, configured-to-order offerings, Software and Lifecycle Services were all at or above our forecast. In products, we converted incoming orders at a much higher level than in Q1, and we now have sufficient mix of safety stock in place to convert orders at the current level or higher through the balance of the fiscal year. We are essentially back to booking and billing product orders in the quarter they are received at pre-pandemic conversion rates. Our orders were up low double digits sequentially. With continued recovery across all business segments and regions, North America had the highest sequential increase in the quarter. Year-over-year, total sales were down 6.5% in the quarter based on an organic sales decline of 8% and 1.5 points of acquisition growth. In our Intelligent Devices segment, organic sales declined about 7.5% year-over-year. I'm pleased with our execution to meet our shipping commitments and build safety stock in the quarter for these products. We also continue to see strong performance from our recent Clearpath acquisition, with sales of autonomous mobile robots contributing almost 2.5 points to ITD growth in the quarter. One notable Clearpath win this quarter was with the [ Hershey ] Company. The Hershey Company continues to advance digital capabilities to enhance agility and efficiency across its operations, including supply chain and manufacturing processes. As part of their efforts, Hershey has selected Auto Motors technology to improve productivity in both fulfillment and manufacturing operations. Q2 margin performance for Clearpath was also better than expected.  Software & Control organic sales were down 23% versus prior year, largely as we expected. As you know, this segment is significantly impacted by difficult year-over-year comparables in our Logix business. In Q2 of last year, we had 42% growth in Software & Control. There are particularly high levels of these products in inventory at our machine builders. Despite this temporary correction, we are gaining Logix share and winning new business across our software and hardware offerings. I'm proud of the vitality of our product development here, demonstrated by recent organic product launches and partnerships with Microsoft and NVIDIA that are focused on specific customer use cases, especially those that will benefit from simulation and simplification using artificial intelligence. These partners recognize that machines and manufacturing processes represent an enormous largely untapped source of data, and petabytes of this data flow through our controllers. They also know we have the manufacturing domain expertise to select the best use cases for their technology. Lifecycle Services organic sales grew over 12% year-over-year and continue to outperform our expectations driven by strong process end markets. Book-to-bill in this segment was 1.07, led by good order growth in our solutions and Sensia businesses. Our Sensia JV saw another quarter of over 25% year-over-year sales growth in Q2. The Lifecycle Services segment also continues to contribute strong growth from our high-value services, including cybersecurity, which saw orders growth of almost 50% in the quarter. We are making substantial progress to expand Lifecycle Services margin. We saw 16% margin in this quarter, and we're not done working on the performance of this business segment. Total ARR was up 20% again this quarter. We continue to see strong profitable recurring growth from both high-value services and software. Rockwell segment margin was 19%. This would have been about 17% without the reversal of the bonus accrual we recorded in the quarter. Adjusted EPS of $2.50 was above our expectations even after adjusting for the reversal of the bonus accrual. Nick will cover this in more detail later on the call. Let's now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q2 industry segment performance. Sales in our discrete industries were down high teens versus prior year. The impact of high product inventory levels in the channel are most pronounced in our discrete and hybrid industry segments. Automotive, e-commerce and other warehouse automation sales were all impacted. Within discrete, automotive sales were down 20%. Much of this year-over-year weakness is driven by excess product inventory in our channel. However, we're also starting to see some impact on our fiscal '24 sales as customers take time to reevaluate the timing of their EV investments. While we are not seeing any EV or battery project cancellations, we are seeing pushouts of certain production start dates. As we've mentioned, given our strong installed base and expanded portfolio, Rockwell is well positioned with automotive customers, whether they are investing in electric vehicles or adding more hybrid options in the near term. They are all interested in increasing efficiency. In addition to our traditional sources of value, Clearpath autonomous mobile robots helped us secure over half a dozen wins with major brand owners and Tier 1 suppliers this quarter. Semiconductor sales declined 25% year-over-year with continued geopolitical pressures and a temporary oversupply of legacy chips weighing on semi customers' CapEx investments. Our sales in e-commerce and warehouse automation were down high teens this quarter. We did see an improvement in sequential growth and increased our full year sales outlook. We're rebuilding a strong warehouse pipeline with traditional retailers and global shipping and logistics customers.  Turning to our hybrid sales. This industry segment was down mid-teens year-over-year. The weakness in this industry segment was led by food and beverage and home and personal care. Food and beverage sales declined 20% in the quarter, driven by slower activity at our packaging OEMs, who are still working through their excess inventory. There are also some signs of slower end user CapEx spend. Food and beverage end users are continuing to fund capacity expansion in emerging markets, like India and Southeast Asia, and modernization and resilience projects across their existing facilities. We had wins in the quarter, including the AMR project I mentioned earlier and cybersecurity projects at new customers. Life Sciences sales were down high single digits. Results in the quarter were mainly driven by project delays, especially in China. Outside of that region, we continue to expand our installed base with newer software and hardware offerings. One example of new value in this vertical was an important Q2 order with an innovative contract manufacturer, National Resilience, who selected Clearpath to provide a comprehensive AMR solution as they bring cell and gene therapies to market.  Moving to Process. Our sales here grew high single digits year-over-year, supported by continued strength in oil and gas and mining. Oil and gas sales were up over 20% this quarter with continued momentum in energy transition projects. In Q2, we secured multiple decarbonization projects, including applications for carbon capture, storage and hydrogen. Let's turn to Slide 5 and our Q2 organic regional sales. The Americas continued to be our strongest region this year, with Latin America growing 8% versus prior year and North America organic sales down about 4% in the quarter. EMEA sales decreased 19% due to high machine builder inventory in Germany and Italy, particularly in consumer packaged goods. Asia Pacific sales declined 17% in the quarter, with sales in China down almost 30% versus prior year. We expect a combination of weaker market conditions and slower distributor destocking to continue to impact our China performance through the balance of this fiscal year.  Moving to Slide 6 for our fiscal 2024 outlook. As I mentioned at an investor conference in March, while orders continue to increase sequentially from the trough in Q4 of last fiscal year, we have not yet seen the acceleration we expect once distributors and machine builders work through their excess inventory. The result is that some of the demand they are seeing does not translate to an equal amount of orders placed on Rockwell. I also said that if the pace of orders continued on its current trajectory, we would expect our full year 2024 financial results to track closer to the low end of both our organic growth and EPS range. Since then, we've seen lower-than-expected order activity. While distributors and machine builders are continuing to work through their excess inventory, we have underestimated the amount of overstock at our machine builders. Based on information received directly from our largest machine builders, our downward revision is based largely on the size of their inventory and the expected pace of the reduction resulting in a slower ramp of orders in the fiscal year. Again, we do expect to return to year-over-year growth in orders for the third quarter, and our updated forecast still implies sequential order growth in Q3 and Q4. We believe we are taking share in our major product lines globally and in the U.S. North America is our strongest market, and we are starting to see an increased order impact from customer mega projects as the year progresses. We now expect our full year orders to be down low single digits versus prior year. Based on our performance to date and the lower-than-expected order ramp, we are revising our fiscal '24 sales guidance range with organic sales projected to decline 7% at the midpoint, and we continue to expect acquisitions to contribute 1.5 points of growth. ARR is still expected to grow about 15%. Segment margin of 20% is now expected to decline versus prior year, which still implies an increase in the second half and specifically in fiscal Q4, driven by higher volume and the accelerated cost down actions I mentioned earlier. Nick will share additional detail in his section. Adjusted EPS is slated to decrease 13% year-over-year at the midpoint. We are increasing planned share repurchases to roughly double our original plan for the year, and we expect free cash flow conversion of 80%. This is a reduction from our prior guide, and Nick will cover this in more detail later. The reduced guide for the fiscal year only strengthens our commitment to building a strong foundation for future growth and profitability. The company-wide program to comprehensively take cost out of our products and operations will positively impact our results next year. Savings will be used to expand margins and reinvest to drive future growth. We will provide additional detail no later than the Q3 earnings call. Our intention is to manage our business segments for consistent forecastable performance. You've also seen the announcement of Nick's upcoming retirement. A search has been underway, and we expect to announce a new CFO in the coming months. Nick will be fully engaged in the transition to his successor. And he will now provide more detail on our Q2 performance and financial outlook for fiscal '24. Nick? Nicholas Gangestad : Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. Although my family and I are excited about what comes next in retirement, my continued focus is on delivering our plans for this year and ensuring a smooth, seamless transition to a new CFO. I I'll start on Slide 7, second quarter key financial information. Second quarter reported sales were down 6.6% compared to last year. Q2 organic sales were down 8.1%, and acquisitions contributed 140 basis points to total growth. Currency translation increased sales by 10 basis points and about 150 basis points of our organic growth came from price, in line with our projections. Segment operating margin was 19% compared to 21.3% a year ago. This 230 basis point decrease reflects lower sales volume, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. Adjusted EPS of $2.50 was higher than expectations. Given our lowered outlook for fiscal '24, we did not accrue any bonus expense in Q2, and we reversed the prior quarter bonus accrual. This resulted in a total adjusted EPS benefit of approximately $0.30 in the quarter. Even without the bonus impact, our Q2 adjusted EPS was ahead of our expectation due to better-than-expected conversion of incoming orders into sales. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide.  Adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter was 14.8% below the prior year rate. Free cash flow was $69 million compared to $156 million in the prior year. Our lower year-over-year free cash flow generation in the quarter was driven by lower pretax income and higher tax payments, partially offset by decreases in working capital. The increased tax payments relate to our gain on our sale of PTC shares in fiscal year '23 and our payments on the 2018 TCJA transition tax. One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased approximately 700,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $195 million.  On March 31, $600 million remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 8 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our 3 operating segments. Intelligent Devices margin decreased to 16.5% compared to 20.2% a year ago. The decrease from the prior year was driven by lower sales volume and unfavorable mix, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. Higher sequential margin was driven by better volume and lower incentive compensation, partially offset by mix. Software & Control margin of 25.7% decreased from 33.6% last year. The lower margin was driven by lower sales volume, partially offset by lower incentive compensation, positive price cost and favorable mix, driven by higher software sales. Higher sequential margin was driven by lower incentive compensation, partially offset by lower volume. Lifecycle Services margin of 16.6% tripled from a year ago margin of 5.5%. The margin performance was driven by lower incentive compensation, higher sales and higher margins in Sensia. Higher sequential margin was driven by volume, lower incentive compensation and ongoing improvements in productivity. Lifecycle Services book-to-bill was 1.07, indicating continued strength in underlying demand. The next Slide 9 provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q2 fiscal '23 to Q2 fiscal '24. Core performance was down $1.15 on an 8% organic sales decline. The EPS decline was driven by lower volume and unfavorable mix and was partially offset by positive price/cost. Incentive compensation was a $0.55 tailwind. This year-over-year improvement reflects no projected bonus payout this year versus an above-target payout last year. The dilution impact from acquisitions was neutral due to better-than-expected profitability in Clearpath and Verve. The year-over-year impact from tax was a $0.10 tailwind. Let's now move on to the next Slide 10, guidance for fiscal '24. We are lowering our guidance for fiscal '24. We now expect reported sales to decline in the range of negative 6% to negative 4% and organic sales to decline in the range of negative 8% to negative 6%. As Blake mentioned earlier, we continue to expect acquisitions to add 150 basis points to growth. We now expect currency to contribute about 50 basis points to growth as we are seeing continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We continue to expect price to be a positive contributor to growth for the year. We expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17%. We are lowering our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $10 to $11. We now expect full year fiscal '24 free cash flow conversion of about 80% of adjusted income. The lowered expectations for free cash flow conversion is driven by the fact that the positive earnings impact from 0 incentive compensation recorded this fiscal year does not result in better cash generation this year. This is because the payout of any annual incentive compensation occurs in the first quarter of the following fiscal year. Therefore, we will see the benefit of this on our cash flow conversion in fiscal year '25. From an inventory standpoint, we continue to expect that inventory days on hand will drop by -- drop to 125 days by the end of fiscal year '24 compared to the 140 days of inventory we had at the end of fiscal year '23. From a calendarization perspective, we expect mid-single-digit sequential order growth in Q3 and high teens sequential order growth in Q4. We expect Q3 sales dollars and segment margin to be lower than Q2 levels. Now that we have largely cleared our product backlog, we are generating most of our product sales from new orders in the quarter, which are ramping up slower than we expected. We expect Q4 to be the highest revenue dollar and margin quarter of the year. From a sequential margin perspective, we expect margins in Q3 to be about 250 basis points lower than in Q2 due to the non-repeat of the bonus accrual reversal that benefited Q2, also lower volume and mix. By segment, we expect our Q3 margins to be up slightly in Intelligent Devices, down significantly in Software & Control due to lower Logix controller sales and flat in Lifecycle Services. As Blake mentioned, we are adjusting our spending level with the lower outlook for this fiscal year. Last quarter, we expected our full year '24 investment spending to increase by $60 million year-over-year or to be up about 2%. We now expect our full year spend to be down approximately $50 million versus prior year. This roughly $100 million spend reduction in the second half of fiscal '24 is driven by a combination of structural and temporary cost out actions, which will help protect our margins in the current fiscal year and will set the right foundation for fiscal year '25 and beyond. Some examples of temporary cost reductions items include not filling open positions, reducing contractor spend and further reducing our travel and marketing spend for the year.  In terms of structural actions, we are expecting about $60 million of restructuring charges related to head count reductions in the second half of the fiscal year. The expected restructuring charges are excluded from our adjusted EPS. These savings and our continued cost structure optimization are aligned with our longer-term productivity focus and profitability targets. A few additional comments on fiscal '24 guidance. Corporate and other expense is now expected to be around $130 million. We're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 114.3 million shares. We expect to deploy between $600 million and $800 million to share repurchases during the year. This is an increase from our prior range of $300 million to $500 million and reflects a higher near-term prioritization of returning cash to shareholders versus acquisitions. Net interest expense for fiscal '24 is now expected to be about $135 million. With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Blake Moret : Thanks, Nick. We are focused on getting synergies and efficiencies throughout the entire organization. The portfolio of capabilities that we have built and bought is second to none and now is the time to knit all these pieces together. This will help us drive more customer value, efficiency and cost savings, which in turn will yield higher margins and funds for reinvestment.  Aijana will now begin the Q&A session. Aijana Zellner : Thanks, Blake. We would like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Julianne, let's take our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : Nick, congrats, and thanks for all your help. So Blake or Nick, could you give us more color into what's now embedded in terms of order trajectory in your $10 to $11 of guidance? Have you seen continued positive improvement in orders here to start Q3 because obviously, you still need a pretty big order step-up especially in Q4, as you said, given your guidance. And it's been difficult to tell for you, I think, how much excess inventory has been out there, especially with machine builders. So what are you doing to try and get better visibility into when they may bottom with their inventory and ultimately, you won't have to lower EPS again? Blake Moret : Sure. Andy, I'll start, and then Nick may have some additional comments. We're expecting mid-single digits sequential growth in Q3 on orders. This is after low double-digit sequential order growth that we saw in Q2. And then we expect high teens sequential orders growth in Q4. And that's based on our analysis of the levels of existing inventory in distribution as well as in the machine builders. For distribution, we expect that largely to clear by the end of the third quarter in most regions. China is probably an outlier that goes a little bit longer, but we're tracking those inventory levels and that's consistent with the direct feedback from those distributors. As we go out to the OEMs and have specific discussions with the largest OEMs, particularly in Europe and in North America, we're expecting that inventory to be largely cleared at the machine builders in Q4. This is imperfect because we have some of those machine builders that are buying direct from us, and then we have a lot better going through distribution. So that's still evolving. But we have much better view today than we did at the beginning of the year, and that's the primary reason for the reduced guidance for the year. Nicholas Gangestad : Andy, one thing I'll just add on that. What we've seen in April orders is completely consistent with that. Our guide of an expectation of order growth of 5% sequential order growth. Andrew Kaplowitz : Helpful, guys. And then, Blake, maybe just trying to step back and separate out the channel noise you've been seeing from the CapEx weakness you mentioned, for instance, in food and beverage. I know you mentioned you will achieve the long-term targets you said in November, but could you talk about your conviction at this point that Rock can resume that sort of 5% to 8% organic growth trajectory, ex acquisitions, sooner versus later. Can you give more color into the market share gains you mentioned North America, and which core end markets would you think would drive that back to that improved growth? Blake Moret : Sure. So we are confident that those growth ranges are reasonable as we look through the cycle. It's based on our offering. It's based on the higher growth that we see in North America, which, of course, is our home market, where most of our sales are, and it's our portfolio that we've built that's winning today in the market. So we see that through the individual projects that are competitive, the growing impact of mega projects. I and my team are directly involved with versus our toughest competitors around the world with a good win rate of those projects.  We also see in the industries, the win rates looking good. And when I talk about market share gains, obviously, Logix controllers is one of the key areas, and we do see those gains, both when we look at the U.S. and when we look around the world in terms of the reports on that important product line, and there's some other areas as well, motor control centers, for instance, as we get those reports for our offering in North America, but also with the new Cubic offering, which is a space that was virtually unserved by us previously. And then with the autonomous mobile robots, you heard several examples of those wins in the production logistics space from our Clearpath acquisition, that's already a $5 billion or $6 billion market growing much faster than the general automation market. And so that gives us a lot of confidence with these new sources of value as well as the products that make up the majority of our business, we're confident about these long-term targets. And again, it's not just about the above-market growth. I think you've heard the tone on this call and in the last few months, putting that together with the margin expansion is absolutely fundamental to our plans going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Nick, enjoy your retirement. So I'm just wondering if maybe you can get a bit more color on the kind of the third quarter color you provided. So the -- I mean I'm backing into an EPS close to the $2 per share for the third quarter. So I just want to make sure that aligns with your model. And then in terms of the order rates that you're pointing to mid-single-digit percentage increase sequentially, is that sort of back into like a $2 billion order number? Just trying to get a bit more quantification there, that would be great. Nicholas Gangestad : Yes. Nigel, in terms of what you're backing into from an order rate in Q3, that's complete -- that's consistent with how we're seeing this, too. In terms of EPS, the one nuance I will point out from a quarterization on our tax rate, we expect our Q3 tax rate to be lower than the average and our Q4 tax rate to be higher than the average. That's just based on discrete items that are expected in the second half of the year and the timing. That's the only other nuance I'd say on this. But otherwise, I'd say your modeling is matching pretty closely what we're estimating. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's helpful. And then on the cost savings, just on the $100 million of cost savings in the second half of this year, just want to make sure that, that doesn't include any of the bonus accrual reversals or the investment spending pullback. That's all sort of additional cost savings. It feels like it's mainly temporary costs in the back half of this year and then we have more structural costs coming in, in 2025. Is that the right way to think about it? Blake Moret : Let me start with some general comments, and then Nick can add some detail to that. The $100 million of savings that I mentioned for the second half of the year is totally separate from anything with the incentive comp. So that's additional savings that's totally separate from that. Embedded in that is a reduction in force of approximately 3%. So those are not temporary savings and that will provide additional incremental benefit into next year. There's also some of the temporary actions that Nick talked about, but there's a meaningful reduction in force that's structural and is the front end of the additional structural actions that I alluded to, and that we'll provide more detail on the next call. Nicholas Gangestad : And Nigel, part of what we were talking about there is the $100 million we're expecting in the second half of this year. Those actions, we expect to have a tail into fiscal year '25 of an additional $120 million. So -- and I'm saying that in reference to your comment about temporary, some of it is temporary, but the majority of it is sustainable and carried makes that tailwind impact benefit into fiscal year '25. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Wish you all the best, Nick. Thank you for the help. Just maybe circling back on the sort of EPS walk. So you've got that very helpful, Slide 11, for example. But if I think about sort of 3 big buckets of costs you've talked about this morning, you've got incentive compensation, you've got investment spend, and you've got these fixed cost reductions relating to head count cuts. So it looks like for 2024, you've got about a $2 EPS tailwind year-on-year from incentive comp and investment spend combined. Is the right way to think about it that a lot of that reverses in 2025? And then on the other hand, you've got these savings that may be are worth about $1 of EPS from head count cuts in 2025. Just trying to understand of the incentive comp and investment spend, kind of how does that reverse in a substantial way kind of in the following year naturally? Nicholas Gangestad : A couple of points, Julian. First of all, we certainly intend that the incentive compensation does reverse in fiscal year '25. But the productivity actions that we're doing with the structural cost savings, we do not expect the majority of that investment spend that I noted on that slide to reverse. And that's why we're talking about the $120 million of carryforward benefit into fiscal year '25. So 2 different answers. The incentive comp absolutely does reverse, but investment spend does not. And again, investment spend in total for next year will be dependent on the opportunities we're seeing. We haven't set what that number is. But the benefits of what we're doing here, we are confident that will create this $120 million tailwind benefit into next year? Blake Moret : Yes. Just at a high level, the actions that we're taking now with their benefit this year and then the incremental benefit next year, when you add that to the more structural actions that we're beginning a more comprehensive program that I mentioned, we expect that to more than offset the headwinds from returned incentive comp investment and so on as we go into fiscal year '25. Julian Mitchell : That's really helpful. And then just my follow-up would be trying to circle back to that point on sort of your revenues and your inventories and your customer inventory. So it sounds like you have this Q3 sales dip, I think, sequentially, Nick, you'd mentioned. Maybe help us understand why that's happening if orders are up sequentially in the second quarter finished and the third quarter that we're in now. And your own inventories on your balance sheet have been stuck at sort of the same dollar number for a year now. How are you so sure that your customers' inventories are coming down when your own are very stable? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes. So as of the end of the second quarter, Julian, our product backlog is essentially back to normal. We've had good success working through with our supply chain, and we've brought our backlog back to normal. So going forward, our -- we expect to be operating what we were like pre pandemic, where orders in a particular quarter are very much like what our sales are in a particular quarter. In our second quarter, we were still benefiting from drawing down some of that backlog. We brought down our backlog in high single digits in the second quarter. And that's why our sales in second quarter were higher than our orders. That phenomenon will end going into the second half of the year. And that's why even though we expect orders to be up sequentially, we expect revenue to be down sequentially. Operator : Our next question comes from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : Maybe talk about some of the choices you're making around where to reduce investments in the business. I would love any color. You made a lot of acquisitions. I'm not sure if it's related to that. Maybe you can talk about it if possible on the segment level or by protocol? Blake Moret : Sure. No, I'll make some comments, and Nick may have some additional ones. Most of the reduction in force that we're looking at is affecting SG&A and that does include sales and marketing and headquarter functions. I think as we look at guiding principles, we're directing the spend to the highest value activities that's both geographically and from a product portfolio standpoint going through and taking a look at what is generating the best returns in those areas. We're also integrating recent acquisitions with existing Rockwell resources and looking for the cost synergies there. So we're getting good performance out of our acquisitions. And as we look at ways to get the efficiencies and as I said, knit together what we've built and bought, the actions we're taking are consistent with that. And then there's opportunities, as always, for back-office efficiencies by leveraging technology. And we see that in SG&A. We see it in our development activities as well. There is some reductions in cost of sales, including some in manufacturing operations, as we're tuning our capacity to match what we're expecting near term in terms of output. And that's product-specific, right? Some of our lines are growing very well year-over-year, and they're expected to continue. Others as we've gotten back to full safety stock, we can tune that to reduce some of the variances in those operations. So that's the current list of actions that we're doing. As we look at the more comprehensive program, we'll be focusing on areas like sourcing is a big opportunity for us with the spend of direct material and other items. And then there's also additional opportunities for manufacturing efficiencies as we look at our portfolio and the wide range of SKUs that we offer. Nick? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes. The one piece I'd add to that. Many of these costs are in organizations or functions that support multiple of our reporting segments. Given the way we allocate these costs across segments, Intelligent Devices and Software & Control will see the greatest impact from these actions that we're doing. Noah Kaye : Right. Makes sense. And then very helpful on the walk sequentially on orders and your commentary around margins for 3Q, that does seem to imply. Again, we're doing math here on the fly, a pretty big step-up sequentially in margin for 4Q. I'm getting to something like 6 points here. Maybe just talk to the margin math around how you see exiting the year and what, apart from the cost reductions you've announced, would help that step up? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes. So there's a few things impacting our margin progression as we go through the second half of the year. And you are correct, and we expect Q4 to be, by far, our highest margin quarter of the 4 quarters. We -- the biggest contributor to that is going to be volume that is positively impacting the margin, particularly in Software & Control. That's followed by the structural and temporary cost savings that we're doing. And then the third is we will be having a more favorable mix of revenue that will be benefiting margins. So it's volume is the largest and then followed by the cost savings and then the mix, all contributing to that sequential improvement in margin in Q4. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : When you talk about these investments, what's the trend on R&D this year relative to last year as a percentage of sales or on an absolute basis? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes. Steve, R&D as a percent of revenue is going to be pretty consistent at 6% of revenue. As a percent of revenue, it's not really changing from last year. C. Stephen Tusa : Okay. And then I guess just more philosophically, thinking about the story, and I know you guys have talked about your business being more of an intellectual property business over time, certainly a part of the story at least. And I just -- what I struggle with a little bit higher level is whipping bonus accruals around basically altering investments based on near-term sales. I guess, that just seems juxtaposed with kind of an IP-type business. How do we have confidence that you're not rocking the boat with a lot of that core, where the technology comes from, that would be kind of my biggest concern longer term. How are you guys managing that? Blake Moret : Yes. Steve, this is Blake. As Nick said, our development expense remains at 6%. We continue to invest robustly in areas, like new product introduction, which is actually increasing over the last few years in terms of what we're delivering to the market, both in terms of the hardware products as well as new software as well. And so I think it would be incorrect to talk about whiplashing that piece of it. We're looking for efficiencies that are taking cost out that had built up over the last few years of volatility as we've gone from pandemic to supply chain shortages and making sure that we're tuned for growth going forward with that. The incentive comp philosophy hasn't changed there and that we operate in a pay-for-performance culture. We had great payouts last year because we performed really well with high teens top line growth and even better EPS. This is a year that is below expectations, and we're not paying a bonus, but it's going to come back, and that's the way we've operated for as long as I've been in the business. So in no way it implies some sort of short-term activity to manage results at the expense of the long-term value that we continue to provide. C. Stephen Tusa : And then just one last one on the 3Q to the 4Q. I know that the second half of this year was dependent on obviously the sales being there. I mean, how dependent are we from -- going from the 2-ish to 4 from 3Q to 4Q on sales actually being there? Is it the same kind of dynamic as we've been seeing -- we're seeing in 3Q, similar to the comments you made last quarter. Nicholas Gangestad : Steve, the sales dynamic is the single biggest contributor to the increase in EPS from Q3 to Q4. Second -- followed second by on a smaller scale to cost actions. The total cost actions that we're projecting in the second half of the year, we expect about 1/3 of that to be impacting Q3 and about 2/3 of that to be impacting Q4. So there -- that is part of it, but it's still a smaller number compared to the reliance on revenue growth occurring in fourth quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob Mason from Baird. Robert Mason : I wanted to see if you could provide a little more color around the step-up in orders that you're expecting -- sequential up in orders that you're expecting in the fourth quarter? I know you mentioned distributor channel inventories normalizing at that point. But is that the entirety of the high teens growth? Or are you expecting some shift in -- more positive shift in demand as well? Blake Moret : There's a few elements of what informs that guidance, Rob. But the first is a significant reduction in packaging machine builder inventory. So within the OEM inventory, packaging machinery has been particularly affected by that. And the feedback we're receiving from the conversations directly with them indicates that, that reduces significantly as we go through the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. The distributor inventory actually is expected to clear again in regions outside of China before that. And so those 2 factors are an important part of it. We also see the normal seasonality in our engineered-to-order and Lifecycle Services shipments. There's always a higher shipment amount at the end of the year there, and that would include Sensia as well.  And then we see the growing impact of mega projects. And we do have a line of sight to some of those projects that are expected to come in with ordering and shipments beginning in the fourth quarter. We're seeing some of that now. Think of that as kind of a drumbeat that increases through the year and again into next year. Robert Mason : Should we think about the fourth quarter order level as a solid jumping off point as we go into 2025 now, absent the engineered-to-order, normal seasonality there? Blake Moret : Yes. I mean in this volatility that we've been operating in, in the last 4 years, I'm going to reserve a view. But I think we're setting up the foundation so that we have an attractive cost base regardless of what orders do next year. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : Nick, I wish you the best in retirement and then we're back and forth. Yes, so maybe -- can I just maybe just start on that last comment on mega project spending specifically. I'm trying to square the comments around EVs earlier and some pushouts. And if I think about where we're seeing the biggest kind of like expectation for mega project pickup would probably be in semi-fab CapEx? And then also on the like EV/battery plants. And so Help me just kind of square the comments on EV pushing out and where you're actually starting to see some kind of some good green shoots on the mega project side. Blake Moret : Yes. So I mentioned that we're seeing some push out on EV, but we are not seeing cancellations in those projects. And it doesn't mean that they've all gone away. EV is still about 1/3 -- a little bit more than 1/3 of our total automotive business. So there's still some of those projects -- EV projects that we're winning and getting business for now. If we look at some of the other areas of mega projects, the facilities management and control systems or semiconductor fabs. We've got great capabilities there and are playing a major role in a lot of the fabs that have been announced and are currently under construction in the U.S., but around the world, that's been a good business for us in Asia for over a decade. So it's not a new application for us. Renewables is another area that we're seeing a good investment playing in solar. We are  seeing meaningful business in solar as well as wind, particularly with our Cubic acquisition. And then another area that is, we think, has bottomed, and we're seeing an impressive funnel building is in the area of warehouse automation and really the overall space of production logistics. And again, I'll go back to the capabilities that we have that's somewhat unique with AMRs, the mobile robots, combined with the fixed automation that we've always had, we're tracking some major projects there, and we've had some wins, and I talked about some of them on the call.  But to give you an example about how those are playing out. There are a couple of customers that we've talked to in the last couple of months that have come off of discussions with labor and have made it clear that they want to complement their people with technology to a greater extent over the next few years. And those have resulted in multimillion dollar wins for Rockwell as a result of moving more aggressively and to adding technology to complement their scarce resources. And so those are the kinds of examples of mega projects that are starting to come in. Joseph Ritchie : That's super helpful, Blake. And then -- and if I can maybe just make sure that I've got it totally squared for next year on the buckets of cost savings. So you mentioned $120 million for next year. We're going to get something more on the structural side. And then incentive comp goes to 0 this year. And so in a normal year, that would be like roughly basically about $120 million, $130 million headwind in a normal year. So is that just baselining it? Is that the right way to think about it? Nicholas Gangestad : Joe, you got it all right, except for the last one, our normal bonus expenses in the $160 million to $170 million range. Aijana Zellner : Julianne, we'll take one more question. Operator : Certainly. Our last question will come from Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Joseph O'Dea: Blake, when you talk about packaging, delivering better order activity from Q3 to Q4, just want to level set on to what  --  how that kind of sizes overall for the business. And so you're talking food and beverage and household and personal care, and we should be thinking about 25% of revenue that would be seeing that pick up? Blake Moret : Yes. Actually -- so if you think about those verticals and that's about the size of the overall verticals there, about 60% of our business in consumer packaged goods covered mainly by those 2 verticals is the OEMs, the machine builders. So that's the way you can kind of do the calculus of how much of that business has been suppressed by the higher inventory levels, and we're expecting that to be dissipating over the coming quarters. Joseph O'Dea: Got it. And then the bridge on sort of prior guide to revised guide and the core piece in the $3.75 sort of EPS impact on core, it looks like that could be something like a 60% to 70% decremental. And if that's the case, and we think about the flip side, do you think about sort of a reversal of these headwinds is translating to better incrementals than what you would traditionally think about sort of through a cycle, absent some of the temporary structural cost actions that are underway? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes. When you strip out things like incentive compensation and what we're showing there from investment spend because those things would normally be part of what we talk about in terms of our incrementals and decrementals, but we stripped out those 2 details to give you more detail of the underlying moving parts in there. But there are many parts of our portfolio where incrementals and decrementals like that in that 60% range are certainly normal. They're normally offset by some degree of incentive compensation or investment spend though. Blake Moret : Yes. I think -- but directionally, I think you're right in that Logix, we've seen the biggest correction based on the really tough comps with the huge growth from last year. And as that comes back in, that hardware does have high incrementals and high decrementals. We've put a lot around it with annual recurring revenue and so on, which does help us and continues to grow. But there's no getting around that Logix is very profitable. We have high incrementals and high decrementals there. Aijana Zellner : Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. That concludes today's conference call. Operator : At this time, you may now disconnect. Thank you.",

Later in the call, we will open up the lines for questions. [Operator Instruction] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Aijana Zellner, Head of Investor Relations and Market Strategy. Ms. Zellner, please go ahead. Aijana Zellner : Thank you, Julianne. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's third quarter fiscal 2024 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include, and our call today will reference, non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings. And with that, I'll hand it over to Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks, Aijana. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before we turn to our third quarter results, I'll make some initial comments. As we saw in Q2, operational performance continued to be strong in our third quarter, but order growth continued to ramp at a slower than expected pace. Our accelerated actions to bring costs in line with the lower outlook on current year orders contributed to the strong margin performance in the quarter, and we are well into the more comprehensive program to expand margins introduced during our Investor Day last November. We continue to expect savings of $100 million in the second half of this year from accelerated actions taken this fiscal year, which will create a good starting point for fiscal year 2025. Based on actions taken in the last 12 months, our worldwide headcount is down 6% since Q2, and most others who will be affected have been notified. We will see incremental savings of $120 million next year from these actions alone, plus a larger amount of additional savings from the more comprehensive program, as I'll discuss in a few minutes. We've announced our new CFO, Christian Roth, who starts in two weeks and is excited to begin. Christian brings a successful track record and will work with me and the rest of the team to combine market-beating growth and financial performance in a consistent longer-term model based on the targets introduced last November to create significant share owner value. Turning to specific results in the quarter, Q3 orders were up low single digits, both year-over-year and sequentially, with growth across all regions. However, while our distributors and machine builders are making progress on working down their excess inventory, their orders to us came in lower than expected in the quarter due to weaker end user demand. As a result, we are projecting a more gradual sequential order growth in Q4 and into fiscal year 2025 than we had previously expected. We had another quarter of strong execution with sales, margins, and EPS, all exceeding our expectations. Total and organic sales were down 8.4% versus prior year. Organic sales came in better than we expected, with strong backlog execution in our longer cycle businesses, including lifecycle services and the configured to order products in Intelligent Devices. Organic sales in our Intelligent Devices segment were down by about a point versus prior year. We continue to see a solid pipeline of projects across all product lines, including good opportunities involving Clearpath's auto mobile robots and cubic data center solutions. In software and control, organic sales declined over 31% year-over-year compared to 24% growth in Q3 of last year. Sales in this segment were still better than expected, driven by better Logix recovery as machine builders reduced their inventory. We also saw good growth in our software business, including both on-prem and cloud-native offerings. For example, in the quarter, we had over 150 new logos for a recently launched FactoryTalk optics portfolio. This reinforces the importance of continued investment in innovation and new product introduction as we continue to redeploy and prioritize our spend towards areas of highest growth and strategic importance. We've talked a lot about cost savings during this challenging year, but we're taking great care to preserve the investments that will enable us to continue to grow share. Lifecycle services had another strong quarter, with organic sales up over 11% year-over-year, driven by continued relative strength in process end markets and strong execution of our project backlog. Book-to-bill in this segment was 1.0. We did see some additional project delays, especially affecting our solutions orders. Some manufacturing customers are taking a pause in making large capacity investments as they deal with slower consumer demand, high interest rates, and policy uncertainty around tax tariffs and stimulus incentives. Even so, our customers are still investing in their operational resilience, reflected by continued double-digit sales growth of our recurring managed services. Total ARR for the company was up a strong 17% this quarter. Segment margin of 20.8% and adjusted EPS of $2.71 were well above our expectations. We're making good progress on driving productivity across the enterprise and we are seeing the benefits of these actions with over $40 million of savings in Q3 alone. Turning to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q3 industry segment performance. Last quarter we talked about some project delays and end user CapEx slowdown in parts of our business, namely automotive and food and beverage. We saw project delays across a broader group of industries this quarter, which will impact our end market performance through the end of the fiscal year. Sales in our discrete industries were down high single digits versus prior year, with declines in auto and semi being partially offset by year-over-year growth in warehouse automation. Within discrete, automotive sales declined high teens versus prior year. Brand owners are delaying more EV programs as they continue to reassess their product strategy in light of slower consumer adoption and policy uncertainty in the U.S. Semiconductor sales were down high teens. We continue to see delays in new capacity builds and the associated tooling, due in part to questions about the timing and certainty of CHIPS funding disbursements. E-commerce and warehouse automation sales grew high teens versus prior year, led by strong double-digit growth in North America. We continue to see a broad-based recovery at our end-user and machine builder customer segments. Moving to hybrid, sales in this industry segment were down mid-teens, driven by year-over-year declines in food and beverage and Life Sciences. Food and beverage sales decreased mid-teens in the quarter. Producers in certain segments of the food and beverage market, like baking and snacks, are seeing inflationary headwinds as consumers shift from high-end brands to more affordable labels. We're seeing less greenfield activity, but we do continue to see high demand for software and services that optimize processes to increase efficiency. Life Sciences sales were down high teens. Similar to food and beverage, customers and Life Sciences are prioritizing investments in their operational resilience and infrastructure. In the quarter, we had important wins with two leading pharmaceutical companies. The Life Sciences of Merck in Darmstadt, Germany, which operates in the U.S. and Canada as Millipore Sigma, selected Rockwell to assess the company's current plant infrastructure and help enhance the digital connectivity and cybersecurity resilience of operational assets. Another important Q3 win in Life Sciences was with AstraZeneca. Together with our partner, Claroty, we're helping the customer identify and monitor plan assets, detect threats, and integrate internal services and systems to provide a comprehensive global cyber platform for all of their OT environments. Process sales were mixed across the individual vertical markets. Overall, sales were about flat year-over-year with growth in oil and gas and mining offset by declines in chemicals and metals. Oil and gas sales grew low single digits this quarter. Within this segment, our Sensia JV sales grew double digits versus prior year with good growth in process automation and digital solutions offerings. And while we continue to win business in the energy transition space, we did see some North America project push outs tied to customers wanting to understand potential policy changes that may occur after the U.S. elections in November. In mining, our sales increased high single digits versus prior year. Our growth in the quarter was driven by continued double digit growth in Latin America. Here, Rockwell was chosen to integrate an end-to-end solution for Vale's new processing plant. As this customer looks to increase production capacity, reduce water consumption, and enhance cybersecurity infrastructure. This is a great example of how Rockwell brings our hardware, software, and services together to deliver differentiated value for our end users. Let's turn to Slide 5 and our Q3 organic regional sales. The Americas continue to outperform the rest of the world with North America sales flat year-over-year in the quarter and Latin America sales up almost 19%. EMEA sales were down 28% with continued macroeconomic challenges across Germany, Italy and France, impacting end user demand. Despite these headwinds, we continue to make progress with our European machine builders to gain share in the end user market. In the quarter, IMA Group, an Italian-based leader in designing and developing packaging machines, has sold over a dozen machines equipped with our Rockwell platform. By recognizing the technical advantage of our motion control capabilities, coupled with the time to market provided by our integrated architecture solution, their end user, who's based in Germany, is now looking to adopt Rockwell as its preferred choice in all future commissions. Asia Pacific sales declined 22%. In addition to continued inventory de-stocking and economic challenges in China, we saw incremental headwinds from EV battery project delays in Korea this quarter. Moving to Slide 6 for a fiscal 2024 outlook. While our orders are improving sequentially, they're progressing at a more gradual pace than we anticipated. We believe this is largely tied to a pause in new capacity investments as manufacturers focus on cost control and operational efficiency, waiting for a potential reduction in interest rates and broader U.S. policy changes. Therefore, we're reducing our fiscal year 2024 guidance to reflect this gradual pace of orders growth. Taking into account our order progression through early August, we now expect Q4 orders to be up low single digits sequentially. With that, we expect our organic sales to decline 10% for the year. We continue to expect acquisitions to contribute about a point and a half of growth, and we expect currency to be about neutral for the year. Total ARR is expected to grow about 15% and will exceed 10% of total Rockwell sales this year. We now expect our segment margin to be slightly over 19% for the year. While this represents about a 200 basis point decrease versus last year. It also shows the improving resilience of our business model. Adjusted EPS is slated to decline 21% versus prior year. We expect free cash flow conversion of 60%. Nick will cover this in more detail in his section. Before I turn the call over to Nick, I'd like to spend a few moments on Slide 7 to discuss the progress we're making in setting the foundation for long-term productivity and margin expansion. We already talked about the accelerated actions we're taking in the second half of this fiscal year to drive efficiency and scale across our entire company, and we remain committed to delivering $100 million of savings this year and $120 million of incremental savings in fiscal year 2025, mainly targeted at reducing our SG&A spend. We will continue to optimize our general and administrative spend through a targeted approach, although the majority of additional productivity and margin expansion will be realized as a result of reductions in our cost of sales. As you can see from this chart, we expect to save another $130 million in fiscal year 2025 through additional margin expansion and productivity projects bring our total fiscal year 2025 year-over-year savings to roughly $250 million. You can see the broad list of actions and programs that are underway to realize these targets. These productivity projects include savings in the areas of product cost, indirect material, purchase services, logistics, manufacturing workflow, make or buy decisions, portfolio optimization through SKU reduction, and price. We look forward to our new CFO, Christian Roth's additional perspective as we maximize the effectiveness of this program in fiscal year 2025 and preserve it as a foundational part of our operating model going forward, regardless of the top-line growth in any particular year. Let me now turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q3 performance and financial outlook for fiscal 2024. Nick? Nick Gangestad : Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 8, third quarter key financial information. Third quarter reported and organic sales were down 8.4% compared to last year. Acquisitions contributed 60 basis points to total growth. Currency translation decreased sales by 60 basis points. About 350 basis points of organic growth came from price this quarter. Segment operating margin was 20.8% compared to 21.1% a year ago. Margin performance in the quarter reflects lower sales volume and an unfavorable mix, largely offset by positive price cost, lower incentive compensation, and the benefits from cost reduction actions we announced on our last earnings call. Adjusted EPS of $2.71 was higher than expectations, driven by better revenue, mix, and savings from our cost actions. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter was 13.3%, benefiting from discrete tax items and below the prior year rate. Free cash flow was $238 million compared to $240 million in the prior year. Our lower year-over-year free cash flow generation in the quarter was driven by lower pretax income, but was mostly offset by lower working capital, which improved for the second consecutive quarter, but at a slower rate than anticipated. One additional item not shown on the slide. We repurchased approximately 600,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $160 million. On June 30th, $500 million remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. Intelligent Devices margin increased to 20.2% compared to 16.8% a year ago. The increase from the prior year was driven by positive price cost, lower incentive compensation, and our cost reduction actions, partially offset by lower sales volume. Software and control margin of 23.6% decreased from 34.8% last year. The lower margin was driven by lower sales volume, partially offset by positive price cost, lower incentive compensation, and our cost reduction actions. As Blake mentioned earlier, software and control margin exceeded our expectations this quarter with better performance in Logix sales. Lifecycle Services margin of 19.3% more than doubled from the year ago margin of 9.3%. The margin performance was driven by lower incentive compensation, higher sales, continued strong project execution, and ongoing savings from the prior year structural actions. Lifecycle Services book-to-bill was 1.0. The next, Slide 10 provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q3 fiscal 2023 to Q3 fiscal 2024. Core performance was down $0.80 on an 8.4% organic sales decline. The EPS decline was driven by lower volume and unfavorable mix and was partially offset by positive price cost. Cost reduction actions contributed 30 cents to the year-over-year increase. Incentive compensation was a 40-cent tailwind. This year-over-year increase reflects no projected bonus payout this year versus an above-target payout last year. The dilution impact from acquisitions was $0.10, and currency was a $0.15 headwind. Share count, interest expense, and tax were a combined $0.05 cent tailwind. Let's now move on to the next Slide, 11, guidance for fiscal 2024. We are lowering our guidance for fiscal 2024. We now expect reported sales to decline by about 8.5% and organic sales to decline 10%. As Blake mentioned earlier, we continue to expect acquisitions to add 150 basis points to growth. And we now expect currency to be neutral for the year on continued strength in the U.S. dollar. We continue to expect price to be a positive contributor for the year. We now expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 16%. We are lowering our adjusted EPS guidance to $9.60, down 21% year-over-year. With lower sales, our improvements in inventory days will be delayed, and we now expect to end fiscal year 2024 with 160 days of inventory. As a result, we expect full-year free cash flow conversion of about 60% of adjusted income. Our free cash flow conversion for the year also reflects several non-recurring headwinds, including our second half restructuring actions, the timing of our cash bonus payout, and tax payments for both the TCJA transition tax and our prior year PTC gain. From a top-line perspective, we expect flat sequential sales in Q4 in each of our business segments. Sequentially, we expect margins in Q4 to be about 100 basis points lower than in Q3. By segment, we expect our Q4 margin in Intelligent Devices to decline about 100 basis points, and Lifecycle Services margin to decline about 200 basis points sequentially. In both segments, we expect the decline to be driven by a less favorable mix. We expect margin in software and control to be similar to Q3. A few additional comments on fiscal 2024 guidance. Corporate and other expense is still expected to be around $130 million. We're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 114.5 million shares. We still expect to deploy between $600 million and $800 million to share repurchases during the year. Net interest expense for fiscal 2024 is now expected to be $140 million. Before I pass it on to Blake, I'd like to talk about how actions we're taking this year are going to benefit our results in fiscal 2025 and beyond. As you heard earlier, we expect our productivity and margin expansion actions to provide about $250 million in year-over-year benefit next year. These are expected to offset compensation headwinds next year, which includes merit increases and the reinstatement of incentive compensation. The $250 million in benefits is split about equally between improvements in gross margin and reductions in SG&A. We expect R&D spending next year to remain similar as a percentage of sales as we continue to invest in areas of highest growth. With my upcoming retirement, I'd like to thank Blake for this opportunity and to thank all of you for your engagement over the last several years. Thank you. With that, I'll turn it over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Blake Moret : Thanks, Nick. This will be Nick's last earnings call with us. I'd like to thank him again for his commitment to Rockwell's mission over the last few years. He's working closely with Christian for a smooth transition, and we wish Nick and his family the very best in retirement. Christian will join me in leading the fourth quarter earnings call and Investor Day in November. As always, Investor Day takes place during our Annual Automation Fair. Last year, over 8,500 customers, distributors, partners, and investors joined us in Boston. Registration opens tomorrow for the 2024 event in Anaheim, California, which takes place during the week of November 18. This year, the fair offers an expanded four days of show floor access, showcasing major new hardware, software, and services offerings. Rockwell's technology portfolio, domain expertise, and unmatched ecosystem uniquely position us to help customers in our home market of North America and around the world. We look forward to seeing you in Anaheim in just over three months. Aijana, we will now begin the Q&A session. A - Aijana Zellner : Thanks, Blake. We'd like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Julian, let's take our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead, your line is open. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning, Blake and Nick and Aijana. Congrats, Nick, on your retirement\u2026 Blake Moret : Good morning. Nick Gangestad : Thanks, Scott. Scott Davis : Hope we all keep in touch. But hey, guys, I hate to climb into minutiae, but just to kind of clarify the $250 million a little bit. Normally I think I recall your bonus pool something like $160 million ballpark. So would we think for 2025 something we wanted to model conservatively, would it be $160 million or so incentive comp that comes back and to kind of cut into a little bit of that $250 million or is the number bigger than that? Nick Gangestad : Scott the $250 million is exactly as you said, as a year-over-year benefit from the productivity and cost safe margin actions we're taking. We expect the bonus expense next year if we're delivering to plan to be between $160 million and $170 million. Other things on top of that where I'm saying it's largely being the $250 million in total cost and margin benefits are being largely offset by bonus and other compensation. I'm including our anticipated merit increase for fiscal year 2025 which will round that out to about $250 million when I add in the bonus. Is that clear, Scott? Scott Davis : Yes, that's clear. Thanks, Nick. And then when you guys -- I know you're not issuing your 2025 guidance and we still have a little time here, but when you think about incremental margins, let's just assume we get back to growth in 2025 on the easier comps. Would you expect incremental margins to be a little higher than they have been historically based on some of this kind of SKU rationalization, the other stuff that's on the -- on Slide 7, would that be a fair assumption to make guys? Blake Moret : Scott, we\u2019re -- that's certainly the objective is to increase the conversion on incremental revenue. Last November we talked about 35% and we said that that wasn't going to be dependent on mid-single digit top line growth. So a little bit more aggressive stance there. We'll hold off before talking about exactly what we expect in terms of core conversion, but you can bet that that's on our mind to increase the incremental conversion on revenue. Scott Davis : Okay, fair enough. I'll pass it on. Thank you, guys. Blake Moret : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead, your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks again, Nick. Nick Gangestad : Hey, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Blake, can you give us a little more color into your comment that you expect to see continued order growth sequentially and into next year, despite manufacturers taking a pause in adding capacity. Where does that confidence come from? Do distributors still expect to clear their channels in next quarter or two? How much in incremental orders could the end of de-stocking be versus maybe the $2 billion that you're guiding to for Q4? And how are you thinking about the order and revenue landscape in 2025? Do you think $2 billion is a quarterly trough that Rockwell bounce off of? Blake Moret : Sure. Andy, for a little bit of context, we have talked in the third quarter about expecting mid-single digit sequential order growth. We've seen sequential order growth through the year, and we said, because we were continuing to see the impact of excess inventories at distributors and machine builders that was going to yield mid-single digit order growth. As that kind of merges with some weakening in end markets, that's where we saw the low single digit sequential orders growth in Q3. And we think that that continues. So rather than a one or two quarter sharper bounce back, We think this is going to continue to be a gradual recovery. Inventories are depleting, both at our distributors and our machine builders. But we have seen some weaker conditions in end markets. And I would characterize that in a couple of buckets. You see a couple that are affected by consumer demand, such as automotive, as consumers are going a little slower in a rush to EV. And you also see it in food and beverage and home and personal care. We see consumers, and you've heard this from the brand owners themselves, are going a little bit down brand as they're being more discriminating on what they pay for packaged goods. Then you also see some pressure based on policy uncertainty going forward. I would say semiconductor and questions about the disbursement of CHIPS and Science Act funds are weighing on semi manufacturers and then an energy transition. So in those broad buckets, that tempers our view on the good side, on the tailwind side, as we go into next year, we're going to be lapping some of the quarters that had the most significant -- that were more significantly impacted in this fiscal year by inventory. And there'll certainly be a lot less inventory at distributors and machine builders in Q1 of fiscal year 2025, for instance, than there was in Q1 of fiscal year 2024. Andy Kaplowitz : It's helpful. And, Nick, last quarter you suggested, I think, that two-thirds of your cost out program this year would be in Q4 and one-third in Q3. So it's a little strange to see that you're estimating lower margin in Q4 versus Q3 just based on mix in Intelligent Devices and Lifecycle Services. So maybe just give us a little more color on how the cost program this year is divided between Q3 and Q4. And then the comments on Logix getting better. Do we see Logix continue to get better from here in Q4? Nick Gangestad : Yes, a couple things there, Andy. First of all, the mix between Q3 and Q4 on the $100 million of cost savings that we're expecting, that's shifted a little. I earlier had said one-third, two-thirds, it's now more like 40-60 between Q3 and Q4. We got some good progress in Q3, a little ahead, moving some of those actions earlier. So the differential isn't quite as big between Q3 and Q4 as what we thought three months ago. Now moving into margin and what we're expecting going into Q4 for margin. We had some things noticeably impact our margin better than what we were expecting in Q3. Primarily we guided in Q3 that we expected our -- in our software and control business, we expected a sequential decline of 20%, which would have -- what we said on our last call is that, we thought that would bring our margins in software and control down to the mid-teens. With the strength in the Logix, orders and sales that we saw in Q3, that did not materialize to that level. It ended up, rather than software and control being down 20%, it was down 10%. And that extra revenue and the mixed benefit that brings help boost the margins in software and control much higher than what we were estimating. And that's the primary driver of our over performance of margin in Q3. Now into Q4, we will be getting the benefit of these additional cost actions. In software and control, we don't see an additional ramp up happening in Q4 for our Logix sales. We think that'll be very, very similar to what we saw in Q3. In fact, we think what we saw in Q3 is going to be almost a carbon copy into Q4 from a revenue standpoint, from a margin standpoint for software and control. Intelligent Devices and Lifecycle Services, we expect for both of those a sequential decline. We had some -- both of those businesses had some favorable mix. Driven by, in Q3, we see some of that mix reversing into Q4. And in Lifecycle services, it's part of our customer and project mix that was very beneficial to us in Q3. We think that'll abate some in Q4 and why we see margins going down a couple hundred basis points sequentially. Still part of a more than doubling the margin for the full year than what we saw last year. And then Intelligent Devices, we see about 100 basis point drop in margin. That is also driven by some of our product and project mix there. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate all the color. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead, your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Hey, thank you, good morning. Good luck, Nick. Nick Gangestad : Thanks, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Hey. Maybe the term normal is sort of hard to use here at all. But if we look at Q4 revenues flat, I don\u2019t know, maybe up slightly sequentially, my words, you said flat. That looks like kind of a -- sort of a pre-COVID normal pattern. As we all -- the biggest task of us analysts here this morning, right, is to get in front of your 2025 guide and make an educated guess, I think as you well understand. I mean, how would you view this Q4 2025 jumping off point in the context of what has been historically normal? And how should that inform our view of 2025? Blake Moret : Jeff, I'll offer some comments on that. I think to start with, what is largely back to normal is orders and sales of our products kind of coming back right on top of each other. So getting back to historical pre-COVID levels of book-and-bill. When you get an order for a drive or a Logix controller in the quarter, being able to ship it down and recognize the revenue in the same quarter. Back to very high percentage conversion, operational performance is good. Customers are looking for that material in about the same time frame that they were previously. So that's really good news and puts orders and shipments back very similar from quarter-to-quarter in terms of products. As we look at next year, we're going to be lapping some extremely low order rates. And so, beginning with the fourth quarter, as we start thinking about year-over-year rates again, you're going to see some big numbers in the fourth quarter and likely going into next year. And we do see continued investment. We talked about project delays, but we're winning projects as well. We are seeing the impact of higher than traditional levels of investment, despite the uncertainty for North American manufacturing plant. So I think looking at Q4 as a jumping off point is inevitable, but as we said, we expect continued gradual sequential increases into next year and then we'll certainly be given a lot more detail in November. Jeff Sprague : Yes, right. But so putting the order comps aside, right, if book-and-bill are kind of linked up and they're still channel inventory, we should have some quarters for the year of your order comps look good, but kind of sequential revenue patterns don't sound like we should expect anything too unusual. And perhaps there's even, I don't know, some risk if the economy ends up getting weaker here than we anticipate. Blake Moret : There's certainly risk with that, Jeff, but there's also the amount of business that we didn't ship in the beginning of the year because there was inventory sitting at distributors and that was a meaningful number throughout the year and it's far less as we move into next year. So you get some tailwind from that. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thank you very much. Blake Moret : Yep. Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead, your line is open. David Ridley-Lane: Thank you. This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew. On that point about de-stocking, it sounds as though you are mainly done with it in North America. How's the visibility for regions outside of there? Blake Moret : Yes, so our visibility into distributor stock is very clear for the distributors on our DMI program, which is 100% of the distributors in North America. And it's not all the way gone, but the vast majority of it has dissipated there. We see continuing stubborn inventory in China, and we'll call that out, and that's going to take a little while to get to the bottom of that, because if you think about it, what paces those inventory levels has a lot to do with the end market demand. And so, if that is weaker, then it's going to take longer to burn through that stock sitting on distributor shelves. But we have very clear visibility in the US where the vast majority of our business goes through distribution. I painted the picture in China and then we have a higher amount of direct business with machine builders in Europe, there it's basically talking with them about what their levels are. And we have consistent questions that we review with them on a monthly basis. We're confident it continues to go down, but it's not all the way there yet. David Ridley-Lane: Thank you. And then a quick follow-up on Lifecycle Services margins, if we take a third quarter and what you're expecting for fourth quarter, would you expect margin progression from that sort of blended second half margin as you go and continue to add volumes? Nick Gangestad : Yes, our Lifecycle Services margin -- thanks for pointing that out. It certainly has been a noticeable improvement over fiscal year 2023 with our margins for the -- our estimate for the full year of more than doubling. A portion of that year-on-year improvement in the margin and in the margin you're seeing is coming from the absence of any kind of bonus or incentive compensation this year. The majority of our improvement is coming through better profitability in our Sensia joint venture. It's coming through structural productivity that we set in place late last year. It's coming through better project execution. Those aspects we think that will continue to build into fiscal year 2025. But I just will point out that the benefit from the incentive compensation, we expect that not to be repeated into fiscal year 2025. If incentive compensation were paid as per the plan, that would have reduced life cycle services margin for the full year by approximately 200 basis points. David Ridley-Lane: Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning and good luck, Nick. So obviously, good news that sell-in to distribution is sort of being matched by order rates, et cetera. But any color in terms of how the sell through from distributors into their customers is tracking for Rockwell products? I think that the message has been that distributors have been cutting inventory levels. It seems like the actual end user demand is weaker for the reasons you cited. So I'm just curious how your intelligence on days of inventory on hand, on shelves, has been tracking through the quarter. And then just maybe just talk about how you've seen this progressing into FY 2025? I know, Jeff, had a crack at 2025, but do you think that we're still in the status now until we get past the election? Blake Moret : So a couple of comments, and then I think Nick may provide some additional color. In the quarter, inventory reduced nicely at distributors. So tracking that, as I mentioned before, pretty explicitly with our DMI program, being able to look at the high runners, the A items, as well as the B and the C items, we saw an overall reduction of the inventory levels and through that -- first part of the year we saw positive year-over-year growth in shipments coming out of our distributors to the end users. So as we talked to them, they have been having a reasonably good year as they're shipping out, particularly to those end users where they're not dealing with higher stock at the machine builders. Nick Gangestad : Yes, Nigel, a couple things to add. One is, yes, we do track the amount of new orders being placed on our distributors. And what we see there is, we are seeing that continuing to go up. But part of what we're highlighting in our revised estimate for Q4 is we're not seeing go up at the pace that we were expecting, implying that the end demand is not as robust as what we were thinking three months ago. And then in terms of your question about added visibility into 2025, I'm sure you were asking more about revenue, but I will just add from a margin perspective, what are some of the headwinds and tailwinds we're thinking about for margin next year? The headwinds we've talked about of compensation, both the bonus and our annual merit increase, and we expect to continue investments in new products and digital offerings. Tailwinds that we expect in our margin next year. That $250 million of margin expansion and cost reduction actions we think will be -- we know will be benefiting margin next year. We continue to expect positive price cost next year and then we expect continued margin improvement from our recent acquisitions in the last two or three and that coupled with, right now what's anticipated, no new M&A, we think that will also be marginally enhancing for us in 2025. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's great color, Nick, just a quick one on M&A contribution for the quarter. Came in quite a bit lighter than what we were looking for. Just wondering if there's any seasonality or timing of shipments we should bear in mind then? Blake Moret : Yes, I mean the biggest contributor to the M&A this year is Clearpath and the mobile robots. That's project business. I mean those are fairly expensive sales. And so, it's going to be lumpy through the year. We're seeing very strong year-over-year growth overall for that business, but it's going to move around a little bit from month-to-month and quarter to quarter. We remain very optimistic and proud of the accomplishments of that acquisition as well as the verb on the cybersecurity side. Nigel Coe : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe I just wanted to start off with inventories, but more around your own inventories than perhaps the customer level. I think your own inventories are only about 8% off the sort of all-time highs and sales in the current quarter look like they're maybe 20% off the year ago level. So I'm curious why your customers and distributors it seems have got inventories down a lot but you haven't. So I'm trying to understand why there's been that discrepancy or disconnect. And sort of allied to that, often I think at Rockwell and others when you get a sales shortfall, you get super normal free cash flow conversion, but for you we're getting cash conversion guide coming down with the revenue guide coming down. So that's just very unusual for this kind of business model. So maybe any sort of highlights around that please. Nick Gangestad : Sure, Julian. Thanks for asking. So from an inventory standpoint, given where we have been in the last 2.5 years in terms of ensuring that our customers are getting the products they need. We have been very focused on making sure that we have the stock we need in place to be meeting our customers' requirements. As we went through the \u2013 our plans for fiscal year 2024, as we went through the year, is that we expected that in the second half of this year we would be seeing increased demand on us depleting quite a bit of that excess inventory that we ourselves are holding. As we're seeing the demand on us not having that ramp up, but more of this gradual increase that we're talking about, that's leaving us with noticeably more inventory in terms of days of inventory at the end of our fiscal year than what we were estimating earlier in the year or even three months ago. And that's the most significant part of our cash conversion story. In terms of our prior guide of 80% now bringing it down to 60%, we've known all along we have these one-time non-recurring headwinds, things like our extra tax payments that we'd be doing well in excess of our tax expense. We also knew that we'd be having the cash payments for our restructuring actions. So those things are contemplated as part of that 80%, but we were also counting on a noticeable roll down in that working capital and inventory in the second half of the year. And while it's still going to come down in the second half of the year, it's not going to come down nearly at the pace. That's really going to be more of a 2025 development for us. Julian Mitchell : That's great. Thank you. And maybe just one follow-up on the broader demand environment. So it seems as sort of a couple of things happening. I think one is, Blake, as you mentioned, sort of orders sequentially are improving. So the overall backdrop sequentially looks a little bit better as we move along. But you also highlighted CapEx reductions at customers and project delays, which I suppose is something new versus say six months ago when the talk was only about destocking headwinds of inventory. So it seems we've moved sort of seamlessly from de-stock into CapEx cuts. Just wondered sort of when did those CapEx cuts start to become evident to you in earnest? And any kind of thoughts around demand cadence in the last month or two in general? Blake Moret : Yes, so we did talk in the last quarter about some weaker CapEx spend, particularly in food and beverage and auto, around new capacity. We indicated that while, for instance, food and beverage customers are still investing in resilience and efficiency, they're pausing new capacity. And similarly -- and I think the well-read theme of EV slowing down a bit as well. We're still seeing projects and behavior that we would characterize as delays, push outs, but not cancellations. And we certainly hope that it doesn't move to that. We're watching it. We're taking a clear-eyed view of what's happening out there. But people are pushing for some of the reasons I mentioned before, as we said, looking at consumer demand, interest rates, and then some policy uncertainty. It doesn't all just stop until the elections, for instance. So we're going to see major projects that are awarded this quarter that are coming from customers across a variety of industries, but not at the pace that we would have thought, say, three or four months ago. And you're right. The dominant theme for the first part of this year was the inventory issue at distributors and machine builders. And now, as that dissipates, we're seeing some pause in capital spend in manufacturing. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Blake Moret : Yes, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, your line is open. Noah Kaye : Thanks. So I'll just bundle a couple of questions here to keep it moving. First, can we actually quantify the revenue impact of the inventory de-stocking in the channel as contemplated in full year guidance. What is the actual revenue headwinds, just so we can level set for next year? And two, thinking about sort of the routability of the cost actions benefiting the P&L. When we get the reinstatement of bonus comp and merit increases, presumably those are fairly rattleable throughout next year, quarterly. Should we think about the same for the cost actions that you're announcing today? Blake Moret : So I'll take the first one and then Nick will chime in on the calendarization of the cost actions. We haven't given a specific figure in terms of the inventory at distribution and machine builders, but it's hundreds of millions of dollars. And it's a larger factor, as I've said before, than some of the investments that we've seen in North America. So it's a bigger number than the business on the good side that's been won this year based on investment in North America. It's dissipating, we're seeing a smaller contribution in each quarter, but it's been stubborn. And as we said, we expect that there's not going to be one month all clear where suddenly it's gone. And that's why we say gradual sequential improvement in orders in this quarter and then into next year. Nick Gangestad : Yes. And then, Noah, as far as the quarterization or calendarization of the benefits of that $250 million. Well, first let me say, you are correct about the bonus, that that will be like largely equal throughout the four quarters of fiscal year 2025. But in terms of the calendarization, of course, we'll add that kind of information in the November meeting for more detail. That said, what I can tell you is the restructuring benefits are more front half loaded, the things that we started in Q3, whereas those additional margin expansion benefits that we talked about that go on top of that, that is more second half loaded. But the actual calendarization of all of this, we'll share more of that in November. Noah Kaye : Very helpful on both fronts. Thank you. Blake Moret : Yep, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open. Steve Tusa : Hi. Good morning. Nick Gangestad : Hey, Steve. Blake Moret : Good morning. Steve Tusa : Nick, I guess for the second time, thanks for all the help and congrats. I just wanted to make sure I understood the bridge items for next year. So you're basically saying that next year is relatively clean when it comes to all these moving parts. I guess, he didn't talk about growth investments, but I would assume you kind of toggle those with the volume picture. So can you just clarify if there is anything else outside of those, the $250 million and then the merit and incentive comp, anything we're missing? Blake Moret : So I'll start with the general comment and then Nick can add detail. But you're right, Steve. The productivity that we're looking at, the combination of the actions that were primarily reductions in force on the second half of this year, and the items in the more comprehensive program offsets the headwinds from compensation into next year. We expect our R&D spend, which is part of that overall operating spend. If you add R&D and SG&A together, that's our operating spend. And we expect R&D to be roughly similar as a percentage of sales next year. Nick Gangestad : Yes, and I think what I'll add to that, this $250 million that we're projecting for next year, that is roughly half of that that we see as benefiting gross margin and roughly half of that that we see reducing our SG&A spending. We're striving to keep our ongoing investments in R&D in light of the opportunities we see there as a percent of revenue relatively flat. Steve Tusa : Right, but basically, like, whatever I want to assume on volume is what the picture is as far as earnings drop through is concerned. Like, simple as that, it sounds like. There aren't too many other bridge items. Nick Gangestad : Yeah The five I shared on Nigel\u2019s question, those are big five there. Steve Tusa : Yes, okay. And then just one last question for you. I mean, so it sounds like you overproduced a bit, I\u2019m sure you have the benefit of that offset obviously by the negative mix. As you take inventory down next year do we look at the drop through on whatever volumes we assume is being neutral to positive on mix, because that should be a little bit more normal, but then you obviously get hit with the overproduction, so it's still kind of that into that more normal like 35% range for you guys? Blake Moret : Talk a little bit more about what you mean by overproduction, Steve. Steve Tusa : Just your inventories are up, right? So there's -- you overproduced relative to what the shipments were, just with inventories up. Or am I wrong about that? Nick Gangestad : Yes, in the last two or three quarters, it's -- Steve, it's -- the inventory is in both the last two quarters not going up. They're just not coming down as fast as we thought. And we think that pace of it coming down will accelerate in 2025. But in terms of volume in our factories, in terms of a negative headwind from underutilization in 2025 versus 2024, we don't anticipate that's a material impact on fiscal year 2025. Steve Tusa : Okay. Great. Thanks all for the color, as always, and enjoy retirement, Nick. Thanks. Nick Gangestad : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning guys. And Nick, wish you the best in retirement. Thanks for everything. Nick Gangestad : Thanks, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Yeah, my first question, and I know, look, we're all trying to figure out 2025, and I know that your business is fairly short cycle. But if I look at some of your two -- like your two biggest end markets being food and beverage and auto, this year you're going to be coming up against maybe one more tough comp in the fourth quarter. I guess Blake, as you kind of think through the conversations you're having with your customers and the environment that we're in, is there a scenario where you don't grow in 2025 and what's the realistic expectation going forward? Blake Moret : Joe, I'm going to stay away from bigger than a bread box type of dimensioning for next year. But the customers we're talking to, including in automotive and food and beverage, are continuing to make investments in those areas. We look at not just potential capacity that they're adding, but it's about resilience, efficiency in existing facilities. It's one of the things that excites us about the mobile robots, for instance, is that -- most of that's going into existing facilities. So customers, just like Rockwell, are working on their efficiency and their cost, regardless of what's going on in the external environment. And we're really well prepared to address that. So I mentioned before, as we start getting into -- back into year-over-year growth in orders, we'll characterize what that means for shipments into the next year, but I'm very confident with our position. Joe Ritchie : Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe lastly, just a near-term question as we think about the fourth quarter. In the Intelligent Devices segment, it seems like historically we've seen this uptick in the fourth quarter on revenue. It seems like you guys are implying that that business is going to be down a bunch. If any color around that would be helpful for 4Q. Nick Gangestad : Joe, we're implying that Intelligent Devices revenue will be almost exactly the same sequentially between Q3 and Q4. It's not -- we're not expecting a noticeable uptick or downtick sequentially in intelligent devices revenue. Joe Ritchie : Okay, just not the typical seasonal uptick that you would normally see [indiscernible]? Nick Gangestad : Not a seasonal uptick there. Joe Ritchie : Okay, great. All right. Thank you both. Aijana Zellner : Julianne, we'll take one more question. Operator : Certainly, Aijana. Our last question will come from Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, your line is open. Joe O'Dea: Hi, thanks for fitting me in. I wanted to start on the -- Hi. I wanted to start on the margin expansion and productivity in terms of : one, understanding the structural versus temporary components of this; and then two, just in terms of understanding the breadth of it. Obviously, a lot of different elements all rolling up to the savings here. And so just the genesis of this and how these opportunities have developed over time in terms of greater manufacturing efficiency or sourcing efficiency or SG&A efficiency. It seems like there's a lot out there. And so just kind of understanding how that opportunity came to be. Blake Moret : Sure, Joe, broadly, we've spent a lot of the last few years adding some capabilities that I felt we needed to move faster in, things like software capability, high-value services like cybersecurity, and some particular technologies like mobile robots, independent car technology, industrial PCs. At the same time, we've been playing a lot of defense with COVID, with supply chain volatility that has introduced inevitably some inefficiencies into our own processes. And so for several reasons, now is the time to integrate the parts, to bring together the things that we built and bought over the last few years, and to drive out some of the inefficiency that's built up with programs like this. And it necessarily involves headcount reduction, as well as actions aimed at reducing our cost of goods sold. And so it's a broad-based approach that will yield benefits in this year as we talked about into next year. But then it gets rolled into a continuous operating model of continuous improvement that continues to drive these costs out and be vigilant to make sure that new costs don't creep in. The benefits, of course, are for an investor standpoint, expanding margins to go with the higher growth levels. For customers, there's also a benefit. Things that we're doing to reduce that long tail of SKUs can actually increase customer service for the more frequently bought items. And when we reduce the cost of goods sold, we have the opportunity to be even more competitive on the projects that we choose to go after. So for a variety of reasons, integrating the parts and driving inefficiency out is the right time in our journey to introduce this as we started last November at Investor Day and will certainly be given more of an update in just a few months. Joe O'Dea: And so primarily structural in terms of how we think about the cost coming out? Blake Moret : Yes, it is primarily structural. These aren't one-time things to address a particular year. The idea is that, the savings that we're making, the costs that we're reducing persist regardless of what the top line growth is going to be. Joe O'Dea: And then just one more on demand. I know a lot of focus on that already, but just trying to understand the past few months. When we look at the end market expectations, I think things came down in nearly every end market relative to three months ago. And so, trying to understand the degree to which things have gotten worse versus the degree to which things just aren't getting better quite as fast as you expected. Blake Moret : Yes, I think that latter is probably the best way to characterize it. We've seen sequential order growth quarter-on-quarter through the year and we expect it again in the fourth quarter and into next year, but it's at a more gradual pace. Joe O'Dea: Got it. Thanks a lot. Aijana Zellner : All right. Thank you for joining us today, everyone. That concludes today's conference call. Operator : At this time, you may disconnect. Thank you.",

Later in the call, we will open up the lines for questions. [Operator Instruction] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Aijana Zellner, Head of Investor Relations and Market Strategy. Ms. Zellner, please go ahead. Aijana Zellner : Thank you, Julianne. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's fourth quarter fiscal 2024 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Christian Rothe, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include, and our call today will reference, non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings. And with that, I'll hand it over to Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks, Aijana and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'll make a couple of comments before we turn to our fourth quarter results. With the U.S. Federal Election Day now behind us, we're optimistic that the country will turn its focus to a smooth transition to newly elected leaders. We're pleased that policymakers recognize the essential role that U.S. manufacturing plays at the core of our economy. Rockwell is the clear leader in providing technology that helps U.S. manufacturers be more competitive, so we welcome policies that will benefit our most important market by spurring innovation, streamlining project approvals and leveling the playing field. Orders continued to be soft in Q4, but we had solid execution on several fronts. Customer service levels and conversion of new orders to shipments are back to pre-pandemic levels across all businesses. We are growing profitable software and digital services lines of business which help to partially mitigate the impact of excess product inventory in our channel. Annual recurring revenue grew double digits in the year and is now 10% of our total revenue. For comparison, ARR was about 4% of our revenue in 2018. We're seeing modest market share gains over the past few years based on U.S. market share reports, product specific studies and comparison to the automation businesses of our closest competitors. Our best results in fiscal year 2024 were in North America, our home market and China is now less than 5% of our revenue. We are broadening our cost savings activities and Christian Rothe, our new CFO has jumped into the effort with enthusiasm. He brings valuable new perspectives on additional opportunities. At the end of fiscal year 2024, we were able to accelerate our savings to realize about $110 million of cost reductions in the second half of the year, $10 million above the target we first discussed in May. As of the end Of October of 2024 our global headcount is down over 12% since Q2 of fiscal 2024. In the last call we talked about multiple additional cost down opportunities, including activities to reduce the price paid for purchase components and services as well as actions to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing plants. Despite the headwind of lower volume, we are still confident in our ability to save $250 million in fiscal year 2025 from the combination of all our productivity actions. We continue to see positive impact from pricing actions. These have been difficult times, but I'm impressed by the resilience and sense of urgency of our teams as we position ourselves to deliver market beating growth and profitability. Later on this call, Christian will cover our pricing, productivity and margin expansion actions for next year. Let's now turn to our Q4 results on Slide 3. Our Q4 orders were down low single digits sequentially compared to our expectations for low single digit improvement. Similar to last quarter, the rate of reduction of lingering excess inventory at our distributors and machine builders was gated by slower end user demand. Of note, we did see sequential orders growth in North America with Asia contributing the largest sequential decline. Going forward, we expect our Q1 orders to be flat sequentially. We expect our Q1 sales to be down high single digits from last quarter, primarily due to typical seasonality in our configure-to-order and solutions businesses and slower orders in Q4 of fiscal 2024. I'll talk more about our fiscal 2025 outlook later on the call. Despite weaker than expected orders, our Q4 organic sales came in largely in line with expectations. As I mentioned earlier, we quickly converted incoming product orders to shipments and lifecycle services capped off a year of improved performance with good execution in the quarter. Q4 sales for the company declined 21% versus prior year compared to 18% growth in Q4 of last year. The decline is due to the difficult year-over-year comparison, lingering channel destocking effects in our product businesses and slower end user demand. CUBIC: This quarter we secured a strategic win at NTT, a leading data center colo provider. Rockwell is helping this customer achieve significant footprint savings by leveraging CUBIC's modular, compact and switchgear agnostic custom design capabilities. In Software & Control, organic sales were down over 30% year-over-year. Within this segment, logic shipments were weaker due to slower end demand in product centric end markets. Despite the continuing volatility in product shipments, our PLC market share is slightly up helped by a geographic mix and continued innovation. Logix SIS : Other launches extend the differentiation of our software offering. Last quarter we launched our Vision AI Solutions to help customers improve their quality and yield. In general, software was our best performing area this year with good revenue growth across Fix, Plex and other FactoryTalk offerings. The newest FactoryTalk Design Studio release features a copilot which boosts automation system design productivity and is integrated in this cloud native application which is an industry first. You'll see many of these products at our automation fare in a few weeks. Lifecycle Services organic sales grew about 2% versus prior year book-to-bill in this segment was 0.9 and slightly below our historical average for Q4. We saw a couple of customer delays projects in our Sensia business this quarter. We continue to have a healthy pipeline of projects which include both traditional and energy transition applications and reflect a general shift towards autonomous operations to improve safety and operational performance. Energy end markets overall were over 15% of our total business in fiscal 2024. On the services side, we continue to increase customer penetration through managed services with a growing number of contracts generating recurring revenue. Total ARR for the company grew 16% in the quarter with double digit growth across our software and services offerings. Segment margin was over 20% and adjusted EPS was $2.47. Turning to Slide 4, to review key highlights of our Q4 industry segment performance, similar to our overall top line results in the quarter, our performance by industry reflects difficult year-over-year comparisons, with Q4 of last year being a record quarter of shipments. Sales in our discrete industries were impacted by continued declines in auto and semi, partially offset by growth in e-Commerce & Warehouse Automation. In Automotive, we saw another quarter of EV project delays as brand owners and tier suppliers wait for more policy certainty and an overall improvement in consumer spending. Despite this pause in EV, there's still activity and we continue to win business across traditional ICE and hybrid programs. Rockwell was selected by Ford Motor Company as the automation partner for their Louisville, Kentucky facility. Rockwell will be supplying a full portfolio of Logix controllers, drives, HMI and industrial components for the body and final assembly shops. There is also additional content for their next generation truck programs. Moving to Semiconductor, while the industry is dealing with oversupply and uncertainty around future stimulus support, we secured an important win with a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing to automate their R&D facilities here in the U.S. We also continue to gain traction with our production logistics offering from material transport. e-Commerce & Warehouse Automation sales increased 25% versus prior year. In addition to continued investments in warehouse upgrades by both e-commerce and traditional retail players, we see the benefits of data center investment, particularly in our CUBIC business. Turning to our Hybrid Industry, sales in this segment were impacted by double digit year-over-year declines in Food & Beverage and Life Sciences. In Food & Beverage, we continue to see muted capacity investments as end users are delaying projects and focusing on driving operational improvements across their existing facilities. With that said, we are working with leading Food & Beverage producers on their next greenfield plans. In the quarter we had an important win with Kikkoman, the largest soy sauce manufacturer in the world. In partnership with the engineering firm CRB, we are delivering Rockwell's portfolio of Plex MES software and scalable plant wide control, helping Kikkoman build their factory of the future here in Jefferson, Wisconsin. Within our Life Sciences vertical, we're seeing the investment in GLP-1 drugs as key pharma companies and their contract manufacturers aggressively add manufacturing capacity to support soaring consumer demand. Sales growth in our Process industries was impacted by difficult comps with over 25% growth in Q4 of last year for this industry segment. Within Oil & Gas, similar to last quarter, we saw project push outs in North America due to election uncertainty and potential policy changes given the impact they may have on funding of greenhouse gas related projects. Sensia did grow double digits in the quarter and continued to deliver improved profitability. In Mining customers are investing in the sustainability and safety of their operations. This quarter Rockwell was chosen by Syrate [ph] New Denmark and South Africa to upgrade their environmental monitoring system from a competitive software offering to ensure effective monitoring of environmental conditions and respond to potential hazards. Let's turn to Slide 5 and our Q4 organic regional sales. In general, sales were down sharply year-over-year due to tough comparisons and the lingering impact of destocking. Orders were up sharply year-over-year due to the easy comparison with Q4 fiscal year 2023. Sequentially orders were down low single digits and shipments were flattish. The Americas, our home market, continued to be our best performing region. As I mentioned, orders were up sequentially in North America. While we are happy with our strong presence in the Americas, we continue to expand our share of wallet with European machine builders as they serve their end users around the world. In the quarter, we won an important project with Gaia in India. Gaia is one of the world's largest system suppliers for the food, beverage and pharmaceutical sectors. The Gaia portfolio includes machinery and plants, as well as advanced process technology, components and comprehensive services. The end user will implement state-of-the-art technologies to ensure efficient water usage and replenishment. Let's move to Slide 6 for key highlights of fiscal 2024. We finished the year with a 9% year-over-year decline in reported sales. Sales from our ClearPath and Verve acquisitions contributed about a point of growth as we expand our customer value in the production, logistics and cyber security spaces. Total ARR grew 16% with strong performance across our recurring software and services portfolio and is now over 10% of our total business. The 200 basis point decrease in our segment margin on a high single digit year-over-year sales decline would have been worse without our more diverse business mix, and the significant cost reduction actions we took earlier this year to align our cost structure with the current business environment. These actions also position us for expanded margins as markets recover. 60% free cash flow conversion was in line with our prior forecast. Let's now move to Slide 7 to review our fiscal 2025 outlook. Given the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and continued project delays across a number of our end markets, we're projecting sales growth in the range of positive 2% to negative 4%. After a sequential decline in Q1 shipments, primarily due to typical seasonality, we expect gradual sequential improvement in our top line growth through the balance of fiscal year 2025. Christian will cover the calendarization of our guidance in more detail later on this call. We expect our annual recurring revenue to grow about 10%. Segment margin is projected to be down slightly versus prior year and adjusted EPS is expected to be $9.20 at the midpoint. We expect free cash flow conversion to return to 100% in fiscal year 2025. I'll now turn it over to Christian to provide more detail on our Q4 and full year performance and financial outlook for fiscal 2025. Christian? Christian Rothe : Thank you, Blake and good morning everyone. I'm excited to be here this morning and look forward to working with you all over the coming quarters and years. I'll start on slide 8, fourth quarter key financial information. Fourth quarter reported sales were down 21% versus prior year. The positive impact of acquisitions and the negative impact of currency roughly offset each other in the quarter. About two points of our organic growth came from price. Segment operating margin was 20.1% compared to 22.3% a year ago. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower sales volume and unfavorable mix partially offset by our cost reduction actions and no incentive compensation. Adjusted EPS of $2.47 was above our expectations primarily due to price and one-time items. Those one-time items included $22 million benefit from an adjustment to an earn-out accrual tied to achievement of the sellers revenue targets on our ClearPath acquisition. Adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 14.9% below the prior year rate of 17% and about 4 points below our expectations for the quarter. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later Slide. Free cash flow of $367 million was $409 million lower than the prior year, primarily due to lower pretax income. One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased approximately 450,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $118 million. On September 30th we had $1.3 billion remaining under our repurchase authorizations. Slide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview for our three operating segments. Intelligent Devices margin of 20.6% decreased 70 basis points year-over-year due to lower sales volume and unfavorable mix. If you exclude the benefit from the ClearPath earn-out adjustment I mentioned earlier, segment margin in Intelligent Devices was 18.3%. Operationally this was about a point below our expectations as better than expected price cost was more than offset by lower volume and other costs including the impact of currency. Purely focusing on decremental conversion after adjusting for the earn-out, the segment had decrementals in the mid-30s year-over-year in the fourth quarter which reflects strong execution on cost out programs against a 20% organic sales decline. Software & Control margin of 22.3% decreased about 1,100 basis points year-over-year due to lower sales volume which was partially offset by cost reduction actions and no incentive compensation. Margins in this segment were below our expectations mainly due to lower shipments of Logix controllers. Revenue from the software portion of Software & Control held up nicely year-over-year. The 39% sales decline in Software & Control was driven by the hardware portion of the business against the historically high shipments in Q4 of the prior year. The typically high decrementals for Software & Control were mitigated somewhat by our cost out actions. Lifecycle Services margin of 17.4% increased 890 basis points year-over-year and was slightly above our expectations. The higher year-over-year segment margin lifecycle was driven by no incentive compensation, strong project execution and Sensia margin improvement. As Blake said, this business performed well throughout fiscal 2024 and the incrementals reflect that. The next Slide 10 provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q4 fiscal 2023 to Q4 fiscal 2024. Core performance was down $2.40 on a 21% organic sales decrease with unfavorable segment and product mix driving an outsized flow through. As Blake mentioned, cost reduction actions provided a $70 million benefit in the quarter exceeding our expectations and were a $0.50 tailwind. Incentive compensation was a $0.55 tailwind. This year-over-year delta reflects no bonus payout this year versus an above target payout last year. ClearPath earn-out benefit was $0.20. Year-over-year impact from currency and acquisitions were a $0.05 headwind each whereas tax was a $0.05 tailwind. Shares, interest and other items taken together were a tailwind of $0.03. I want to pause here to briefly discuss the sequential performance for Rockwell from Q3 to Q4. Although it's not in the slide, I think it's informative to discuss the progression, particularly when we later discuss the fiscal 2025 guide. Negative mix was the largest contributor to our decremental sequentially. While reported company wide sales were down $15 million, declines in products in both Intelligent Devices and Software & Control including Logix were more than double that amount. On the other hand, we saw growth in Lifecycle Services and our configure-to-order products which have less favorable margin profile. Further, as mentioned in our Q3 call, the Lifecycle Services segment had some high margin projects ship in Q3 that did not recur in Q4. This negative impact of both volume and mix drove high sequential decremental margins. Sequential currency and pension headwinds were offset by the earn-out adjustment. Moving on, Slide 11 provides key financial information for the full fiscal year 2024. Reported sales declined 9% to $8.3 billion including 1 point of growth coming from acquisitions. Currency was neutral. Organic sales were down 10%. Full year segment margin of 19.3% decreased 200 basis points from last year. The decrease was due to lower sales and again an unfavorable mix that skewed heavily toward products partially offset by no incentive compensation as well as the benefits from cost reduction actions and one-time items including the earn out adjustment. Adjusted EPS was down 20%. A detailed year-over-year adjusted EPS block can be found in the Appendix for your reference Free cash flow conversion was in line with the updated expectations we shared last quarter at about 60% in fiscal 2024. Free cash flow decreased $575 million from fiscal 2023. The decrease in free cash flow was driven by lower pretax income. Inventory and receivables were a source of cash in the fourth quarter as we reduced our balances in line with end demand. Return on Invested capital was 15.2% for fiscal year 2024 and 570 basis points than the prior year, primarily driven by lower income. For the year, we deployed about $1.2 billion of capital toward dividends and share repurchases and made inorganic investments of $750 million at the beginning of the fiscal year for ClearPath and Verve. Our capital structure and liquidity remained strong. Let's now move on to the next Slide 12 to discuss guidance for fiscal 2025. We expect reported sales in a range from negative 4% to positive 2% or slightly below $8.2 billion at the midpoint with no impact from currency or acquisitions. At the midpoint of our sales guidance, which is negative 1%, we expect both Intelligent Devices and Software & Control to be down low single digits and Lifecycle Services to be up low single digits year-over-year. We expect price to contribute about a point of growth for the year and price cost to be favorable. Segment margin is expected to be just under 19% at the midpoint, down about 40 basis points from fiscal year 2024. As Blake mentioned, we continue to expect $250 million in year-over-year benefit from our productivity and margin expansion projects in fiscal year 2025. We look forward to covering more on our productivity and operational excellence journey with you at our upcoming Investor Day in Anaheim. We expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17%. This is about 2 percentage points higher than fiscal 2024, which benefited from some discrete events that will not recur. Our adjusted EPS guidance ranges $8.60 to $9.80 with $9.20 at the midpoint. We expect full year fiscal 2025 free cash flow conversion of about 100% of adjusted income. Blake mentioned earlier that we expect first quarter sales to be down high single digits sequentially. From a margin standpoint, we expect our Q1 margins to be in the low to mid-teens. Although we don't give quarterly guidance, we thought it would be helpful to give some additional color on how we expect the first quarter to shape up. Intelligent Devices sales are expected to be down low teens sequentially, reflecting soft product demand and a seasonal low in configure to order products. Against this tough volume backdrop, Intelligent Devices will have compensation headwinds and the non-recurrence of the earn out adjustment. As a result, we expect Intelligent Devices segment margins to be in the low teens. Software & Control margin is expected to be in the low 20s on flat sequential sales growth. Lifecycle Services typically has a seasonal low in the first quarter and sales are expected to be down low single digits sequentially. We expect compensation headwinds and the volume impact to drive segment margins in Lifecycle to the low teens. As Blake mentioned, we expect gradual sequential improvement in our sales through the rest of the year. We also expect a corresponding increase in our segment margins. Let's turn to Slide 13 for our adjusted EPS walk for the full year. Our core is expected to be negative $0.20 for the year with more normalized conversion on the 1% sales decline at the midpoint of our guide. Importantly, included in our core is R&D spending, the lifeblood of our future growth, which we continue to target at about 6% of sales. Non-R&D investments planned for fiscal 2025 are expected to be a $0.25 headwind. These investments are structural in nature to position us for future growth. They include expansion of our CUBIC footprint to continue to capture the ongoing data center tailwind, especially in the U.S., our new Rockwell facility in India and IT investments that will provide differentiated performance both inside and outside of Rockwell's walls. Continuing on to the waterfall, our productivity actions are expected to increase EPS by $1.85 reflecting the targeted $250 million cost out savings. Nearly offsetting those savings are compensation and inflation headwinds next year which are expected to decrease EPS by $1.40 at the midpoint of guide. Adjustments to the ClearPath earn-out in Q2 and Q4 of fiscal 2024 result in a $0.25 headwind in fiscal 2025. We expect tax to be a $0.20 headwind. Shares, interest expense and other items taken together are expected to be a $0.06 headwind. To break down the guide another way, our adjusted EPs in fiscal 2024 included about $0.25 of benefit from earn-out adjustments that added about 35 basis points to our segment margins for the year. Our guide of fiscal 2025 segment margins of just under 19% reflects essentially flat segment margins on this adjusted basis year-over-year. The headwinds of a 1% sales decline at the midpoint of our guide, as well as compensation and investment headwinds are expected to be offset at the segment level by our cost out programs. A few additional Comments on Fiscal 2025 guidance for your models, corporate and other expenses is expected to be around $130 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2025 is expected to be about $145 million. We're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 113.1 million shares and we are targeting $300 million of share repurchases during the year. With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Blake Moret : Thanks, Christian. Despite project delays tied to policy uncertainty and the U.S. election, we won new capacity projects in the U.S. across a variety of verticals in the quarter and throughout the year. We saw a sequential ramp in these wins throughout the year with Q4 being the best quarter. Projects came from a diverse set of end markets including renewable energy, tire, oil and gas, EV and semiconductor. The funnel of these mega projects is robust and we expect an increase in these orders during fiscal year 2025. Fiscal year 2025 will be a particularly strong year for new product introductions, including both hardware and software. We look forward to showcasing this innovation for customers during Automation Fair in two weeks and for you at our Investor Day during the show. Acquisitions made a year ago are expected to contribute about a point of organic growth in fiscal year 2025. We do not anticipate major new acquisitions in the year. We have an unmatched portfolio that combines traditional sources of value with new ways to win. As we've said, we're now concentrating on integrating what we built and bought to drive simplification for our customers, expanded margins for investors, and focus for our employees. Our people remain the heart of our success and I thank them for their dedication and resilience. My leadership team and I look forward to working shoulder to shoulder with our employees and partners around the world during the coming year as we tune our operations add new innovation to our portfolio and win at customers. Aijana will now begin the Q&A session. Aijana Zellner : Thanks, Blake. [Operator Instructions] Julianne, let's take our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning, Blake and Christian, Aijana. Blake Moret : Hey, good morning. Scott Davis : Blake, you implied that maybe the election caused some noise. Do you see a restock happening imminently is that something that seems possible? Blake Moret : We're really not counting -- Scott, we're really not counting on anything at the beginning of the year, particularly in Q1. As we talked about before, we're nearing the end of the drain of excess stock at distributors and machine builders. Some machine builders and distributors are already back to that equilibrium point, but we're just not counting on some rapid acceleration for them to put additional inventory back on their shelf. Scott Davis : And just to follow up on that theme, the last time we had tariffs come in, what were the customer responses? Were they more likely to pre-buy and kind of buildup in particular distributors, build up inventory? Were they more -- was there a change in behaviors around that? And certainly there may be some concerns around tariffs, so I'm just kind of curious to see what you guys saw last time and how that may inform this time. Blake Moret : We really didn't see customer behavior change a lot with the tariffs, I'll tell you that. That's an area that I'm proud of the agility that we showed as the tariffs came through to get ahead of that to ensure a positive price cost as things were coming in. And so I'm very confident should we see additional tariffs, we'll be able to reflect that in our pricing to customers. But unlike what occasionally will happen with regular price increases, where you see a little bit of purchases brought forward, we really didn't see that with respect to the tariffs, obviously, there's a lot of expectation that continues as investment increases in the U.S. to complement labor with technology. And of course, that's right down our sweet spot. Scott Davis : Yes, makes sense. Okay, thank you. Best of luck this year, guys. We'll see you in a few weeks. Blake Moret : Yes, thanks, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, everyone. Blake Moret : Hey, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Blake, maybe just trying to flesh out 2025 a little bit more. When you look at 2025, do you think we're any closer to a bottom in discrete? I know you mentioned some incremental CapEx delays, but is there any kind of visibility that's helping you? Let's call it talk about relative stability in hybrid and process markets in 2025 given the forecast of down low, single digits and flat respectively. Blake Moret : Yes. So in let's start with Hybrid, Food & Beverage, we're still not seeing a lot of activity of people pulling the trigger on greenfield investment, although we're working with them and the associated EPCs on planning for expansion projects. And we're continuing to get business through digital services modernizations and things like that with their brownfield footprint. In Life Sciences, we do think that we may be coming off a little bit of a bottom with respect to Life Sciences. And we've talked about the optimism around GLP-1 capacity that we're engaged with and that we expect to continue in that area. In discrete the biggest component of discrete is Automotive. We talked about a minute ago the win at Ford. So customers are still investing, but it's not picked up to a point where we can sound the all clear let's say. We do expect the SAR count to increase in fiscal 2025. EV as a percentage of vehicles sold in the U.S. is expected to go up a little above 10%. It's obviously at a much slower pace than we all envisioned a couple of years ago. And then another element of discrete is e-Commerce and Warehouse Automation. That's also where our data center activity is. That was a bright spot this year for us and we expect that to continue. There's a lot of activity there, not only among the hyperscalers, but also among the other retailers who are looking to modernize and make their operations more efficient. Semiconductor a little bit more mixed. Still expect that to recover. We talked about some activity there, but we're not expecting that to be a big contributor in the year. Andy Kaplowitz : It's helpful. And then Blake, just kind of fleshing out the 2025 guidance or maybe this for Christian, orders down, most of them in Q4. You talked about flat in Q1. I guess, that puts you probably in the sevens in terms of run rate and sales. So maybe how much lift do you get in orders if destocking were to just end and do you need orders to start picking up in Q2 to sort of make that midpoint of your guide? Blake Moret : We're really looking at very gradual sequential growth in orders after Q1. That's what we're expecting triangulating from a variety of points, looking at the different industries. We also look at life cycle with its higher exposure to process, which continues to invest and the relevance of backlog that they have in that segment, contributing positive growth in the year. So we feel comfortable with that. And then with the order progression that I just described being the biggest impact, biggest influence on Software & Control and Intelligent Devices through the year. Andy Kaplowitz : I appreciate it. Look forward to seeing in a couple weeks. Blake Moret : Yes, see you soon. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andrew Obin : Yes, good morning. Blake Moret : Hey Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just, I'm going to go back to sort of trying to figure out where things bottom. So as you look at your funnel and then obviously funnel becomes orders and then orders become shipments. So just trying to understand is the sort of this funnel converting into orders is just budgeting at year end. And so we effectively need budgets to be set for calendar 2025. And that's what we're going to see orders. And then once you get an order, what do you think, because not just for you, I know that you guys can probably ship your stuff within one to two weeks, but as you put the product together, what's the right way of thinking from order converting into shipment that you book? Is it three months? Is it six months? If you could just outline this timeline if and when things actually start inflecting? Thank you. Blake Moret : Sure. So, Andrew, let me describe a little bit of the overall process, and if I missed something, then ask me to touch that up. The funnel is tracked probably a little bit differently for pure products that go into MRO versus the big greenfield projects that we look at that we described last year in terms of the typical calendarization of like a big EV project, for instance. And of course, we have both in our business. We track intensely the project work, in some cases a year or two before orders are left there with CapEx across the different industries. And that's where our Lighthouse project group has really shown this year. And as I said, we expect even more activity in the coming year. That funnel looks good and certainly supports the guide with respect to Lifecycle Services. We have a good funnel in ClearPath, for instance, cubic and so on. But between the time that something comes out of the funnel and is won and ordered and shipped that could be months or in some cases a year or more depending on the amount of engineering in that project. When it comes to the products in that funnel, when those come out as an order to us, as you said, we're back to turning those around at a very high rate. The majority of those get serviced within a period of days off our distributor shelf. But even when we have to build it, we can rely on the safety stock that we built up, built back up during the year or building in the plants that's converting at a very high rate. So, I think to your question, from time to get an order to the shipment, what's the overall time? It literally is a period of weeks for those products, a little bit longer for the configure-to-order products that we have in intelligent devices. And again you get into the months. I think average lead time in Lifecycle Services is probably about five or six months. But it certainly varies between digital services and fully engineered systems. So hopefully that touches on some of what you were looking for. Andrew Obin : Yes, no, absolutely. Thanks so much. And then just and I apologize if you have sort of talked about it but, you were sort of machine builders in Europe was a pinch point. I think one of your competitors sort of has come out and said that that is being pushed out three to six months. What is happening with machine builders in Europe, just a little bit more granular view there? Thank you. Blake Moret : Yes, well let me, let me start with a subjective comment and that is I'm seeing a lot of machine builders from Europe in our facility now and we'll see a lot of them at Automation Fair in a couple of weeks. The PACK EXPO show down in Chicago, was close enough to where we're seeing a lot of those machine builders come up and talk to us about their plans going forward, super encouraging. These are big names and they're already decent sized customers, but with lots of opportunities to grow share of their spend. Given that a lot of their end users are investing in the U.S. and they want to be working with the U.S. leader, that's fact. We're definitely hearing that directly from those machine builders and you'll hear from some more of them at Automation Fair as well. In fiscal year 2025, coming off of a year where the overstock condition at European machine builders contributed to big declines, we expect Europe to be decent performing after the Americas. So Americas will be the best performing region in the world in 2025, followed by Europe, followed by Asia, as those overstock conditions completely dissipate and they get back to normal order patterns. Andrew Obin : Thanks so much, I really appreciate it. Blake Moret : Yes, thanks Andrew. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Oh, thanks. Good morning everyone. Hey, good morning. Thanks for the 1Q color and all the additional guidance points. So Christian, I just want to make sure that we've got message on 1Q. We're sort of getting, just to map it back to the full year guide, down a 6% to 7% type organic year-over-year for 1Q. And it's just based on the, I don't know, based on the margin it seems like maybe a bit more pressure perhaps on EPS, so maybe down to like $1.80 or so. Would that be sort of consistent with your thinking? Christian Rothe : Yes. So just to -- hi Nigel. To frame it a little bit when we talk about the sequential side of it for kind of the overall organization we have, if we bridge from Q4 into Q1, we've got headwinds, of course the earn out adjustment is not going to recur. We've got headwinds from the perspective of the compensation inflationary side and then on top of that, of course, there's the volume reduction. All of which are going to contribute to going to contribute to some real decrementals as we go into Q1. So you mentioned a number on the EPS. We're not going to actually get into real detail on exactly what that number is, but it will be significantly below $2. Nigel Coe : Okay, that's helpful. And then just based on the normal, I mean normal quote unquote normal sequential through the year, it seems like 2Q would be down in the similar level year-over-year and then you start getting the real benefit from the easy comps in the back half of the year. But I do struggle to understand what gets us to plus 2% given the start of the year. So just to be curious what sort of assumptions you're making at that plus two and maybe just frame it in terms of what you'd expect to see in the order numbers. Blake Moret : Yes, so that would. So, the plus 2% would be a little bit better sequential improvement, either a little bit more pronounced ramp up or a little bit earlier development of the recovery in the end markets that would flip intelligent devices and Software & Control products to positive shipments for the year. So, if you get a little bit higher growth than expected earlier in the year and we continue to build sequentially off of that, that's where you would see the pickup, the lifecycle services, the longer lead time items. Again, given the exposure to process markets and the amount in backlog, I don't see that changing as dramatically. It's really going to be the products that will be the swing votes in this. Nigel Coe : Okay, thanks Blake. See you in two weeks. Blake Moret : Yes, see you soon. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Snyder from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Chris Snyder : Thank you. I wanted to talk about America's market and order trends. So I think you guys said that those were up low single digits sequentially or just up sequentially, so any color on maybe the magnitude of increase? And when you guys talk about orders flat sequentially into Q1 on seasonality, is the expectation that Americas continues to get better and then just more broadly on America, anything you could comment around the competitive environment and specifically how you think the company is doing on share of new wins and new awards? Thank you. Blake Moret : Sure. Yes, as we said, Americas was the best performing region in 2024 and we expect in 2025 it continued to be the best performing region. We obviously have by far the largest share in the Americas. We've got the best channel; we've got the largest installed base and the deepest relationship. So it's pretty good hand in that case. And we're seeing, as I mentioned before, modest share gains. Obviously our competitors are all interested in the U.S. and expanding that footprint. But we're attacking it with the same sense of urgency and recognizing that we have to take the battle to machine builders and engineering firms around the world as well as continuing to provide, unmatched, very differentiated support for the users here as well, releasing new products, it's the whole equations and it's all hands on deck for that. In terms of the sequentials, I did mention that we saw sequential improvement in orders in Q4 in North America. And we haven't characterized just where we see the sequentials, through the year by region and by products or solutions. But again, we expect Americas to be the best. And I did say that we expect in the so called mega projects that we expect more orders to come from that activity in 2025 than we saw in 2024. And that will become a more and more significant number, as we finally get past the overstock effects of products in the channel. Chris Snyder : I appreciate that. And then may be just following up on that American manufacturing CapEx investment, which is obviously tilting much more towards electronic components like chips and even bigger electrical equipment, maybe things like transformers. So as the CapEx shifts into different end markets, is there anything that investors should be aware of on just the content? Is the content on those products not just for you, but just for the automation industry? Maybe lower than more traditional verticals like, like Food & Beverage and then just the fact that some of these verticals are a bit new to the United States, how is Rockwell positioned to compete on those? Thank you. Blake Moret : Yes, Chris, great question. The opportunities we're tracking and literally there are thousands of projects that we're looking at and then getting laser focused on the, the top of the funnel where we have the clearest line of sight and they're getting ready to make decisions. If you look at the vertical industries represented by that funnel, it split roughly evenly between the verticals that we don't have as much penetration in that we haven't talked as much about historically. Things like semiconductor balanced by industries that we have great share in, we've talked about forever. We have, extremely high readiness to serve, like Food & Beverage, like Automotive, like Life Sciences. So we went through and characterized that entire basket of projects and it split roughly equal. And each side of that represents hundreds of billions of dollars of CapEx, and very substantial amounts of opportunity for us. And as I've said before, I think we're still in the reasonably early innings of those being awarded. So you're seeing awards for things like data centers for projects now. And while we have some exposure in data centers, it's obviously not the bulk of our business people are placing orders for very long lead time items. I think transformers in some cases are still out two years and so on and we'll see some content from that. But I think the biggest amount of those projects is still to come over, over the next few years. Chris Snyder : Thank you. Blake Moret : Yes, thanks, Chris. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. May be one question for you, Blake just thinking back to the Investor Day a year ago. So you talked about that sort of mid-to-high single digit organic sales CAGR entitlement. When we take 2024 in the guide for 2025, you're running at a sort of negative mid-single digit CAGR. So just trying to understand for you to sort of get the nose up and move back towards the mid to high positive growth, how much more do you need to put in in terms of reinvestment? Because I understand short-term you're sort of cutting spending and headcount because of the near term top line. But are you confident you can get back to that mid-single digit plus growth trend without sort of heavier investment taking place in the next couple of years? Blake Moret : Yes, thanks for the question, Julian. So in terms of the investment, we've taken a lot of care even through the last tough year to preserve spending in areas like customer facing resources as well as R&D for new product introductions and you'll see the continuing increased pace of that at Automation Fair in a couple of weeks, across our portfolio, Software & Control, Intelligent Devices, New Digital Services. I'm very proud of the way that we're getting these new products to market. And in fact in Software & Control, R&D as a percentage of sales is actually double digits. So we continue to preserve that going forward. I think that as we look at getting back to those growth rates, let me also say that after we get past the reset, the very high growth in 2023 17%, top line growth, obviously the decline last year and then the guide for this year, we still hold, and we'll talk more about this in a couple weeks, but we still hold to that framework both in terms of top line as well as margin expectations. And so, while we've made some cuts that are to align the cost structure of the business with current business conditions and incoming orders, some of what we're doing is structural for that long-term as well. We talked about the structural capacity investments that we're making. I just mentioned the continued investment in R&D. So I don't see a sharp snap back because we've been pretty surgical about the cuts that we've made to make sure that we're not cutting the lifeline to future acceleration back to the growth that we talked about at Investor Day last year. Julian Mitchell : That's very helpful. Thanks, Blake. And maybe just a shorter term second question for the 2025 guidance. So just on the segment margin point, it's 19% for the year, I just wanted to check, was that the low to mid-teens margin comment for Q1? Was that a segment margin comment? And so you sort of and off that Q1 margin starting point, do we assume you sort of take the margin up 200 or 300 basis points sequentially each quarter to get to 19% for the year? Is that the right framework? And maybe in that context, Christian, just to clarify, I know you don't want to talk quarterly earnings, but have a different way maybe first half, let's say, I think first half is often 45% of EPS in recent years. Is it maybe sort of 40% or so this year? Christian Rothe : Yes, Julian, thanks for the question. So as we think about that sequential as we go through the year, it should continue to improve. That was segment margins that we talked about in the first quarter. So yes, that low to mid-teens number that we, that I discussed was about the segment margin side. And yes, we do expect that that should ramp as the year goes on. In order to get to that 19%. I'm not really going to talk too much about first half, second half, but I do understand the math that you're doing there. Julian Mitchell : Great, thank you. Christian Rothe : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Joseph O'Dea: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Hi. I wanted to start on intelligent devices and the outlook for the first quarter. We've actually seen revenue on a quarterly trend in 2024 in a pretty stable range and it looks like what you're outlining is that sequentially from 4Q to 1Q would be down like $120 million. So much larger than what we've seen over the course of 2024 swings. Can you just kind of elaborate on what you're seeing there, destock end market regions, just to understand the drivers of that, step down a little more? Christian Rothe : Yes, so that step down, if you think about the fact that as we were going through the sequentials in 2024, each quarter there was some shipment of backlog that was happening. So the shipments were outstripping the incoming order rate during that period of time and on top of that, we do have some seasonal lows that are happening in the first quarter. So that's, that's a headwind for us in the first quarter and the configured order business is going to be off somewhat well in the first quarter. Joseph O'Dea: Got it. That's helpful. And then just in terms of any color around kind of end markets versus channel effects, when we think about inventory management over the course of 2024 in the channel, I think when we look at the combination of intelligent devices and Software & Control revenue down roughly $1 billion year-over-year. Just high level and any context on kind of end market versus destock contributions to that? Can we think about it as roughly a third of it could have been channel management versus end market trends? Anything there would be helpful. Blake Moret : Yes, I don't know that I can quantify the relative split because they're interrelated because the velocity of your destock is dependent on end user demand pulling it out of the channel. But the first part of last year of 2024, the effects of just that overstock were more pronounced. The underlying end user to market, end user demand was actually positive, we think. And then towards the end of the year, as we talked about in the last couple of calls, some weakening spread in those end demands and we're at a point where I think it's really most informative to talk about the end user demand. Again, they're linked. There's a little bit of stock left in the channel but it goes as end user demand goes. And so that's really going to be the biggest item as we look at the development in the year. The biggest impact of that will be on the product centric vertical. So think about Automotive where most of our business is done through products going through distributors and some machine builders. Food & Beverage, where packaging is actually, a very large percentage of the total business going into Food & Beverage and that's a product type go to market in those cases. So that's where you see the most of it as opposed to for instance in Oil & Gas or Life Sciences where you have a higher percentage that comes from Digital Services & Engineered Solutions. Joseph O'Dea: I appreciate the color. Thank you. Blake Moret : Yes, thanks Joe. Aijana Zellner : Julianne, we'll take one more question. Operator : Certainly our last question today will come from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Noah Kaye : Yes, thanks. Just a clarification on the guide. You called out some of the non-R&D investments but the nature of those sounded more like facility expansions. So just give us a bit more color on these investments and why they're OpEx versus CapEx? Blake Moret : Yes, it's a mix and in some of these there's a mix of OpEx and CapEx as you said. Some of it is facilities expanding cubic to be able to manage the really strong growth in the data center portion of your business. We do have a new facility in India that's providing some additional resilience in the Asian region for us and then digital infrastructure within IT, as we make sure that for internal productivity as well as external productivity with our partners we've got a business system and digital services that is world-class. So those are some of the investments that we're making. We talked about them on the waterfall because of the OpEx portion but there's a little bit of CapEx for those as well. Noah Kaye : That's helpful. Thanks Blake. See you in a couple weeks. Blake Moret : Yes. Thank you. Operator : I will now turn the call back over to Ms. Zellner for closing remarks. Aijana Zellner : Thank you for joining us today. That concludes today's conference call. Operator : At this time you may disconnect. Thank you.",

I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. Later in the call, we will open up the lines for questions. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Aijana Zellner, Head of Investor Relations and Market Strategy. Miss Zellner, please go ahead. Aijana Zellner : Thank you, Julian. Good morning. And thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation, Inc.'s First Quarter Fiscal 2025 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO, and Christian Rothe, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include, and our call today will reference, non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next thirty days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings. So with that, I'll hand it over to Blake. Blake Moret : Thanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'll make a couple of general comments before we turn to our first quarter results. I'm pleased with the early benefits of our renewed focus on operational excellence and cost discipline as we create a solid foundation for market-beating growth and performance. Continuing benefits from cost reductions in SG&A we took last year will be joined with benefits from reduced costs of direct and indirect purchases, manufacturing efficiency, and additional price actions. Overall, our plan to achieve $250 million worth of productivity benefits versus last year is intact, despite additional temporary headwinds such as the negative impact of currency. Additionally, we are confident that we are dealing with the recently announced tariffs in a way that mitigates the impact and maximizes our position as a large US manufacturer. We've been working on various scenarios since before the election. Undoubtedly, there will be near-term disruptions and volatility in the global supply chain both for us and our customers, but we continue to believe Rockwell Automation, Inc. is a net beneficiary of policies that increase US manufacturing. Christian will cover some of the actions we are taking later in his section. In terms of demand, we are encouraged by better-than-expected order performance in the quarter. We had mid-single digits sequential growth overall, with sequential growth across all regions and business segments. Orders exceeded shipments in the quarter, giving us some additional backlog for the balance of the year. While there is still macroeconomic and policy uncertainty weighing on customers' CapEx plans, Rockwell Automation, Inc. won multi-million dollar strategic orders across multiple key industries in the quarter, especially in the US, our home market. Let's now turn to our Q1 results on slide three. Our Q1 orders grew 10% versus the prior year and, as I said, were up mid-single digits sequentially. We saw particularly strong orders for Logix controllers and IO. We believe our order outperformance reflects true underlying demand based on the broad geographic outperformance, balanced mix of hardware, software, and solutions orders, and the fact that distributor and machine builder inventories continue to reduce. As customers are waiting for more certainty in the macroeconomic and US policy environment, they're balancing their automation spend between increasing operational efficiency and making longer-term capital investments. Our Q1 order outperformance includes a number of large customer projects that are slated to convert to sales over the coming quarters. Our Q1 reporting sales declined about 8.5% year over year, with slightly better-than-expected organic sales being offset by about a point of headwind from negative currency translation. Remember, our sales in the first half of fiscal 2024 were still supported by a sizable product backlog, creating a difficult year-over-year comparison for us in fiscal 2025. We expect to return to year-over-year sales growth in the back half of the year. Organic sales in our Intelligent Devices segment were down 12% versus the prior year and in line with our expectations. Both CUBIC and ClearPath, our recent acquisitions in this segment, saw double-digit year-over-year growth in sales. We continue to grow our pipeline of multiyear projects here with significant wins across our key industries and global customers. I'll touch on some of these wins in a few minutes. Software and control organic sales declined about 12% year over year but were above our expectations. Logix exceeded our expectations this quarter, with both orders and sales at double digits versus the prior quarter. Logix orders have recovered sequentially during the last six months. Some of our newer offerings we talked about at our investor day in November continue to set us apart and help get new customers. One of these competitive wins in the quarter was with Convergex Automation Solutions, a leading global machine builder who's partnering with Rockwell Automation, Inc. to help a German end user with their first US greenfield plant. The customer chose our cloud-enabled Optix platform for its hardware-agnostic nature and its ability to seamlessly extract and aggregate data from various devices on a plant floor, significantly reducing the time, risk, and cost to integrate solutions for multiple vendors. Lifecycle services organic sales were up 5% year over year. Book to bill in this segment was 1.05, led by strong orders in our solutions business and tied to some of the larger multiyear project wins I mentioned earlier. We also saw good growth in recurring services, with strategic wins across automotive, tire, and food and beverage. Total ARR for the company grew 11% in the quarter, led by strong growth in our software offerings. One of our notable wins here this quarter was with Morocco, whose dairy factory is powered by renewable geothermal energy and has one of the lowest manufacturing carbon footprints in the industry. Our cloud-native Plex software was chosen to help Morocco enhance their product traceability, improve quality, and reduce cost. Segment margin was over 17% in the quarter, and adjusted EPS was $1.83, both well above our expectations as we continue to execute on our cost-out and longer-term margin expansion projects. As we reiterated at our Investor Day a few months ago, we are committed to delivering $250 million in year-over-year benefits from these actions in fiscal 2025. In addition to this structural productivity, we're deploying temporary cost measures to help mitigate the unfavorable currency impact on our earnings. Christian will cover this in more detail later. Turning to slide four, to review key highlights of our Q1 industry segment performance, consistent with our overall sales results in the quarter, our performance by industry reflects difficult year-over-year comparisons with Q1 of last year still benefiting from a large product backlog. Our discrete sales were down mid-single digits year over year with declines in auto and semi, partially offset by strong growth in e-commerce and warehouse automation. Within discrete, automotive and semiconductor sales continue to be impacted by delays as customers focus on driving operational efficiencies and profitability amidst increasing uncertainty from trade and policy changes in the upcoming months. E-commerce and warehouse automation sales grew over 30% versus the prior year and were above our expectations. We saw a significant uptick of customer activity this quarter, especially in North America and Europe. A strong position with leading machine builders and systems integrators in this space is helping us gain additional share of wallet with key end users, both in the traditional e-commerce space and global logistics sector, with a common theme of facility modernization and optimization. Recent new product introductions have also enhanced our competitiveness in this vertical. Given the acceleration in customer investments, we now expect e-commerce and warehouse automation to grow high single digits year over year in fiscal 2025. Moving to hybrid, sales in this industry segment were slightly above our expectations, led by better performance in food and beverage and home and personal care verticals. In food and beverage, our customers continue to prioritize spend on digital services and modernization programs over large capacity investments. We expect modest improvement in this vertical as we go through the year. In life sciences, we saw a number of strategic wins in the quarter, showcasing the breadth and differentiation of our offerings to serve this market. In addition to follow-on orders for GLP-1 related investments, we secured a large competitive win with our FactoryTalk MES software, helping one of the largest European life sciences companies standardize their global facilities on our platform to increase tech transfer speed and reduce cost. Another important win this quarter was with Thermo Fisher. Our autonomous mobile robots were selected to help address Thermo's workforce challenges by optimizing their warehouses through Otto's AI-enabled path determination and movement flexibility, freeing up labor to focus on more value-adding tasks. Turning to process industries, sales in these verticals were down high single digits year over year on difficult prior year comps, especially within our energy market where oil and gas grew over 25% in Q1 of last year. While the new administration's support for more oil production in North America should benefit our customers in the long run, we see a mixed reaction from our energy customers near term as they continue to prioritize capital discipline and operational efficiency over adding more production in the US. This quarter, Rockwell Automation, Inc. and EPIC Industrial, a leading EPC company in the energy and chemical space, were chosen by one of the world's largest oil and gas producers to help achieve this end user's goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Another important process win was in our mining vertical. Vale selected Rockwell Automation, Inc. to help increase production and reduce water consumption at their new processing plant in Brazil. Our winning combination of integrated hardware, software, and services is the reason Vale chose Rockwell Automation, Inc. as their single partner to integrate end-to-end solutions for this greenfield. Let's turn to slide five in our Q1 organic regional sales. As you can see, the Americas continue to outperform other regions for us this quarter. EMEA sales were down 14%. We continue to see weakness across most of the region, particularly in Germany and France, with some early signs of stabilization at Italian machine builders. Asia Pacific sales declined 9%, led by a double-digit year-over-year decline in China. While the automation market in the region is expected to stabilize later in 2025, we expect Asia Pacific to be our weakest region in fiscal 2025. Let's now move to slide six to review our fiscal 2025 outlook. We continue to expect a gradual sequential sales improvement as we move through this fiscal year. We're keeping our organic sales growth range of positive 2% to negative 4%, but we are updating our reported sales midpoint to $8.1 billion, reflecting 1.5 points of negative contribution from currency translation. Christian will cover FX and the calendarization of our guidance in more detail later on the call. Annual recurring revenue is projected to grow about 10% this year. As I mentioned earlier, we are taking additional cost measures to offset the negative impact of currency headwinds on our bottom line, which means we continue to expect segment margin in the 19% range and are reaffirming our adjusted EPS of $9.20 at the midpoint. We expect free cash flow conversion of 100% in fiscal year 2025. I'll now turn it over to Christian to provide more detail on our Q1 and financial outlook for fiscal 2025. Christian? Christian Rothe : Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide seven, first quarter key financial information. First quarter reported sales were down about 8.5% versus the prior year. The impact of acquisitions was negligible, and currency had a negative impact of 90 basis points in the quarter. But one point of our organic growth came from price, and price cost was favorable. Segment operating margin was 17.1% compared to 17.3% a year ago, but lower sales volume was mostly offset by the benefits of cost reduction and margin expansion actions Blake mentioned earlier. Adjusted EPS is $1.83, above our expectations primarily due to the beat on segment operating margins. I'll get into more detail when we discuss the EPS bridge and the cost reduction actions. I'd like to take a moment to commend the team for outstanding performance in the first quarter. It was about strong execution and good cost controls. The adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter was 17.5%, below the prior year rate of 17.9%. We remain on track to achieve a 17% ETR for fiscal 2025. Free cash flow of $293 million was $328 million higher than the prior year. Free cash flow conversion was 140% in the first quarter of this year, reflective of continued working capital management by the team as well as zero incentive payout on fiscal 2024 performance. This is in contrast to the first quarter of last year where we had our cash bonus payout for 2023 performance. Two additional items not shown on the slide : we repurchased approximately 400,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $99 million. On December 31st, we had approximately $1.2 billion remaining under our repurchase authorization. Return on invested capital was 14.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, 400 basis points lower than the prior year, primarily driven by lower pretax income. Slide eight provides the sales and margin performance overview for our three operating segments. Intelligent Devices margin of 14.9% decreased by 130 basis points year over year. Purely focusing on detrimental conversion, the segment had decrementals in the 20s year over year in the first quarter, which reflects strong execution on cost-out programs against the double-digit organic sales decline. Software and Control margin of 25.1% was flat with the prior year. This segment typically has very high decrementals, but strong execution on our cost-out programs and good price cost performance kept our year-over-year decremental margins in the 20s, performing above our expectations. It's important to note that R&D spend in this segment was in the low teens as a percentage of sales, reflecting our continued focus on new product introductions and long-term growth differentiation. Lifecycle Services margin of 12.5% decreased 190 basis points year over year and was slightly below our expectations, mostly driven by Sensia shipments. Incrementals were solid year over year, reflecting the low single-digit volume growth and strong execution on our cost-out programs. Before moving on to EPS, let's just stay a little on orders and demand. As Blake mentioned, orders came in better than expected, surpassing $2 billion in the first quarter, and book to bill was greater than one, which hasn't been the case for the last seven quarters. This is a good sign, but didn't materially change the calendarization of our outlook. The outperformance was largely from project orders scheduled to ship later in the year. Another favorable data point : in the first quarter, new demand placed on our distributors is flowing through at close to 100% in terms of new orders on Rockwell Automation, Inc., matching historical levels, giving us further evidence that the destocking cycle is mostly behind us. The next slide, nine, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q1 fiscal 2024 to Q1 fiscal 2025. Core performance was down $0.55 on an 8% organic sales decrease. Those sales declines were primarily in our higher margin products, in both Intelligent Devices and Software and Control, which impacts flow through. Importantly, the organization took some temporary cost measures in Q1, which helped keep the core detrimental flow through on the high single-digit sales decline to this level. Cost reduction and margin expansion actions, which reflect more structural productivity, provided about $70 million of benefit in Q1, slightly above our expectations, and were a $0.50 tailwind. Compensation, which reflects merit and incentive compensation, was a $0.20 headwind. This year-over-year delta reflects merit increases that came into effect at the beginning of the fiscal year, as well as higher incentive comp versus the prior year. Recall that our full-year 2025 guide, which for compensation and inflation to be about a $190 million headwind compared to fiscal 2025, with $160 million of that coming from compensation. The inflation impact is captured inside a core in this bridge. We expect compensation to be about $0.90 of headwind, the remaining three quarters of the year spread about equally. All other items resulted in a $0.04 net benefit. Moving on to the next slide ten to discuss our updated guidance for the full year fiscal 2025. Our thesis for the year remains largely intact with a couple of changes. We expect organic sales in a range from negative 4% to positive 2%. While our initial guide for reported revenue for fiscal 2025 did not anticipate any significant impacts from currency, the recent strengthening of the dollar requires a modification in our guide. At current rates, we expect currency headwind to be about 1.5 points, which takes our guidance on reported sales down to slightly below $8.1 billion at the midpoint. We expect price to contribute about a point of growth for the year. This excludes any tariff-related price actions. At the midpoint of our reported sales guidance, which is now negative 2.5%, our current expectations are for Intelligent Devices sales to be down mid-single digits, and Software and Control and Lifecycle Services to be approximately flat year over year. From a margin standpoint, we expect ITD margin to be down year over year on lower sales. Software and Control margins to expand year over year on flat sales, and we expect Lifecycle Services margin to be flat to slightly down year over year. Our adjusted EPS range is unchanged at $8.60 to $9.80, with a $9.20 midpoint. Talk about calendarization. The dollar strengthening late in the first quarter has continued into the second quarter and is a sequential headwind of less than one point. Expectations for reported sales grow low to mid-single digits sequentially from Q1 to Q2. After Q2, we're expecting gradual sequential sales growth through the remainder of the year. On a year-over-year basis, the 1.5 points of sales headwind from FX is expected to result in a $0.35 headwind on EPS, split evenly to the remaining three quarters of the year. As Blake said earlier, we're taking additional temporary measures on spending to offset this impact. The team performed well in spending control in the first quarter. We're going to hold those reins tight and continue to drive towards that adjusted EPS midpoint of $9.20. Just look at Q2, we expect segment operating margins to expand about 100 basis points sequentially on the incremental sales volume, resulting in EPS up. Those sales and margin expectations would be in the neighborhood of $2 per share. A few additional comments on fiscal 2025 guidance for remodels. Corporate and other expense is expected to be around $145 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2025 is expected to be about $140 million. We're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 113 million and share repurchases targeted during the year. Moving away from the slides, I'd like to expand on a couple of topics. First, focusing on cost reduction and margin expansion activities, which gave us a benefit of approximately $0.50 of EPS in the first quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect a benefit of $250 million or about $1.85 per share. As discussed at our investor day in November, there are hundreds of projects supporting these initiatives. And while each one individually may only be a couple of basis points or ten basis points of yield, when put together and annualized, they are giving us a yield in the hundreds of basis points. The timing and magnitude continue to fluctuate as we execute against these plans. The first quarter was a good one. We tracked slightly ahead of our goal for the quarter. The primary driver of the outperformance was manufacturing efficiencies and effective sourcing. There's a lot of year left in front of us, a great deal of work to be done, but I'd like to thank the team for their efforts. Nice work. While you may see this initiative as cost, because that's what we're tracking and reporting to our investors, it's important to note that the ultimate goal is product competitiveness and speed. These actions are setting us up for long-term growth of both sales and earnings. To that end, I want to follow up on some other operational excellence topics from our investor day. The Rockwell Automation, Inc. operating model continues to develop as we build the foundation for sustaining our long-term cost-out initiatives as well as drive margin expansion for the long term. During the first quarter, we had another 1,300 Rockwell Automation, Inc. employees complete yellow belt training. In addition, we rationalized over 21,000 SKUs as we seek to simplify our operations and improve customer experience. Our product resiliency index continues to improve as we steadily reduce single points of failure in our operations. While those initial efforts arose from the supply chain crisis, as we enter into an era of changing tariffs and trade, resiliency enables us to respond to dynamic conditions. Moving on, I'd like to go into some depth around the potential tariff impact on our business, including our short-term actions as well as longer-term thoughts. As Blake mentioned earlier, the Rockwell Automation, Inc. team has taken initial steps in response to new tariffs. We've planned for a number of scenarios and remain ready to adapt quickly. Our priorities are a combination of maintaining profitability and utilizing resiliency in our operations and supply chain to mitigate impacts under a variety of scenarios. I want to size our exposure so you have context. The cost of finished goods imported from Mexico, Canada, and China in total were less than 10% of our US revenue in fiscal 2024. Separately, in fiscal 2024, our direct imports into the United States from Mexico, both from third parties as well as from our own manufacturing facilities, were approximately $350 million. Imports from Canada and China were each approximately $100 million. Our tariff mitigation plan is multifaceted. For the near term, this will be primarily through price, and we have implemented price changes from the additional China tariffs that were enacted on February 4th. We have made and will continue to make changes to manufacturing locations where there's an attractive ROI. Canada and Mexico tariffs, if they happen in March or sometime in the future, will impact both standard products as well as a portion of our configured order sales. We will enact price increases on impacted products and also intend to reprice our backlog to reflect our new price list. These actions are disruptive for our customers, of course, and there will likely be some noise in the near term. We are working hard to minimize that disruption and ensure continued levels of customer service. With that said, due to our immediate actions and substantial US manufacturing footprint, we do not expect these tariffs to have a material impact on our profitability for the full year. Beyond pricing, we have a number of projects that are in flight to mitigate tariff costs through alternative sourcing and movement of production locations. We'll be leveraging the resiliency that's been built into our operations and supply chain, including movements in production in response to tariffs. For example, we have some products that are produced in Mexico and destined for the US, but similar production that occurs in the US where the destination is outside the United States. We're swapping those out, leaving the production for non-US customers outside the US in order to create capacity to manufacture production for US customers inside the US. It's a small portion of our overall tariff-impacted operations but a good example of quick moves we can make. As Mike mentioned at our Investor Day, our operations team has done a good job of keeping infrastructure in place for second shift, sometimes third shift in locations, that have been challenged with lower volume in the last twelve months. That creates an opportunity to move production into the US to avoid tariffs with a limited time lag. As you know, we're in a very dynamic environment, so we will continue to leverage our agile supply chain and take additional steps as necessary. With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Blake Moret : Thanks, Christian. As I mentioned, we're seeing some encouraging new project activity across multiple end markets. Many of these involve US user sites, but they involve multiple points of influence around the world. And we're doing a good job of coordinating this global effort. We expect the impact of so-called mega projects to be meaningful in the next few years. We continue to track new legislation and executive orders as they are announced. With our large US manufacturing footprint and strong market position, we're confident that we can respond quickly to these changes. I'm pleased with the progress our teams are making toward our long-term productivity and margin expansion targets, and I'm confident we are making the right investments to drive sustained growth and profitability. The framework for superior growth and performance through the cycle that we outlined over a year ago is intact, and we are working that plan. I'm also taking a moment to thank our employees and partners for their dedication and hard work. I'm proud to have such a strong team to help us navigate through this dynamic period. Nobody is better positioned than Rockwell Automation, Inc. and our partners to help American manufacturers create the future of industrial operations. Aijana will now begin the Q&A session. Aijana Zellner : Thanks, Blake. We would like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Julian, let's take our first question. Operator : Certainly. As a reminder, to ask a question, please press 1 on your telephone keypad. Our first question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Hey. Good morning, guys. Blake and Christian, Aijana. Good morning. Hey. I want to start with this SKU rationalization thing because it's kind of relatively new-ish for you guys. And 21,000 sounds like a lot. I know you sell a lot of stuff, so maybe it's not. But in context, it sounds like a lot. But are there puts and takes on how that impacts 2025? Meaning, I would have expected maybe some top-line impact but perhaps an offsetting impact on margins. Is there any way to kind of drill down into that a little bit? Christian Rothe : Yeah. Sure, Scott. I'll start. And if Blake wants to jump in afterwards, he can certainly do so. But from the SKU rationalization, what's to be really honest here is that this hasn't been done in the history of Rockwell Automation, Inc. So really, we're starting with the low-hanging fruits. That 21,000 really reflects a lot of no-sales and low-sales SKUs. So from an impact perspective within the year, you should be thinking about it as any impact at all or no significance of impact. It's really, again, trying to help us streamline those operations. As we get farther along in the process, we've got another 39,000 that we're looking at right now, that will continue to have a little bit more of an adjustment, but again, don't expect it to have a material impact. Blake Moret : Yeah. And this is think of this as part of a spectrum of activities as we go in and take a little bit closer look at the total SKU portfolio. As Christian mentioned, you have those that are easy to reduce from our bills of material. And then look at what are the items that we might want to keep, but we can do something with price on. Beyond just the general price increases that we do. So we're working through that in a methodical way. I expect this activity to continue on an ongoing basis, but the early results, as you said, are significant because when you can reduce those catalog items, then it reduces the ability for those items to attract cost in some way as they move through the manufacturing footprint. Scott Davis : Yeah. That makes sense. Hey, guys. This was a more, I think, upbeat and positive call than you've had in a few quarters. And orders obviously supportive of that and a lot of progress you've made on the margin side for sure. Incrementals certainly way better than you had in the past. But when you think about the guidance for 2025, on just organic growth, considering the orders that you had in the commentary, would you expect that there's a little bit of a positive bias to that guidance? Is that fair to say? Would you characterize that you're still being just a little bit conservative and appropriately so, I suppose, given the state of affairs in the world, but it appears it got a bit conservative. Would you characterize it as that? Blake Moret : Scott, there's no question we had a good start to the year. As we've been saying, we expected gradual sequential growth through the year, overperformed a little bit in orders, so we're happy to see that early in the year. But it still keeps our thesis intact. We needed to see growth. We've started off with growth, and we expect to see that continue through the year. Scott Davis : Okay. Fair enough. Best of luck, guys. Thank you. Aijana Zellner : Thanks. Operator : Next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. Nice quarter. Hey, Andy. Christian. Orders up mid-single digits sequentially. I know you had five six expectations. Can you give us more color in terms of what you think happened in the quarter? It seems based on Christian's comments that maybe lack of destock was slightly better than expectations. And you did mention, Blake, the improvement in e-commerce. You sound a little better on hybrid and food and beverage and life sciences. How much of that improvement is actually getting better versus your improved product offering? And did the positive order trend you saw in fiscal Q1 continue in January? Blake Moret : Yeah. I think the performance in Q1 and then January, which does support the outlook for Q2 and the balance of the year, does represent some improvement in the underlying market. As Christian said, we saw the orders, the new demand placed on our distributors pretty much right on top of the new demand that we're seeing, which indicates that the destock of our market is pretty much done. In most parts, possible exception of China. It's broad-based. Importantly, it was manifested in the hybrid space with food and beverage and home and personal care. We mentioned that we saw some green shoots in Italian builders, which is mainly packaging, for life sciences, including beverage. Within the discrete space, automotive is still a challenge. But as we mentioned, e-commerce, warehouse automation, is quite strong. That includes a few areas. It includes e-commerce as new fulfillment centers are being built. It includes the modest exposure we have to data centers, but that modest exposure is growing really fast. And then it's parcel handling companies that are looking to complement scarce people with technology, and we're seeing some really good projects in parcel handling companies. And this is also where we mentioned new product introductions, our on-machine portfolio, FactoryTalk Optix for operator interface and edge data management, autonomous mobile robots, all of those are playing a role. They're not only winning on their own merit, but for precisely the reason that we acquired these companies, they're pulling through larger solutions as customers are confident that we have the breadth to be able to meet their needs. And I'll finish by saying, you know, process we're not seeing a weakening in oil and gas. More of the performance there was based on very strong comps or difficult comps in the first quarter of last year when oil and gas was up 25%, but we continue to expect energy to contribute positive growth in the year, and then mining within the process industry is also a source of optimism. Andy Kaplowitz : Very helpful, Blake. And then, Christian, your cost reduction and margin expansion actions, as you said, were at $0.50 in Q1, $1.85 expected for the year. Think, Christian, at the Investor Day, you mentioned the cost actions from your combined overall cost program. We're going to continue to ramp as 2025 evolves. And you mentioned slightly more positive impact, any mild insourcing and manufacturing in Q1. So do you actually see a little more benefit than that $1.85? I know it's early, but how would you respond to that? Christian Rothe : Yeah. And it's really more about the timing of those. So we did certainly I think we've understood the timing and magnitude is always going to be a little bit tough for us to gauge. And so some did come through a little bit earlier in the year, in the first quarter than what we'd expected. Didn't see anything in there though that would say that we would be changing that number. And so, you know, from the perspective of the overall program, the size program is still the same. Keep in mind that this program really started in the second half of last year. So as we're coming up against those comparables, as we get into the second half of this year, again, we're going to be building on that base, but we have to make progress against the cost that were already in place from the prior year. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Snyder from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Chris Snyder : Thank you. I wanted to just kind of follow-up on some of that commentary around orders here improving into December quarter. Do you think that there was any positive impact of moving past the election? You know, we heard from a lot of companies in late summer and the fall that there was maybe some freezing ahead of the election. So do you think that had any impact whether it's, you know, some of these projects moving forward or, you know, distributors or integrators just willing to hold a little bit more product, you know, given improved expectations? Blake Moret : I think there's a little bit of that. I think as we've talked to customers, really around the world, but especially here in our home market, there is a general optimism. Now that being said, there's obviously remaining volatility which offsets a bit of that. But the general mood out there as evidenced by PMI in the US, you know, finally getting above fifty for the first time in a long time, is that there's a general optimism and these companies can't wait to get on with their plans for increasing efficiency or transforming their operations. And at some point, they're all concerned about waiting too long and losing share to companies that move more assertively. So I think we did see a little bit of that as evidenced by the broad-based project activity that we mentioned in the first quarter. Chris Snyder : Thank you. I appreciate that. And then for my follow-up, maybe one for Christian. So software and control margins, obviously, a real standout this quarter, up year on year despite double-digit revenue decline. I guess, what should we expect the rest of the year there for margins? Because it seems like revenue should continue to build sequentially as the year goes on. And I would think with that, those volumes lift up margins for the segment as the year goes on. Thank you. Christian Rothe : Yeah. Sure, Chris. So, yeah, as the year goes on, you know, again, we talked about Clearbit mix and Blake specifically mentioned Logix and IO being nice contributors in the quarter. And, you know, as we talked about for the full year, we are expecting that that business year over year is going to be in that flat range, which should get some expanded margin. So really nice start to the year. You know, from an overall margin perspective, again, we're just looking for that to continue to progress gradually during the course of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Oh, yes. Hi. Good morning. Maybe my first question was just around trying to understand, again, sorry, to go back to the orders and know, understood. Year on year is up double digits, but also very depressed base a year ago. So maybe if we think about the book to bill, it's a bit easier. I think maybe that was about 1.07 in your first quarter. I imagine it's always above one early in the year, below one second half of the year. So is there any sort of historical context you could put around that book to bill kind of what is it typically in the first quarter, company-wide, you know, anyway you could sort of flesh that out and how we should think about that book to bill moving over the balance of the year? Blake Moret : Yeah. Julian, I don't know that we have as reliable a correlation in orders at the beginning of the year. As we do with what you mentioned, and that is at the end of the year, certainly Q4, you know, you can typically count on higher shipments particularly in our configured order and lifecycle services business. We did see orders a little bit better than expectations in the first quarter. We mentioned mid-single digit growth overall. Products were actually a little bit better than that in terms of sequential growth. And products in terms of orders probably are affected by calendarization the least, you know, unless it has to do with, you know, holidays, you know, typical in one quarter or the other. So to be sure, the performance was a little bit better than expected in the first quarter and then as we mentioned January performance was consistent with our outlook for Q2 and the rest of the year. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much. And then just to understand the differences between sort of intelligent devices versus software and control. So it looks like in intelligent devices, maybe the channel or your partners are a bit further behind in the destocking, whereas Logix and software and control you're firmly in the sort of early stage of an upturn. I just wondered if that's a fair characterization and what sort of typical operating leverage we should expect from Logix in a sales recovery? Blake Moret : Yeah. I think you can also look at the performance of Logix as being impacted by the reduction of any excess inventory in our machine builders. Obviously, Logix was foundational to the solutions that our machine builders around the world use. And it was recovering, to be sure, from a low base at the very beginning of last year. Now, intelligent devices is a broader set of SKUs relatively than software and control hardware. It has to be said, intelligent devices does have a lot of exposure to automotives, which as we've mentioned, hasn't really hit that same growth curve that some of the industries have. So that's a little bit of additional color for you on the relative performance between those two sets of hardware. Christian Rothe : Maybe I'll just add one other thing around the configured order portion of the business. In Intelligent Devices. Typically starts the first quarter of which is usually low as well. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Joe O'Dea: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Good morning. On the cost out and the $250 million and I think, you know, a little more than half of that on the COGS side, you just talk about the status of actions there with respect to, I think, a year that's framed as, you know, COGS really kicking in some of the contribution to cost savings in the back half of the year. But of that $130 million, you know, any sense of how much has been actioned? How much will be actioned by the time you start the first half or the second half of the year? Christian Rothe : Yeah. Joe, there's a lot of that's already in flight. And certainly some of that and the timing of those coming in already in the first quarter. And again, that will continue to ramp as the year goes on. The delta that we saw from those activities in the first quarter really did come from manufacturing efficiency and sourcing, so really areas that are going to impact COGS. And that was a pretty broad range, everything from freeing up some additional capacity, which reduced some overtime at a couple of our facilities, that also actually, those facilities had some better improvements in quality, which reduced material expense. We also implemented barcode scanning at a number of facilities. During the season really good. Early wins in that regard. Logistics gave us a touch of outperformance in the quarter. And then I would also say on the material side, and these are smaller dollar items as far as the delta impact, but again, important. So things like metal fab, raws, stamping, all of which contributed a few hundred thousand dollars each to that outperformance we saw in the first quarter. So momentum is building. It's going well. We're pretty happy with it so far. And again, you're going to see more that that helps in the second half. Joe O'Dea: Then just wanted to circle back on channel inventories. Pretty encouraging of you that, you know, at this point in time, a lot of that is sorted out. Think, you know, previously, maybe, you know, some timing expectation it would take until, you know, second quarter, maybe even drift into third quarter. So perhaps that's sorting out a little faster than anticipated. But just regionally, if you talk about kind of North America, say Europe in particular, because it seemed like that was still an inventory overhang up until recently. And then it sounds like maybe China is the only area left that you would say, you know, still has some drag effect. But just any regional color on what you've seen there over the past couple of months? Blake Moret : Yeah. I think you characterized the shape of it. You know, biggest factor in North America would be distribution so much of our business goes through distributors. And that's mostly done at this point. In Europe, the inventory at big machine builders is an important factor. And the relatively high sequential growth in orders that we saw in Europe, we think is indicative of that playing out and normalizing there. And as you said, you know, China might take into end of Q2, Q3, but it's a small part of our business. As China's total revenue is now a little bit less than 5% of our total revenue. Joe O'Dea: Great. Thank you. Yes. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Chagusa Kotoko : Hi. This is Chagusa Kotoko on for Steve. Thanks for taking my question. Just a little bit more on the first half to second half ramp. It's still the first half seasonality still seems a little weaker than historical seasonality. And you mentioned before you booked some orders during this quarter that or some big orders that are expected to ship in toward the end of the year. If you could provide some any more color on what's going to support the first half to second half ramp, that would be great. Blake Moret : Yeah. Thanks for your question. We do see as we enter the year an expectation for gradual sequential improvement through the year. And actually, the year started from an order standpoint a little bit better than expected, which reduces that ramp from first half to second half. Chagusa Kotoko : Okay. Thank you. And then on the second quarter, if you were to do similar decremental margins to the first quarter, it looks like there's some upside to the $2 and EPS that you mentioned, but is there any reason you can't do similar decrementals to the first quarter? Christian Rothe : Yeah. So obviously, you know, we don't go into that level of detail on our guide. We are expecting, you know, sequentially that we're going to see margin expansion on segment operating margins going through 17% to that 18% kind of number, which again, is consistent with our ramp that we talked about for the full year guide. At the outset of our guide in last quarter's call, but also just reiterating that in this call as well. So no, as far as the modeling year over year, we'll leave that up to you to take a look at that. Chagusa Kotoko : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andre Adams : Hi there. This is Andre Adams on for Noah. Could you give us more color on some of the drivers of margin outside the quarter, and what the contribution was between mix versus cost action and how mix factors into the reiterated segment margin guidance and the EPS outlook given FX headwinds? Christian Rothe : Yeah. Sure. Let me just I'll go after this and let me know if I answered the question properly. But really, I believe your question is around just generally the outperformance versus where our original thesis was for the quarter. If we break that out, there were kind of three primary drivers behind it. The first portion was that we did have a favorable mix. That is the software and control business performed better than what we had expected, against the lifecycle business, which was a little bit below our expectations. So careful mix was the first side. And the second one was that as Blake discussed and I also discussed, we had these temporary cost measures that the organization performed really well against. You'll see that inside of our core in that bridge schedule. And then the last one was that we also had a better performance on our cost reduction and margin expansion activities that was expected to be more equal throughout the year, kind of leading up to that $150 million for the full year. We had a little bit of outperformance there. So all three of those are about equal as far as helping us to perform in the first quarter. Andre Adams : Great. Thank you. And just as a follow-up, microproject still seen as a tailwind for fiscal 2025. Can you just talk about any impact of the funding pause for IRA, IIJA, loans program office funding on the magnitude of that tailwind? Blake Moret : Sure. We do continue to see mega projects as a tailwind, both in terms of year over year and as a nice contributor to our growth this year as well as for the next few years. So this is multiyear. It's multi-industry. And as we've talked to companies, for instance, in energy, about any impact, you know, that the change in administration is having on their plans, they're continuing on with those projects. So we highlighted a project by a major oil and gas company on a sustainability project this quarter, and we're tracking a lot of those through this year and into the next years. In fact, renewables in terms of new project introductions continues to be a major contributor to the new announcement. So these projects are going to have to stand on their own merit. They're going to have to have a good ROI, but we think there's a lot of those out there whether it's direct air capture, carbon capture and sequestration, and so on. And then, obviously, in terms of traditional development of energy resources, that continues to be a big part of our business. With energy overall about 15% of our total revenue. Andre Adams : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Hey. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I just want to come back. Hey. Good morning, Blake. Just want to come back to order. Sorry. It's I guess it's for the umpteenth time on this call. But I just want to be clear on the $2 billion plus number that was given. I don't quite get there based on the year-over-year and sequential changes you talked about. Maybe my base is a little bit off, but is that a reported number, an organic number? Maybe you could be a little bit more precise on that if there's anything else to add. Christian Rothe : Yeah, Jeff. So that is a recorded number. And you know, I'm not sure exactly what the number is that you're looking at from the prior year, but we are being consistent with the metric and how we've thought about it historically. Again, knowing that, you know, we didn't always and we haven't always given the exact number on orders. It was really more of the I think a lot of folks are getting that order number based on delta, what happened with backlog versus shipments. But again, we thought it was notable that we were back over $2 billion, and we want to call that out. Jeff Sprague : Yeah. No. That's what I'm doing too. The implied orders based on backlog and revenue changes, but fine. I'll play with that. And then also just wanted to come back to kind of the cost reductions. It looks like your corporate expense actually you raised the corporate expense for the year, if I have that correctly. What is going on in that line item? Christian Rothe : Yeah. So corporate expense obviously has a number of smaller items that move around from quarter to quarter and throughout the year. Probably the biggest change in the delta on we did take that number up for the full year is really around some of the execution costs on some of the margin expansion cost reduction activities. We're going to take those on the corporate side. So that's the reason why that number went up slightly. Jeff Sprague : And maybe just one other quick one. I think you said you expect Asia Pacific to be the weakest region for the year even though EMEA is starting off weaker. Are you implicitly assuming there's kind of a tangible pickup in EMEA over the balance of the year? Do you have some visibility on that? Blake Moret : We do. Again, a lot of that business is driven by the machine builders. So we call that specifically stabilization at the Italian machine builders, and we expect, particularly because it's coming off of a low base, that that machine builder business to recover in Europe as they're back to normal in terms of their inventories. China is expected to continue to suffer from a, let's say, mild deflation through the year. So while we see some recovery, it's going to be slow, and they've got some structural challenges there. China is a small part of our business, but it's a big manufacturing economy, and so it remains important to us. And then India mid and long term, you know, continues to be very bright, but we're not expecting any heroic growth from India this year. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thank you very much. Thanks. Aijana Zellner : Julian, we'll take one more question. Operator : Certainly. Our last question today will come from Robert Mason from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Robert Mason : Yes. Good morning, Blake, Christian. Hey, Rob. Thanks for taking the question. Hey. I appreciate the level of detail you provided us around your manufacturing footprints and imports into the US from various, you know, regions, maybe tariff exposed. Could you just and I know you've made a lot of changes over the last few years around how you execute on pricing. Can you just remind us some of those changes and how quickly, I guess, you know, matter of days, weeks, what have you, would you actually be able to put through incremental price around the tariff enactment? Blake Moret : Yeah. The short answer is immediately. Tariffs can be handled a little bit different than normal price increases. But as we talked about, in the past being able to move to a fixed discount pricing structure, which was some changes that we implemented during the supply chain crisis over the last couple of years, has allowed us much faster response to general price increases. But with tariffs, we implemented them fairly quickly. The first time around back in 2018, and I would say, even more immediately, this time because the impact was potentially larger. Robert Mason : And in repricing backlog, is you know, would that be a new experience for your customers? Blake Moret : I think in general, yes, that would be. We have been very communicative around the terms and conditions and how we've been selling to those customers for some of those projects over the last several months knowing that this was a potential. Again, that's what happens when a scenario where we were imagining and indeed did seem to be the case for a little while, which was immediately around tariffs and wanted to make ensure that, you know, again, if we're incurring the cost, we're going to find a way to recover it. Robert Mason : Excellent. Thanks. I'll turn it back. Thank you. Aijana Zellner : Thank you for joining us today. That concludes today's conference call. Operator *: At this time, you may disconnect. Thank you.",
