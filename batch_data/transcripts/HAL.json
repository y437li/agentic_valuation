Morgan Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company Angie Sedita - UBS Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse Jim Crandell - Cowen Doug Becker - Bank of America Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Scott Gruber - Sanford Bernstein Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Halliburton First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Kelly Youngblood. Sir, you may begin. Kelly Youngblood : Good morning. And welcome to the Halliburton's first quarter 2014 conference call. Today\u2019s call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. The press release announcing the first quarter results is also available on the Halliburton website. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Jeff Miller, COO. I would like to remind our audience that some of today\u2019s comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events and their potential impact on our performance. These matters involve risk and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results, and cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Our comments today include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our first quarter press release which, as I have mentioned, can be found on our website. In our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of an increase to our reserve related to the Macondo litigation that was taken in the first quarter of 2013 unless otherwise noted. We will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up to allow more time for others who have questions. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave. Dave? Dave Lesar : Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. We are going to change up our format this quarter to more effectively communicate the items you've told us you want to hear. I will provide the highlights then Mark will add the financial details that will be followed by Jeff who will give the operations and technology update. So here are my highlights for our first quarter. Results played out about as expected that the earnings mix was a bit different. We had record first quarter total company revenue of $7.3 billion and operating income increased 8% over the first quarter of 2013 as a result of double-digit growth in the Eastern Hemisphere. Now let\u2019s do our outlook by key geographies. Eastern Hemisphere activity continues to expand at a steady rate and is playing out about as expected. Our forecast for the full year remains unchanged. We see customer spending levels increasing by the upper single digits and our revenue growth to be in the low double digits, and we still expect average full-year Eastern Hemisphere margins in the upper teens. Latin America came in slightly better than we projected, but we continue to believe that 2014 will be a transitional year. For the full year, we expect Latin America revenue and profit to be in line with 2013 levels. Longer term we are very optimistic about our position in Latin America and the future growth potential of this market. As Jeff will discuss, we were successful in winning over $3 billion in IPM contracts in Mexico during 2013 and the constitutional changes in Mexico seem to be progressing as planned and we believe the opportunity for foreign investment to come into this market will be very beneficial to our businesses beginning as early as 2015. Turning to North America, as you know, I went through a number of turns in the market and let me tell you, I'm starting to feel the turn. I'm starting to feel the momentum swing not only that, I'm starting to see it happen. I\u2019m more excited about North America now than I have been since late 2011. Now I could be off by a quarter or so, but I do not believe I am wrong about this turn happening. Now why is that? First, the sense of confidence I get when I talk to customers and the sense of confidence they have in their own business prospects. Supportive commodity prices today are translating into stronger cash flow than OpEx budgets for our customers and despite the logistical issues we saw in the first quarter, during March we saw record levels of revenues. Completions intensity is rising, lateral links are increasing, stage counts are rising and the average well volume pumped has increased over 30% just since last year and due to natural attrition, demand growth in the Permian, we believe that excess frac capacity has tightened much faster than expected. And we don't think we'll have any problem filling our frac calendar through the end of the year and believe we will be able to pull-through additional product lines. So how will this play out? First, we will drive efficiency leverage from our low-cost operating model. Second, we will gain incremental revenue from our customer base due to increase job sizes. And thirdly, as a result of tightening supply of equipment we can offset increases in input cost through reimbursement from our customers. And think about it, all of that comes without any help from the natural gas market. So while the first quarter margins were impacted by weather and logistical issues, this will dissipate and North American margins should rebound to second half 2013 levels in the second quarter and we continue to expect North America margins will approach 20% before the end of the year. Based on our continued confidence in our business prospects, we bought back an additional $500 million in shares during the first quarter. We still have $1.2 billion remaining in repurchase authorizations. Along with the buybacks we executed last year, we repurchased about 11% of the company since this time last year, well, also raising our quarterly dividend by 67%. Now I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Mark to provide financial details, but before I do, I want to point out that as you work through Mark's financial commentary, you will see projected earnings per share growth of approximately 25% from Q1 to Q2 and even more increases after that. That is why I am so confident we can continue to deliver industry-leading growth, margins and returns, and continue to return significant cash to our shareholders. Mark? Mark McCollum : Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with an overview of our first quarter results. In the Eastern Hemisphere revenue and operating income increased by 11% and 16%, respectively, as a result of year-over-year growth in both the Middle East/Asia and Europe, Africa, CIS regions. Sequentially, we experienced a typical decline in revenue and margins during the first quarter due to the absence of seasonally higher year end software and product sales, as well as the normal first quarter weather-related weakness in the North Sea, Russia and Australia. In the Middle East/Asia region both revenue and operating income increased by 13% compared to the prior year. Middle East/Asia is projected to be our highest growth region this year led by Saudi Arabia. In the first quarter Saudi Arabia grew by almost 50% compared to the first quarter of 2013, which clearly demonstrates the success we\u2019ve had in expanding our integrated project capability and our ability to leverage our unconventional leadership and expertise outside of North America. But the improvement was also driven by solid growth across the majority of our Asia-Pacific countries with Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia leading the Pac. Turning to Europe, Africa, CIS, we saw revenue and operating income increased 9% and 21%, respectively, on year-over-year basis. This improvement was led by higher completion tools sales and increased drilling and open-hole wireline activity in Angola. We also posted increased activity in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Algeria. Latin America revenue and operating income declined by 9% and 8%, respectively, compared to the same quarter last year, in large part due to a decline in drilling-related activity in Brazil. Increased unconventional stimulation and cementing activity in Argentina partially offset this decline. We also continued to be impacted by an activity reduction in Mexico related to the cessation of older contracts in anticipation of new integrated projects awarded late last year and early this year. We are currently mobilizing for our Humapa and Mesozoic projects and they should get underway in the second and third quarters. Moving to North America. Revenues were up 5% year-over-year relative to a 1% increase in the U.S. land rig count and operating income was flat. This was a challenging quarter for our North America business. We experienced the coldest winter in 20 years which impacted activity in the Bakken, Niobrara, Marcellus and other operating areas including Canada during the early part of the quarter. Severe weather also disrupted rail movements further reducing efficiency. Pricing contributed lower margins in the quarter as a result of pressure pumping contract renewals that went into effect late in the fourth quarter or early this year. Additionally, we saw rising cost in certain expense categories such as freight and fuel. Our corporate and other expense totaled $89 million this quarter. We invested approximately $15 million in our HALvantage strategic initiatives during the first quarter, a bit lower than we expected. These activities will continue throughout 2014 but the related cost should begin to decline in the second half of the year. We anticipate the impact of these investments will be approximately $0.02 per share after tax in the second quarter. Including these strategic costs, we anticipate that corporate expenses for the second quarter were run approximately $95 million to $100 million. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter also came in slightly lower than expected at approximately 27% due to a tax-basis adjustment. For the remainder of 2014, we\u2019re expecting the effective tax rate to be approximately 28% to 29%. Cash flow from operations during the first quarter was $934 million, nearly triple the cash flow from the first quarter of 2013. Adjusting for the $500 million in stock repurchases, we generated approximately $300 million in cash during the quarter. As we progressed through 2014, we believe we are well positioned to generate significantly more cash and then our cash flow will grow sustainably in the coming years. As a reminder, we\u2019re working to grow the percentage of cash available for distribution to shareholders up to roughly 35% of our operating cash flows over the next few years, which has nearly doubled our historic average. For the second quarter, we expect our average share count will be approximately 850 million. We continue to expect that our capital expenditures for 2014 will be approximately $3 billion. We also expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $2.1 billion during 2014. Now moving to the eastern hemisphere outlook. In the second quarter, we\u2019re anticipating a low double-digit percentage improvement in revenue as we recover from the first quarter seasonal drop-off and we expect margins to move solidly into the midteens. Over the course of the year, revenue and margin should continue to progressively stairstep higher with full year margins averaging in the upper teens. In Latin America, we expect for Brazil to be a headwind for the remainder of this year, an average of 24 rigs we\u2019re drilling during the first quarter and activity is expected to remain at this reduced level for the rest of 2014 and into 2015. However, IPM activity is beginning to pick up in Mexico to offset the Brazil slowdown. For the second quarter, we expect a higher single-digit percentage improvement in revenue in Latin America. We believe margins will only be modestly higher than the first quarter, due not only to lower Brazil activity but also to project mobilization cost in Mexico. We expect a more meaningful step up in revenues and margins in the second half of the year. We should bring full year revenue and margins in line with 2013. Concluding with North America, in the second quarter we\u2019re expecting higher U.S. land activity to more than offset the seasonal Canadian spring breakup. The logistics issues we experienced in the first quarter should also abate and we will yield more benefit from our HALvantage initiatives. The net result is that we should see a low to mid-single digit percentage improvement in North America revenue in the second quarter and margins will return to second half 2013 levels. And as Dave commented earlier, we fully expect North America margins will approach 20% before year end. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff for an operational update. Jeff? Jeff Miller : Thanks, Mark and good morning, everyone. As you\u2019ve heard, we\u2019re excited about the North America market. We\u2019re confident that we\u2019re going to hit our eastern hemisphere growth expectations. The key point that I want to make today is that our strategies from unconventionals, deepwater and mature fields are working well. Our unconventional strategy continues to focus on driving a lower cost per BOE for our customers. Our discussions with operators about their unconventional assets today are almost entirely centered around how to make more barrels and our strategy is dead focused on just that. Using frac of the future, CYPHER and Custom Chemistry, we\u2019ve consistently demonstrated that we can help operators get more barrels and improve their efficiency. As Dave said, we\u2019re seeing rising servicing intensity across North America and this underscores the importance of our unconventional strategy. Lateral lengths have grown to over 10,000 feet in the market. Stage density has increased by 20% to 25% year-over-year in basins like the Eagle Ford and the Marcellus. And in the Permian basin, the horizontal rig count has crossed over the 50% mark and you know, this is great for us. The net result is that year-over-year we\u2019ve seen average completion volumes per well increase by 30% for our customer set which is driving demand for improved service efficiency at the wellhead. The frac of the future is delivering the increased efficiency we expected, reducing maintenance headcount and the capital required on location. At the end of the first quarter, over 20% of our fleet has been converted to frac of the future. And we have largely completed the HALvantage rollout across our U.S. land operations. And CYPHER is making a difference in helping our customers increased their EURs, telling them where to drill, how to grill quarter, where to complete and how to complete. CYPHER is now gaining traction internationally as well as we deploy the platform to projects in Saudi Arabia, Russia, Argentina and Australia. When it comes to how to complete, the goal is maximum reservoir contact. And this is where our customized chemistry is generating results. One example is AccessFrac. AccessFrac is the system that combines leading-edge unconventional hydraulic fracturing techniques with proprietary diversion chemistry. And the result is substantially better multi-zone completions during plug-and-perf operations. AccessFrac has been used in thousands of stages in every major U.S. basin and in a number of emerging international plays as well. Through successful application, our customers are seeing a production improvement on the order of 20% to 30%. Moving to deepwater. Our outlook has always been one of steady growth, which is precisely what we're seeing play out and our strategy to reduce uncertainty and increase reliability is more important to our clients than ever. As we think about our deepwater strategy, reducing uncertainty for our clients shortens their cycle time and improves their decision making. Our ICE Core fluid analysis technology does exactly that. It performs lab quality fluid analysis, down hole, using spectroscopy and proprietary algorithms. Now this is important to our clients because one logging run can potentially save an operator costly weeks waiting on lab results. Instead oil, gas, water and other fluid composition can be determined during testing operations. And not surprisingly, this unique Halliburton technology is really gaining traction and is gaining traction in every deepwater market in the world. It\u2019s been successfully run in the North Sea, Latin America West Africa and Asia Pacific. We\u2019re also reducing uncertainty with our subsalt reservoir characterization software, GeoShell. GeoShell is part of our leading DecisionSpace 3D Seismic Interpretation software. And it allows our clients do better image salt structures and then therefore map the subsurface more accurately. We\u2019re gaining traction in markets like the deepwater Gulf of Mexico where a large customer is now using GeoShell to improve technical success and reduce exploratory drilling risk. Next, I'm very excited about the pipeline of projects that we see in mature fields. Our discussions with clients are increasingly focused on how to improve mature field production. And these assets are a terrific annuity for our customers whether they may be simple workover or a fulfilled optimization project. And as evidenced of increasing demand, we have over 6 billion in awarded integrated projects and over 25 billion in projects in the perceived pipeline, primarily in mature assets. In Mexico, we have two significant integrated mature field mobilizations underway, the Humapa project in the north and the Mesozoic project in the south. And we expect Humapa to be generating revenue in the second quarter. And with Mesozoic, we are currently preparing the rigs required to deliver these high pressure wells and expect to spud the first well late in the second quarter. This four year project is the largest of the recent mega tender awards and represents over 20% of the recent $4 billion tender round. We expect to be operating at a full run rate in early 2015. And there are two takeaways here. First, we have built the organizational capability to successfully execute large, mature field projects. We have aggressively developed the reservoir skills to increase recovery factors for our customers at a field wide level and have built the service portfolio required to drill, complete and produce mature fields. And second, we're more constructive on Mexico than at the end of last year. And in spite of any near-term transition, it\u2019s clear that the future activity in Mexico is taking shape. In closing, our strategies are working and working well in mature fields, deepwater and unconventionals and we are more confident than ever that we are on track to deliver on our commitments. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Dave for his closing comments. Dave? Dave Lesar : Thanks, Jeff and let me just do a quick wrap up. In summary, Eastern Hemisphere is playing out as we said it would. And based on our contract pipeline, we are confident in our estimates. Latin America will be a transitional year, but our project wins in Mexico set us up for a stronger second half and an improved 2015. And as I said in North America, I can feel and I can see the turn coming, which gives us confidence in our outlook for the year. Overall, our strategy is working well and we intend to stay the course. I am optimistic about our ability to grow our North America revenue and margins, realize industry-leading revenue and margin growth in our international businesses, which will result in EPS growth and significantly higher cash generation. We remain focused on consistent execution, generating superior financial performance and providing industry-leading shareholder returns. Thank you. Kelly Youngblood : Okay. Sam, we are ready to open up the questions now. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from James West of Barclays. Your line is now opened. James West - Barclays: Hey. Good morning, guys. Dave Lesar : Hey, James. Thanks. James West - Barclays: It\u2019s good to hear your confidence on North America and we were certainly aligned with you there. One quick question on NAM, if we think about, Dave, you mentioned you are getting reimbursables for higher cost, are you also at the point now or getting close to the point where you can get net pricing on the product lines that have been somewhat out of balance here? Jeff Miller :  Yeah, James. This is Jeff. First thing with respect to pricing, we are not going to discuss our pricing strategy. But if you go back to what Dave said, we have seen some capacity tightening and the ability to pass on some of the increased prices to customers but the point being from our standpoint, we stay focused on returns. James West - Barclays: Okay. Okay. Fair enough. And then Jeff or Dave, you mentioned a lot of confidence comes from everything outside of the gas markets. What are you seeing in gas markets today given where gas prices sit and where gas prices could go, given the tightness in the gas market? Jeff Miller : Yeah, we like -- the short answer is gas. We don\u2019t have it in the plan for 2014. James West - Barclays: Right. Jeff Miller : We view sustainable prices north of $450 would be what\u2019s required to see gas move but we are seeing it support, probably cash flows for some clients. But if anything, the key takeaway is it would be a 2015 event. James West - Barclays: Okay. Okay. Great. I got it. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Anderson of J.P. Morgan. Your line is now opened. David Anderson - J.P. Morgan: Thanks. Good morning. So, I just had a question on the pressure pumping pricing comments. Obviously, you guys are pretty fired up. Help us understand kind of how you see this playing out. It sounds like there should be a couple more quarters of seeing contract rollovers kind of pushing pricing down. I was wondering if you could give us little more context as to what you are seeing out there. Is this primarily in the Permian that things are kind of changing around, but just a little bit of more color in terms of how that should play out this year? Dave Lesar : But we don\u2019t see -- we don\u2019t see pricing pushing down, we described. What we\u2019ve described is contract rollovers through Q4 taking affect now having pricing affect. What I will just reiterate is that we stay focused on returns for our business. The ability to push through the pricing for inputs has been a bit of what we\u2019ve seen. But the vagaries of the tightening, it\u2019s tough to call that at this point. We have seen some tightening. David Anderson - J.P. Morgan: Okay. Dave, I was just curios on your comments, you talked about kind of seeing the beginnings of another upswing here. You\u2019ve been here before. I was just wondering if you could kind of maybe give us little color in terms of how you are approaching this cycle different from the past. Obviously if you are seeing, if I would have to think some of your smaller competitors are starting to get fired up as well? Are you concerned about capacity coming to the market? Do you start building capacity little bit sooner? I\u2019m just curios, can you help us understand little bit how do you approach this cycle different without obviously giving away the secret sauce and what not? Dave Lesar : I think, Dave, first of all, I do feel the turn coming, but I want to see it get here first. When it gets here, we will be making those kinds of decisions. I think a couple things to keep in mind. One is, we will continue to high-grade our customer base, as we go through this process, working with the ones that want to work with us to basically get the efficiencies that we need, the rate of returns that we need. We are going to continue to rollout the Q10s, as we said at our Analyst Day. We believe it\u2019s a differentiating platform to go to market with, and we\u2019ll just sort of analyze the market as it comes to us and make those decisions at that point in time. I\u2019m certainly not going to give away our strategy at this point. But I think we're pretty well down the road in thinking about what we're going to do. David Anderson - J.P. Morgan: Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons & Company. Your line is now opened. Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company: Thanks. Good morning. I was a little bit unclear with regard to your commentary on the earnings growth and vision for the second half of the year, following the 25% upswing in the second quarter. Did you call for an additional 25% increase in EPS sequentially in Q3? Mark McCollum : Bill, this is Mark. We did not call for 25% sequential from Q2 to Q3. I think what Dave was alluding to is that, if you just translate the notion of getting us back to a 20% margins in North America as the year progresses\u2026. Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company: Yes. Mark McCollum : \u2026as well as the continued strong growth, double-digit growth that we expect in our international or our Eastern Hemisphere markets, that\u2019s going to continue to add to what we think is going to be a good solid Q2 for us, coming off of a Q1 seasonal level. Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company: Understood. And then secondly, in light of the increased service intensity that you're seeing in the business and the increase vigor with regard to the overall business, can you comment a little bit on your capital spending intensity overall? I mean, we\u2019ve gone from call it a, low to mid-teens capital spend rate as a percentage of revenues, the high single digits? And I\u2019m just curious given the runway that you see now. Your restraint with regard to adding horsepower for a considerable period of time, your rollout of frac in the future, how is that all interwoven into your capital spending intensity, your capital allocation with regard to new horsepower going forward? Mark McCollum :  It's a great question, Bill. And one of the things that we are, as Dave, alluded to, yes, we think about our strategy for looking at North America, where we\u2019re keenly focused on. Clearly, several years ago, we accelerated our capital bit quite dramatically anticipating a fairly dramatic turn in North America coming off the bottom of the financial crisis and then seeing the growth opportunities that were available to us in international markets. We felt like that that was a season of time overall because of our focus on returns. We wanted to get back our spending back down to something that was a more reasonable growth rate and really focus the business on capital utilization, asset turnover and return to our sort of an ultimate focus on returns. As we look at this market today and what maybe happening, I would tell you while we\u2019re still expecting capital expenditures to be $3 billion, I mean, that\u2019s -- I mean, I\u2019ve got a lot of them through sort of keeping a tight grip on the rains in terms of what the opportunity set is out there for the growth of our business. I mean, there is a lot of things that we can do, we\u2019re just -- we\u2019re going to try to maintain that focus on return. So remember one of the things that we also have available to us, as we do the rollout of Q10s and we\u2019re bringing equipment out of the market itself for reclamation or repositioning into international markets is, in essence, gives us some opportunity to sort of spread our assets, improve our utilization overall that maybe some other businesses don\u2019t have within the capital budget. Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company: Thanks very much. That\u2019s helpful. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is now open. Angie Sedita - UBS:  Thanks. Good morning, guys. Dave Lesar : Hi, Angie. Angie Sedita - UBS: I thought it was interesting your comments first on that you\u2019re seeing frac capacity tighten faster than expected, which you would expect to some degree, but can you give us your thoughts on where the markets frac capacity or frac utilization is today? And then thoughts towards the exit rate at the end of the year, given we still are seeing frac efficiencies, moderate activity growth clearly, and some capacity additions, and where we could be on a frac capacity or utilization frac at the end of the year? Jeff Miller : Hi, Angie, this is Jeff. Certainly as we look out, we\u2019re seeing some tightening, but what I would say about, broadly capacity is that I don\u2019t have any reason to disagree with some of the numbers that you saw last week. So that be. Angie Sedita - UBS: Okay. So let\u2019s move to Latin America then; on Mexico, your comments certainly were a little bit more positive on the opening of the country and that you could see something as early as 2015, what do you think, what are you hearing that gives you more confidence and more confidence on that timing? Jeff Miller : Yes. Couple of things. First is the country is making a lot of the right moves. So as we see the reforms sort of taking shape, clearly they are -- I am impressed and pleased to see the schedule sort of keeping pace. Equally important as we see the contract opportunities in the market that works being lit, being tendered and won, which gives me confidence that the base activity, though we see the transitory sort of slow down in the contracts that were in place. We also see the path to the contracts that are going to take their place. Angie Sedita - UBS: Okay. And then finally the Q10 pumps, based on your remarks it does appear -- it does sound as if you are not making net additions to your horsepower in the U.S., is that fair that you are still actually adding capacity on the Q10 side but retiring or refurbishing all the capacity? Jeff Miller : I mean, right now, we are sticking to our same policy. We are not going to comment on our overall capacity additions just for competitive reasons. Angie Sedita - UBS: Okay. I will turn it over. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Dave Lesar : Hey, Jim. Operator : Jim, please shut your mute button. We will move on to our next question, our next question comes from Kurt Hallead of RBC Capital Markets. Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets : Hey, good morning. Dave Lesar : Hi, Kurt. Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets : I just had a follow-up question. Your forecasting guidance I think speaks to this, but there have been significant investor concerns about the deepwater drilling market and potential utilization declines in conjunction with the prospect for lower international oil company, E&P spending dynamics throughout the course of the year. I know again given the context of your forecast whether or not you can give us some view on IOC spend plans maybe versus NOC or independents and how you see this rolling up into your forecast? Dave Lesar : Thanks, Kurt. We\u2019ve always called the growth in that market as sort of slow and steady and it\u2019s staying on the pace that we\u2019ve sort of described all along. I won\u2019t comment necessarily on the deepwater drillers, but our view and their view maybe a little bit different around that growth pace. We feel confident about what business that we see sort of over the near term and then clearly contracts that are being left appear to be going to work. So I am confident that from our standpoint, our outlook is still intact and our commitment to outgrow that market by 25% stays intact. Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets : Okay, great. And just follow-up, I had commentary about the North American market capacity tightening and maybe more quickly than anticipated. What do you see is the potential impact on a global standpoint from pricing because typically when North America get tight, it\u2019s pretty good opportunity to improve pricing on the international front as well, and any sense on that prospect as we head out into the rest of 2014? Dave Lesar : Well, I think as we -- sort of our experience in the last up-cycle following the financial crisis that potential connection doesn\u2019t always work. We continue to believe that, while there are pockets of opportunity to -- or maybe to adjust our pricing with contracts awarded for specific product service lines, the large mega tenders that come out continue to be very, very competitive. And we don\u2019t anticipate that necessarily changing in a slow and steady growth market over time regardless of what happens in the North American market in the short term. Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Tillery of Tudor Pickering. Your line is now open. Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering : Hi, good morning. Dave Lesar : Hey, Jeff. Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering : Given some of the volume increases you talked about in North America sort of 30% on a per well basis in your customer mix, can you just talk about the challenges that brings and what you are doing to address it, whether it\u2019d be sand, water, or kind of whatever else on the logistics side? Dave Lesar : Yes, thanks, Jeff. The increased volumes put a lot of -- not pressure but gives us an opportunity really to use our logistics and infrastructure that we put in place over the last several years. But clearly the ability to deliver the large volumes is crucial to our business and we do that through managing that delivery really from the beginning to the end from the mine to the well side and it\u2019s -- so the takeaway is, yes, we manage it, and yes, we see it as a key component of our advantage. Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering : And the second quarter in North America, so seasonally Canada obviously takes a step backward, but could you comment on weather risk and how you see it in kind of northern part of the U.S., whether it be the Bakken breakup or what not, just curious how you see that playing out at this point? Dave Lesar : Yes, the Canada breakup is always an impact. There is no -- that\u2019s always part of the outlook, but in our case that is part of our outlook that\u2019s included in the commitments that we made for next quarter and then beyond in North America. So we continue to be positive on that and really the takeaway, equipment works harder in the lower 48 than it does in Canada, just given that impact to breakup. Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering :  Any thoughts on the Bakken and just given coming off the very cold weather, do we need to expect very, I mean a normal seasonal impact, better or worse, I mean, any thoughts around the Bakken this quarter? Jeff Miller : Yeah. I mean, Bakken, I think is back to work. So, I mean, it works it\u2019s way through breakup and don\u2019t have any reason to believe that it\u2019s impacted any differently and it was extremely cold winter but that market knows how to rebound. Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse : Sorry, guys, I\u2019m obviously technically challenged on Monday morning. Dave Lesar : We already knew that. Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse : Yeah. That's no surprise, no surprise. Let me talk about sustainability if I could? Its great picture, excited about the North American market, a lot of people saying don\u2019t forget there was price fixing litigation last year. So it\u2019s good that you can be excited but we understand why you can\u2019t talk details, so that's fine? But it just strikes me and Jeff, your comments about natural gas, but we all kind of know that volumes have to increase overtime? And I am just wondering how do you guys view the sustainability of growth in the North American market? And I would think that you get paid on volume as much as what gas price is, but Dave to your point, you are not increasing volumes much, maybe that's not the case? But can you talk about the broader five-year outlook for North American activity, the sustainability part of it? Dave Lesar : Yeah. Thanks, Jim. I mean, a lot of the, if we look out five years, a lot of the structural things in my view are happening that that support the sustainable gas market. If we look at LNG export clearly a positive and its moving the right way, if we look at sort of the uptake on gas and its positioning in the market as long-term, fuel for electricity and then we look at sort of the economy and the upside in this economy, all of those conspire to in my view a sustainable gas market. Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse : And should we expect to see, I mean, I am looking at the consensus numbers for you guys and your biggest competitors, and 8% to 10% revenue growth seems to be sustainable at least through consensus? Is that -- I don\u2019t want to -- you guys are saying the business is no longer cyclical? But to Dave to your point, is this the momentum leading into a two-year cycle or a five-year cycle or do you all have a thought on that? Dave Lesar : Yeah. Jim, I mean, its clearly in my view more than a two-year cycle, because as I indicated earlier, we are not getting any help from gas essentially at this point in time. And I have a view on gas, I happen to believe that over the next five to 10 years, the gas market is going to be there and potentially be there in a big way. Have you went outside and the [call] (ph) probably has their own view as to whether I am right or wrong there. But I think that what we are trying to indicate is that if you just look at the liquid side of the business right now that's actually what\u2019s giving us our excitement. And so is it sustainable, yes. Duration, yeah, it is still a cyclical business, but I clearly think that we are looking at something that is going to be turning up for more than two years. Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse : Okay. And my follow up if I could. On the mature fields into the business you guys have mentioned several times that you probably have to make some acquisitions to get to where your guidance at your Analyst Meeting was and obviously, those are around pumps of all different kinds and chemistry of all different kinds? Should we expect to see some continuing level of M&A over the next couple years since or could it come in big burst? I am just trying to think of not who you would buy or what you would buy, but how you would go about doing it over the next couple years? Dave Lesar : Well, I think, the honest answer is, why we would always love to do some big bites. It takes two to tango, right. You\u2019ve got to have those opportunities in front of you and in the absence those opportunities, the way I described our M&A strategy as we play small ball, right. You are going to that's ultimately can win the game and so we are out there constantly keeping our M&A pipeline full of prospects that address the strategic technologies and niches that we want to feel and keep a constant dialogue. Now all of those will come to fruition but enough of those you know along the way are filling up the prospects that can ultimately get us there. We would love to have some bigger deals. We have the balance sheet. We think we have the management team, the ability to integrate in a way that can make that very successful but those have been few and far between. Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse : Okay. Thanks guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Crandell of Cowen. Your line is now open. Jim Crandell - Cowen: Thank you. Mark, are they any chances of any adjustments to your Brazilian contracts and if the answer to that is, no, when do you expect them to be re-bid and when might that take effect? Jeff Miller : Yeah. Thanks, Jim. This is Jeff. The answer to question, well, I am not going to comment on the specific discussions with the client, but I am confident that we work through those during the current year. So as we -- some point this year we will see some relief there and certainly going into \u201915 it would look different. Jim Crandell - Cowen: Okay. Secondly, another question about South American country, are you seeing or have any seen any improvement in your receivable situation from PdVSA and have you at all curtailed shipments of product or services to PdVSA because of that? Mark McCollum : We saw a significant improvement in our receivable position at the end of the fourth quarter. This quarter, it didn\u2019t necessarily improve but I think that was driven probably more by an expansion of our operation there in Venezuela versus lack of payment but still is slower than we would like it to be. We continue to work with our customer there. They are trying to find an arrangement that\u2019s mutually beneficial. But I think that at this point in time we\u2019ll take a long-term view of Venezuela. We\u2019ll continue to be constructive about that market think it can work for us and we\u2019re continuing to invest and operate there to help them achieve their goals. Jim Crandell - Cowen: Okay, good, Mark. And one final question about two categories of companies and how you see sort of this category of E&P spending, one is the majors we\u2019ve -- I mean, the majors budgets if you add them up are actually slightly lower in 2014 versus \u201813 and they make up about 26% of spending. And then we are also seeing at least in the budgets a significant slowdown coming out of Asia Pacific companies, particularly the NOCs out of China, India, Malaysia, Indonesia. When do you expect that this condition is going to change and if so when do you think it could change? Mark McCollum : So challenging question, your second part is when it necessarily will change? Again I think that our overall view of the market has been slow and steady. And we have supported commodity prices ultimately when things will change will really relate to the supply and demand balance. Right now, there everything seems to be well and balance and I think as the economic, macroeconomic indicators improve globally, demand will grow then the need for supply will start growing and I think accelerate activity. The first part of the question on IOC and IOC is the part of our overall portfolio. They are an important part but they\u2019re less than 25% as a percentage of our total revenues. I mean, we -- and I would also say that even though their relative budgets have stayed flat, what we see internally that they\u2019ve adjusted some of that spending toward E&P and away from infrastructure this year. So the overall budget totals that they get may not be necessarily indicative of what we see them spending. And we expect that particularly in areas like the Gulf of Mexico that spending will be creeping up as the year goes -- goes by. Jim Crandell - Cowen: Okay. Thank you, Mark. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Becker of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Doug Becker - Bank of America : Thanks. I will stick with Latin America. Mark, you\u2019ve mentioned expectations for slightly higher margins in 2Q versus 1Q pretty flat for the full year. What assumptions are you making regarding work in Brazil and the signing of the blanket contract with PEMEX in that guidance? And maybe, if you could help us think about the range of outcomes in terms of margins related to those factors? Mark McCollum : Okay. Just sort of, I guess, to reiterate the guidance, we are expecting that revenues will be slightly up but that margins will be flat in Q2 but that they will be increasing over the rest of the year so that when you look at the total 2013 -- I'm sorry 2014 year, it will be on balance the same as 2013 was, both from a revenue standpoint and margin standpoint. So that's the overall guidance. So that anticipates a higher margin in the back part of the year than we\u2019re currently experiencing. The forecast that I gave you for Q2 on the blanket contract assumes Q2 more but probably later in the quarter versus earlier. And so it\u2019s large impact will be back half of the year versus for Q2. Doug Becker - Bank of America : Okay. And with relates -- as it relates to Brazil just that the contracts stays in place as is, is that their underlying assumption? Dave Lesar : Yes, it is. We have not anticipated any kind of contract reform in Brazil over the course of the year. So if something happens there earlier than toward the end of the year than that would be beneficial for us. Doug Becker - Bank of America : Got it. And then Dave, you did mentioned that March saw record revenues in North America. Can we get any sense for just how much better March was, whether its in terms of revenue, profitability compared to January and February? Jeff Miller : Yeah, this is Jeff. I mean there was a solid exit rates and on the basis of that we feel confident about the forecast we\u2019ve laid out for you and also see the path to the commitment that we\u2019ve made for 2014, which was adding the 200 basis points in North America. Doug Becker - Bank of America : Maybe another way of approaching it, just any quantification of what the weather impact was in North American margins in the first quarter? Dave Lesar : Maybe to help, when we gave our guidance at the end of the first quarter -- fourth quarter about what would happen in Q1. We highlighted that we expected that there would be some pricing degradation that we had to fight against because of contract rollover as well as weather. And I think that some of the pricing was basically anticipated but I think that the weather and the knock-on impacts of the weather and logistic impacts and stuff like that were not anticipated to be as bad as they were. And so that\u2019s probably, and I guess, as much as I want to give but again looking at March exit rates, they were very strong, very solid and that gives us high confidence for not only just Q2 but the rest of the year. Doug Becker - Bank of America : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now opened. Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs : Thank you very much. My question relates to the Middle East. As we look at the margins in the Middle East in the first quarter versus last year's first quarter, they are relatively flat. Could you talk about that given what's going on in Saudi Arabia and UAE, like I would have expected the margins to be year-over-year much better? Is there anything special going on there, is it all Iraq or equipment relocation that's impacting first quarter? Dave Lesar : Yeah. Thanks, Waqar. The Middle East growth is solid. But don\u2019t forget, we have won a number of projects in the Middle East then we\u2019re mobilizing for those, including in Saudi Arabia. And so what you\u2019re seeing is some of the sorting out of that activity. That said, the takeaway is we are very confident about the business in the Middle East and expect to see strengthening there. Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs : Okay. Could we -- where could the margins in the Middle East head to? I know you've given guidance for all of Eastern Hemisphere. But just looking at Middle East on its own, any guidance in terms of revenues and margins for not just 2014, maybe longer term as well? Dave Lesar : Waqar, we are not going to provide any guidance specifically on the Middle East. Middle East/Asia is our reportable region. If you look at it, it tends to be, have higher margins and we anticipate it will have higher growth than the average of Eastern Hemisphere overall but otherwise, we are going to stay with our Eastern Hemisphere guidance. Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs : Okay. We\u2019ve heard from some of your peers saying that like rig count growth could be 17%, 18% in the Middle East area. Is that your thinking as well? Dave Lesar : We have no reason to dispute their estimates on rig count growth as well. Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs : Okay. And just one finally on the labor, we hear that labor is pretty tight, not just in Permian but other places too. Do you see that having any impact on work or the industry\u2019s ability to perform work this year? Dave Lesar : No. I mean, this is really where we\u2019ve build the machine. It\u2019s able to hire people. We know how to do that. We\u2019ve seen this sort of tightness in labor before. So, we may see some increased costs but the ability to execute and deliver the people, I\u2019m quite confident that we will do that. Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Dave Lesar : Sam, I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Yes, sir. Our final question comes from Scott Gruber of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now opened. Scott Gruber - Sanford Bernstein : Thanks for squeezing me in. Dave or Jeff, have you started to see a turn in the appetite for shale technology, particularly by the domestic E&Ps? Just from a 20,000 foot level, it appears that the domestic industry is just running so hard right now, that customers are simply demanding more and more of the conventional services. But obviously you have a much more detailed perspective than we do, so wanted to see if you're starting to sense a turn in that mentality? Jeff Miller : Yeah. This is Jeff. There is a strong appetite for better technology and that\u2019s really the crux for most of the conversations, I have with customers today is around how to make more barrels and what technology will allow them to do that. And that's really what our CYPHER suite is all about, is how to frac and how to drill to make more barrels. And so that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing that increase in appetite so. And that\u2019s really across the piece. So the takeaway is yes, there is more activity but every application of better technology in that higher volume environment is able to even make, create more value for our customers. Scott Gruber - Sanford Bernstein : And do you think that's a product of where we stand with the evolution of shale, more in the development phase today? Is it a product of the tightness -- emerging tightness for people and equipment, if you can comment on any change in your sales strategy and whether that's having an impact as well? Dave Lesar : Well, let me comment on this place. We are in the cycle and clearly as the client goes into development, there is such a premium on making more barrels out of that existing asset that I think that\u2019s driving some of that appetite. I won't comment on our sales strategy necessarily other than to say, we really like the suite of tools that we have in the marketplace right now and the benefit that it\u2019s delivering for our customers. Scott Gruber - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back to management for any closing comments. Kelly Youngblood : Okay, Sam. I think we\u2019re ready to close the call. I just want to thank everybody on behalf of the management team for participating today. You can go ahead and close the call. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

And welcome to the Halliburton Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Kelly Youngblood. Sir, you may begin. Kelly Youngblood : Good morning. And welcome to the Halliburton's second quarter 2014 conference call. Today\u2019s call is being webcast and a replay would be available on Halliburton's Web site for seven days. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Jeff Miller, COO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risk and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton\u2019s Forms 10K for the year ended December 31, 2013, Form 10Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2014, recent current reports on Form 8K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave, Dave? Dave Lesar :  Thank you Kelly and good morning everyone. I am obviously very pleased with our second quarter results and here are the headlines, record company revenue this quarter of $8.1 billion, double-digit sequential revenue growth and new quarterly records in both North America and Middle East/Asia. We once again delivered industry-leading revenue growth both sequentially and year-over-year compared to our primary peers. We had strong cash flow from operations of $1.1 billion and our Board has approved an increase in our buyback authorization to $6 billion. I am also pleased to announce the promotion of Jeff Miller to President and his appointment to Halliburton\u2019s Board, effective August 1st. I\u2019ve known and worked with Jeff for 25 years and I am absolutely confident he will do an excellent job leading our very strong management team. Now for some details around our performance this quarter, company operating income increased 23% sequentially, led by a 31% increase in North America operating income, with an impressive 280 basis point improvement in margins to 18.2%. The Eastern hemisphere had an equally impressive 220 basis point margin improvement to 16% resulting from a 26% growth in operating income. Now on our last call some of you may have been skeptical when I said I was beginning to feel the turn in North America, but based on our performance during the quarter I believe this feeling was dead on target. Today we are not feeling the turn, we are in the turn and I feel even more excited than I was last quarter about the outlook for the North American market. Why is that? During the quarter we saw our completion volumes continue to rise and I don\u2019t see that changing. Our logistics infrastructure is more of a differentiator than ever before. We were successful in getting cost recovery from our customers. And we estimate the percentage of excess horsepower has dropped below the 10% mark and capacity has tightened to the point that the market will require new horsepower to meet customer demand. As you know, based on the competitive advantage of our Frac of the Future, our plan has always been to upgrade our fleet to Q10s over time. These current trends provide us confidence that now is the appropriate time to accelerate our Q10 build schedule. We anticipate incremental fleets arriving in the fourth quarter and throughout 2015. We\u2019ve also been investing to increase our logistics capability as well. I am confident that these are the right moves. So even in the unlikely event the market softens, we always have the option of accelerating the retirement schedule of older equipment and replacing them with Q10s. Now moving to our international operations, Eastern Hemisphere activity continues to expand at the steady rate that we expected. But you know what, steady is exciting for us because it demonstrates that our view of the market was the correct one and that we are sized and scoped correctly to turn industry-leading revenue growth into steadily increasing margins. Our outlook for the full year remains intact. We are still targeting our Eastern Hemisphere revenue growth to be in the low double-digits with average full year margins in the upper-teens and approaching 20% by the end of the year. Second quarter margins of 16% show we are on-track to deliver that. Turning to Latin America, we faced issues around revenue timing during the quarter. Now it\u2019s easy for me to give my head around the issues, and I can see a path forward to normalized profitability. But I am certainly not thrilled with how some of the things played out this quarter; first, there was an issue with the late receipt of our software consulting blanket order from PEMEX, which impacted our ability to book revenue to offset our costs, which of course significantly hurt second quarter results. This should reverse itself in the second half of the year. Second, we were mobilizing for two large integrated projects which resulted in cost, but minimal revenue, for the quarter. This also should reverse itself in the second half of the year. Lastly, the rig count approached a 10 year low and social disruptions impacted operations resulting in reduced discrete service activity in Mexico. However, we remain encouraged by the prospect of energy reform in Mexico and believe that as the market gains more certainty around the direction of reform future service activity will increase. And in Brazil we are pleased with our customers\u2019 decision to re-tender the deepwater drilling contract, which should allow us to right-size our footprint there. So looking at the full year, we continue to target 2014 Latin America margins to be in line with the prior year at approximately 13%. Now let me be clear about one thing, and I\u2019ve been around long enough to know, headwinds become tailwinds therefore I am optimistic about our future growth potential in Latin America as we go into 2015. So our overall strategy is working well and we intend to stay the course. Our leadership position in North America positions us well to capture the upside of this exciting and quickly evolving market, and we are continuing to realize significant revenue and margin expansion in our international business. We remain dead focused on consistent execution, generating superior financial performance and providing industry-leading shareholder returns to you. Now I am going to turn the call over to Mark to provide financial details. Mark? Mark McCollum : Thanks Dave and good morning. Let me begin with an overview of our second quarter results. Starting with North America, revenues were up 11% sequentially relative to a 4% increase in U.S. land rig count. And operating income was up 31% over the same period. Margins increased to 18.2%. Stronger activity levels in U.S. land primarily drove the improvement for the quarter. Margins also benefited from modest pricing improvements on pressure pumping contract renewals, which were designed to cover inflation on specific cost categories such as transportation, fuel and labor. These improvements were partially offset by the Canadian spring breakup and lower sequential profitability in the Gulf of Mexico due to the timing of completions activity. In the Eastern Hemisphere, revenue and operating income increased sequentially by 9% and 26% respectively, as a result of growth in both the Middle East/Asia and Europe/Africa/ CIS regions. We experienced a seasonal rebound in revenue and margins after encountering typical first quarter weather-related weakness in the North Sea, Russia and Australia. In our Middle East/Asia region, revenue and operating income increased by 11% and 25% respectively compared to the first quarter. Saudi Arabia showed strong sequential improvement driven by our consulting, directional drilling and drilling fluids product lines. We are very excited about this market and continue to see revenue and profitability improving at a very aggressive rate. Additionally, we continue to see solid growth across the majority of our Asia Pacific countries with Australia, Malaysia and China leading the pack for the quarter. The current situation in Iraq has resulted in some logistics bottlenecks and increased security measures but our operations which are in Southern Iraq and in Kurdistan are away from the fighting and are continuing. We continue to expect the Middle East region to have the highest growth rate for the full year 2014 despite the potential for activity disruptions in Iraq later this year. However, contract renewals and tenders for new work in Iraq are currently being pushed back which may mute our growth expectations as we exit the year. Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue and operating income increased 6% and 27% respectively compared to the prior quarter. The seasonal activity rebound in the North Sea and Russia led to sequential improvement. Additionally, sub-Saharan Africa showed sequential improvement, led by drilling activity gains in Angola and higher completions, intervention in pipeline processing services in Nigeria, Ghana and Congo. The Russia sanctions have not had a material impact on our activity levels up to this point, but there is some risk related to certain projects that are being tendered later this year. Latin America revenue increased 4% sequentially while operating income declined by 39%. Despite double-digit revenue improvement this quarter in Venezuela, Argentina and Colombia, we were negatively impacted by project mobilization and the blanket order delays in Mexico which Dave previously discussed. Our corporate and other expense totaled $107 million for the quarter, a little higher than anticipated, driven by retirement cost and higher professional fees. We invested approximately $15 million in our HALvantage strategic initiative during the second quarter. These activities should wrap-up this next quarter. We anticipate that corporate expenses for the third quarter will run approximately $90 million to $100 million. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter came in at approximately 28%. For the remainder of 2014, we are expecting the effective tax rate to be approximately 28% to 29%. Cash flow from operations during the second quarter was $1.1 billion, an increase of approximately 18% compared to the first quarter. Excluding the $215 million in acquisitions made this quarter, we have generated approximately $356 million in cash and marketable securities during the quarter. As we progress through 2014, we believe we are well-positioned to generate significantly more cash and that our cash flow will continue to grow in the coming years. As a reminder, we are working to grow the percentage of cash available for distribution to shareholders to roughly 35% of our operating cash flows over the next few years, which is nearly double our historic average. As discussed, we intend to accelerate our Q10 build schedule and expand our logistics infrastructure. As a result we now expect that our 2014 capital expenditures will be approximately $3.3 billion, an increase of $300 million compared to our previous guidance. We also expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $2.1 billion during 2014. Now moving to the Eastern Hemisphere outlook, in the third quarter we are anticipating a mid single-digit percentage improvement in revenue and we expect margins to migrate modestly higher into the upper-teens. Revenue is expected to continue to step higher in the fourth quarter, which is seasonally our strongest quarter of the year with margins approaching 20%. We continue to expect full year revenue growth to be in the low double-digits and margins averaging in the upper-teens. In Latin America, we expect mid-teen sequential revenue expansion in the third quarter and believe margins should approach the mid-teens. With continued improvement in revenue and margins in the fourth quarter, as a result we expect full year revenue and margins to be in line with 2013. However, our second half outlook assumes the timely approval of our billings under the blanket order in Mexico, as well as a swift resolution of the retender of our Brazil drilling contract. And concluding with North America, we are expecting revenue growth in the third quarter to outpace the rig count with North America margins approaching 20%. While we expect the rig count to continue to increase, utilization levels are very high and growth in the third quarter could be constrained by the availability of equipment until incremental fleets begin to arrive later in the year. Now I will turn the call over to Jeff for an update on our strategy. Jeff? Jeff Miller :  Thanks, Mark and good morning everyone. Our strategy is in the deepwater, mature fields and unconventionals are clearly delivering results. These led not only to record company revenues, but also quarterly revenue records for our production enhancement, baroid, cementing, wireline, production chemicals and artificial lift product lines. So for today\u2019s comments, I\u2019ll focus on our execution against these three strategies. Recall that our unconventional strategy is to deliver the lowest cost per barrel of oil equivalent through surface efficiency, custom chemistry and subsurface insight. Let\u2019s start with surface efficiency. We\u2019re seeing record activity levels with year-over-year stage counts up more than 20% and profit volumes per well up about 35%. We also saw record sales of our drill well plugs for plug-and-perf operations, as well as record installations of our RapidSuite sliding sleeve technology. All of these indicators point to larger volume jobs which is precisely for the Q10 pump excels consistently delivering 20% higher flow rates with about 50% lower maintenance cost than a legacy pump. And one last comment on North America surface efficiency regarding profit and infrastructure, while we see sufficient quantities of sand at the mines, the transportation infrastructure has and will continue to experience unprecedented levels of congestion. And we see profit competing for delivery not only with other profit types, but also with oil and agricultural products. And while we\u2019re not immune to this impact, we\u2019re confident that we have the best developed logistics infrastructure and we plan to continue adding to this capability throughout the year. Moving on to subsurface insight, we continue to gain traction with our CYPHER platform that optimizes where to drill, how to drill, where to frac and how to frac to make better wells. CYPHER applications continue to grow with over 50 projects underway across more than a dozen basins globally, which makes me even more excited about our recent release of CYPHER 2.0. That refines our earth modeling capability, increases our simulation accuracy and allows real-time adjustments during frac treatments. And finally our Custom Chemistry solutions are helping deliver better wells. Our AccessFrac diversion technology, clean breaking PermStim and our RockPerm formation analysis have all demonstrated better production for our clients. For example AccessFrac has delivered on average 20% better performance than offset wells with market uptake tripling since last year. RockPerm was first introduced only one year ago, as a means to enhance production through better hydrocarbon mobility and it\u2019s now used in more than one-third of our North American completions. And as we work across every basin we get to see the different methods used in all of those basins. And even as volume trends emerge our new techniques gain popularity we\u2019re more convinced than ever. The customized frac design and customized fluid chemistry delivered better, sustainable production for our clients. Now turning to the mature field space, we\u2019re pleased with the progress of our large IPM and asset management projects. During the quarter, we were either rewarded or began mobilizing on large integrated projects in India, Kuwait, UAE and Indonesia. For example our 93 well integrated project with Cairn India, is the first IPM project in India to employ tier 1 land rigs. These projects and other provide us with a strong platform for growth in addition to a pursuit pipeline of over 30 billion in project management opportunities that we\u2019re currently evaluating. And during the quarter, we started on the multi-decade Humapa incentivized asset management project in Mexico. Early work over operations have been successful and the production levels are already well ahead of schedule in the project. We expect to spud new wells in this asset during the second half of 2014, bringing up to two rigs by the end of the year. Also in Mexico, we spud at our first well in the Mesozoic project in late June and expect our second well to spud in late July. Our Mesozoic project represents a $1 billion opportunity over the next few years. We plan to mobilize additional rigs over the next several quarters moving towards four rigs by early 2015. And during the second quarter, we expanded our artificial lift capabilities through the acquisition of Europump, an industry leader in progressive cavity pump systems. This acquisition is an important step forward in our artificial lift strategy which complements our existing electric submersible pump technology and positions us to benefit from this growing market. Overall we\u2019re very pleased with the progress of our mature field strategy. The Europump acquisition expands our discrete service offerings and we\u2019re confident in our ability to execute on these large integrated projects. Looking at deepwater, we continue to increase reliability and reduce uncertainty for our customers. As we introduced new technology, we\u2019re dramatically simplifying equipment design to increase the operability of the equipment. Examples include our full suite of high pressure open hole logging tools designed for the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and our new ultra deepwater subsea control system Dash EH which is integrated with Veto, Halliburton\u2019s premiere 3-inch 15k Subsea Safety System that performs emergency well shut-in and critical landing stream disconnect in less than 15 seconds. Specific to the Gulf of Mexico, we continue to see incremental deepwater activity for the balance of the year and an increase in lower tertiary rate completions in early 2015. In the third quarter, we expect to begin operations on an integrated deepwater project for a major customer providing drilling and completion services across multiple wells. During the second quarter, we also acquired Neftex Petroleum Consultants, a market leader in reducing uncertainly in basins the world over. Neftex has created a unique 4-D model of the subsurface already used by E&P companies worldwide to evaluate and identify resources more quickly and more accurately. We expect this acquisition will touch all three of our key strategies by integrating data and interpretations from the Neftex Earth Model with Landmark\u2019s DecisionSpace platform. We expect to be able to accelerate our customer\u2019s ability to explore prospects and increase our ability to predict drilling success. In closing, I want to be clear that our strategies are working. We continue to see strong long-term growth opportunities across unconventionals, deepwater and mature fields. In fact I would like to highlight the performance of our Eastern Hemisphere where we\u2019ve see revenue expand by more than 50% over the last three years with margins stair-stepping higher year-after-year. This has been a consistent focus on our three key themes that is driven this success. In mature fields, we are now the leading surface provider of primary customer against Norway driven by our focus on both discrete and integrated solutions. In unconventionals, we are the leading provider of unconventional services in Australia and recently into joint venture to expand our footprint in China. In deepwater, we have seen tremendous growth with all product lines drawing baroid fluids in Asia Pacific, creating a testing business almost from scratch, and a completions business that is now number one globally. Looking ahead, with the projects we have in place and the technology we\u2019re putting to work, we are very optimistic about our growth prospects for the Eastern Hemisphere in the coming years. Before I hand the call back to Dave one final note, it is truly a privilege to serve as President of Halliburton. I have been part of the management team for several years and I have been part of developing our current strategies, so you should expect us to stay the course and remain dead focused on superior growth, margins, and returns. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Board and the over 80,000 Halliburton employees for their steadfast support. Now, I will turn the call back over to Dave for his closing comments. Dave? Dave Lesar : Thanks, Jeff. In North America, we are past feeling the turn, we are in the turn and we will be accelerating our Q10 build in the order to meet customer demand. In Latin America, we feel optimistic about improved second half, but are still monitoring a few potential headwinds regardless of that 2015 is shaping up to be a strong year. In the Eastern Hemisphere, we are still on-track for low-double digit full year revenue growth with margins averaging in the upper-teens. And finally, our strong outlook for the business provides us with confidence in improving increase shareholder returns going forward as is evidenced by our increase in stock buyback authorization to a new total of $6 billion, which represents approximately 10% of our market cap today. With that, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Question: and: Operator : Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Kurt Hallead of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now opened. Kurt Hallead : Great, thank you. Good morning. RBC Capital Markets : Great, thank you. Good morning. Dave Lesar : Hi Kurt good morning. Kurt Hallead : Maybe a question for either Dave or Jeff with respect to the re-tendering on Brazil, when do you think you might get the bids opened and how do you expect to see that playing out going forward I guess in the context of you still expect to be awarded in the same package that you were awarded before? RBC Capital Markets : Maybe a question for either Dave or Jeff with respect to the re-tendering on Brazil, when do you think you might get the bids opened and how do you expect to see that playing out going forward I guess in the context of you still expect to be awarded in the same package that you were awarded before? Jeff Miller : Yes thanks, Kurt. That rebid is in process right now, so the documents haven\u2019t been resubmitted. We still expect to see that conclude this year, expect early Q4. With respect to competitive positioning I am not going to share that with you here, I expect it will be competitive but in any case expect to see a healthy reset as we look ahead into the \u201915 and beyond. Kurt Hallead : Okay, great. My follow-up relates to the U.S. frac business and the accelerated deployment of the Q10 pumps and I\u2019m sure you are aware of increased equipment orders by other players in the market. Can you help us calibrate what this may mean as it relates to the potential for pricing? You think it\u2019s going to be more of a volume driven market or you think there\u2019s an opportunity to get some price as time goes on? RBC Capital Markets : Okay, great. My follow-up relates to the U.S. frac business and the accelerated deployment of the Q10 pumps and I\u2019m sure you are aware of increased equipment orders by other players in the market. Can you help us calibrate what this may mean as it relates to the potential for pricing? You think it\u2019s going to be more of a volume driven market or you think there\u2019s an opportunity to get some price as time goes on? Jeff Miller :  Yes, Kurt let me just kind of go through what we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace with respect to activity. We\u2019re seeing all the right signs as capacity starts to tighten which we\u2019ve seen fall below sort of 10% spare capacity. We see activity increasing at breakneck rate, we\u2019re seeing some pass through of cost increases at this point and probably most importantly we have clarity of our frac calendar through the end of the year. So all of those things give it a lot of confidence in adding our equipment because we see where that\u2019s going to go work. I think from a -- if you think more broadly about the market, again we believe in our equipment, it\u2019s doing exactly what we thought it would do, what we described at our Analyst Day so from Halliburton\u2019s perspective very confident that the Q10 equipment is delivering. Kurt Hallead :  Alright, thanks, I appreciate it.  RBC Capital Markets :  Alright, thanks, I appreciate it. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is now opened. Angie please check your mute button. Angie Sedita :  Thanks, good morning guys. UBS:  Thanks, good morning guys. Dave Lesar :  Hey Angie. Angie Sedita :  So on the Q10 roll out is there is any constraints in adding this incremental equipment if you want to accelerate it even further and can you talk about how much you\u2019re adding incrementally as far as percentage wise from you what you were adding at the beginning of the year? UBS:  So on the Q10 roll out is there is any constraints in adding this incremental equipment if you want to accelerate it even further and can you talk about how much you\u2019re adding incrementally as far as percentage wise from you what you were adding at the beginning of the year? Jeff Miller :  Yes, thanks Angie. From a competitive standpoint we\u2019re not going to share with you quantities of equipment and that sort of thing. But suffice to say that we have the ability, that\u2019s one of the reasons we stay in the manufacturing business, it gives us the ability to flex more quickly and then put the equipment when and where we need it. Angie Sedita :  So there\u2019s no constraints in adding equipment at a more accelerated rate if you want to even up it from here or do you have any constraints in the system? And then to add to that on the legacy equipment, is it fair to say that all retirements will stop at this time or are you still seeing some retirements at the older equipment? UBS:  So there\u2019s no constraints in adding equipment at a more accelerated rate if you want to even up it from here or do you have any constraints in the system? And then to add to that on the legacy equipment, is it fair to say that all retirements will stop at this time or are you still seeing some retirements at the older equipment? Mark McCollum :  Hey Angie, this is Mark. Just so I oversee the capital side let me weigh in, we did during the second quarter stop the retirement of some of our equipment just because of the activity levels were so great; we were rolling Q10s out, the ability to leave some of the older equipment out there allowed us to basically gain a spread or so to sort of address some of that activity. From a capital standpoint we\u2019re building to contract. We\u2019re building to what we can see. There is the ability to dial that further if the market accelerates further, but we think that this build schedule is aggressive enough to make sure that we\u2019re addressing the market as we see it that will be available for Halliburton over the next 18 months or so. Angie Sedita :  Okay, helpful and then as a follow-up, you mentioned it briefly in your remarks, on the cost recoveries are you now seeing that in every instance, are there still some regions of pushback and I believe you signed a new agreement earlier this year that would actually reduce your sand cost and that you\u2019re also doubling your rail fleet as far as your ownership of the rail fleet, could both of these start to help margins in Q3 or is it more Q4 2015? UBS:  Okay, helpful and then as a follow-up, you mentioned it briefly in your remarks, on the cost recoveries are you now seeing that in every instance, are there still some regions of pushback and I believe you signed a new agreement earlier this year that would actually reduce your sand cost and that you\u2019re also doubling your rail fleet as far as your ownership of the rail fleet, could both of these start to help margins in Q3 or is it more Q4 2015? Jeff Miller :  Yes, Angie, to address the first part of the question which is really what are we seeing across the entirety of North America. It\u2019s not all the same in terms of tightness, nor is it the same in terms of cost. So the ability to get the cost pass throughs, we\u2019re able to do that where we see that kind of inflation. The second part of your question around logistics, truly a place where we have a lot of confidence in our ability and our supply chain organization has a great window into the market in terms of how to acquire the inputs and as you suggested, or as we\u2019ve said in our comments, we\u2019ll continue to build the logistics capability that we have, and so that\u2019ll -- across a number of different parts of that supply chain. Angie Sedita :  Great, thanks, I\u2019ll turn it over. UBS:  Great, thanks, I\u2019ll turn it over. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Crandell of Cowen. Your line is now opened. Jim Crandell : Thank you. Just to follow-up on the pricing question, cost pass-throughs are usually the first step and you went out of your way to say that there\u2019s less than 10% excess capacity in the industry which seemingly sets a stage for real pricing increases and as we know your prices are well below where they were at the peak of the last cycle, when do you see it -- do you see it, and if so when do you see it coming, going from more of a cost recovery to real price increase environment in domestic pressure pumping? Cowen and Company : Thank you. Just to follow-up on the pricing question, cost pass-throughs are usually the first step and you went out of your way to say that there\u2019s less than 10% excess capacity in the industry which seemingly sets a stage for real pricing increases and as we know your prices are well below where they were at the peak of the last cycle, when do you see it -- do you see it, and if so when do you see it coming, going from more of a cost recovery to real price increase environment in domestic pressure pumping? Jeff Miller :  Yes, Jim, I can\u2019t, I\u2019m not going to give you a date or a time in that case, what best I can do is describe the conditions precedent which is what we\u2019re seeing; recall oil cycles are a little different than gas cycles in terms of spikiness, so -- but we -- our build schedule and sort of our view into the market gives us a lot of confidence around kind of that what we see for the balance of this year and in \u201915. Jim Crandell : Okay. And do you see - last cycle as I recall when you were building equipment, you would not add equipment unless you sold the least four other services along with the stimulation equipment, do you have a similar strategy now this year and will you be requiring your customers to order at least three or four product lines? Cowen and Company : Okay. And do you see - last cycle as I recall when you were building equipment, you would not add equipment unless you sold the least four other services along with the stimulation equipment, do you have a similar strategy now this year and will you be requiring your customers to order at least three or four product lines? Jeff Miller : Jim we see pull through on services consistently I mean that\u2019s part of our value proposition in terms of how we go to work most efficiently from a competitive standpoint I am not going to get into the requirement or where we are in that cycle but we are confident that the package of services that we put to work really work well together particularly as the market gets tighter and busier. Jim Crandell : Okay, thank you.  Cowen and Company : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Anderson of JPMorgan. Your line is now opened. David Anderson : No. Thank you. And apologize if I ask a question that might have been answered already as that line dropped off. But there is a question in terms of the capacity of how it\u2019s going to tighter in the market. How much of this do you think is due to seasonally smaller because you guys haven\u2019t had a lot of extra backup on wells and also we have a co-refurbishment cycle which I think is probably starting to kick in. Is that playing a factor in terms of the market tightening up to kind of less than 10% of excess capacity now? JPMorgan: No. Thank you. And apologize if I ask a question that might have been answered already as that line dropped off. But there is a question in terms of the capacity of how it\u2019s going to tighter in the market. How much of this do you think is due to seasonally smaller because you guys haven\u2019t had a lot of extra backup on wells and also we have a co-refurbishment cycle which I think is probably starting to kick in. Is that playing a factor in terms of the market tightening up to kind of less than 10% of excess capacity now? Dave Lesar : Well volume matters a lot, and so our strategy has been to build equipment into the market that handles a lot of volume, and handles the volume more efficiently than competing equipment in the market. So, what we\u2019re seeing it shape up in terms of tightness which is a function of volume, size of jobs that we have described plays right to us. I think that\u2019s -- so anyway it gives us a lots of confidence in the direction both the markets going and where we are. David Anderson : So do you need less backup capacity on a given well than your competitors? Can you give us some sort of sense as to how much less that would be? JPMorgan: So do you need less backup capacity on a given well than your competitors? Can you give us some sort of sense as to how much less that would be? Dave Lesar : Clearly, less, how much less that kind of depends on the size of the job and where it is and some of those things. But again our whole strategy was around putting equipment that is basically the lowest total cost of ownership and the ability to handle bigger jobs with less back up. And we\u2019re seeing that happen that\u2019s why we\u2019re -- and we described the 20% better efficiency out of our equipment and we\u2019re consistently seeing that work that way. David Anderson : Okay, a question for Mark on the guidance, so on the third quarter guidance you guided to kind of close to 20% margins in North America in the third quarter. Now if I recall correctly a lot of that\u2019s all coming from the cost side. Is there more to go on the cost side, you see margins picking up and should we start thinking and could we kind of start layering in I know you\u2019re kind of holding off and kind of say in the timing of pricing. But is that kind of next phase as you think about margin progression in North America? JPMorgan: Okay, a question for Mark on the guidance, so on the third quarter guidance you guided to kind of close to 20% margins in North America in the third quarter. Now if I recall correctly a lot of that\u2019s all coming from the cost side. Is there more to go on the cost side, you see margins picking up and should we start thinking and could we kind of start layering in I know you\u2019re kind of holding off and kind of say in the timing of pricing. But is that kind of next phase as you think about margin progression in North America? Mark McCollum : Yes, I think in terms of cost it is. If we look back at sort of the margin progression in Q1 to Q2, there is a little bit of cost, some of that\u2019s cost of goods sold and then commodities as Angie highlighted earlier that we certainly were able to add some share. But when you look back I mean in our analysis it is very much activity driven. Our units out there are working harder and they are sort of a breakpoint that really adds to the margin. We just finished the roll out of the core components of our Battle Red program. It\u2019s now in the field fully deployed. We\u2019re working through the change management of that process now as that stabilizes for the next couple of months. There is going to be additional cost savings that will be added to it. We\u2019re going to continue to work on supply chain and logistics. We all I think across the face of logistics bottlenecks and issues in the early part of Q2 with moving sand where it needed to be. We\u2019ll think as we continue to iron out logistics and add to our infrastructure there. We\u2019re going to be able to continue to drive additional savings. So at least -- we said all along we believe that we could get to close to 20% without the benefit of pricing and that is still the internal goal and we\u2019re driving hard to that and we think that the results of Q2 were a strong step toward that goal. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Handler of Jefferies. Your line is now opened. Brad Handler : Thanks and I guess I\u2019ll stay in the Western Hemisphere too. But first in Latin America, have you received the blanket order from Mexico for consulting and project management? I wasn\u2019t quite clear from the comment thus far. Jefferies & Company: Thanks and I guess I\u2019ll stay in the Western Hemisphere too. But first in Latin America, have you received the blanket order from Mexico for consulting and project management? I wasn\u2019t quite clear from the comment thus far. Dave Lesar : So Brad the answer is yes. We did get the blanket order but we didn\u2019t get it in time to be able to book any revenues in Q2. And so now that we have the blanket order in hand the process now is submitting billings that ultimately need to be approved by PEMEX management that ultimately can translate into revenue. So I mean that really was the impact of Q2 that we had to book cost and no ability to book revenues offsetting that even on an unbilled basis. So that we\u2019ve got it now in hand and that\u2019s why we feel fairly confident in our second half guidance around Latin America with regard to that. Brad Handler : Right assuming -- I guess assuming any kind of normal processing of those -- of your bills? Jefferies & Company: Right assuming -- I guess assuming any kind of normal processing of those -- of your bills? Dave Lesar : That\u2019s right, I mean it\u2019s clearly -- it's still customer dependent. We\u2019re subject to their timing and if they approve those bills on an expeditious manner then we get to book the revenues and have the margin uplift associated with it. Brad Handler : Okay, make sense. And then if I can come back to the U.S. too I guess we\u2019re also bouncing around some different questions here, but have you experienced in your view do you think you\u2019ve experienced some taking away of work from somebody else because of your distribution capabilities has have others already struggled but getting in the sand in place or some other facet of logistics that do you think you\u2019ve already taken share because of constraints of others? Jefferies & Company: Okay, make sense. And then if I can come back to the U.S. too I guess we\u2019re also bouncing around some different questions here, but have you experienced in your view do you think you\u2019ve experienced some taking away of work from somebody else because of your distribution capabilities has have others already struggled but getting in the sand in place or some other facet of logistics that do you think you\u2019ve already taken share because of constraints of others? Dave Lesar : But we did it at all the time Brad this is -- we rely on our infrastructure we\u2019re very proud of the logistics capability that we have and we really put to work in the second quarter. Brad Handler : Fair enough. Alright, that\u2019s fine. Thank you very much. That makes sense, thanks.  Jefferies & Company: Fair enough. Alright, that\u2019s fine. Thank you very much. That makes sense, thanks. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons & Company. Your line is now open. Bill Herbert :  Thank you. Good morning. Back to Latin America Mark, high confidence level with regard to your Latin America second half guidance and you\u2019re rationale with regard to the endorsing of the software order makes sense. You also had a stake in however in the press release that \u201cwe believe our full year Latin American margin should improve sufficiently to be around the \u201913 assuming approval on the billings under the blanket order in Mexico as well as a swift resolution of a retender in the Brazil drilling contract\u201d it doesn\u2019t sound like given you commentary that in fact your Latin American targets for the second half of the year are all that contingent on a resolution or the retender, correct? Simmons & Company:  Thank you. Good morning. Back to Latin America Mark, high confidence level with regard to your Latin America second half guidance and you\u2019re rationale with regard to the endorsing of the software order makes sense. You also had a stake in however in the press release that \u201cwe believe our full year Latin American margin should improve sufficiently to be around the \u201913 assuming approval on the billings under the blanket order in Mexico as well as a swift resolution of a retender in the Brazil drilling contract\u201d it doesn\u2019t sound like given you commentary that in fact your Latin American targets for the second half of the year are all that contingent on a resolution or the retender, correct? Dave Lesar : No, they are contingent on that as well the -- I mean both issues are there, the Mexico lack inability to build on the blanket order and of course the mobilization cost that we incurred where the larger issues of why the margins were off of Q1. So I think that relative to guidance that we gave at the end of Q1 the blanket order was the culprit that really hurt us in terms of being below what we thought the Latin American business was going to look like in Q2. So as we go to Q3 getting that back certainly helps us. The Brazil retender obviously we\u2019re subject to our customers\u2019 calendar as well on that front, they have a fairly aggressive schedule and so for they\u2019ve been executing against that schedule, we\u2019re hopeful that we can get some relief under that contract expeditiously if for some reason they begin to delay that process that push retender out to the end of the year and again right now I can\u2019t see that but assuming that happened it could have a marginal impact on us later in the year, in the fourth quarter. Bill Herbert : But the vast majority of the margin bridge for the second half of the year is the combination of the blanket order in Mexico coupled with object inception in Mexico as well? Simmons & Company: But the vast majority of the margin bridge for the second half of the year is the combination of the blanket order in Mexico coupled with object inception in Mexico as well? Dave Lesar :  That\u2019s exactly right. Bill Herbert :  Okay, great. And then secondly, this is probably a Dave question but maybe not, with regard to -- or Russia, you\u2019ve made some comments here there are some project tenders in the latter part of the year which now -- which could be delayed based upon the possibility of sanctions or just the turmoil that\u2019s underway in the region, could you elaborate on that and what that means? And then moreover if you could remind us kind of what percentage of your revenues are actually derived from Russia these days? Thank you.  Simmons & Company:  Okay, great. And then secondly, this is probably a Dave question but maybe not, with regard to -- or Russia, you\u2019ve made some comments here there are some project tenders in the latter part of the year which now -- which could be delayed based upon the possibility of sanctions or just the turmoil that\u2019s underway in the region, could you elaborate on that and what that means? And then moreover if you could remind us kind of what percentage of your revenues are actually derived from Russia these days? Thank you. Dave Lesar :  Yes, thanks Bill. The Russia business for us is the growing business and I think the commentary that you\u2019re describing is more around our outlook if sanctions were to be increased or become more so, currently at least till now the sanctions themselves have had a minimal impact on the business but as we -- as sanctions potentially escalate and the risk of more sanctions sort of looms that's what we believe puts some risk into the business in the back half of the year. Mark McCollum : I think on your sizing question Bill, this is Mark, I don\u2019t want to give any kind of specifics but I think the Russian business is the low single-digits percentage of our total revenues, company revenues, low single-digits. Operator : . : Jeff Tillery :  Hi, good morning. You mentioned several numbers just around completion size and intensity in the both leading edge I believe ahead of what you\u2019re seeing year-to-date, what are the answers for the industry to just in terms of preparedness is that just greater local storage, and do you see infrastructure as a limit or in terms of the industry actually being able to transition completions to where they want to go over the next 12 months? Tudor, Pickering Holt :  Hi, good morning. You mentioned several numbers just around completion size and intensity in the both leading edge I believe ahead of what you\u2019re seeing year-to-date, what are the answers for the industry to just in terms of preparedness is that just greater local storage, and do you see infrastructure as a limit or in terms of the industry actually being able to transition completions to where they want to go over the next 12 months? Dave Lesar : Yes, thanks. And we were seeing as you described record levels of congestion rather to speak for the industry itself I will speak for Halliburton and so where we spend our time is focused on building out that logistics capability to have access to adequate supplies of both propones and chemicals and there are many elements along that supply chain and we focus on each of them and we also maintain a broad base of suppliers on the sort of the source end of that business so I think the -- from our standpoint the volumes continue to increase, we really think it plays to what we would like to do which is prop into location and then just as importantly have the equipment on location that can handle it and deliver jobs very effectively. Jeff Tillery :  And the follow-up question has -- it is just around any sort of inflationary pressure as you are seeing here in the U.S. anything at this point where you are not able to recover your cost inflation from the customers even if it\u2019s not matched perfectly in timing and you think that you are stuck with? Tudor, Pickering Holt :  And the follow-up question has -- it is just around any sort of inflationary pressure as you are seeing here in the U.S. anything at this point where you are not able to recover your cost inflation from the customers even if it\u2019s not matched perfectly in timing and you think that you are stuck with? Dave Lesar :  Not at this point, we are able to -- so we have got great visibility into the inflationary pressures, we are -- and because of that I think we have the ability to respond to those quickly and get those in front of our customers. Jeff Tillery :  Okay, thank you guys.  Tudor, Pickering Holt :  Okay, thank you guys. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Jim Wicklund :  Good morning guys. Credit Suisse :  Good morning guys. Dave Lesar :  Hi, Jim. Jim Wicklund : I want to ask a pricing question because the anti-trust but I do want to drill down on something, investors don\u2019t want anybody in the industry adding capacity. If anybody adds capacity it slows down the pricing improvement so some people are going to see your acceleration of capacity adds as a negative. And I just want to ask I would assume that these capacity additions won\u2019t reduce margins it won\u2019t reduce your returns, is that a fair statement? Credit Suisse : I want to ask a pricing question because the anti-trust but I do want to drill down on something, investors don\u2019t want anybody in the industry adding capacity. If anybody adds capacity it slows down the pricing improvement so some people are going to see your acceleration of capacity adds as a negative. And I just want to ask I would assume that these capacity additions won\u2019t reduce margins it won\u2019t reduce your returns, is that a fair statement? Dave Lesar :  That\u2019s a fair statement Jim, I mean we are building to contract and we are building to fair away customers I say fair away players. So, we have got a lot of confidence that our equipment it goes to work in the market. Jim Wicklund :  Okay, okay I appreciate that that\u2019s going to probably be one of the hottest topics following the conference call is what that\u2019s going to be and I would assume that the 300 billion increase in CapEx would be to a large extent that acceleration of hydraulic horsepower? Credit Suisse :  Okay, okay I appreciate that that\u2019s going to probably be one of the hottest topics following the conference call is what that\u2019s going to be and I would assume that the 300 billion increase in CapEx would be to a large extent that acceleration of hydraulic horsepower? Dave Lesar :  Yes, it is. Jim Wicklund : Okay, my follow-up if I could, Bill asked it and I will kind of chime in, in the end. The two areas that we are worried about going forward are Iraq and Russia but only if sanctions or violence continues it then reveres -- you guys only have about a $100 million in assets in Iraq how material could that be in the year or two if things get worst than better does that -- would that be enough to drive your earnings down in two years? Credit Suisse : Okay, my follow-up if I could, Bill asked it and I will kind of chime in, in the end. The two areas that we are worried about going forward are Iraq and Russia but only if sanctions or violence continues it then reveres -- you guys only have about a $100 million in assets in Iraq how material could that be in the year or two if things get worst than better does that -- would that be enough to drive your earnings down in two years? Dave Lesar :  Jim, as we look at that market I mean it\u2019s a bit of a unknown over two years time what that could mean what we are seeing happen today are delays and getting contract approvals through the government and the extensions of contract I have to believe that, that rights itself over a period as long as two years because of the importance of hydrocarbons in that markets and to the government et cetera. So, as we look further down the road I mean I can see where this comes right as things settle out if it were to continue to escalate, clearly we have got other places we could move equipment and put it to work even in that very region. So, I think we have got lots of options we just prefer not to exercise them. Jim Wicklund : Thanks for the clarification guys. Credit Suisse : Thanks for the clarification guys. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Becker of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now opened. Doug Becker :  Thanks. So, back at the November Analyst Day kind of weighed out the North American target that at some point second half of the year margins would be approaching 20%, activity levels are better than expected at that point in time, the frac market is tighter, you are getting cost recovery, just what\u2019s the market dynamic that keeps from seeing margins above that 20% at that time the target that was weighed out at that time? Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Thanks. So, back at the November Analyst Day kind of weighed out the North American target that at some point second half of the year margins would be approaching 20%, activity levels are better than expected at that point in time, the frac market is tighter, you are getting cost recovery, just what\u2019s the market dynamic that keeps from seeing margins above that 20% at that time the target that was weighed out at that time? Dave Lesar :  As I hear a tough customer I think it\u2019s ultimately the dynamic largely the fact that there is inflation offsetting a lot of what we are doing to right here, you talked about activity, you talked about the increased -- the ability to pass through but we are constantly as Jeff has alluded to managing logistics challenges we are managing inflation across a number of cost categories and so that really is ultimately is pushing against us. We are continue to navigate through that very effectively and as I have indicated earlier, what we are seeing our largest margin improvement thus far has been on just the share efficiency of running our crudes really stretching out what we can do with these Q10 fleets and what our guys could do in the field every single day it\u2019s a differentiator for Halliburton that we see other people not being able to drag, we are going to continue to push on that until such time as I would say the pricing lock jam breaks. Doug Becker : And so, may be if I just summarized it, it\u2019s -- yes you are getting cost recovery which is not instantaneous relative to the cost inflation that you are seeing? Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And so, may be if I just summarized it, it\u2019s -- yes you are getting cost recovery which is not instantaneous relative to the cost inflation that you are seeing? Dave Lesar :  Yes it never is. Mark McCollum :  It never is. Doug Becker :  Okay. And then just a quick clarification the less than 10% excess capacity in horsepower is that before or after what I would call just normal industry friction? Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Okay. And then just a quick clarification the less than 10% excess capacity in horsepower is that before or after what I would call just normal industry friction? Dave Lesar :  Not sure, what you define is friction Doug\u2026 Doug Becker : It\u2019s just crudes moving in the yard just something that -- there is always some amount of capacity that\u2019s not available even if it truly is in the market? Bank of America Merrill Lynch : It\u2019s just crudes moving in the yard just something that -- there is always some amount of capacity that\u2019s not available even if it truly is in the market? Dave Lesar :  Our view is that it probably has some view of that, right. The reason we believe that\u2019s fallen that low is impart sort of twofold. One is, crude sizes have to grow, seems like 20% to 50% in some cases as the equipments working harder, so you have got more equipment in the field per fleet. And the second issue is because it\u2019s working so much harder, there is more in the shop and in the base, being worked on at any one point of time. And so the net, what we are trying to do is get a percentage calculation of what\u2019s available to work and it appears to us that what\u2019s available to work now is less than 10%. Doug Becker : Perfect, thank you. Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Perfect, thank you. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now opened. Waqar Syed : Thank you. My question relates to the share buyback program or the expansion that you announced. Mark, are you going to, I mean just to kind of sort of regular share buybacks on a monthly basis or this Dutch auction that you are considering as well as you have done in the past? Goldman Sachs : Thank you. My question relates to the share buyback program or the expansion that you announced. Mark, are you going to, I mean just to kind of sort of regular share buybacks on a monthly basis or this Dutch auction that you are considering as well as you have done in the past? Mark McCollum :  Waqar, there is no limitation as to how we can spend the money that the Board has authorized us to spend, so I wouldn\u2019t necessarily preclude a Dutch auction. I think though that right now it doesn\u2019t feel like that\u2019s the appropriate way to approach the market. We just did one last year. It was debt finance, and so our debt ratio was high. What I am primarily focused on is thinking about how do we deploy access cash, either -- obviously we have an opportunity here for reinvestment in the business that we have been discussing in North America. We have an opportunity all the way for additional M&A transactions similar to what we accomplished in Q2. But to the extent that we are generating more cash flow than we thought we would and that certainly has been the case over the last couple of quarters. And we believe will continue to be the case over the next few quarters. You will see us be in the market doing ratable share purchases until such time as it makes sense, collective sense, financial sense to do something on a larger scale. Waqar Syed : Okay. And then on Brazil, so retendering certainly positive but when should we expect kind of activity to actually pick up. Is that something that could happen early in \u201915 or later in \u201915, what\u2019s your view on that? Goldman Sachs : Okay. And then on Brazil, so retendering certainly positive but when should we expect kind of activity to actually pick up. Is that something that could happen early in \u201915 or later in \u201915, what\u2019s your view on that? Mark McCollum :  Waqar, we don\u2019t see a lot of change in \u201915, I mean this could be a \u201916 event when we see things, take back up there. There is opportunities for things to be done but I think there is also a lot of sorting out to be done. Waqar Syed : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Goldman Sachs : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Chuck Minervino of Susquehanna. Your line is now opened. Chuck Minervino :  Hi, good morning. Just wanted to go back also to the Analyst Day comments as well and I was hoping you can may be update us on the context of the guidance I believe you gave at that Analyst Day around $6 number for 2016. I also believe they are really heavily dependent on the self help you could do and getting really contemplate this improvement in this North America cycle. So may be clarify for us if you can and then also kind of may be give us some update on how you are thinking, is it possible that that kind of $6 number, I know it could have gone higher, I remember that slide at your Analyst Day. Can we see that $6 kind of run rate sooner than that or that $6 number going higher in \u201916 as well may be an update there? Susquehanna Financial Group :  Hi, good morning. Just wanted to go back also to the Analyst Day comments as well and I was hoping you can may be update us on the context of the guidance I believe you gave at that Analyst Day around $6 number for 2016. I also believe they are really heavily dependent on the self help you could do and getting really contemplate this improvement in this North America cycle. So may be clarify for us if you can and then also kind of may be give us some update on how you are thinking, is it possible that that kind of $6 number, I know it could have gone higher, I remember that slide at your Analyst Day. Can we see that $6 kind of run rate sooner than that or that $6 number going higher in \u201916 as well may be an update there? Dave Lesar : Chuck, 2016 seems like a long, long time away but I think it\u2019s fair to say six months or so off of our Analyst Day. We are very pleased with the progress that we are making on all fronts and each of our strategy is unconventional, deepwater mature fields. From a financial standpoint, the things that we are being able to accomplish in terms of improving cash flow, we are tracking right along the line, may be a little ahead of where we thought we will be in terms of reducing working capital. And so as I look at it, I think that everything is going exactly the way that we have planned may be a little bit better but don\u2019t necessarily want to get out there right now with the 2016 forecast. But certainly we firmly believe in our strategy both operational as well as financial strategy and we are going to execute against that strategy. We are not going to lever-off of that right now and feel like that certainly it\u2019s being successful in driving us forward. Chuck Minervino : Okay and then just a couple of quick ones. When you did lay that out, at that particular time did you anticipate having to add pressure pumping capacity or was that kind of planned with, when you laid that out, was that more of using what you had in the field? Susquehanna Financial Group : Okay and then just a couple of quick ones. When you did lay that out, at that particular time did you anticipate having to add pressure pumping capacity or was that kind of planned with, when you laid that out, was that more of using what you had in the field? Jeff Miller : We had always planned to implement the Q10 in fact of the future strategy, so the timing and the pace of that was not as clear certainly a bad time but given the value and the efficiency of the equipment, part of our strategy has always been to put that newer technology to work. Chuck Minervino :  Alright, thank you very much. Susquehanna Financial Group :  Alright, thank you very much. Operator :  Thank you. At this time I would like to turn the call back to management for any closing comment. Kelly Youngblood : Thank you, Sam. On behalf of the Halliburton management team, I am sorry Dave\u2026 Dave Lesar : Yes Kelly let me just add one last comment to what Jeff said because I think it\u2019s been important one and that, and it goes back to the issue that the question Jim Wicklund had around our market expectations in adding pumping capacity. Of course we\u2019re not going to be crazy enough to add equipment into the market if we see that it\u2019s going to have an impact on our margin expectations from the direction that they\u2019re had it right now. We build to market expectations. We build to the customer base we have. We build to the market share we believe that is efficient to support our business in North America. And we\u2019re also building in a Q10 fleet that we believe is second to none in the marketplace. So as Jeff said all we really are doing is accelerating a bill that we have previously laid out to everybody to get it done faster to take advantage of the efficiencies and the competitive advantage we have from it sooner rather than later. So, I wouldn\u2019t get too exercised about it in my view I think it\u2019s the smart business decision and clearly we wouldn\u2019t do it if we didn\u2019t think it was in the best interest of our shareholders. Kelly Youngblood : And with that, I\u2019d like to thank everyone for your participation. And Sam I\u2019ll turn it back over to you to close the call. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

And welcome to the Halliburton\u2019s Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Kelly Youngblood, Halliburton\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Kelly Youngblood : Good morning. And welcome to the Halliburton third quarter 2014 conference call. Today\u2019s call is being webcast and a replay would be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Jeff Miller, President. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risk and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton\u2019s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2014, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today include non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations to the most direct comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our third quarter press release which can be found on our website. Unless otherwise noted, in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of restructuring charges taken in the third quarter of 2013 and an insurance recovery and a decrease to our reserve taken during the third quarter of 2014, both of which are related to the Macondo litigation. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave. Dave. Dave Lesar : Thank you Kelly and good morning to everyone. I can tell you I am really pleased with our third quarter results. Even with all the noise out there this quarter and things such as Russian sanctions, disruptions in Libya and Iraq, the supply chain challenges we faced, and customer delays in the Gulf of Mexico, I believe we met these challenges head on, fought through them and we\u2019re successful, and I am really proud of our employees who made it happen. Now here are the headlines : record company revenue of $8.7 billion. We also delivered industry leading revenue and operating income growth, both sequentially and year-over-year, once again outgrowing our peer group. New quarterly revenue records for both North America and the Eastern hemisphere with double-digit sequential revenue growing in Latin America, and one I know you are going to want to hear is that the exit rate for this quarter for North American margins was over the 20% margin mark, a major milestone in delivering our analyst day commitment to you, our shareholders. In addition, our job board in North America remained sold out and we are delivering new stimulation equipment that will allow us to add incremental work in the fourth quarter with no negative impact on our margins. We believe the Macondo case is an essentially over for Halliburton, based on our settlement in the judge\u2019s ruling in the litigation. And lastly, we continue to focus on delivering higher shareholder returns to you. This quarter, we repurchased an additional $300 million in stock, and our Board of Directors has approved an additional 20% dividend increase, meaning we now have doubled our quarterly dividend over the past two years. Now let\u2019s go through some of the geographies. Company operating income increased 21% sequentially. North America grew 15%, Europe, Africa/CIS 16%, and Latin America more than doubled by growing 126% from the prior quarter. In North America, activity levels continued to surge higher month over month due to an unprecedented level of service intensity. As you will recall, I called the turn two quarters ago. This quarter, things are clearly accelerating out of that turn, and we do not see momentum slowing anytime soon. We also made excellent progress on pricing and our stimulation contract renewals and on cost recovery for ongoing contracts. Across key basins, we have negotiated higher prices that at a minimum should recover current and expected future cost inflation, and we should begin to see the full impact of new contract pricing as we move in to 2015. Now a hot topic today is obviously proppant and sand logistics, and we did experience some disruptions early in the third quarter where work was delayed because we were waiting on sand deliveries, and we did in fact miss some jobs as did nearly every other service company. But I can tell you, we have great people who helped us manage through this challenge each and every day, and we have now taken actions to get ahead of this issue going forward, and Jeff will provide details on this in a few minutes. Now moving to our international markets, despite the geopolitical issues we faced in areas like Russia, Libya, and Iraq, our eastern hemisphere activity continues to expand at a steady rate. On the strength of markets like Saudi Arabia, Southern Iraq, West Africa, and the Caspian, we are on track to deliver double-digit revenue growth for the full year 2014. In addition, we expect to be awarded $1 billion of new work in Iraq. And consistent with previous years, we expect the fourth quarter in the eastern hemisphere to be our strongest quarter of the year due to seasonal year-end software and equipment sales. So, over the last three years, we\u2019ve delivered industry-leading, double-digit revenue growth in the eastern hemisphere, and as we look ahead to 2015, we anticipate the rate of growth may slightly moderate due to headwinds from ongoing geopolitical issues as well as customer spending adjustments, especially among the IOCs as they seek to achieve better returns for their company. And although double-digit growth may be a challenge for any service company next year, we fully expect to continue to outpace our peers in revenue growth whatever market is handed to us. Now let\u2019s move to Latin American. This has been an area that\u2019s had a tough year. Even with better revenue in the third quarter, margins and overall activity levels still do not meet my expectations, due primarily to continued operational delays in Mexico. But as we look ahead, I see several positive factors finally coming in to play. First, we are up and running on our integrated projects in Mexico and expect to be at full operational capacity in early 2015. We are also excited about the pace of Mexico energy reform and expect to see strong opportunities in Mexico shale, mature fields, and deepwater markets in the coming years. In Brazil, negotiations on the recently retendered directional-drilling contract are progressing, and we expect to be operating under the new and more profitable contract as we transition into the first quarter. And last but not least, we are very excited about our recent multi-billion dollar award in Ecuador where we expect strong growth as these projects ramp up next year. So for Latin America, I expect a much strong 2015 and we are well positioned for tremendous growth potential in the coming years. Now before I close, I have to recognize that there is currently a concern about the recent decline in commodity prices. I am not going to predict what the oil price is going to be, but on a longer term, we believe industry fundamentals suggest that these lower prices are not sustainable. While we might be in a slight oversupply situation right now, remember demand is still growing. Therefore considering North America and OPEC production expectations, the continued tightness in global spare production capacity and potential geopolitical impacts on non-OPEC production, we believe that supply and demand will essentially be back in balance in a relatively short period of time. Nevertheless, we are keenly aware that there is a risk of a moderation in activity if oil prices remain weak for an extended period of time. What I can tell you is that in recent conversations with our North America customers, we have not received any indication of activity levels slowing as we transition into 2015. For example, last week the IEA commented that approximately 98% of North America liquids projects have a breakeven price below $80 per barrel and over 80% work below $60 a barrel. On the international front, the majority of our NOC customers have not indicated that their activity levels will slow down at all. However, as I mentioned before, we are ready expecting our IOC customers to moderate their capital budgets in 2015 to improve their individual company returns. That being said, we can\u2019t be in denial about what is happening in the market today. As you know, I have been around the block a few times and I can tell you our management team is well equipped to handle this kind of uncertainty. We will control what we can control in areas such as cost management, contract price renewals and managing customer relationships. We know that we can do these things very well. My experiences taught me that if we keep the franchise strong and growing, and I can tell you that we are going to do that, aligned with the right customers which we\u2019ve already done and take care of our employees, we will be fine in the long run. Whether this uncertainty lasts for a few months or longer, we are ready for any market. I think we are well positioned as a company to capture all of the market upside potential for you, while giving you protection to any downside. Strategically we are structured to deliver the lowest cost per barrel to our customers, which in turn positions them and Halliburton to perform best in volatile markets. As such we believe oil prices will have to remain at lower levels for a sustained period before the long term economics would begin to impact our primary customers. So to sum it up, our overall strategy is working well and we intend to stay the course. Whatever the market, we believe we can outperform our peers, and we remained focused on consistent execution, generating superior financial performance and providing industry leading shareholder returns. We have delivered this to you in the past and I believe we will continue to do so in the future. Now let me turn the call over to Mark to provide you some financial details. Mark. Mark McCollum : Thanks Dave and good morning. Let me begin with an overview of our third quarter results, starting with North America. Revenues were up 9% sequentially. This strong all organic growth was relative to a 3% increase in the US land rig count. Operating income was up 15% over the same period, margins for the quarter averaged 19.2% with our September exit rate coming in slightly higher than the 20% mark. Stronger activity levels in US land and the rebound from the Canadian spring breakup drove the improvement for the quarter, more than offsetting increased logistics cost and the impact of loop currents in the Gulf of Mexico. Margins also benefited from modest pricing improvements on pressure pumping contract renewals, which were designed to cover inflation on specific cost categories such as transportation, fuel and labor. In the Eastern Hemisphere, revenue and operating income increased sequentially by 4% and 6% respectively. Growth was led by Europe Africa/CIS where revenue and operating income increased 6% and 16% respectively compared to the prior quarter. Seasonal increases in Russia and the Caspian, higher activity in Angola, along with increased well, construction activity in continental Europe, led the sequential improvement. Partially offsetting these increases were activity declines in Libya, Algeria and Norway. The seasonal recovery in Russia was negatively affected by the recent sanctions and growth in this market is expected to be a challenge for the foreseeable future, since we\u2019ll be prohibited from tendering projects that fall under the sanctioned restrictions. We expect our Russia business will continue to face headwinds next year, including the possibility of additional sanctions, but we are hopeful that full-year 2015 could come in at similar levels to this year. Middle East /Asia region revenue increased by 3% sequentially and operating income was in line with the second quarter. Activity improvements in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, India and Indonesia during the quarter were mostly offset by sequential declines in stimulation work in Malaysia and Australia. On a year -over-year basis, we\u2019ve seen tremendous revenue growth across Middle East/Asia, Saudi is leading with a 60% improvement and India, Iraq, and Thailand have all delivered growth over 30%. The conflict in Iraq resulted in a shutdown of the majority of activities in Kurdistan in northern Iraq. However, the majority of our operations had been in southern Iraq away from the fighting where activity levels have remained relatively stable. At this point activity is gradually returning to Kurdistan and overall we expect Iran to be a growth market for us in 2015. In Latin America revenue increased 16% sequentially, while operating income more than doubled compared to the previous quarter. Mexico was the primary driver where we saw benefit of higher activity on our Humapa project and recent contract approvals, which resulted in an increase in consulting and software revenue for the quarter. We also experienced higher testing and directional drilling activity in Brazil, as well as increased work over and stimulation activity in Venezuela. Our corporate and other expense totaled $83 million for the quarter a little lower than anticipated, driven by a reduction in strategic initiative cost and lower legal expenses. We anticipate that our corporate expenses for the fourth quarter will be approximately $90 million. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 25%, primarily driven by an adjustment to reflect the recoverability of our net operating loss carry forwards in Brazil. For the fourth quarter you are expecting the effective tax rate to return to our normalized rate of approximately 28 % to 29%. We now expect our 2014 capital expenditures will be approximately $3.2 billion and depreciation and amortization to be approximately $2.1 billion for the year. During the third quarter we recorded income of $66 million in discontinued operations. This is primarily related to settlement with KBR for amount sold to us under our tax sharing agreement with them. We announced today that a Board of Directors approved a 20% increase to our quarterly dividend from $0.15-$0.18 per share, resulting in a cumulative 100% increase to our quarterly dividend over the last two years. As previously stated, our intention going forward is for our dividend payout to equal at least 15% to 20% of our net income. Additionally, based on our continued confidence in our business prospects, we bought back an additional $300 million in shares during the third quarter. We still have $5.7 billion remaining in repurchase authorization from a Board of Directors available for future stock buybacks. Now moving to the Eastern Hemisphere outlook; in the fourth quarter, we are anticipating moderate growth resulting in a mid-single digit percentage sequential improvement in revenue, with margins in the upper teens. Middle East/Asia is expected to have a high single digit sequential improvement, with margins approaching 20% for the quarter. We expect our Europe, Africa/CIS region to be relatively flat as a result of geopolitical challenges in Russia and Libya and reduced customer spending in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. In Latin America, we expect mid-single digit sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter, with margins improving modestly from the third quarter. This improvement is expected to result from year-end software and product sales as well as the continued ramp up of our IPM and asset management projects in Mexico. Concluding with North America; in the fourth quarter, we typically see a seasonal decline in both revenue and margins. This year, however, based on the exit rates, we saw in the third quarter, as well as the incremental equipment, we are currently deployed and considering our forecast for minimal holiday downtime this year, we believe fourth quarter revenue and margins will be flat to modestly higher than the third quarter. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff for an update on our strategy. Jeff? Jeff Miller : Thank you. Mark and good morning everyone. I\u2019m excited about our results this quarter, the Halliburton team is dead focused on strategy execution, and the results are clearly evident in the quarter\u2019s industry-leading growth, with both of our divisions setting revenue records as well as revenue records for 11 of 13 product lines. As a reminder, our strategy is built around three key growth markets unconventionals, deepwater and mature fields. Our unconventional strategy is designed to deliver the lowest cost per barrel of oil equivalent for our customers with surface efficiency, custom chemistry and subsurface insight. Our deepwater strategy is to increase reliability and reduce uncertainty. And finally our mature field\u2019s strategy is to deliver additional hydrocarbons in declining fields by identifying new reserves and optimizing the recovery of existing reserves. Clearly these strategies are working. In North America unconventional market the topic on everyone\u2019s mind this quarter was logistics, driven by big increases in both horizontal activity and completions intensity which is right in the sweet spot of surface efficiencies. Now compared to the prior year, US horizontal recount in the third quarter was up more than 20%. Over the same timeframe our stage count was up more than 30% and our average sand per well increased by more than 50%. While the rising recount was predominantly a Permian basin phenomena, our customers are experimenting with larger completion volumes in almost every basin. This is a fundamental change in well design that we believe is part of a continuing trend. As Dave said, earlier in the quarter, we experienced issues related to logistical disruptions, primarily around proppant. Cast in terms of surface efficiency increasing intensity presents a terrific opportunity for us. We\u2019ve addressed these rising completion volumes by expanding our infrastructure and transport capability. This includes increasing our sand terminal capacity by over 100%, and we are on a path to double our current rate fleet. In terms of the last mile, trucking from the railhead out to the location we\u2019ve added over 30 new contract suppliers so far this year, giving us a better footprint in the capacity to handle these intense volumes of work. Additionally, we implemented a sand logistics command centre in Houston, where operation personnel monitor supply levels in the basins and the set with transport and procurement specialists for tracking our rail and trucking fleets all in real time. The combination of these steps resulted in a sharp increase in efficiency and we are confident that this integrated approach to logistics will continue to differentiate Halliburton. A quick update on our CYPHER seismic-to-stimulation platform; we are now at over 60 projects running, with more in the pipeline. In addition to taking on new work, we are also seeing customers expand CYPHER engagements to multiple basins in North America. Most recently we started a multi-year CYPHER project in the Permian basis incorporating the full breadth of our products and services. We are only a few months in to the study, but early wells have already seen more than a 20% increase in average production compared to offset wells. And CYPHER continues to serve as an engine for commercializing new technology like RockPerm a proprietary chemistry service that enables better oil flow and then FRACINSIGHT a Halliburton software package to help customers optimize the perforation placement and deliver the most efficient wells. We are very pleased with the client uptake on the CYPHER platform and typically see follow-on work in additional basins with those same clients. Our execution of surface efficiency, custom chemistry and subsurface insight led to more than 20% extra rate margins for North America in the third quarter. In deepwater we remain focused on technology that reduces uncertainty and improves reliability for our customers. I will give you a couple of examples of technology that are getting traction right now. The GeoTap IDS which is a sampling-while-drilling tool allows clients to take multiple fluid samples which reduces uncertainty while at the same time reducing costly rig time. Another is BaraECD which is a drilling fluid that allows customers to stabilize circulating density enabling them to reliably drill more complex wells. We have already seen success on a global basis from the Gulf of Mexico to the North Sea to the offshore Asia, and most recently in deepwater Angola. But the real point here is that we are executing a technology strategy that does exactly what we say to help clients reduce uncertainty and increase reliability in deepwater. And now finally in mature fields, our customers continue to look for ways to enhance recovery rates, whether through discreet product offerings such as a recently acquired Progressive Cavity Pump technology or through large scale asset management projects. Let me highlight just a couple of these large project opportunities. The first is the recently awarded IGAPO project in Ecuador. This is a project that provides asset management across nine mature fields. This is a 15 year project that we expect to provide a stable, long term revenue stream that could potentially double our business in the country, representing a multi-billion dollar opportunity over the full term of the project. We are very excited about this opportunity in Ecuador and expect work to begin late in the first quarter of 2015. Second, we recently extended and integrated drilling project in southern Iraq and are encourage by progress on several other significant IPM projects in the country. We believe these opportunities will provide a platform for continued double-digit growth in the Middle East region throughout 2015. Now beyond these recent awards, we are currently evaluating a pipeline of well over $30 billion worth of IPM work, which gives us confidence that we are on the right track with our mature field strategy. And in closing we believe that our strategies continue to provide growth opportunities. Our technology, infrastructure and processes are aligned and we are relentlessly focused on superior growth margins and returns. Now I will turn the call back over to Dave for his closing comments. Dave? Dave Lesar : Alright, thank you Jeff. Before we go to the questions let me summarize what you heard today. North American exit margins greater than 20%, our new equipment will be going to work at at least those exit margins. We are building our North American logistics to get ahead of the curve. We made good progress this quarter negotiating price increases with our customers and in Latin America headwinds are becoming tailwinds, and 2015 is shaping up to be a much stronger year. In the Eastern Hemisphere there are few troubled spots, but we still an opportunity for steady growth in the coming year and we continue to focus on delivering the highest shareholder returns as evidenced by our 20% dividend increase in addition of $300 million of stock repurchases during the quarter. Before I close I want to make one final comment on the current environment. The strategic initiatives we\u2019ve been working on the last several years Battle Red, Frac of the Future and others make us what I believe is the most efficient and adaptable organization in the industry. We are able to execute equally well in either a boom market or one that\u2019s more challenged. Across the board, we are focused on making better wells for our customers and better returns for you our shareholders. So no matter what market is handed to us, our strategies give us confidence that we will continue to outperform our peers. So with that let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) our first question comes from James West of ISI. Your line is now open. James West - ISI: First of all, just congrats on the substantial year-over-year growth in Eastern Hemisphere well above your peers. I suspect Joe Rainey is pretty proud of what he\u2019s been able accomplish. And then Dave as you mentioned, you\u2019ve been around the block a couple of times here, and I wanted to know kind of what\u2019s your gut telling you right now about the outlook for North America as we go into next year? I know it\u2019s a tough question, but it\u2019s on everybody\u2019s mind, and given your history in the industry, I was curious about kind of your feel for what you think is going to happen next year. Dave Lesar : Let me let Jeff take the first crack at it and then I will come in at the end if I feel I need to add something. Jeff Miller : Our outlook today is very positive. We are in the heavy part of our renewal period now, and I would tell you that renewals are rolling up not down, and as of last week, I talked to a lot of customers and budgets are moving up, not down. So in terms of activity, everything I see looks like its increasing into 2015 and quite frankly our strategy that we have in place around delivering the lowest cost per BOE in the market is more valuable than ever. Dave Lesar : So I guess let me just add, I think if you want to summarize it, we are not feeling, hearing, seeing anything that says this momentum is going to change that we had coming out of Q3. James West - ISI: And then on the international side, I think you gave a good outline of most of the regions around the world, you know some obviously slowness from the IOCs, but the same type of commentary around the NOCs in the international markets, no commentary around them slowing down. Jeff Miller : Not seen any of that James. This is Jeff, the capital is going to work, it\u2019s going to work in mature fields, it\u2019s going to work in unconventionals, maybe more so than deepwater, but again where we are positioned and what we are seeing around integrated asset management opportunities as in just a traditional work, nothing leads us to believe that from an IOC perspective there is any change - NOC perspective. Operator : Our next question comes from Jud Bailey of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Jud Bailey - Wells Fargo : Question on the fourth quarter, you had indicated North American margins are -- you exited at 20%. I believe Mark indicated you thought only a slight increase in margins from 3Q to 4Q. Is that just allowing for seasonality or how should we think about the fourth quarter \u2013a seasonally fourth quarter where your exit rate was above kind of what you had indicated, I guess? Mark McCollum : Hey Jud this is Mark. Yeah, that\u2019s exactly right, you know we always try to consider that fourth quarter you have some holiday down time, you are going to have some seasonality particularly in the Rockies where we have a dominant market position that will impact operations as you close out the year. But what we are doing is we are looking at every thing on balance; first of all very strong exit rates, second of all very strong activity levels that month-over-month continues to increase. When we are working, our equipment is working very hard. We had already indicated earlier in the year that we\u2019ve been building additional frac equipment, you know we\u2019ll have new spreads that are already hitting the street today that will be active during the fourth quarter, that will be adding to our complement of equipment that will be generating revenues, and so when you take all that on balance, we are just saying that this fourth quarter uniquely looks like one that we could have a slightly better earnings and profits in this fourth quarter in North America than you might see in a traditional fourth quarter. Now that\u2019s assuming a very sort of standard weather pattern, standard holiday downtime. But from our base outlook, it looks like its going to be a very good Q4. Jud Bailey - Wells Fargo : And then if I could may be stretch the margin outlook into 2015, understanding that customers aren\u2019t really indicating a slowdown at this point, if we were to see some operators sort of scale back activity or just flatten out their budgets, can you help us think about -- Halliburton\u2019s going to have a lot of moving parts, you are negotiating new contract at higher pricing, it sounds like now. If you see a softness in utilization and you are obviously recovering some of your recent cost increases as well; how should we think about your margins in 2015 if we were to see a slow down. Is it a situation where you think you could hold the line of margins, would they decline potentially or could they still go up because of the net pricing you are already starting to see in your contracts? Jeff Miller : Yeah Jud this is Jeff. Our entire strategy is built around delivering Frac of the Future or HALvantage. If we roll back to our analyst day, we\u2019d always said that we would continue to put more efficient equipment in the market and more efficient work practices so that we would be able to improve margins on the back of the way that we are working. So as I look out into 2015, we are seeing those fundamental pieces of our business continuing to deliver which clearly means that we continue to see a positive impact on margins. Dave Lesar : Yeah I think, let me just one thing, if you go again, go back to analyst day, the impact of things like Battle Red, Frac of the Future and other things that you were doing at that point, we thought could add five points in margin without any price increases. And we are not backing off that view. A lot of the push up and margins right now are just those things been implemented and us been more efficient as an organization. So I think to answer the question specifically, if you did have a flattening out, I would expect that our margins would be at least where they are today. Operator : Our next question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is now open. Angie Sedita - UBS: So there was intensity growth of 50% quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year was pretty amazing, and I know Jeff touched on it a little bit. But could you give us additional color there on what you are seeing on the oil service intensity side and I know you indicated it was [basin], but can you go in to that a little bit. And then thoughts on 2015, what kind of any insights at this point on the degree of service intensity growth that we could see this year and clearly its worth noting that even if the rig count is flat and the well count is flat you are still driving higher revenues in margins. Jeff Miller : The (inaudible) intensity continue to increase on the basis of the types of jobs that are being designed and so we\u2019ve seen a consistent increase in the amount of proppant and the amount of stages. So I refer specifically to 30% increase in stage count, 50% increase in sand consumption. I would say that you see a bigger ramp in the more mature basins, because that\u2019s where we are really getting in to what I\u2019d call sort of hyper efficiency and increasing the production of existing wells as oppose to way before its\u2019 a little bit more, I will use it with quotes around it \u201cexploratory\u201d in a few basins. But as I look in to 2015, I don\u2019 see anything that changes the pace of increase necessarily across the piece simply because we are making better wells, and that\u2019s what takes us back to the importance sand logistics and the ability to deliver. I will give you a one quick anecdote; for us that have seen trains load, we can unload an entire unit train in nine hours and we can load a truck in seven minutes. So that\u2019s kind of where we are focusing our attention. Angie Sedita - UBS: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then thinking about this oil service intensity growth and it\u2019s reported out there, we are going to add 1.5 million to 2 million in horsepower next year. How much do you think of that is being added with standalone crews and they are actually full (inaudible) fleets and how much of that horsepower do you think is reinforcement for existing fleets; that there is much of the third or even more. Jeff Miller : No, I mean when we look at that our expectation that\u2019s probably less than 10% coming in to the market, and the fact is the equipment is working harder than it has ever worked before given the size of the stages and the amount of the sand. So my expectation is most of that equipment will either be backup equipment, four big jobs now with our Q-10 pumps we are more effective with typically 20% less horsepower on location, and quite frankly less back up. I put very little backup equipment to work in the market. So that\u2019s kind of the takeaway is not that concerned, really not concerned about additional horsepower. Operator : Our next question comes from Ole Slorer of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley : Sorry to [harpoon] on the sand this year, but some pretty staggering number of 50% up high and kind of what we have heard from other players. Do you think that\u2019s something that deals with Halliburton\u2019s customer base and the opposition in the market or do you think this is sort of an industry trend. Jeff Miller : Well I think it\u2019s a little bit of both Ole, we are working with fairway players, we\u2019ve always said that we make it a point to work with the most efficient operators in the market place so that we get the maximum utilization of the technology we are putting in the markets. So we are pumping more sand may be then competitors would not surprise me at all. But I do think longer term there will be a continued move towards better frac design thinking about our CYPHER technology how we design the best fracs to get the most production out of the wells. And I do believe that will lead us to a continuation of larger volumes. Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley : So how are you scaling your infrastructure over the next say two years, and what are you planning for as far as your experience for 2015-\u201916 volume growth per well. Jeff Miller : Well let me think about it this way and in terms of what we are doing to address that. I think the volumes will continue to increase across the piece that may not stay at the same rate of increase. But from our standpoint, we\u2019ll continue to invest in logistics and control the supply chain really from mine to the last well, from the mine to the last mile it gets us to two locations which looks like sand transloading and investment in rail cars. And these are things that overcome the logistics problems that seem to occur. Mark McCollum : Which we are certainly \u2013 Ole this is Mark just to add to that, from a contracting standpoint, we are working very hard to make sure that we\u2019ve got all the sand dates that we are forecasting under contract. You know we\u2019ll probably have 80% of our sand needs contracted this year it may go up to 90% next year. By contracting our sand, looking forward that allows us to shave off anywhere from 15% to 20% off of a spot of sand pricing. Doing the same on rail cars making sure that we\u2019ve got plenty of capacity to run full unit trains, making sure that our transloading facilities each one are designed to offload complete unit trains. We are the only one so far I think to have managed to be able to really offload complete unit trains on sight on some of our location, and we are just going to look forward to where our customers are saying they are going to be running these volumes and make sure that the infrastructures onsite to be able to run as lean and efficient as we possibly can. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons. Your line is now open. Bill Herbert \u2013 Simmons: Dave and Jeff to tackle the international question just a little bit differently. You guys have been consistent and you\u2019ve been correct here with regard to just the pace of international expansion in general over the past several years, and when I look at your numbers for 2014 and juxtapose them against the preceding couple of years, you will likely end up somewhere kind of high-single digits year-over-year in \u201914 versus kind of a low teens rate of expansion in \u201913 and a 20% rate of expansion in \u201912. So when we contemplate 2015 against the slate of opportunities and threats, at this juncture do you think you will do well to match your international rate of growth of this year or should we expect something less. Jeff Miller : So the answer to that was, we expect outgrow the market or outgrow our competitors in that space. There clearly are some headwinds when we look around the world right now. So the North Sea, Russia and Libya are clearly going to present headwinds, so quite encouraged around tailwinds in the Middle East and Asia Pacific. So when I think about growth, more specifically, it may be more of where capital gets put to work, may be than it has been in the past we talked a lot about deepwater, potential moderation as IOCs look at their capital budgets. But that said, the barrels come from somewhere and our expectation is that we may see more of that capital going in to development and mature field type of opportunities, and so for that reason I am still very encouraged about our ability to sustain growth in to 2015 that would be sort of similar to where we are now. Bill Herbert - Simmons: Okay, and the billion dollar project in Iraq, can you elaborate on that and also I guess to play devils\u2019 advocate for a second, why would we even want that given the travails that the industry has witnessed over the past several years there. Dave Lesar : Let me answer that (inaudible) your first question was your [output] in reverse order. Why would we want that work? The fact is we are a lot smarter in that market than we\u2019ve ever been. I think we were early in to that market and underestimated the risk around logistics and a few other things. We really like the contract the way this one looks in terms of terms and conditions. So feel good about that. The project itself I won\u2019t name the project, but it\u2019s a great project, its four rigs to drill, 120 wells over the next probably three years. We have invested heavily in putting our IPM team together and they are really executing it. So if I think how we execute on mature fields longer term, these are the kind of projects that we are going to do. Operator : Our next question comes from Brad Handler of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brad Handler - Jefferies: May be just a quick one, your CapEx commentary I guess just a little bit lighter than second quarter commentary. What are you reflecting in that, is that a difficulty in spending some capital, and you will spend it in \u201915 or are you actually shaving it relative to some of the commentary you\u2019ve given us this morning. Jeff Miller : There\u2019s not been any kind of a conservative effort to shave capital. I think its probably a little bit tighter forecast particularly as we look forward in some of the projects in the eastern hemisphere. It just takes some time off and times to get things approved and so it\u2019s just timing. So you will see some of that coming in to probably the early part of 2015. Brad Handler - Jefferies: And then maybe an unrelated to follow-up and may be it\u2019s a bit broader. If I look at your North America D&E revenues, over the nine months it\u2019s sort of tracking the rig count, but I think it\u2019s up 6% again nine months versus nine months and that\u2019s relative to your horizontal rig count up 13% of US land any way or in the US. So I know there\u2019 some other factors and may be you will fill that in to the answer. But how does \u2013 what the prognosis for how that is moving forward, are there some things that that might move in place that can accelerate D&E and they can align better with the horizontal rig count. Are there some factors that continue to suggest it will somewhat less than that? Jeff Miller : Yeah, and I think what you are seeing the current quarter is a bit of impact of the Gulf of Mexico. So we experienced loop currents like everybody else, and so we had a quite a bit slower activity in the Gulf of Mexico in the current quarter. But the well construction type activity is going to track generally speaking the rig count. But we are really encouraged as we look Q4 and beyond hit the loop currents behind us. We really like our share in the Gulf of Mexico right now, and it\u2019s a growing share in the Gulf of Mexico. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse : Eastern hemisphere production really hasn\u2019t grown much in the last couple of years, and you guys are setting records in terms of operating income and revenues, and the US of course has been growing. Is the level of activity in the eastern hemisphere somewhat inelastic considering that we at least have to maintain production. Jeff Miller : Yes Jim, that\u2019s the right answer. We are working harder and harder to produce arguably the same number of barrels, but those barrels are critical to number of economies around the world, and so when we look at sort of outlook; two things, one, the projects that are started have to continue. These are long duration type projects, they don\u2019t turn on and off, and then secondly, there are a lot of mature field type activity that we know would lower exploration risk almost nil exploration risks. Those are projects that create terrific returns for our customers. So I think those two conspire to give you an inelastic sort of outlook. Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse : And my follow-up, if I could, there\u2019s so much the same for in North America. If the US unconventional production starts to decline on an unconventional hyperbolic, the amount of effort it takes to reverse that is huge. So how much activity in the US is needed to maintain not grow, but just maintain existing US production. You all have done that work? Jeff Miller : It\u2019s quite a bit of the work that\u2019s going on now, and I guess Jim the way I would answer that is, rather than give you a percentage, I would say that we know the decline rates on existing wells\u2019 fairly dramatic. We know what it takes in order to continue to improve that. So I would expect that sustaining activity or sustaining production in North America takes a quite a big chunk of the work that\u2019s going on now. Dave Lesar : Jim this is Dave, I would just add one thing and I think we refer to it as sort of the treadmill effect. What you want to do is get your customers in a basin where they\u2019ve got sufficient amount of production that they have to get on the treadmill if you will to keep that production going, because that\u2019s a great place for a service company to be, and a great place for the lowest cost most efficient service company to be, because helping the customers stay on that treadmill as it gets faster and the incline goes up is part of the whole hyper efficiency model that we try to offer up to our customers. Operator : Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead of RBC Capital Market. Your line is now open. Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Market : I just had a follow-up question regarding the frac dynamics in US and you guys have discussed for many quarters now cost recovery process, it seems like that is now beginning to take hold. Just wondering what your perspective is terms of the incremental capacity that\u2019s been added recently and whether or not some of that cost recovery can turn in to net pricing gains from an industry standpoint going forward. Jeff Miller : I can\u2019t speak for the industry, but we\u2019ll speak for Halliburton, and this is right in our wheel house. As you said recovering inflation has really been the order of the day, but as we go through the renewals and we sort of establish inflationary increases that keep us whole, very quickly we drop back in to our ability to manage cost and drive efficiency which should allow us of it does allow us to convert that inflation in to net pricing to the extent to which we compete at the market, and this precisely why we implement and have advantage and the logistics advantages we have Battle Red, Frac of the Future and that\u2019s what conspires to deliver our exit rates in excess 20%. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Becker of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Doug Becker - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Mark you mentioned Europe, Africa/ CIS would be relatively flat in the fourth quarter, wanted to confirm that this is for revenues as well as margins. And then just get a little additional color on the growth, or just how that region grows revenues and margins next year given that North Sea revenues are likely down and it would be challenge just to keep Russian revenues flat. Mark McCollum : The answer is it does relate to both, yes revenues and margins. I mean typically you might see margins climb up a bit on the back of some level of direct sales, completion tool sales, things like that. But I think this quarter given where we are seeing some of the softness particularly the Norwegian sector, the North Sea in Q4 we are expecting it to be more flat to Q3 on both the revenue and the margin side. Doug Becker - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : And for next year? Mark McCollum : It\u2019s a little early to know for next year where it\u2019s going to go. I mean obviously everything that we are trying to do across the board is to improve margins by cutting cost and things like that. As we look forward to next year, I think we do see some continued softness in the Norwegian sector and the North Sea. Russia as I said on the call will likely be, hopefully we are working to be flat year-over-year on an overall basis and we\u2019ll have Libya\u2019s down for the count right now, so it\u2019s difficult to forecast when that will be. But when you look at other markets across Europe, Africa and CIS, you know the Caspian continues to do very well. When you look at sub-Saharan Africa itself, we had a very good year, we expect that will continue to grow on the back of mature field projects there. And Continental Europe for us is doing exceedingly well right now and we expect that that will go up as well. So as we go in to the year, while a still little bit early in the planning cycle, I would say we are still expecting it to be up and with that we are continuing to leverage incremental margins that are higher than current margins and so we are expecting margins to continue to decline in that area as well, even though it might be able, but less in the Middle East/Asia. Operator : And our final question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs : Mark you\u2019ve promised this 500 basis points kind of margin improvement through the course of the years from internal [miles] Frac of the Future and HALvantage. How much of that has already been realized and what is left for the coming years. Mark McCollum : I would tell you that our goal was to get a 200 basis point improvement in 2014. As of the day we have accomplished that objective. We had hoped that it would be for the entire year Q3, we didn\u2019t quite get there, but we were very close. If it hadn\u2019t been for some of logistics challenges that we had in the month of July, we would have indeed had hit that target. So as we look forward, we are comfortable with where we are at, but I can tell you that really on the face of Battle Red we still got a long way to go. All of our systems are in place, we\u2019ve been working out a lot of the kinks in that process, but a lot of the upsights from that project are still in front of us. On the Frac to the Future side we are only still quarter deployed. We got a long way to go in terms of achieving that. So we are going to continue to work a very, very focused and determine lead to make sure that we capture all that upsight. So as we sit today, we feel very good about our progression and let us know from our standpoint no retreat from our objective of getting 500 basis points over the next couple of years. Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs : And them I may have missed that before, but could you quantify the impact of Gulf of Mexico on the D&E margins and revenues for the quarter. Mark McCollum : I don\u2019t know if we could quantify it overall for D&E, but I\u2019d say that the Gulf of Mexico, the loop current issue probably caused us about a penny in the quarter. Operator : At this time I would like to turn the call back to management for any closing comments. Jeff Miller : So thanks Sam. I want to thank everybody for your participation today and Sam you can go ahead and close the call. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude today\u2019s program, you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Kelly Youngblood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kelly Youngblood : Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton fourth quarter 2014 conference call. Today\u2019s call is being webcast and a replay would be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Christian Garcia, Acting CFO; and Jeff Miller, President. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risk and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton\u2019s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2014, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today include non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our fourth quarter press release which can be found on our website. Unless otherwise noted, in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of restructuring charges and Baker Hughes\u2019 acquisition related cost taken in the fourth quarter of 2014. In our prepared remarks today Dave will provide a brief update on our progress related to the pending Baker Hughes acquisition. However, the purpose of the call today is to review our quarterly financial and operational results and our outlook for 2015. We ask that you please keep your questions focused on those matters.  Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave. Dave. Dave Lesar : Thank you, Kelly and good morning everyone. While the market is certainly tougher out there today, and I will discuss that in a minute, I do want to begin with a few of our key accomplishments in 2014. First, I'm very proud to say that we delivered industry leading total company revenue growth and returns in 2014. We finished the year with revenues of nearly $33 billion and operating income of $5 billion. Both of which are new records for the company. Leading the improvement was North America with revenue growth of 16% and profit growth of 23%, followed by the Eastern Hemisphere with revenue and profit growth of 10% and 12% respectively.  This was also a record year for both of our divisions, where 12 of our 13 product lines set new all-time highs. From an operating income perspective, we achieved new full year records in our Completion Tools, Multi-Chem, Drill Bits and Baroid product lines. I highlight this performance because you want to head into any industry downturn starting from an extremely strong financial and operating platform and that\u2019s certainly is where we are performing today. And finally during the fourth quarter we announced the definitive agreement to acquire Baker Hughes. We believe this combination will create a bellwether oilfield services company, a stronger more diverse organization with an unsurpassed depth and breadth of services.  We are excited about this transaction and the benefits it will provide the shareholders, customers and other stakeholders of both companies. Similarly, employees at all levels in both organizations are excited about creating a new industry leader and the opportunities they have is part of a larger company.  We've also heard from many of our customers who have expressed enthusiasm about the combination, those who see the broader, cost effective offerings that we will be able to provide. And especially those who are looking for a compelling alternative to their current incumbent in parts of the world or individually ourselves and Baker have only a small footprint. We are continuing to highlight for our customers the benefits that this combination will deliver to them. We have formed an integration team lead by Mark McCollum which includes representatives both companies. Mark and his team have already hit the ground running to develop a day one strategy and an ongoing integration plan which we believe will deliver the nearly $2 billion in annual cost synergies we discussed in our previous announcement. Now, I'm not na\u00efve how hard it is to put two companies together. It\u2019s damn hard. But you know Mark and you know his excellent track record on delivering on the commitments that he makes to you. And I'm confident that we will achieve our integration goals with him in the lead. On the regulatory front we filed the initial Form S-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are proceeding expediently with all the antitrust filings. We continue to expect that we will complete the transaction in the second half of 2015. We look forward to realizing these strategic and financial benefits inherent in this combination to create greater value for our combined shareholders. I want to clear that we remain committed to seeing this deal through despite the current macro headwinds facing the industry. In fact, as we continue to analyze the potential value creation opportunities of the combination, we believe the transaction is even more compelling today than we when we announced it. I would also like to congratulate the Baker Hughes employees for delivering on an outstanding quarter with record financial results. This is clear evidence to me of the capabilities of this organization and their continued focus on supporting their customers during this period of transition. So all in all 2014 was a historic year for Halliburton as we stayed focused on our returns, executing on our key strategies around unconventionals, deepwater and mature fields. Our strategies have worked, are working and we intend to stay the course.  Now, let me discuss what we are seeing in the market today and our prospects and challenges for the coming year. Later Christian will cover our fourth quarter results. Obviously, commodity pricing has dropped dramatically over the last several months with oil prices now at levels not seen since early 2009. The North America rig count and activity levels held up with most of the fourth quarter as customers executed against the reminder of their 2014 budgets. However, over the last 60 days the U.S. land rig count has fallen by 250 rigs or close to 15%. Capital expenditure budgets from our customers remain fluid, but so far an average have been reduced 25% to 30% as they adjust their spending to operate within their cash flows in response to a continued drop in commodity prices. As a result, we expect activity declines for North America land to accelerate further in the first quarter, impacting all of the key liquids basins. What is creating even more uncertainty with the service industry is that many customers have continue to revise down their capital budgets to further capital reduction announcements. This makes is difficult to size your business in today's U.S. market, in particular, because it is such a fast moving target. So while we did not experienced price weakness during the fourth quarter, price discount discussions with customers did begin in the fourth quarter and have accelerated over the last past several weeks and price reductions are now occurring across all product lines.  Now, we expect pricing concessions to be less severe when compared to previous cycles and therefore I believe our decremental margins should be lower. That is because our margin improvement this cycle was largely driven by our focus on gaining efficiencies and getting increased labor input cost recovered more quickly, not through net pricing increases.  This up cycle did not last long enough for us to see the kinds of net pricing that would have enabled margins to recover to historically strong levels. Therefore, less pricing erosion will be needed to eventually reduce service capacity if market weakness persists.  Based on our experience in previous downturns, we expect that it will take a couple of quarters to see how the interplay of pricing declines, volume reductions and equipment efficiency deterioration plays out relative to our ability to lower labor and input cost and to right size the organization, and therefore reach an equilibrium in the market. The first quarter of any severe downturn is almost always the most challenging quarter to predict, because pricing concessions usually impact our results in real time. Volume declines can be erratic as customer\u2019s rig plans are uncertain and can change daily. Then there is typically a delay in realizing input cost savings from our suppliers. There is two reasons for this. One, discussions with vendors are dependent on them truly believing we have a reduction in ongoing activity levels, before we can have the kinds of tough renegotiations that results in significant input cost reductions. Second, there is a timing issue as to the expenses that flow through inventory like sand, propane, chemicals and cement. It takes a while to see lower input pricing fully reflected in your average inventory cost, because you have to work off your higher priced inventory.  Next, headcount adjustments don't follow directly from pricing concession as you still need the crews to do the work. Headcount adjustments do, however, follow volume reductions. Therefore there is a lag in getting labor costs out as activity declines. And finally, the impact of a large rig count reduction on 24-hour operations and its inherent efficiency is hard to predict as customers slow down activity in many different ways. But eventually these moving parts all settle out and we reach some sort of equilibrium. In this environment, we would expect to see most of our margin degradation occurring over the first couple of quarters and more margin stability in the back half of the year. Now, in this very uncertain averment, we believe Halliburton's more efficient crews and differentiated technologies are best suited to outperform. Additionally, being aligned with the right customers, those with assets in the sweet spot of the reservoir, becomes more important as we expect to see those customers continue to work through the cycle. But we have to be real about it. The North America market is going to see volatility and pain for a few quarters. However, in this scenario I like our chances. Now, moving to international, we started to see the impact of lower commodity prices during the fourth quarter. Declining oil prices have caused our customers to reduce their budgets and defer several of their new projects, particularly around offshore exploration. In 2015, we anticipate headwinds across all of our international regions. Middle East/Asia will likely be the most resilient followed by Latin America. And finally, Europe, Africa, CIS is expected to see the sharpest decline. Let me talk about each individually. Middle East/Asia is expected to be the best performing region for the company in 2015 as recent project awards in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the UAE, and Kuwait are all anticipated to move forward. However, we expect Malaysia and Australia and other markets across the region to be impacted by reduced customer spending and delayed projects. In Latin America, we currently expect to see unconventional activity levels in Argentina continue to grow, along with the startup of our new integrated asset management project in Ecuador. However, we believe lower activity levels in Mexico and Colombia will more than offset the higher growth in these markets. Europe, Africa/CIS is expected to experience significant activity declines across the entire region with the most vulnerable areas being the North Sea, Russia, and Angola. In addition, Russia and Norway also are experiencing significant currency weakness. So when you net out the international regions, we expect to see year-on-year decline. But we believe we will outperform spending predictions indicated in the third-party surveys that are out there today. Later Jeff will discuss some of the specific actions we're taking to adjust our cost structure to the market conditions. I can tell you that we will do what we have to do, we know what buttons to push and levers to pull and we will do so. I will say that, similar to previous cycles, we will protect our market share and expect to see customers focused on our highly efficient service model. As our customers struggle with cash flows, they will be very focused on optimization and gaining higher levels of efficiency and I expect that this will bode very well for Halliburton. Our management team has been through previous downturns and we intend to emerge from this cycle a much stronger company on a relative basis. During the fourth quarter we took a $129 million restructuring charge as a first step in preparing for these market changes. And as Jeff will cover in a few minutes, there is likely to be more in the first quarter. Now for competitive purposes, we're not going to lay out our detailed strategy for addressing this business environment. However, in the short-term, we're putting initiatives in place not only to temper the impact of the activity decline on our financial performance, but also to ensure that we're in an optimal position to take advantage of the market's eventual recovery. The length of any downturn is very difficult to predict, but as you know, we are in a great financial position right now with strong free cash flow. We will make adjustments as activity declines and our intention is to look beyond the cycle and continue to execute our strategic initiatives. I believe that this is the right thing to do for the health of our business over a complete business cycle. As I stated, we've been through these cycles before and we know what to do and we will execute on that experience. The bottom line, we have historically outperformed the market in North America during downturns and we have no reason to believe that this downturn will be any different. Now, let me turn it over to Christian to provide more details on our financial performance. Christian? Christian Garcia : Thanks Dave, and good morning everyone. It has been a while but I'm glad to be back on the call and looking forward to be working with all of you again. Let me begin with an overview of our fourth quarter results and later on let me discuss our financial outlook. Total company revenue of $8.8 billion was a record quarter for Halliburton with operating income of $1.4 billion. We achieved record quarterly revenues in both of our divisions and our Middle East/Asia region set a new record for both revenue and operating income. From a product line perspective we had record revenues in the fourth quarter in Production Enhancement, Completion Tools, Drill Bits, Artificial Lift and Consulting and Project Management while new operating income records were set by Multi-Chem, Drill Bits and Landmark. North America revenue was flat sequentially in-line with the average quarterly rig count. Operating income was modestly higher over the same period despite the impact of seasonal fourth quarter, weather and holiday downtime. Fourth quarter margins benefited from the continued roll out of our Battle Red and Frac of the Future initiatives, as well as efficiencies we're seeing from recent enhancements to our logistics network. Service pricing was stable during the fourth quarter as activity levels remained robust, but are expected to deteriorate in the coming quarters. In the Eastern Hemisphere we experienced a modest level of sequential revenue growth which resulted in a new quarterly record despite the headwinds experienced in our Europe, Africa/CIS region. Operating income came in flat compared to the third quarter. In the Middle East/Asia region revenue increased by 10% compared to the third quarter and operating income was up 29% over the same period. Our fourth quarter margins came in just under 21% as a result of seasonal year-end software and equipment sales as well as higher integrated project-related activity in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, India and Indonesia. Switching to Europe, Africa/CIS, fourth-quarter revenue and operating income declined 8% and 35% respectively compared to the prior quarter as we experienced significant reduction in activity levels in the North Sea, Russia and Angola. Declining oil prices and project economics caused our customers to reduce activity levels in the first several of their new projects. Russia and Norway results were also significantly affected by currency weakness. In Latin America revenue increased 3% sequentially while operating income declined 4% compared to the previous quarter. The revenue increase was a result of year-end software sales, increased Artificial Lift activity in Venezuela and higher activity levels across the majority of our product lines in Colombia. Operating income was negatively impacted during the quarter from mobilization costs in Brazil and budget constraints in Mexico. Now I will address some additional financial items. As a result of the market decline that has primarily impacted our international business. We incurred $129 million of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter consisting of severance-related costs as well as asset write-offs. The majority of these adjustments related to our Eastern Hemisphere business. Our corporate and other expense totaled $83 million for the quarter excluding $17 million in costs related to the Baker Hughes acquisition. We anticipate that our corporate expenses for the first quarter will be approximately $90 million excluding acquisition-related costs and this will be the new run rate for 2015. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 27% which was lower than expected as a result of Congress approving the Federal Research and Experimentation tax credit in late December. As we go forward in 2015 we are expecting the first quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 28% to 29%. Currently, we anticipate that our capital expenditures for 2015 will be essentially in-line with 2014 and expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $2.4 billion for the year. I know this may surprise some of you, but let me lay out our approach. As Dave mentioned, our objective is to look beyond the cycle and continue to invest in certain strategic technology such as the Frac of the Future, while retiring older, more costly equipment. As we have previously discussed, our Q-10 pumps support our surface efficiency strategy that will enable us to lower operators' costs while at the same time protect our margins against deteriorating industry conditions. As you know, we manufacture our own equipment which gives us the utmost flexibility in this market and can adjust our spend accordingly based on our visibility. Turning to our operational outlook, the severity of the activity decline in the coming quarters continues to be unclear, preventing us from providing specific guidance. But let me give you some thoughts around the first quarter of 2015. For the first quarter of 2015, our results will be subject to the same type of seasonality that you've seen in previous years. Landmark, completions and direct sales activities typically fall-off in the first quarter as those businesses benefit historically from customers' year-end budgets. Our business will also be impacted by weather-related seasonality that occurs in the Rockies, North Sea and Russia. In the first quarter of 2014 this seasonality impacted our results by approximately 22%. However, this year we believe the decline will be exacerbated by the macro headwinds currently faced by the industry. In North America, the U.S. rig count is already down 9% from the fourth quarter average and the rate of decline has accelerated in the last two weeks. We expect to see activity levels continue to drop throughout the first quarter accompanied by price reductions. As Dave mentioned, the beginning of a down cycle is typically the most challenging, but we believe that our sequential decrementals in the first quarter will be less severe than what we have previously experienced in the prior downturn. We finished 2014 in a solid financial position. We continue to have the best returns in our peer group. We reduced working capital by seven days since our Analyst Day and gave back 33% of our cash flow from operations for our shareholders in 2014. In 2015 we will continue to focus on working capital and returns and we will live within our cash flows. We will also continue to adjust our cost structure and currently anticipate that we will be incurring restructuring charges for severance and other actions that we are contemplating in the first quarter. Now I will turn the call over to Jeff for an update on our strategy. Jeff? Jeff Miller : Thank you, Christian, and good morning, everyone. Today I would like to begin my comments by discussing the current market environment and what we plan to do. Although oil demand growth expectations for 2015 have weakened it is still growth. Demand is forecast to increase by an estimated 900,000 barrels per day. Keep in mind the steep decline curves are still at work. We estimate the average annual production decline rates for unconventionals in North America are in excess of 30% and much higher in some areas. Depending on the ultimate trajectory of the rig count declines and the backlog of well completions, we believe that North America crude production could begin to respond during the back half of the year. Internationally, decline rates have become more pronounced in several key markets over the last couple of years. In areas like Angola, Norway and Russia historical growth has given way to net production declines in the last year. While decline rates in markets like Mexico and India have actually accelerated. Consequently, we believe that any sustained period of under investment due to reduced operator spending could lead to an increase in commodity prices. And this largely ignores the possibility of short-term disruptions due to geopolitical issues. So, the long-term fundamentals of our business are still strong. But it is clear we are heading into an activity downturn. We can look at previous cycles for insight and while history doesn't always repeat, sometimes it rhymes. In North America, we're looking at the rig count decline relative to past downturns. After a plateau through much of the fourth quarter, the rig count has dropped sharply over the last two months and is already down 15% from early December. This trajectory is similar to both the 2001-2002 cycle and the 2008-2009 cycle. And in those cases, we experienced a rapid correction to the rig count going from peak to trough over a three quarter period. Over the past several years, we've taken key steps to reduce our underlying cost profile. Steps such as deploying Frac of the Future equipment, streamlining our field operations through Battle Red, and vertically integrating portions of our logistics network. For these reasons, we're confident that we are better prepared than our competitors to execute through this coming cycle. In the international markets, our projects and contracts tend to be longer term in nature than in North America. Historically, this has resulted in reduced year-on-year volatility. However, nearly all of our customers are currently reassessing their priorities and looking for efficiency and even more so in the offshore space. It's important to note that this group has been quick to react to decline in commodity prices with the first moves being made in mid-2014 at sub $100 oil. Although projects already underway are continuing to move forward, generally speaking we're seeing significant reductions in new work being tendered and projects that can be delayed are moving to the right. As we evaluate service intensity for our international markets, we keep a close eye on revenue per rig, which helps us understand the overall health of the business. Although this metric took a step backwards during the 2009 economic downturn, we've seen consistent improvement over the last four years. In fact, we're in a better position now than going into the last cycle. Our 2014 revenue per rig is more than 20% higher than in 2008. For Halliburton, this expansion represents not only the value of technical content in complex wells, but also our ability to expand our footprint in underserved geographies, as well as in underutilized product lines. We believe this demonstrates the success of our growth strategies, deepwater, mature fields and unconventionals, and positions us to outperform through the next cycle. As Christian said, the midterm outlook is unclear. But whether this cycle ends in a sharp V or takes time to recover, our strategy will be consistent. First things first, we'll control the things we control. We've already taken initial steps to address headcount internationally. And as activity in North America begins to fall more sharply, we will make similar adjustments here as well. Between actions already taken in the fourth quarter and actions we anticipate taking by the end of the first quarter, we expect our headcount adjustments to be in line with our primary competitors. We intend to minimize discretionary spending in our operations. As operators have requested price discussions with us, we've opened dialogues with our suppliers around both volume pricing and anticipate reducing our input cost profile. We'll continue to manufacture our Frac of the Future equipment and plan to take advantage of the opportunity to accelerate the retirement of older fleets which operate at a higher cost, especially in 24-hour operations. The value we have seen from the rollout of our Q-10 pumps has truly exceeded our original expectations. And despite the current market conditions, we feel it's the right decision for our shareholders to move forward with this initiative. Frac of the Future not only gets the job done with 25% less capital and offers maintenance savings of up to 50%, an optimized Frac of the Future spread running under the right efficiency model can complete a well more than 50% faster than legacy equipment. And it does all of this with 35% fewer people on location. Frac of the Future represents about 30% of our North American fleet today, and we expect that number to be closer to 50% by year end. Second, service quality really matters, and even more so in this environment. And our ability to execute more efficiently lowers non-productive times for our customers and reduces their effective cost per barrel. Due to the nature of the work that we do today, large complex shale wells in North America, increasingly technical offshore work and a growing base of integrated projects on the international stage, we believe that our superior execution and best-in-class technical solutions will allow us to maintain utilization and outperform our peers. As the management team, this isn't our first downturn. We're talking to our customers every day, and it's safe to say that budget expectations are a moving target. Accordingly, we've given ourselves flexibility inside of our capital budget to right size quickly to whatever the market gives us. I'm very pleased with our management team and the strategies we have in place, and believe that we're well positioned to outperform in the downturn and to ensure that we take advantage of the recovery up cycle and come out a much stronger company. Now, let me turn the call back over to Dave for his closing comments. Dave? Dave Lesar : Thanks, Jeff. Industry prospects will continue to be weak and the coming quarters and the ultimate depth and length of this cycle remains uncertain. However, we are confident that our management team is prepared to meet the challenges that are forthcoming and we will take the opportunity to strengthen the long-term health of our franchise. We will selectively cut costs and at the same time, continue to invest where we can improve our competitive position. Whatever scenario you think may happen we have the people, technology and experience to outperform the market. We have demonstrated this to you for the past several years. Whatever the level of industry activity, we expect to get more than our share of it. Now, before I open it up to questions I want to let you know that due to other business commitments I will not be participating in our first quarter conference call. Jeff will be providing market comments on my behalf and I will return for our second quarter call. Now let's open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is open. J. David Anderson : Thanks. Good morning Dave. Dave Lesar : Good morning. Good morning Dave. J. David Anderson : So, Dave, first off, you must be very happy to see the strong numbers posted by Baker this morning. Hopefully, they can keep it up as you close this deal by the end of the year. But as we all kind of stare out at the unknowns of the next couple quarters, I would love to hear your perspective what you've seen so far from your customers in North America. We're getting a sense this is happening a lot faster than we have seen in past downturns. Perhaps it is because E&P's are struggling with where the oil prices will settle out. I just want to know if you agree with that assessment, and perhaps you could give us some insight into their thinking and how that is shaping your view on how this market responds over the next couple quarters. Dave Lesar : Yeah, let me let Jeff take a shot at it and then I'll comment as necessary. Jeff Miller : Yeah, thanks, Dave. I mean the -- we're talking to our customers every day. And of course initially the discussions have been around reductions in the 25% to 30% range. However, as commodities continue to move, they are all revisiting their budgets. I mean, arguably for the next couple of quarters this will be -- North America will look a bit like a chocolate mess in terms of where it winds up. But the -- most customers are living within their cash flows and similarly, that's what we are going to do. But we're confident that we're positioned in the right places and in the fairways of the right plays to where we will be very effective as we work through this with them. Dave Lesar : Yeah, Dave, let me just add a little bit to that. I think the -- your question about the speed of the pullback by our customers is a bit unusual and I think, first of all, they're worried about their cash flow because of lower commodity prices. And I also think they are worried about where their next dollar might come from if they start living outside of their cash flows. So, in my view, it sort of exacerbates the speed by which this is happening. But I also think it accelerate the time where they sort of know what they can spend this year, they know how they are going to spend it, they know who they are going to spend it with. And we can get to that equilibrium point that I referenced in my remarks. David Anderson : So, now, Dave a key part of your strategy over the last several years has been aligning with the strongest customers. You clearly did that in the natural gas downturn and this is -- the same strategy here with oil. These are the customers that have the best economics in their acreage. I was wondering if you could talk about some of the steps that you think these stronger guys are taking. Are you seeing kind of high grading of drilling yet? Is it CapEx shifting amongst certain product lines? Are you starting to see them use their scale to get more pricing concessions through the supply chain? Can you just help me understand how maybe -- your customer base is clearly differentiated, how are they responding differently or are they yet? Dave Lesar : Yeah, I think -- good question. In terms of what they are doing and we are -- let me just confirm, we are aligned with what we call the fairway players, particularly in North America. And our view of a fairway player is one who is in a strong financial position and has a low leasehold cost or are in the sweet spots of these various reservoirs. So, the discussions with them today are, okay, let's high grade back to the places where we can produce the lowest cost per BOE even in this pricing environment. Let's have to remain service company and operator, very flexible in how we're approaching this market in terms of where we're going to put rigs up, how many rigs we're going to have there. We went to partner with you in terms of the service capabilities you have. But be essentially aware that we're still in a commodity driven world and we may have to be flexible and change. We can do that. We've got a good management team, we've got a good footprint, we've got good technology and it's not a fun environment to be in, but it's one we can easily handle. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Jud Bailey : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to -- you talked about how quickly your customers are moving much more quickly than in prior cycles. Could you maybe talk a little about how that's impacting your discussions -- and you talked about it a little bit -- but how it's impacting your discussions with your vendors? And maybe how quickly you think you could get price concessions? And do you think you can get price reductions on the supply chain side in-line with what you are giving to your customers? Jeff Miller : Yeah, thank you, Jud. Those discussions have already begun, but I think as Dave referenced in his early remarks, there is a bit of a disconnect in the timing of seeing price concessions with customers and working that both through the vendor community and also through our inventory. I think that is one of the reasons I say we look out a quarter or two. That said, we've got a terrific procurement organization and we have -- we're already in discussion with a number of vendors and we continue to see this progress. Again, these are steps that we have taken before and it's really a matter of connecting sort of what's happening in the marketplace to the vendor community, but I think that happens initially quite quickly. Jud Bailey : Okay. And then just to kind of switch gears and look internationally. And Christian commented a little bit on this, but it want to make sure I am thinking about it correctly when I think about Europe, Africa/CIS and the types of revenue declines you experienced in the fourth quarter. You take away some of the seasonality and your typical year-end product sales. Can you help us think about that market in terms of revenue progression in the first quarter or second quarter? And what are the moving parts on what's going to be the biggest weakness in that market? Christian Garcia : Jud let me approach it internationally in total. As I mentioned, we're not going to provide specific guidance, but kind of give you some help here. If you look at seasonal decline that we see in our international markets, it usually declines -- typically declines about 10% -- 9% to 10% for Q1. Clearly, there's going to be macro headwinds that would push that at a higher decline rate. If that is the case, then we will basically see a steeper decline in the operating income. As an example, last year we saw a 300 basis points decline from Q4 to Q1 for our international markets and we expect to see a little bit higher than that this time around. Now, I'm not going to provide guidance in any of the sort of regions, but you're absolutely right, Europe, Africa/CIS will probably have a higher decline than Middle East or Latin America. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company. Your line is open. Bill Herbert : Thanks. Good morning. Dave and Jeff and Christian, so I think it's plausible that given the rationale that you laid out that your decremental margins are going to be less severe than they were in 2009. I'm just curious if we can bracket sort of a plausible targeted range. I mean you did close to 60% decrementals in 2009, I'm just curious as to what you guys envision as a reasonable target as we come into 2015 with regard to decrementals in North America. I mean should they start with a four just to throw that out there? Christian Garcia : Right. So, Bill, to answer you, we don\u2019t know, because the \u2013 the reason is we don\u2019t know the depth the length of the cycle. Okay. So what we can tell you is in Q1 if you look at 2008, 2009, the rig count drop in Q1 of 2009 was about 30%, our revenue decline was 25% of that line. Bill Herbert : Right. Christian Garcia : We had the 1,000 basis points decline in Q1. We just don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen in Q1 at least given the visibility that we have currently. So that\u2019s the only visibility we have. We are going to do it quarter by quarter and we will update our guidance as we go along throughout the year. Bill Herbert : Okay, and then secondly more of a conceptual question for Dave. Dave, if you could put your oilfield history and cap on and compare and contrast if you will what you expect to be this downturn in terms of duration versus what we've seen kind of in 2088, 2009, the late 90s and the mid-80s. It sounds like from a duration aspect, although you guys have taken pains to say you don\u2019t know whether this is U-shaped or V-shaped. Our capital spending budget would seem to indicate that you don\u2019t necessarily view this as a protracted multiyear adjustment. Dave Lesar : No. I think, Bill, that\u2019s right. I mean, if you look at the 2008-2009 that was really a gas driven rig count decline. What we are seeing today is more of an oil based decline. If you go back into the late 80s and 90s, those actually were probably more oil driven declines at that point in time. And so I don\u2019t have a crystal ball that will allow me to absolutely predict it. I know on my experience that you have to invent through these things. You want to keep your business franchise strong. And as Christian indicated, we are looking at basically a flat capital budget for next year. But the reality is that a lot of that is going into building out our Q-10 pump system, because, frankly, you guys can shoot me if I didn\u2019t continue to invest in that technology. It\u2019s a great technology. It\u2019s a differentiated technology. It saves not only customer\u2019s money but it saves us operating cost. So we would be crazy not to push through with the deployment of that and retire the older assets. The reality is that if we did -- we had pulled back there our capital expenses for next year likely would be going down. But generally, my experience has been stay flexible, stay nimble, stay strong financially and I think that when we come out of this thing, especially when we execute the transaction with Baker, we\u2019re going to be a heck of a company and I'm really looking forward to that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. James West : Hey, good morning guys. Dave Lesar : Good morning, James. James West : Hey, Dave or Jeff, on international side, obviously, you\u2019re going to have conversations. You are having conversations about pricing. But my sense is this cycle we never saw that big inflection point for international pricing, it was more of a market share game. So do you actually have that much pricing not to give up or am I misreading this because lot of the CapEx costs are coming offshore where pricing is better? Jeff Miller : Thanks James. This is Jeff. No, you are reading that correctly. I mean, we really never saw net pricing throughout the last cycle internationally. In fact, as you describe most of the margin gains were volume driven and really cost absorption over that period of time. That said, we are working with our customers around efficiency approaches, how can we lower total cost of operations for them and this really gets back to our basic strategy which is around reducing uncertainty and increasing reliability in operations. And we've made terrific gains in non-productive time over the last couple of years and that\u2019s a differentiator for us. James West : Is there an urgency on the part of our customer base? Are they expressing urgency for you to go ahead and get the Baker deal closed so you could provide even better efficiencies? Dave Lesar : Yeah, I think James as Kelly said at the beginning, we really don\u2019t want to and can't answer any questions related to Baker other than what we had in our prepared remarks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita with UBS. Your line is open. Angie Sedita : Great. Thanks. Good morning guys. Christian, could you -- I mean you gave us the color on Q1 on international markets, as you looked at it seasonally Q4 over Q1 on a normal year. Can you do the same for us on North America? Christian Garcia : Yeah, so North America, as I mentioned, rig count is already down 9% so far. I don\u2019t know may reach the decline in the mid-teens for the whole quarter. Well, assuming that projection as correct, we would expect a revenue decline to probably slightly less than this -- than that percentage based on our past experience.  And as I mentioned, the decrementals in 2008-2009, we don\u2019t think we are going to do better than that. Angie Sedita : Okay. Okay, fair enough. And Dave or Mark, can you talk about the steps you are taking both internationally and in North America to protect your market share given that your largest fear has been quite vocal on your proposed merger and the opportunities that they see. Jeff Miller : Yeah, let me answer that one Angie. I have heard the word distraction, I have heard other comments about what's going to happen. You got to remember we've been asbestos, we've been through asbestos, we've been through Macondo, we've been through the Iraq war and none of those distracted us from making sure our business franchise remains strong. We've been through ups and downs, that didn\u2019t distract us.  So, I guess, my view is, you know us. We are the execution company. We are not going to get distracted through this. This is a tough market, but we've been through these kinds of things before. I've got a really strong management team. We are going to focus on maintaining our market share. We\u2019re going to focus on improving our business franchise and clearly we\u2019re not going to get distracted. I'm not going to permit it to happen. So I guess that would be my sort of editorial comment on it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Market. Your line is open. Kurt Hallead : Hey, good morning. Thanks for all that color. I just wanted to dive in a little bit deeper into Brazil, for example, given lot of challenges that are going down there with corruption scandal. I know you guys have a contract shift taking place down in Brazil. I want to get a sense as to -- you mentioned Mexico, what's your outlook for Brazil as you go into 2015? Jeff Miller : Yes. Thanks Kurt. The outlook is, we will do those things that we've described. We expect to drilling contracts signed in first quarter. We should have our wireline contract sort of reupped in Q1 and our testing contract mobilized into Q1. The broadly outlook, however, is we still that market declining to a certain degree in terms of activity and beyond that really don\u2019t want to give any guidance expect to say that we've described some of those markets as looking a little bit stronger and certainly Brazil and Mexico are likely to be headwinds. Kurt Hallead : Right. And then beyond the next follow-up, say, beyond the Rouble depreciation dynamic in Russia, what kind of activity changes have you seen there? Jeff Miller : Yeah, in Russia, I mean, obviously we still got a couple of things going on. First, the sanctions are in place and so that\u2019s having an impact on our business, you mentioned currency. And then around mature field activity there may be some improvement there. But overall, the issues around sanctions and what not, I think, are a bit of a drag on the business overall. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Tillery with Tudor Pickering. Your line is open. Jeff Tillery : Hey, good morning. Could you give us some color as you see on the domestic completion activity there has been increasing anecdotes around wells being drilled but not completed. Could you just talk about is that having \u2013 is that noticeable yet and how do you see that playing out over the coming quarters. Jeff Miller : We've worked through year we saw tightening in capacity, things that I described. So there is some amount of that out there. But I would really take a broadly view to say that our customers are managing within cash flow, and so I think that behavior may be different for different customers. But broadly there will be a drawback to the best parts of the plays focused on efficiency and really those strategies that we talk about that we've built our franchise around, which is lowest cost per BOE, custom chemistry and delivering sub service insight. So I think those things are at play. But I don\u2019t necessarily see a large inventory building of uncompleted wells. Dave Lesar : Yeah, I think -- this is Dave. I mean, you've just got to think through -- put yourself in the operator\u2019s mind, especially one who is concerned about cash flow. It would be crazy to drill a well and then put it in inventory because you've got cash flow out, but not cash flow coming in.  So I think the decision is very quickly going to go to, do your drill well? If you drill a well you\u2019re going to complete it. If you\u2019re not going to complete that there is no sense in drilling it, and that\u2019s the dialog that\u2019s going on now. Jeff Tillery : My second question is unrelated. You talked a lot about -- there is lot of questions around North American supply chain, Europe, Africa, CIS, you've talked about that being likely the worst region in 2015. Could you just talk about cost structure and flexibility in that region and things you\u2019re doing to address that? Christian Garcia : Yeah, thanks. So we've taken some steps early in Q4 around headcount, so we are reacting quickly to what we see there. As we described the timing around supplier cost reductions and getting those in place don\u2019t sync up perfectly. But for the visibility that we have we are taking actions to address that. Operator : Our next question comes from line of James Wicklund with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. James Wicklund : Good morning, guys. You guys always gain market share in the down market and you've done a fabulous job this morning explaining why. But I just kind of have an industry question. I remember when I was running an operation in Africa, granted it was long time ago. And I have to cut everybody by 15% and I didn\u2019t really care what their margins were, they just had to cut their prices to me by 15%. Their margins or costs where their problem. Has that changed?  Jeff, you alluded to the fact that since we -- some of these companies don\u2019t have the margin to give up that pricing won't go down this much? Jeff Miller : Jim, I'm glad you are not my customer anymore. I think the reality is that you -- a customer may take that approach, say, we want to cut our cost by 15%. But in today's world and really today's shale world in the U.S. and let\u2019s say the offshore market in Africa, differentiated technologies still make a difference. And having that technology, having the efficiency, having the people on the ground ends being sort of what you sell to that customer. Customers also know that in reality -- in reality they know who they want to use for particular products and services in various parts of the world and generally they move to make sure that when they go through a cost reduction after like this that they keep the strong players strong. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Waqar Syed with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Waqar Syed : Thank you very much. Dave, my question relates to service intensity in the U.S. shale. You were seeing strong service intensity increase throughout last year, do you expect that trend to continue? Do you expect people to have more frac stages and then use more sand per frac stage? Or do you see that abetting with where the sand price -- sand costs are right now? Dave Lesar : Yeah. Thanks Waqar. The behavior around the wells, we expect to continue. I mean, what we've seen is consistently improving productivity based on the things we talk about all the time, so custom chemistry, the application of your technology like AccessFrac and rock firm and then also sand volume. So, while overall activity likely falls off, the activity that\u2019s executed is going to be executed with absolutely the best technology and well bore design and frac design to deliver the lowest cost per BOE. So I expect that continues. Waqar Syed : And so previous you were seeing about 15% per quarter kind of change in sand volumes used per well, if I may say. How do you see that trending going forward? Jeff Miller : Well, we actually in Q4 a year-on-year increase of about 46% sand on a per well basis, so that was up sequentially another 5% or 6%, again, on a per well basis. So, I expect that at some point better design, better frac design will moderate the volume of sand, it\u2019s not internment. But nevertheless, I would expect the demand -- not the demand, but on a per stage basis volumes to remain high. Dave Lesar : Yeah, and let me just make sort of one last comment on sort of increasing volumes is that, more and more of our customers are now looking at what is the impact of these large volumes jobs on offset wells. And this concept of well bashing is what's it\u2019s called where basically pumping enormous volumes into one well bore is it bashing adjacent well bores and actually declining or decreasing the volumes you are getting out of it in total. So, I think as the volumes continue to increase, customers and the service industry, Halliburton, in particular, are starting to look at sort of the signs of what's happening down hole two to make sure that what you are running up with is an optimal outcome and not just accelerating greatly production from one well, but impacting that in adjacent wells. Operator : That does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Jeff Miller : Yeah. Thank you, Kay [ph]. So I would like to wrap the call up with just a couple of comments. And as we've said there is a tremendous amount of uncertainty in the market, but we've seen this before. And we always take basically a two-pronged approach, which is first, we control what we control and defend our margins within our cash flows. And the second is that we look through the cycle and as in the past emerge a stronger company in the recovery. Thank you and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Kay [ph], you can take from there. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude today\u2019s program, you may all disconnect. Everyone have a good day.",

David Anderson - Barclays Capital Jim Crandell - Cowen Securities Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley Dan Boyd - BMO Capital Markets Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Halliburton First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Kelly Youngblood, Halliburton Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir you may begin. Kelly Youngblood : Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton first quarter 2015 conference call. Today\u2019s call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, President; Christian Garcia, Acting CFO; and Mark McCollum, Chief Integration Officer. As mentioned on our last call, due to a longstanding business commitment, Dave Lesar, Halliburton's Chairman and CEO will not be present today but will return for our second quarter call. Today Jeff will be providing market commentary, followed by Christian who will discuss our quarterly financial results and finally, Mark will provide an update on our progress relating to the pending Baker Hughes acquisition.  Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton\u2019s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today include non-GAAP financial measures. Unless otherwise noted, in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of these items. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our first quarter press release which can be found on our website.  Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you, Kelly, and good morning everyone. It was a challenging quarter for the service industry which translated into lower activity levels and widespread pricing pressure on a global basis as our customers responded to the impact of reduced commodity prices. For Halliburton, total company revenue of $7.1 billion was a 4% decline compared to the first quarter of 2014 relative to a 19% decline in the worldwide rig count, once again representing industry-leading revenue performance.  Operating income declined 28% year-over-year to approximately $700 million, driven by North America and Europe/Africa/CIS. The industry experienced unprecedented decline in the North America drilling activity during the first quarter which significantly impacted our financial results. US rig count has dropped approximately 50% from the peak in late November and we\u2019re still seeing activity fall off week to week although the pace of decline has slowed.  Looking back over the last several major cycles, the speed of this downturn has been historically high. Because of the lack of available work driven by the rig count decline and the resulting overcapacity and available equipment chasing the work that remains, this is an extremely competitive market. We\u2019re seeing substantial pricing pressure in all of our product lines and the significant amount of service capacity is looking for work.  Service company behavior has fallen really into one of three buckets. First, those who are still running their businesses to make a profit and returns for their investors. Second, those who have decided that covering fixed cost is no longer important and therefore will take work to keep equipment busy and crews intact while operating at a loss. And third, those who are basically working at a price which covers only their cash costs. Ultimately neither model 2 or 3 is sustainable. And we believe capacity adjustments are likely in a market like this. We\u2019re not going to call a bottom but historically it's taken rig count three quarters to move from peak to trough. Once we see activity stabilized, the healing process can begin but it takes time. Our input costs can then start to catch up with service pricing declines and our efficiency programs and well solutions can start driving margins upwards.  What is not unique about this downturn is the customer service company and supplier behavior is pretty much as you would expect. What is unique is the speed at which this is happening. We believe that the operators, vendors and service companies who deal most effectively with the velocity of this downturn will be those who profit the most when it turns. We fully expect Halliburton to be one of those winners and so will the vendors who work with us to get through it.  Outside of North America, the international markets were more resilient than the domestic market but were not immune to the impacts of the lower commodity price environment. The international rig count is down 9% from the peak last July but we\u2019re seeing customers defer new projects, most notably in the offshore exploration markets. Due to the lower cash flows available to operators, they are more focused than ever on lowering costs and are asking the oil service companies, engineering companies and fabricators to offer solutions, including pricing concessions. We\u2019re working with our customers to improve project economics through technology and improved operating efficiency.  As we discussed last quarter, we anticipate headwinds across all of our international regions this year with full year international spending reflecting a mid-teens reduction. We still expect Middle East/Asia to be the most stable region for the company in 2015 as recent project awards in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, UAE and Kuwait are anticipated to move forward. However we expect Malaysia, Australia and other markets across the region to be impacted by reduced customer spending and delayed projects.  Europe/Africa/CIS is experiencing significant activity declines across the entire region with the most vulnerable areas being the North Sea, Russia and Angola. In particular, the offshore markets are facing extremely challenging economics. We've already seen significant delays of exploration work in these markets with a number of pending opportunities still at risk as operators work to balance their budgets. And in Latin America, we expect lower activity levels across the region with the largest declines projected in Mexico as a result of budget constraints and Colombia where operators are sizing their programs to live within cash flows.  In addition, we anticipate lower revenue resulting from the new Venezuelan exchange rate. Given the near-term headwinds that we\u2019re seeing globally, our focus is on controlling what's within our control. First, after taking a hard look at our global operations in the first quarter, we streamlined our business primarily through headcount and asset reductions while not impacting our service delivery model, which resulted in a $1.2 billion restructuring charge, including a complete write-off of our operations in both Libya and Yemen. Christian will provide more details later in the call.  Second, we\u2019re continuing to work with our suppliers. As we discussed last quarter, there's a delay in realizing cost savings from our suppliers. Input cost reductions around items like sand and logistics began during the first quarter and we expect to realize more of these cost savings as we move through the remainder of the year. We\u2019re pleased that many of our key vendors now realize the type of market that we are in and they are working with us to allow us to get our input costs more competitive. We\u2019re also looking at consolidating our vendor list into fewer companies that we can commit more volume to going forward.  Third, we are staying focused on service execution and collaborating with our customers to reduce their well costs. Fourth, we're playing offense. We're focused on the utilization of our deployed assets and we're defending our market share with key customers. And finally and most importantly, we're still a returns driven organization and where pricing concessions were to push returns below an acceptable threshold, we have instead elected to stack equipment, including frac lease. Given the unsustainable prices, we've seen some of our competition willing to work for them who would rather save our equipment for better times.  One other thing I need to point out is that in a typical downturn we would've reduced our operating cost structure more than we have done but in anticipation of closing the Baker Hughes acquisition later this year, we want to preserve our underlying service delivery platform. We know we have best-in-class service delivery and keeping this platform in peak condition will allow us to realize our transaction synergies post close. This means that we're not cutting as deep as we might have done so otherwise. And consequently we're carrying an elevated cost structure. While this decision burdens current margins it is clearly the right thing to do in the long run.  As we\u2019ve done in previous downturns, we are looking through the cycle and investing capital and strategic programs to maintain the health of the franchise and to position ourselves to be able to accelerate out of the downturn when the market recovers. This includes investing in key technologies and capabilities that allow us to deliver our value proposition in unconventionals, deepwater and mature fields.  As I mentioned previously, we're always working closely with customers around the world to help them lower their cost per barrel of oil equivalent. We approach this in two ways. First through more efficient and more reliable lower-cost delivery platform, and second, through technology that reduces uncertainty and makes better wells.  In terms of efficiency this is where innovations like our Frac of the Future with its increased reliability and lower-cost profile become important differentiators. Our Q-10 pumps support our surface efficiency strategy which will enable us to lower operators\u2019 costs while at the same time protect our margins against deteriorating industry conditions. This is also where we leverage the scale of our global logistics network and supply chain. Just as important, we\u2019re working with our customers to help them make better wells through subsurface insight and custom chemistry. Our CoreVault system is a great example of delivering subsurface insight where we\u2019re able to collect multiple core samples during a single trip and preserve 100% of the downhole fluid for analysis. This accelerates our customers\u2019 reservoir understanding, more precisely locate hydrocarbons and helps them fully understand the economic value of their asset. We\u2019re doing this today in every North American basin and have recently expanded into Europe and Asia-Pacific.  Our CYPHER seismic to stimulation service is gaining traction, helping more customers maximize the value of their unconventional assets. Our CYPHER project count actually increased sequentially even as activity levels declined. The added projects included both existing customers expanding their programs as well as customers new to the CYPHER platform.  And finally, custom chemistry where we are pleased with the expansion of AccessFrac which helps our customers efficiently and effectively stimulate the entire lateral. In addition to being used in 12 basins around the world, AccessFrac is also seeing significant uptick as a refrac solution in North America. When deploying our proprietary chemical diversion technology in the early unconventional oil wells, we\u2019ve seen instances where the estimated ultimate recovery has more than doubled. There has been a lot of discussion around inventory wells. Operators choosing to drill but not complete wells and then defer production until commodity prices become more favorable. Third-party estimates put this number around 4000 wells. It is our view that although inventory wells can exacerbate the short-term activity declines per completions, it essentially defers the revenue opportunity. When our customers decide to increase activity levels, this will be beneficial for Halliburton as they are likely to increase completions in tandem with new well drilling, which could accelerate our rate of recovery during the upcycle. Now before I turn the call over to Christian, I want to spend a few minutes on the macro environment. Over the past several months, global demand expectations for 2015 have been consistently revised higher, now calling for an increase of over 1 million barrels per day, including recent upward revisions for both US and Europe.  On the supply side, we\u2019re all watching US production levels very closely given the volume expansions that took place throughout 2013 and 2014. Recently monthly production estimates have been encouraging, however, showing significantly lower production growth and actually projecting oil production to be flat to down in the major basins.  In terms of international production, non-OPEC estimates continue to be trimmed. But we see this as an overlooked positive factor. Comparing the IEA forecast exit rate for 2015 against 2014, key non-OPEC contributors are expected to decline with further reduction expected as a result of declining global rig count. We view this as ultimately constructive for the prospect of supply-demand equilibrium. Whether we reach this point in months or quarters, Halliburton will continue to take the necessary steps to prepare our global franchise with the eventual recovery and to outperform our competitors.  Further it's our view that North America will continue to be the most adaptable market in terms of addressing well economics through both efficiency models and technology uptake. One way to look at it is that the US unconventional business is now the lowest cost fast as the market incremental barrel of oil available in the world today. One thing we\u2019ve helped our unconventional customers prove over the years is that they are smart, technically savvy and very adaptable companies and I am confident that this type of market will show that again. As a result, we believe that when the recovery does come, North America will respond the quickest and offer the greatest upside and that Halliburton will be best positioned to lead the way.  We\u2019ve been through these cycles before. We know what to do and we\u2019ll execute on that experience. Now let me turn the call over to Christian to provide more details on our financial results. Christian? Christian Garcia : Thanks, Jeff and good morning everyone. I will begin with an overview of our first-quarter results. Total company revenue of $7.1 billion represented a 4% decline compared to the first quarter of 2014 while operating income declined 28% to approximately $700 million.  As expected, we experienced typical first quarter sequential decline in revenue and margins due to the absence of high year-end software and product sales in the fourth quarter, as well as the normal first-quarter weather-related weakness in the North Sea, Russia and the Bakken. The decline this year was obviously exacerbated by the macro headwinds facing the industry.  Now let me compare our geographic results to the first quarter of 2014. In the Eastern Hemisphere, first-quarter revenue was essentially flat and operating income increased 3% over prior year despite activity and pricing headwinds. We\u2019ve consistently outperformed our competitors in terms of revenue growth over the last few years and we expect that this will be true for the first quarter once all of our peers have reported.  In the Middle East, Asia region, revenue and operating income increased by 13% and 33% respectively. This excellent improvement was led by solid growth in integrated project activity in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and India that was partially offset by declines in Malaysia and Australia.  Turning to Europe/Africa/ CIS, we saw first quarter revenue and operating income declined 16% and 41% respectively. Significant activity declines in Angola and the Norwegian sector of the North Sea along with currency and sanction related issues in Russia led to the lower results for the region.  Latin America revenue and operating income increased by 10% and 22% respectively, primarily due to higher unconventional drilling in Argentina and increased activity in Venezuela.  Moving to North America, revenue and operating income declined 9% and 54% respectively, relative to a 21% reduction in the US-land rig count. Lower commodity prices have translated into severe reductions in activity levels throughout the first quarter accompanied by significant price reductions. Primarily as a result of the market decline that is affecting all of our operations globally, we incurred $1.2 billion of charges in the first quarter consisting of asset write-offs, including our entire operations in Libya and Yemen, severance-related costs, inventory write-downs, impairments of intangible assets and facility closures and other items.  Over the last two quarters, we\u2019ve reduced our headcount by approximately 9000 employees, more than 10% of our global headcount. As Jeff indicated, we're continuing to take a hard look at our operations. Additional actions will likely be required in the second quarter although we expect further charges will be significantly smaller. Our corporate and other expenses totaled $69 million for the quarter, slightly lower than originally anticipated. We estimate that our corporate expenses for the second quarter will be approximately $75 million and this will be the new quarterly run rate for 2015.  During the quarter, we adopted the new free-floating market exchange rate in Venezuela, resulting in an approximate $200 million foreign-currency loss. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter came in slightly lower than expected at 26% due to a higher mix of international earnings and other favorable tax benefits. For the second quarter we\u2019re expecting the effective tax rate to remain at approximately 26%. For capital expenditures, given the severity of the decline in activity levels, we are now reducing our capital spend for the year by $500 million or approximately 15% to $2.8 billion. Because we manufacture our owned equipment, we have the utmost flexibility to adjust our capital spend based on our visibility of the market.  Our objective is to look beyond the cycle and we continue to be committed to investing in certain strategic technologies such as the Frac of the Future while retiring older more costly equipment. Our rollout strategy related to this initiative is not impacted as a result of our new capital guidance and therefore we still expect to be approximately 50% converted to the Frac of the Future by year-end.  Finally, let me give you some comments on our second-quarter operational outlook. In North America, the average US rig count for the second quarter is already down nearly 30% compared to the first quarter and we expect further activity declines and for pricing to remain under pressure. As a result, we anticipate a sequential revenue decline in the second quarter. But as a reminder, we typically outpace changes in the average rig count.  We also expect margins to drift lower to the mid single digits with our sequential decrementals improving compared to the first quarter as we begin to see the impact of our cost reduction initiatives and lower input costs from our suppliers.  Now moving to the Eastern Hemisphere outlook. In the second quarter, we are anticipating both revenue and margins to be in line with the first-quarter levels, as the typical seasonal improvements are expected to be offset by customer budget reductions and pricing concessions.  In Latin America, for the second quarter we expect a revenue decline in the upper teens with low double-digit margins. The main driver of this is our Venezuela operations where revenues are expected to decline by 50% sequentially as a result of the recent currency devaluation. In addition, we expect to see budget constraints in Mexico and reduced activity in Brazil and Colombia.  Now I will turn the call over to Mark for an update on the pending Baker acquisition. Mark? Mark McCollum : Thanks, Christian and good morning. It\u2019s good to be back on the call and I am excited to be able to provide you with an update on the significant progress we\u2019re making towards closing the Baker Hughes acquisition.  Let me begin with some of the more recent developments. On March 27, we announced that the transaction was approved by the shareholders of both Halliburton and Baker Hughes. We were pleased that nearly 99% of the shares voted at Halliburton Special Meeting voted in favor of the proposal and that more than 98% of the shares voted at Baker Hughes special meeting voted in favor of the transaction. These results were strong vote of confidence from our shareholders and we believe reflect their enthusiasm for the strategic and financial merits of the combination. When we announced the transaction last November, we discussed the likelihood of divestitures and our confidence that the combination would be achievable from a regulatory standpoint.  On April 7, we announced that we will be marketing for sale our Fixed Cutter and Roller Cone Drill Bits, Directional Drilling, logging while drilling and measurement while drilling businesses. The 2014 revenue associated with these businesses was approximately $3.5 billion. We're very pleased with the strong interest that\u2019s been expressed in these assets by potential buyers both within the energy industry as well as outside the industry, including a number of very capable financial sponsors. We will begin the marketing process in the coming weeks. The eventual sale of these businesses is subject to obtaining final approval of the pending Baker Hughes acquisition by the competition authorities reviewing the transaction.  We expect there will likely be additional divestitures and we plan to provide updates at the appropriate time. However launching the sale of the drill bits and drilling businesses is a good first step toward expediting this process. We're continuing to respond to the second information request from the Department of Justice and outside of the US we continue to make progress with the required filings with the competition authorities in foreign jurisdictions. We believe we remain on track to complete the transaction late in the second half of 2015.  Now turning to integration planning. Since launching the process in early December, we\u2019ve been focused on developing a comprehensive, detailed and thoughtful integration plan to make the post-closing transition as seamless, efficient and productive as possible but also to fully capture the financial and strategic benefits of the combination. Working in parallel with the Baker Hughes integration team, we're bringing together the talent and expertise of both companies to build an even stronger combined organization as well as ensure that the planning efforts results in a robust integration plan for each and every functional and operational area of both businesses.  We\u2019re preparing such that on day one after the close, we can immediately begin the integration and start capturing the value inherent in this combination and deliver on the estimated synergies. Regardless of market conditions and the actions both we and Baker Hughes have taken to date, we continue to target annual pre-tax cost synergies of nearly $2 billion. As we evaluate this transaction and move toward completion, we are confident that we can achieve our synergy objective.  In closing, we remain enthusiastic about and fully committed to closing this compelling transaction. We\u2019re very excited about the benefits this combination will provide to the shareholders, customers and other stakeholders of both companies. This combination will create a bellwether global oilfield services company and together with Baker Hughes we will combine our highly complementary suites of products and services into a comprehensive offering that will deliver an unsurpassed depth and breadth of solutions to our customers. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Jeff for some closing remarks. Jeff Miller : Thanks, Mark. To sum it up, I want to thank the Halliburton team for avoiding distractions and maintaining their focus during the downturn. We\u2019re excited about the pending Baker acquisition. We\u2019re making great progress and believe we\u2019re on track to close late in the second half of this year. It's a tough market out there and we\u2019re not going to try to call a recovery. There are just not enough convincing data points out there at this time for me to make a conclusion. Instead we\u2019re focused on the things we can control, things like rightsizing the business to current activity levels, preparing for the Baker integration by preserving our service delivery platform, collaborating with our customers to address their well costs, protecting market share with key customers, to turning down work when baseline economic thresholds don't make sense. Continuing to work with our supply chain to properly adjust costs to current market conditions, we made progress here but there's still more to get. And finally investing to preserve the long-term value of the franchise. So whatever scenario you think may happen, we have the people, technology and experience to outperform the market. We demonstrated this during previous cycles and have no reason to believe that this cycle will be any different.  Now let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jud Bailey from Wells Fargo. Jud Bailey : Good job on the quarter, impressive. A question on international, impressive performance in the margins better than what we were anticipating and as well as the second quarter guide. Could you give us a little insight, Jeff, as to what\u2019s helping drive the margin performance there and help us think about going forward, are you seeing the impact of some of the pricing concessions in the 1 and 2Q margins internationally? Jeff Miller : Thanks, Jud. I am pleased as well with the results in the international market for us and I think it reflects a systematic buildout that we have been talking about in terms of strengthening that organization and it's really paying off. It also demonstrates execution of our mature field strategy which is really inherent in a lot of that activity. So I think it's consistent with our performance over the last couple of years and I expect to continue to outperform there. As we look at pricing, though, there is pricing pressures sort of throughout the marketplace and obviously the international markets are not immune to that. Jud Bailey : And then my follow-up is going to be on North America. You obviously comment on the second quarter for margins but can you help us think a little bit further maybe in the back half of the year? You noted in the release, you\u2019re going to carry higher costs as you anticipate closing of the Baker transaction. Can you help us think about the impact on margins, maybe in the back half of the year as you carry higher cost than you would've anticipated against the market dynamics as price is going to be pretty tough in the back half of the year? Christian Garcia : Jud, this is Christian. Let me take that. So you have two questions, one is what happens to North America margins in the second half of the year. We\u2019re not going to provide guidance as Jeff talked about in his prepared remarks, the healing process starts when activity stabilizes and then pricing stabilizes, and then we will see the benefits of the adjustments in cost structure that we have taken. So don't know what it is but really it\u2019s a guess on when activity stabilizes.  In terms of the service delivery platform, the costs that we are keeping in anticipation of the Baker acquisition, first of all, those costs that we are keeping are global in nature but it is certainly more impactful to North America. There are several examples of those buckets of costs. One is our footprint. We operate in about 20 districts in North America and with that type of downturn that we\u2019re seeing \u2013 as severe as we are seeing, we would consider consolidating some of them.  The other one is management of organizations. So we have a management layer between the districts and the areas. We would probably have considered collapsing them. And the third, as you know we've been building our logistics capability in the last few years, sand plants where we have transloading facilities in all of the basins, or rail car network, we would have probably dismantled portions of it as activity declined. However we are keeping all of those because we're expecting the increased volumes from Baker and in terms of the margin impact of this, I can say it would probably range between 200 to 300 basis points. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Angie Sedita from UBS. Angie Sedita : Congrats on a good quarter. Mark, I thought it was impressive, your comments on the Baker deal as far as the $2 billion in synergies. I would have thought with the pressure on revenues that the $2 billion in synergies could have moved a bit but can you talk about that a little bit as well as the accretion timeline? Has that changed at all in your mind? Mark McCollum : So I will address the last question first, Angie. The accretion timeline hasn\u2019t adjusted. Obviously everything is contingent on us getting the transaction closed. We can\u2019t get after any of the integration actions until the closing happens. But I think to address your first question, there are couple things to note. First of all, we continue to target internally as synergy cases beyond the two, I mean in order to achieve it, you\u2019ve got to reach high and so we're looking at every single thing that we could go after. That's why we remain confident.  In the downturn itself, certainly there are actions that are being taken both by Halliburton and Baker Hughes that impact employee counts, facility closures and lot of other things, some of which you would say likely would be something that would be in the synergy case itself. But the differences is that most of these changes are being done in response to the market downturn, and the question ultimately comes to, okay, when the market comes back, what happens to those costs, in order for the synergy case to be ultimately captured, we\u2019ve got to make process changes, procedural changes, changes in the way that we do business between the two companies that ultimately captures those synergies, so that when the business does come back, the cost associated with those activities does not. And so that\u2019s why the plans that we are making on the integration continue to really drive after the fundamental process and procedural changes behind it to make sure that we secure those synergies, not just for the current period but forever. Angie Sedita : And then along with that as far as the follow up, the cash from the asset sales related to the merger, is the first priority still buying back stock or has that priority changed? Christian Garcia : Really nothing has changed, Angie. The magnitude of the buyback will always be dependent on how much cash we generate during this downturn, the proceeds from the divestitures and so forth. But our priority has not changed. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Scott Gruber from Citi. Scott Gruber : There has been a lot of discussion recently on this refract potential in the US; you mentioned it, Schlumberger mentioned it. I am curious as to your take on the overall potential, is this really a marginal source of incremental demand where we\u2019re just looking for a silver lining given the overall activity reductions or could this really be a material source of incremental frac demand here and is this trend primarily technology driven or is it being more driven by your customers responding to the cyclical downturn? Jeff Miller : Hi Scott, the refrac economics are attractive both for our clients and certainly for Halliburton. We\u2019ve been refracking in essence for a couple of years and we actually see this as a natural extension with the maturing of unconventional wells over time. Our Halliburton technology was designed specifically to address better production which includes how to refrac, so our diversion technology around AccessFrac does that spectacularly as well as CYPHER was designed with refract in mind from the standpoint of not only at the well level but also identifying candidates at a field level. I would say what has changed in terms of giving it energy right now, more energy is the current market and access to capital. So I think those are going together. I do believe we will see growth there, and I think that growth will be great for Halliburton. Scott Gruber : And then an unrelated follow up, one of the primary debates amongst investors currently is recovery potential. You mentioned the responsiveness of shales to an improvement in commodity price. How do you think about the potential for your North American revenues to return toward a 2014 level? Is this an unreasonable assumption on a multiyear basis, how do you think about the potential for your international revenues to rebound to that same 2014 type level? Jeff Miller : Well, look, the North America market is again one of the most adaptable markets and we expect that, that kind of growth and improvement will be acting as the swing producer. And so I see the potential over time as we described the past recovery being sort of activity stabilizes, then pricing and then input costs catch up but overall the ability for North America to expand is certainly there and if we kind of look back it served us intensity in North America. If we go back to 2008, our rig counts arguably flat with 2014 today but our revenues over that same period of time have doubled. So I expect that the focus on making better wells which is right in our wheelhouse will continue to be important. Operator : And your next question comes from James West from Evercore ISI Group. James West : Mark, quick question for you on the divestitures. Obviously you\u2019re going to be marketing these assets very soon. Was curious, so one, how you think about achieving kind of maximum value given these are very high quality assets that are all for grabs now? And then two, how quickly do you think we or the market will hear about who the likely buyers are of these assets? Mark McCollum : Those are great questions, James. Obviously in this kind of a market, you\u2019re always a little worried about the process but we've been really excited as I said in my prepared remarks about the level of interest that\u2019s been shown in these assets. I mean these types of assets only come on the market once in a generation. And so we\u2019ve just had a tremendous outpouring of response to very quality potential buyers both what you consider strategic buyers inside the industry, outside the industry, global-based as well as very capable financial sponsors have looked at it. We\u2019re going to run a process for each business for the two \u2013 or for the ones that have been announced, we will run two separate processes. We will run a process over the top of them, in case there are buyers that are interested in all of the businesses in combination but we think by doing it in that way, that gives adequate and complete opportunity for anybody who is interested and participate and to come and to stake their claim.  The process for themselves generally will stretch, I am going to guess about five months. So it\u2019s going to be in the later part of the summer before that we will probably have identified buyers. Before we can really make any kind of analysis, we\u2019re going to have to go back to have conversations with Department of Justice and other competition authorities who are looking at this to make sure that the buyers that have been identified will be acceptable to them. Remember that the process is not just divestiture for the sake of getting proceeds. The process here is to make sure that we\u2019re maintaining competition in the marketplace and so they'll have an interest in making sure that the identified buyers are going to be able to make sure that those businesses will be sustainable in the marketplace, will be viable competitors once the process is completed. James West : And then just unrelated question from me, maybe Jeff or Christian, on the supplier side, your supplier side, you\u2019re getting some benefit, it sounds like from your sand, maybe chemicals and truck and things like that, have you seen the full benefit yet and will that show up in the second quarter? And what\u2019s the magnitude of kind of the reduction in the cost from your major suppliers? Jeff Miller : Thanks, James. I am not going to talk about the amount, lot of those discussions are ongoing but we are making progress. I would \u2013 discounts are still better the closer that they are to the wellhead and by that means they have better visibility of really what the full impact of the current downturn might look like. As we work with our suppliers, we\u2019re clearly consolidating those suppliers and we\u2019re doing more volume and we will continue to do more volume with the vendors that work with us to lower our costs. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Bill Herbert : Mark, the divestiture process once again. Are you able to shed any light as to what the after-tax consequences will be associated with the sale of these businesses? Should there be a tax burden associated with the sale of these businesses or how do you think about that? I mean it\u2019s contingent upon price of course but I'm curious as to what we could expect from an after-tax standpoint not on number specifically but conceptually? Mark McCollum : Conceptually, yes. There will be an after-tax impact of these as they are -- we do expect them to sell well above book value. And so there will be a tax consequence of that. We don't know what that's going to be at this point in time, even if I did, not sure I would tell you \u2013 I would have to kill you. That is just joking but I think that \u2013 but we do expect these businesses to go for a really good value. I mean I think anyone who is interested is going to have to bring their A game, considering how many people are interested in these projects and so they are going to be pretty traditional asset sales that will have an after-tax impact themselves. But I think at this point in time we still fundamentally believe in economics of the transaction as we outlined, if you know, at the time that we announced the overall deal. We believe that's intact and our view is that there will be adequate proceeds to be able to have cash at the closing to help Christian do what he needs to do. Bill Herbert : And then secondly, Jeff, with regard to the inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells, are you getting any visibility from customers with regard to telegraphing when they\u2019re going to start monetizing these wells? Are there any discussions about them getting going in the second half of the year or what pricing thresholds they are contemplating that will result in the greenlight going off? Jeff Miller : I mean they lack the clarity in terms of the outlook as much as sort of anyone does in the market right now. So I don't think they\u2019ve even concluded around the timing, though it would certainly be at a point in time that they see commodity prices rising as opposed to where they are. And I think around the dock inventory, of course a couple of comments. First, it represents we think about 4000 wells, that\u2019s against the backdrop of 55,000 wells that were drilled last year. So that's one thought. And then the second is, it\u2019s really a limited subset of customers that can even afford to talk about drilled but uncompleted wells at least as a practice. So from our standpoint, without precision around the timing it certainly looks like deferred revenue for Halliburton and arguably when it occurs it will accelerate sort of tightening and recovery. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Brad Handler from Jefferies & Co. Brad Handler : Thanks guys. Maybe a couple of related questions, related to the North American market. But just first your guidance, want to make sure I heard that. I think you said mid-single-digit North American margins in 2Q that's despite not having a couple or more hundred basis points relative to cost savings and that's include \u2013 but you\u2019re factoring in effective pricing is continuing to presumably be full quarter worth of pricing declines and the like. So first of all, I guess, is the mid single digit, did we hear that correctly? Christian Garcia : That is correct. So Brad, as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, activity continues to decline, price continues to be under pressure and therefore margins go flock down to the mid-single-digits. So it\u2019s an all-in including the elevated cost structure that we have. Brad Handler : Can you maybe just comment a little bit on, in Q1 maybe order of magnitude activity versus price realization combined for that minus 25% sequential performance, can you split it up for us a little bit? Christian Garcia : So just in terms of activity versus price, if you just look at the progression of our results in the first quarter, January held up actually better than the March as you can expect, the exit rate was much weaker than where we started. Overall in terms of our activity that our frac stage count is actually down just in the mid-single digits. That would imply that this tremendous amount of pricing that we were impacted by. So we think it as we go into Q2, the activity will continue to come down. Don't know what it might be, as I pointed out, right now rig count is down about 30% and the decline continues. But we will continue to have pricing pressure. Jeff Miller : Maybe just a follow-up as well, so clients are really myopic on price right now and as data points are continuing to deteriorate, we obviously also talk about the falling rig count, service capacity sorting itself out. But at this point in time as I said in my prepared remarks, simply don't believe that this is sustainable in terms of pricing. And so it's a point as service capacity sorts itself out we clearly expect clients to return to making better wells which is right in our wheelhouse. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from David Anderson from Barclays. David Anderson : Jeff, you talked about two of the three camps of service companies out there based on unsustainable models. And as we think about kind of the new equilibrium performance for the rig count, we know there\u2019s going to be a lot of excess capacity. I was wondering if you could talk a bit about how you think about attrition levels in the pressure pumping market? I mean how long can these guys continue working \u2013 do you think they are weighing on capital infusions there and I guess I am also just kind of secondarily wondering how you think about normalized margins in North America going forward? Do you think that it could be lower than the past just to keep those guys on the sideline? Just kind of curious how you are thinking about this as it develops? Jeff Miller : Let me reframe that a little bit and think in terms of sort of capacity in general. If we look back before we look ahead, capacity comes out pretty quickly and actually when it comes out it doesn't generally get back to work. And that is \u2013 and so if we look at the activity today and how hard the equipment is working to the extent that equipment is getting burned up at prices that don't make sense and new capital is not spent to replace it. Then it\u2019s not necessarily a linear attrition of equipment. What happens is it sits on the sidelines until it's needed and then it's not there, and we really saw that happen last year when capacity was taken up very quickly. And so I don't expect it to be any different going forward, which is really underpins our investment in the Q-10 and our ability to operate more sustainably at a lower cost. David Anderson : And then are you thinking about kind of normalized margins yet, is it too early to be talking about that? We used to talk about kind of mid-to high 20% margin. But just wondering if you\u2019re thinking that sort of have to be a little bit lower to keep that capital from coming back in the market, we\u2019ve been in this just to kind of avoid this cycle we seem to be constantly in? Jeff Miller : I don't think so. I mean the path to the 20s and beyond \u2013 I mean all of that still works, because that\u2019s in our sort of design of service and execution model, but because things are so myopic today on price, this isn\u2019t really the time to have \u2013 we can\u2019t act on that meaningfully. But as Christian mentioned, as activity stabilizes then healing begins and at that point certainly pricing and input costs catch-up and we\u2019re back on the path. But we have to get to some stabilized level of activity and that's where the efficiency model that we execute really shines it on. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Jim Crandell from Cowen. Jim Crandell : Thank you. Mark, is there a scenario where in order to close the Baker Hughes deal that you also need to divest wireline, fluids, the chunk of completions, offshore cementing, maybe some stimulation vessels? Jeff Miller : Jim, as I said in my prepared remarks, we know that there will be some additional divestitures to do. We don't exactly know what those are going to be. That\u2019s going to be something that will be found out as we have discussions with the competition authorities both Department of Justice as well as elsewhere in the world and I just can't even speculate at this point in time what those other divestitures might be. Jim Crandell : Mark, if it\u2019s all of the ones that I said, is there a level where you questioned doing the deal? Jeff Miller : There is not a level that we question doing the deal. We still fundamentally believe in everything that we see that the level of divestitures will be substantially below the $7.5 billion threshold that was laid out in the merger agreement. So we\u2019re still operating well within that level and no, there is not a level at this point that we would walk away from the deal. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Kurt Hallead : So just wanted to get general sense, I mean guys, again over time done really well obviously on the revenue front. Just trying to get a sense on the dynamics internationally from pricing and on the margin dynamic, the decrementals from here and when you might start to see some stabilization in the international markets? Jeff Miller : Thanks, Kurt. The international markets are very competitive and at this point all our clients are asking for discounts. The reality is there\u2019s just not a lot to give. If we go back to 2008 that international markets really never recovered certainly entirely from that. But the short answer is yes we are seeing pricing pressure. Clients are asking for discounts. Though what I would say a better leading edge discussion is around efficiency and contracting which is how to better work with Halliburton to take system costs out of drilling. And so I would say we\u2019re not having \u2013 at the beginning of those discussions were truly internationally, that's a key component of the path forward to for our customers. Christian Garcia : And Kurt, let me comment on international decrementals. We\u2019re still targeting that our decrementals international to be better than in 2009. And one of the reasons why we feel that way is because of how our margins behaved in Q1. As you know, internationally our decrementals usually are the harshest in the first quarter. Historically it\u2019s 45% plus but if you look at our Q1 decrementals it was half that historic rate. Plus we have strong incrementals on a year-on- year basis, growth in both revenue and operating income international. So every quarter is going to be a battle but we\u2019re starting -- where we stand right now in terms of achieving the objective of having lower decrementals than in 2009. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Ole Slorer : Christian, just give a little bit more \u2013 shed a little bit more light on the $1.2 billion charges. You mentioned [indiscernible] and how much was the working capital? Christian Garcia : Ole, we couldn\u2019t hear you but I think you are looking for the savings from the charge. Okay, so let me just take a stab at that. We are taking multiple actions, including right-sizing our infrastructure, we reduced our headcount and lowering our supplier costs and obviously this has been a global effort. Right now our estimate for the savings from these actions is about $1 billion annually but as Jeff pointed out that and as I pointed out in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re not done. We will continue to take a hard look at our operations in the second quarter and we will continue to make adjustments. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Dan Boyd from BMO Capital Markets. Dan Boyd : Hi, thanks. Just wanted to really clarify something because there's a lot of talk of the backlog of wells building up that you mentioned. But then at the same time you mentioned that your frac stages were only down -- what was that -- mid single digits sequentially but the rig count was down 27% sequentially. So can you help me understand what's going on there? Are you just gaining that much market share or is the backlog of wells not all that abnormally high? Jeff Miller : Well, there's always some level of uncompleted wells in any market because of pad drilling. So if you kind of look at the numbers of pads, generally speaking, the rigs will drive uncompleted wells sort of systematically into the marketplace. So but we typically see a flight to quality in a market like this and so as we've said we are defending our customer base. We focus on the fairway players and particularly those players that value our efficiency model. As I've said we won't work at silly prices but our strategy to be the sustainable lowest-cost per barrel of oil operator holds true. And I think we're seeing it play out. Dan Boyd : Yes, impressive market share gains. And then you've touched on this a number of times in the call, and just talking about industry attrition and pressure pumping equipment and yet it happens typically through cannibalization of the fleets I think as you touched on. But can you just maybe give us a guess as to how much attrition we might expect if we stayed at current market levels? Jeff Miller : It's really too early in the cycle for me to give you a number, but let's think about it this way. While the total market volumes of pumping are down year on year or certainly sequentially are down, the volume per well is up 12% sequentially, which means that the equipment that's out there is working harder than it's ever worked. There may be less of it working but working harder, which says that stacked equipment does get cannibalized unless people are making capital investments in equipment. So I think we're going to see a similar attrition sort of behavior that we saw through the last cycle. End of Q& A Operator : Thank you. At this time I would like to turn the call back to management for any closing remarks. Jeff Miller : Thank you Danielle. I guess I'd like to wrap up the call with just a couple of comments. As we've said while we work through the current market, we'll continue to control costs to protect our margins while playing offense to protect our market position with key clients. As we look through the cycle we'll continue to invest in those capabilities to deliver our long-term strategies in unconventionals, deepwater and mature fields. I'm confident that our people, technology and experience will outperform the market and emerge as we have in the past a stronger company in the recovery. So look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Bradley P. Handler - Jefferies LLC Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Halliburton Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Kelly Youngblood, Halliburton's Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Kelly Youngblood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton Second Quarter 2015 Conference Call. Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Christian Garcia, acting CFO; and Jeff Miller, President. Mark McCollum, Chief Integration Officer, will also join us during the question-and-answer portion of the call. During our prepared remarks, Dave will provide an update on the pending Baker Hughes transaction. However, due to ongoing discussions, we will not be taking any questions today related to regulatory matters. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly, any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today include non-GAAP financial measures. Unless otherwise noted in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of these items. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our second quarter press release, which can be found on our website. We had several moving pieces this quarter, so let me help you walk through the numbers. As announced in our press release, our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.44, excluding restructuring costs of $0.30 and acquisition related costs of $0.08. However, as required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, included in our results was a $0.06 benefit related to the cessation of depreciation expense associated with the assets we are currently marketing in anticipation of the Baker Hughes acquisition. Excluding the depreciation benefit would have resulted in earnings per share for the quarter of $0.38. Going forward, the benefit associated with our assets held for sale should be factored in to your financial models as this is the only quarter that we intend to disclose it separately. Now, I will turn the call over to Dave. David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Kelly, and good morning to everyone. The services industry obviously experienced another challenging quarter with lower activity levels and widespread pricing pressures across the globe as our customers continue to respond to the impact of reduced commodity prices. Considering the difficult headwinds that worked against us, I am very pleased with our overall financial results for the second quarter. Now, let me cover some headlines. First, total company revenue of $5.9 billion declined 16% sequentially compared to a 26% decline in the worldwide rig count. I'm also very pleased with our Eastern Hemisphere margin expansion, which once again outpaced our primary competitor. We generated nearly $1.2 billion in operating cash flow. Operating income declined as a result of lower activity levels exacerbated by pricing (04:13) declines primarily in North America. Revenue for North America was down 25% sequentially, significantly outperforming the 40% decline in the average rig count. And while the North American rig count declined 40%, our stage count declined less than 10%. Therefore, we believe that a customer flight to quality emerged during the quarter. And this gives us reason to believe that pricing declines may begin to decelerate. And I can tell you, our customers are smart, responsive and adaptable in this market. And although we experienced some weather disruptions, we were able to make up this work later in the quarter. We continue to maintain an infrastructure well beyond current market needs, ahead of the Baker transaction, incurring costs which we would have otherwise eliminated. This impacted margins by 300 basis points to 400 basis points in Q2, and decremental margins this quarter were better than previous cycles, which demonstrates that our aggressive cost reduction initiatives are helping to offset the current market challenges. The U.S. rig count finished the quarter down 55% from the peak in late November, but has moved sideways over the last few weeks. Price erosion continued in the second quarter and is likely to remain fluid in the near term. We anticipate margin compression in the third quarter, but believe it will be driven more by the full impact of pricing declines that we gave up in the second quarter and from lower activity levels more than continued price erosion. In fact, we believe that service pricing for the industry has fallen to unsustainable levels. Last quarter, we described three types of service companies in the market : those making a profit, which weren't very many; those covering cash costs and those operating at a loss, even on a cash basis. During the first quarter, Halliburton was one of just a few companies that posted profits in North America. And we expect the second quarter has been even more challenging for those of us in the industry. As a result, we believe many of the smaller service companies are now operating below cash breakeven levels, which leads to the conclusion that pricing cannot stay at these levels for an extended period. Now, looking ahead, we could begin to see a modest uptick in activity during the second half of this year, which could include increased refrac activity, which Jeff Miller will detail later. However, we are not expecting a meaningful activity increase until sometime in 2016, depending on the pace of production declines and where commodity prices settle out in the coming quarters. Therefore, what we are continuing to do is manage our cost, service our customers that are engaged in this flight to quality, and prepare for the Baker transaction. Now, outside North America, I'm very happy with where our international business is today. Our full year outlook for our international businesses remains unchanged. We still estimate a mid-teens decline in total international customer spend compared to last year. However, we expect to outpace the total market and believe our revenue decline will be less severe. We also anticipate our third quarter Eastern Hemisphere margins will be in the upper teens. Now, let me provide a little bit of international of regional color. In the Middle East/Asia, we see a solid and stable business as project awards across the Middle East are moving forward. Europe/Africa/CIS is challenged today with the North Sea, Russia and Angola markets being the most vulnerable; and in Latin America, operators are struggling with their cash flows. Although the international markets are more resilient than North America, they are certainly not immune to the impacts of the lower commodity price environment. We did experience some pricing declines in the first half of the year, but negotiations are continuing and we will not see lower pricing fully built into our run rate until the second half of the year. In addition, we are continuing to work with our customers to improve project economics through technology and improved operating efficiency. The execution of our strategy in addressing this environment remains the same. We are continuing to employ a two-pronged approach. We are looking through this cycle to ensure that we will accelerate our growth when the industry recovers. To do this, we continue to invest in key technologies, build out capital equipment, and prepare for our pending acquisition of Baker Hughes. The second part of our approach is managing through the downturn joined upon our management's deep experience in navigating through past cycles. We are aggressively lowering our input costs, eliminating discretionary spending, managing our business within our cash flows, and protecting our market position. Now, I would like to provide you with an update on the significant progress we are making towards closing the Baker Hughes acquisition. Let me begin with some of the more recent developments. During the quarter, we began marketing for sale, our Fixed Cutter and Roller Cone Drill Bits, Directional Drilling, Logging-While-Drilling and Measurement-While-Drilling businesses. In early July, we received nearly 25 indications of interest for each of the businesses, all of which included prices, and we are very pleased with the prices and the response. Because of the high level of interest we received, we are limiting the number of bidders for the second round to only the strongest responses. We expect to complete the auction process sometime this fall with the closing of the divestitures being concurrent with the closing of the larger transaction. We have also recently provided a proposal for additional divestitures to various competition authorities around the world. In aggregate, the total divestitures being considered are still within the scope of those contemplated by us at the time that we announced the transaction. On July 10, both Halliburton and Baker Hughes entered into a timing agreement with the DoJ. Timing agreements are often entered into in connection with large, complex transactions, and provide the DoJ additional time to review responses to its second request. We have agreed to extend the period for their review of the acquisition to the later of November 25, 2015, or 90 days after both companies have certified substantial compliance with the DoJ's second request. I am pleased to say that Baker Hughes did certify substantial compliance on July 14, and we expect to do so shortly. Outside of the U.S., we continue to make progress with the required filings in foreign jurisdictions. Specific to the European Union, we expect to submit our filings later this month, which will start the formal review process. We are fully committed to our target of closing the acquisition in late 2015, though the acquisition agreement does provide the closing can be extended into 2016, if necessary. As we evaluate this transaction and move toward completion, we are confident we can achieve the cost synergies of nearly $2 billion regardless of market conditions or any cost reduction actions taken by either company through that date. In closing, we are enthusiastic about and fully committed to closing this compelling transaction. We are very excited about the benefits of this combination and what it will provide to shareholders, customers and other stakeholders of both companies. This combination with Baker Hughes will create a bellwether global oil services company, combining our highly complementary suites of products and services into a comprehensive offering that will deliver an unsurpassed depth and breadth of cost-effective solutions to our customers. Now, let me turn the call back over to Christian who will provide you some details on our financial results. Christian? Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President-Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. During the second quarter, we announced our decision to divest our Drill Bits and Drilling, MWD/LWD businesses. These businesses were classified as assets held for sale in the second quarter, and we ceased the associated depreciation and amortization for these assets, resulting in an approximate $0.06 benefit to the quarter. We've included a table in our earnings release quantifying the second quarter profit uplift by geography. To provide better transparency of our current operational trends, the sequential comparisons in my comments today have been adjusted to exclude the special items indicated in our earnings release, as well as the benefit of the lower depreciation, meaning both the first and second quarter results reflect the full depreciation burden in order to have an apples-to-apples comparison. Now, let me provide a comparison of our second quarter results to the first quarter of 2015. Total company revenue of $5.9 billion represented a 16% decline, while operating income declined 18% to $570 million. North America led the decline as a result of lower activity levels and continued pricing pressure across all of our product lines. In the Eastern Hemisphere, second quarter revenue declined by 3%, while operating income increased 17%, representing a 300 basis point margin improvement from the first quarter levels despite activity and pricing headwinds. In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue declined by 5% while operating income showed a modest improvement. Lower activity levels across the Asia-Pacific markets were offset by improved profitability in Iraq, Kuwait and the UAE. We are pleased with the progress of operations in Iraq where margins reached double digits for the first time, which we expect to sustain for the full year. Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, we saw second quarter revenue come in flat with operating income increasing by 69%. Seasonal activity improvement's in Eurasia and Norway, along with higher stimulation activity and Completion Tools sales in both Algeria and Angola, drove the improvement for the quarter, offsetting weaker activity levels in the UK and Egypt. Latin America revenue and operating income declined by 19% and 21%, respectively, driven by Venezuela, primarily due to the negative currency impact of the new exchange rate. Partially offsetting this decline was improved profitability in Brazil resulting from the recently retendered Directional Drilling contract. Moving to North America, revenue and operating income declined 25% and 59%, respectively, relative to a 40% reduction in the North America rig count. Lower customer budgets translated into additional reductions in activity levels throughout the second quarter, accompanied by further significant price reductions across all product lines. Our decrementals in the second quarter were 19%, about half of what we experienced in the second quarter of 2009. During the second quarter, we took additional actions to adjust our cost structure due to the continued decline in global activity levels. As a result, we incurred an additional after-tax restructuring charge of $258 million in the second quarter consisting primarily of severance-related costs and asset write-offs. Since the beginning of the year, we've now reduced our global head count by over 16%. We continue to evaluate our operations and will make further adjustments as required to adjust to market conditions. Our Corporate and Other expense totaled $17 million for the quarter. We estimate that our corporate expenses for the third quarter will be approximately $75 million, and this will be the new quarterly run rate for the remainder of 2015. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter came in at 26%, and is expected to be between 26% and 27% for the remainder of the year. We continue to focus on cash flow generation. And given the continued decline in activity levels, we are reducing our capital spend for the year by another $200 million to $2.6 billion, representing a 21% year-over-year decline. Manufacturing our own equipment provides us with the utmost flexibility to adjust our capital spend based on our visibility of the market. Finally, let me give you some comments on our third quarter operations outlook. My guidance commentary will include the benefit of our lower depreciation and amortization run rate from assets held for sale. Starting with the Eastern Hemisphere outlook, we expect to see a full quarter impact of price reductions, which will affect our third quarter results. We currently expect a low to mid single-digit decline in sequential revenues with margins declining modestly into the upper teens. For Latin America, we also anticipate a modest decline in the third quarter for both revenues and margins. In North America, if we extrapolate the current rig count forward, it suggests that the average rig count for the third quarter should decline by at least 5% compared to the prior quarter. This, in combination with the full quarter impact of lower pricing, leads us to believe that revenues and margins in the third quarter will be under pressure. This pattern is consistent with previous cycles where we typically see at least a one quarter lag when the market is transitioning towards the bottom. Based on our visibility today, we're currently expecting a low single-digit decline in sequential revenues with margins also drifting modestly lower. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff? Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer : Thanks, Christian, and good morning. I'd like to start by congratulating our Eastern and Western Hemisphere operations teams for delivering solid results in a very difficult market. We are the execution company and our guys are flat out executing right now. Internationally, we continue to make progress with our mature field strategy. During the quarter, we completed a successful infield drilling program in Malaysia, while mobilizing for projects in Iraq and Russia. In Mexico, we completed drilling the first well using rigs from our joint venture with Trinidad Drilling, setting a new drilling record for South Mexico Mesozoic basin. We're seeing strong interest from our clients tendering new activity, and the global pipeline of opportunities that we're evaluating continues to be in excess of $35 billion. The deepwater economics were challenged in $100 a barrel and are clearly challenged in the current commodity price environment, which is precisely why we are focused on technology that both delivers better production and reduces the structural cost of drilling wells. This generally means removing complete activities from the work stream. A terrific example of this is how Landmark's DecisionSpace software allows clients to reduce drilling days by integrating geological data with well construction design. In a recent deepwater project, this integration reduced drilling time by 15 days by eliminating one entire directional build phase. In another case, the President of another large client was quoted at a recent conference saying that his company reduced its seismic survey data analysis time by 80% through working with Landmark. The point is that Landmark is making a meaningful contribution to our strategy to lower the cost per barrel of oil equivalent for our clients by eliminating activities and reducing structural costs, while also delivering more productive wells. Another example of technology driving efficiency was the delivery of three Lower Tertiary completions in the Gulf of Mexico using our Enhanced Single-Trip Multizone Packer (sic) [FracPac] (22:25) System. The ESTMZ is proving to consistently reduce rig time in these high cost environments. Turning to North America land, the industry saw a sharp 40% sequential decline in the average rig count during the second quarter. Against this backdrop, let me provide a few data points around Halliburton's operations in the quarter. North America revenue was down 25%. Our stage count was down less than 10%. Average profit per well increased 7% sequentially, and finally, approximately 85% of our active fleet continues to work on a 24-hour-a-day operations. And we believe these factors clearly indicate why operators prefer to work with a more reliable service provider like Halliburton for more complex completions. So now that the rig count appears to be scraping along a bottom, what happens next? The exact timing's difficult to predict, but the previous cycles would point us to the following progression of how the story should play out as we move forward. First, activity stabilizing means the healing process can begin with respect to pricing and margins. This will then allow our input cost savings to catch up, and our efficiency programs and well solutions can begin driving margins up. Price improvement will then be a challenge until we see capacity tightening in the market. Therefore, any margin improvement will likely be the result of lowering our cost base. We stacked a nominal amount of equipment during the quarter and expect to put this equipment back to work when the economics justifies doing so. We currently estimate that approximately 40% to 50% of industry capacity has been idled, although our percentage stack is significantly lower. What's unique about this cycle is how service intensity has evolved since 2013. Over the last two years, average job size has essentially doubled. And at the same time, both average pump rates and pressures are also up. On the plus side, bigger jobs mean more revenues and better equipment utilization for us. The downside is we believe larger completions are taking their toll on pumping equipment. In fact, these factors point to higher equipment attrition rates for the industry. Now, this is precisely why we continue to invest in our service efficiency strategy at Halliburton. Close to 40% of our pressure pumping fleet has been converted to Frac of the Future, with a target to reach 50% by year-end. Our customers appreciate the reliability and efficiency of our Q10 units, and we are pleased with the progress in updating our fleet with this more cost-effective model. In addition, the downturn has allowed Halliburton to retool and improve our maintenance and value engineering processes. The result is that in spite of increasing service intensity, our maintenance cost on a per unit basis is trending down, while our service quality and efficiency are the best in company history, differentiating us from our competitors. And while the market has been myopically focused on service pricing, we know that ultimately, it will be lower cost per barrel of oil equivalent that will carry the day. So to this end, in addition to surface efficiency, we continue to deliver technology to help our customers reduce the structural cost of their wells. For example, the Illusion dissolving frac plug, which we launched in the second quarter, will ultimately eliminate the requirement for coil tubing to mill out plugs. The Illusion frac plug provides high-performance isolation during plug-and-perf operations and functions like a normal plug, meaning it does not require any balls, baffles or any sort of special casing design. When dissolved, it leaves the full wellbore open to maximize production. And I'm pleased to see the growing customer interest in using technology for better well placement and better perforation efficiency. An example of this is our proprietary FracInsight solution, which gathers the necessary logging data, but does it in a cased-hole environment, meaning it does not consume valuable rig time required by open hole solutions. In a joint study with a large customer in the Eagle Ford, FracInsight data eliminated the pumping of unnecessary out-of-zone treatments, which helped reduce stimulation costs by over 35% and significantly improved the cost per BOE equation for our customer. Let me spend a minute on refrac technology in the market. We've been involved in refrac operations for decades, and have executed at least twice as many as any other service provider. Although relatively small today, we believe this market has significant potential in the coming years. So why are customers interested? Early horizontal wells were arguably under-stimulated as stages per well are up more than 30% and proppant per well is up more than double since 2010. What's changed is two key components of technology. First is our diversion chemistry that more effectively stimulates wells, and then second is our diagnostic technology to validate those results. Diversion technology, like Halliburton's AccessFrac, more effectively stimulates the entire lateral through better proppant placement, creates greater complexity within the formation, and helps mitigate well bashing scenarios. Thus far, through our candidate selection process and design, AccessFrac contributes an average of 80% increase in estimated ultimate recovery for our refrac clients, while greatly improving the predictability of results. More importantly, AccessFrac is equally effective as a solution on new wells, improving cluster efficiency and delivering 20% to 25% production increases for our customers compared to offset wells. AccessFrac is becoming a standard process for a growing portion of our clients, and is delivering better production and EURs. Our suite of fiber-optic diagnostic tools, deployed either as a permanent installation or on coil tubing, allows us to monitor individual stage results and validate the treatment performance of our refrac solutions. This means that we can demonstrate that our diversion technology and equally critical delivery process together dramatically increase stimulated clusters along the lateral, thereby maximizing our customers' production and EUR. Though a relatively small market today, we see significant runway for refrac in the future. There's an opportunity to address the needs of operators to increase their production and expected ultimate recovery from the tens of thousands of unconventional wells drilled over the last several years. And we anticipate that customers will begin to dedicate a percentage of their annual spend to refracturing operations. Because of our confidence in our technology and ability to lead this market, we've laid the groundwork to execute large-scale refrac operations through alternative business arrangements. To this end, we're pleased to announce that we have entered into a memorandum of understanding with BlackRock to provide a funding mechanism specifically for refrac projects up to $0.5 billion in capital over the next three years. We're pleased to work with a tremendous partner like BlackRock. This arrangement allows Halliburton to focus on candidate selection, execution, and generating best in class returns, while allowing BlackRock to pursue innovative opportunities with their clients. We've seen it before; our customers in unconventionals are highly adaptable, and they are actively seeking the surface efficiencies, downhole technologies and business arrangements that will make the economics work. When the recovery does come, it's our belief that North America will respond the quickest and offer the greatest upside. And when that happens, we are confident that Halliburton will be the best positioned to outperform in the recovery phase of the cycle. I'd like now to turn it back over to Dave for closing remarks. David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Jeff. To sum things up, this is a damn tough market, one of the toughest ones that I have ever been through. And I don't believe anyone on the call can accurately predict when commodity prices will rebound and rig counts will recover in the U.S. or the international markets, and neither can I. What I do believe is that when the recovery occurs, North America will offer the greatest upside and that Halliburton will be the best positioned to lead the way. We are pleased with the progress of the proposed Baker Hughes acquisition and are working diligently to close this transaction before the end of the year. Looking ahead, whatever shape you think the recovery will take, we have the products, the technology and the management expertise to outperform the market. We have demonstrated this during the previous cycles and have no reason to believe that this cycle will be any different. As we have said, our customers are smart, responsive and adaptable, and we are already seeing that by working together, we can figure out a way to have both of us earn returns for our shareholders even in this challenged commodity market. With that, let's open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. And your first question comes from James West from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. James C. West - Evercore ISI : Hey, good morning, guys. David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Morning. Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer : Good morning. James C. West - Evercore ISI : It looks like contrary to, I guess, popular belief on Friday, you guys did not have to work all weekend to change what you were going to say today, so congratulations on a good quarter. David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, thanks, James. Yeah, I had a stress-free weekend, that's for sure. James C. West - Evercore ISI : Good to hear. A quick question on the North American margins. So, the 300 basis points to 400 basis points of extra cost that you're holding on to right now, is that just Halliburton related costs or are you actually adding to your cost structure in anticipation of the Baker Hughes transaction? And if so, will you have all the railcars to handle those facilities, et cetera, that you need once the transaction closes later this year? Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer : Yeah, thanks, James. This is Jeff. The \u2013 I mean, we have the best operating platform in North America. So when we look at that and anticipate adding a second story basically to the house, our management structure, the operating basis that we have, the logistics infrastructure, including things like Battle Red, and our business development we know are critical to delivering the synergies and delivering them quickly. So as we manage our business, we continue to invest in those things that support that sort of in spite of the market. So the answer is managing our investment in new things, but obviously retaining those things that we know are important. James C. West - Evercore ISI : Okay. Okay. Fair enough, Jeff. And another question, a follow-up for me related to that one. On the synergy number for the Baker Hughes proposed transaction, it sounds like you're very confident still in that $2 billion number. However, both companies have taken cost reduction efforts. Is that \u2013 I mean, are you synthetically raising that synergy number then if you're already \u2013 both companies are already going through cost cutting right now? Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer : Yeah, I mean, that's a way to look at it, but I think what's most important to take away is that the \u2013 while market adjustments are required, we want to be crystal clear that the current activities do not impact our view and confidence in the $2 billion worth of post-acquisition synergies. James C. West - Evercore ISI : Got it. Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Sedita from UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks, guys. Indeed, a solid quarter, particularly given the market. I guess to (35:56) look forward into 2016 on the U.S. pressure pumping market and just your thoughts on the outlook, not thinking about oil prices, but just the outlook for scrapping of equipment by some of your peers, maybe laying down equipment that's going to be cannibalized and not returning. When you think about 2016, how do you think the pressure pumping market will play out ignoring the oil price scenario? Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer : Yeah, thanks, Angie. I mean, 2016 looks better than 2015, but I'd like to reframe your question as how really does attrition play out. And for example, I was just out in the Southern region looking up. When I travel, I look at our locations and competitor locations, and I see more equipment than required showing up on competitor locations to compensate for the lack of maintenance and the lack of capital investment. In some cases, two times as much is what would be required. Now, that's attrition in action. And capacity can tighten very quickly, and we saw that in 2014, how quickly attrition \u2013 or actually, capacity tightened. So, I mean, that's why we're so committed to Frac of the Future. I mean, it clearly performs in the downturn and it's even more valuable as the industry recovers. Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then I was actually kind of surprised on the BlackRock side, the transaction. Can you give us a little detail there, further details on how that will play out, the logistics of the arrangement and just some color? Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer : Well, yeah. I mean, what we see is this is a foundation for growth, and demonstrates our belief that the market grows. And it's clear that the technology enables returns. It also lays the groundwork for us to move quickly at scale. And the short answer is it's set up around a three-year sort of window, I mean, it provides a lot of flexibility for us to act quickly. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Jud Bailey from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Dave, in your prepared comments, you noticed that service pricing is generally unsustainable across all product lines. I was wondering, given the potential for attrition in the industry and given how low pricing is, how do you think \u2013 do think pricing can normalize back up to a more reasonable level before we fully utilize the fleet, given the amount of stacked capacity? Or how do you see that first step in pricing playing out given how depressed pricing is and given how much idle capacity there is? Should it normalize a little bit quicker because there is so much stacked capacity and people are investing in their fleets, or is going to take just as long as it has also prior troughs and up cycles? David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, I think the \u2013 certainly, it's not going to pop back up to where it was even a year ago today. It'll normalize in an incremental fashion, and it's going to be a combination essentially of pricing increases, equalization or equilibrium in terms of equipment across the board, and also allowing the input costs to continue to catch up with where we are. So it's going to be a lot of blocking and tackling, and it's just going to go step-by-step. Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you for that. And then my follow-up is on international pricing. Christian, you noted in your prepared comments that taking into account you have a full quarter of lower pricing rolling through, how should we think about in the fourth quarter, have you already adjusted? Are you already seeing a lot of the new pricing rolling through the P&L? Or are we going to have more of an effect as more contracts reprice in the fourth quarter as well? Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President-Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer : Jud, the fourth quarter, it's still early to call what the fourth quarter will look like, but if you think about it, we will still continue to have pricing pressure impacting the fourth quarter. However, we would have the usual seasonal uptick that we experienced on the \u2013 during the end of the year. Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Is it too early to see if you think those can kind of offset each other by the fourth quarter? Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President-Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer : At this point, we think that the seasonal uptick will offset the \u2013 any sort of additional pricing impact that we might have in the fourth quarter. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International : Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to drill down a little bit further on BlackRock and also kind of broaden the discussion with regard to business models. So with regard to BlackRock, what are they bringing to you that you can't do on your own? Is it simply balance sheet? And then moreover, what exactly are you sort of purporting to do with regard to pursuing the refracs? Are you underwriting the cost of the refracs? Who are you targeting, et cetera? And then secondly, more broadly speaking, in terms of that \u2013 the evolution of your business model, are you willing to put your balance sheet to work and make use of your robust holistic value proposition with regard to underwriting the cost of drilling and completing a well, even a new well? David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Bill, (41:23) questions in there. Let me try to synthesize an answer sort of one at a time. Think about what a service company brings to the table is sort of the people, process and technology. And what we're looking for is sort of revenues and margins today. What a BlackRock brings to the table is they're looking for an income tail that goes out a number of years. So in my view, it sort of dovetails together very nicely. To specifically answer your question, yes, we believe in our technology, we believe in the refrac market going forward, and we believe that we can make a difference. And so we would leverage our balance sheet to ramp that part of the business up. But what BlackRock gives us is an ability to lever beyond that, look at additional ways of doing business with our customers, different business models, push beyond where we have been today or where we might be going in the future. But we're not going to lay those out for you here on the call because I think those discussions are going to be with specific customers in specific circumstances and will remain confidential between us. William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International : Okay. And who are \u2013 what type of customer are you targeting? I mean, it's not, I would assume, just the E&Ps under duress, but who else are we targeting? David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, we're not targeting marginal assets here. We're targeting good sets of assets that for whatever reasons are not being able to get accessed by our customer base today. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes, I want to reiterate great quarter, especially with regard to those international profit margins. I'm curious as to your opinion on when the domestic industry could see some friction in rehiring labor if this recovery gains momentum. I realize that you're in a great position given that you're one of the very few companies that actually has the ability to carry extra labor and extra costs today. So the question for you is really, at what rig count do you think you could see competitors become more aggressive in trying to steal your employees simply because there's a dearth of quality labor on the sidelines? Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer : Yeah, I mean, that's probably less of a rig count question, more of a capacity question as things start to tighten. And I think we've demonstrated through the last cycle, our ability to ramp up very quickly with people. So not particularly concerned about that. Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): For the industry, more broadly though, do you think it would happen this cycle at a lower rig count relative to the past, because \u2013 given the service intensity trends? Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer : Well, I think tightness could occur at a lower rig count most certainly, and I think that the lack of investment in the industry today could drive that tightness at a lower rig count. Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And do you think the equipment burn rate is going to be an issue before labor or vice versa? Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer : I think the equipment precedes labor. Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yes. Good morning. Just a follow-up to the prior question there. In one of your earlier comments, you mentioned that industry capacity for frac are fully (44:50) 40% or 50% excess at the moment. But when you factor in the (44:56) perspective, the attrition, what would you say the net effective excess capacity in the marketplace might be? Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer : I think it's \u2013 Kurt, this is Jeff. I mean, it's \u2013 If you think about attrition, it's happening all of the time, but it's not necessarily apparent all of the time. And by that, I mean it's \u2013 you don't see it until there's a call on the equipment, and we really saw this last time. So as competitors consume more equipment on location to do the work, you don't feel the tightness. But as that equipment is called on for even a little bit of incremental activity, that's when it's seen. So recalculating the 50% overhang is difficult to do until there's a call on it, but we're certain that it's happening today. Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then for my follow-up, Christian was mentioning some continued pricing pressures or lingering effects of pricing pressures going out into the fourth quarter. Just wondered if you might be able to give us some general sense, are the pricing pressures going to be roughly equivalent in North America and international? I would be under the impression that the pricing elements would have largely abated during the third quarter if rig count's going to stabilize. Just give us some more color on pricing dynamics on a regional basis, that'd be helpful. Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer : Well, I think pricing internationally, all the customers ask for discounts, but the reality is there's not much to give. We never recovered from the 2008 cycle internationally. And so the better discussion there \u2013 and it moves to this discussion \u2013 is around how to deliver better efficiency and reduce costs, and that leverages precisely what we do at Halliburton. North America, as we've said, we see the price decline rate, maybe a description, decelerating, but nevertheless, still some pressure as we move through the quarter. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Jeff Tillery from Tudor, Pickering & Company. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. I guess I'm curious to hear how the last few weeks have impacted the customer discussions, whether it'd be \u2013 I mean, I imagine it's mostly focused on North America, but it did feel like completion activity was finding a floor and then the oil price rug gets pulled out from everyone. So I'm just curious how the \u2013 your view around the third quarter has evolved over the last three weeks. Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer : Well, over the last three weeks, it hasn't changed that much. I mean, we think about the rig count, it has puts and takes. And so it was seeing some improvement, but then Friday, I suppose those gains were erased. So I would describe where we are today as scraping along a bottom. And scraping along a bottom means that we don't anticipate dramatic change of any sort, certainly over the very near term. Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: My follow-up just on the profit pressures in North America. Should we expect Halliburton's North American business in Q3 to stay profitable? Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer : Most certainly. Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President-Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer : Right. So, obviously, there's still uncertainty on the depth and length of the cycle. However, we are doing everything possible to make sure that our North America will be profitable. Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, all. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Boyd. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Thanks. So, a lot of focus on the attrition rate in pumping this call, but how about on the demand side? You mentioned that you're seeing the average job size increase significantly year-over-year. How should we think about sort of the pressure pumping intensity of the rig count? Is there a rule of thumb that we should think about? And how is that changing? Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer : Well, the demand for equipment and the \u2013 the increasing demand on equipment is really a function of the increasing job sizes. And so we see more and more of the capital spend on completions, and I don't see anything that dials that back. Obviously, technology that we deliver is focused on making better wells sort of within the current job sizes. So I don't think job size growth is not infinite because it starts to have an impact on neighboring wells and other things, but the quality of the fracs will continue to improve. Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I guess, said another way though, if you think about the job sizes increasing, is there something that we could tie to a rig count? I know the rule of thumb used to be sort of four or five rigs per pressure pumping crew. Is it something lower than that today that you're experiencing in your fleet? Or are the increased efficiencies that you're able to realize offsetting that? Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer : Well, I would think more in terms of well count than rig count today driving completions. And from our perspective, the basis for the Q10 and Frac of the Future is for us to be able to do that, which we are doing with substantially less capital on location. So that's clearly part of our competitive advantage. David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, and I would say just one additional thing is although the rig count has been decimated this year, the rigs that are running today, keep in mind, are the most efficient rigs that are out there. And therefore, they are drilling more wells sort of per rig than we've ever had in the past. So I think the fixation on rig count, yes, it's important to the industry, but I think well count is another thing that folks need to look at and concentrate more on, because it's the well count that ultimately drives how much completion work is done. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Brad Handler from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Bradley P. Handler - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Hey, guys. Maybe first question relating to the international activity. There were some references, maybe several references particularly in Europe/CIS/Africa, related to product sales. Should we read anything into that? Is it \u2013 was there a bit of catch-up from buyers that weren't buying, say, in the fourth quarter of last year in the downturn? But was there some sort of truing up to a normalized level? And I guess what I'm hinting at is perhaps there's some falloff as guys have caught up a little bit in their product purchases \u2013 as your customers have caught up in their product purchases. Does that undermine the third quarter outlook at all? David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No. I think what we're trying to say, service work is fairly consistent and fairly predictable, product sales sort of come lumpy all the time. And so when you get a product sale, it might push your margin and revenues up or down, but I wouldn't \u2013 other than sort of a fourth quarter push around Landmark and things like that, product sales do happen throughout the year. We just like to be transparent and point out when they've helped. But they're going to help nearly every quarter. But it just depends on sort of what the location is, what the geography is and perhaps, in some cases, what the product line is. Bradley P. Handler - Jefferies LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Unrelated follow-up, maybe it's my \u2013 I'm not that strong in the accounting side and I don't want this to devolve to an accounting lesson, but I was a little surprised to see the stoppage of depreciation without things getting pulled into some sort of a discontinued state as the assets were held for sale. Does that happen or what's the trigger point for the businesses to be pulled out and put into a discontinued state? Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President-Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer : Right. So, Brad, obviously, don't want just an accounting lesson, but accounting standards... Bradley P. Handler - Jefferies LLC : Right. Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President-Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer : ...call for a business that planned to be divested to be classified as assets held for sale when they meet certain criteria, and we met those, those are \u2013 there are six conditions. To be reported as a discontinued operation, well, you have to put the results of that business in a separate line item, that business needs to represent a strategic shift by the company, and that's what the accounting standards require. And clearly, this is not the case in this situation because we will continue to be in those businesses for drilling services and drill bits. So our treatment is consistent with other merger situations that require a sale of overlapping businesses. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Rob Mackenzie from IBERIA Capital. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC : Thank you. A quick question for you. Coming back to the North American margin impact, commenting about 300 basis points, 400 basis points of excess cost you're bearing, I guess I'm a little bit curious with your viewpoint for a muted recovery and uncertainty well into 2016. Why carry so much incremental cost here? David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, it's pretty simple. I mean, I think we have a superior delivery platform in North America. We know where we are going to be adding a tremendous number of people and assets to it, and in my view, it'd be crazy to get rid of it. If you look historically, the cost to carry something ultimately outweighs the cost to have to replace it, go out and get people, retrain those people, rebuild your infrastructure and all of that. So it's a decision I made. It's on me if you disagree with it, but I think that it's easily defendable and I think it's certainly the way we need to go here, and I'd tell you, it's going to pay off once we get this deal done. Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC : Great. Thanks, Dave. And then on the international margin (54:51) this quarter obviously up sequentially, I guess, in every geomarket. I get you're guiding that down slightly again going into Q3. Can you give us a little more color on the Q2 performance? Obviously, some of that was the contract status in Brazil and elsewhere, but it seems like there's a fair bit of cost cutting that went into that, that should carry forward, correct? Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer : Yes. The \u2013 I mean, the Eastern Hemisphere team and international group's absolutely executing, and executing on the strategy we laid out, which is to manage costs over the near term, and they have done that, taking out quite a bit of costs, while at the same time, looking through the cycle. And we like the contracts that we've won and we've got some very strategic wins that are continuing to go on in places like Scotland and Brazil and other places. So it's just really just execution, world-class execution in the international business. Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President-Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer : But if I can add to that, in terms of our outlook, our Eastern Hemisphere margins were 19% in the second quarter and we are expecting this to come down a little bit into the upper teens. This would then suggest that our margins are being sustained at a higher level than what they were in the first quarter. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks. Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer : Thanks, Danielle. And I'd like to wrap up the call with just a couple of comments. First, there's no question that this is a tough market. In markets like this, Halliburton's operational execution becomes an even more valuable source of differentiation, which was demonstrated by our second quarter results. I'm confident that our team will stay dead focused on delivering both best in class service quality, along with our long-term strategies in deepwater, unconventionals and mature fields. Secondly, we're pleased with the progress of the Baker Hughes acquisition on many fronts, including the regulatory process and the divestitures. We are confident that we can achieve the cost synergies of nearly $2 billion independent of the current market related actions by either company and are excited about closing the acquisition. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter.\uf02e\uf020 Danielle, please close the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Kelly Youngblood, Halliburton's Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Kelly Youngblood : Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton Third Quarter 2015 Conference Call. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on Halliburton's Web site for seven days. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Christian Garcia, acting CFO; and Jeff Miller, President. Mark McCollum, Chief Integration Officer, will also join us during the question-and-answer portion of the call. During our prepared remarks, Dave will provide an update on the pending Baker Hughes transaction. However, due to the ongoing regulatory review, today we will not be taking any questions today related to regulatory matters. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today include non-GAAP financial measures. And unless otherwise noted in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of these items. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our third quarter press release, which can be found on our Web site. Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave? Dave Lesar : Thank you, Kelly, and good morning to everyone. As expected, it was another very challenging quarter for the services industry. Activity levels and pricing took another hit across the globe, as our customers respond to the impact of reduced commodity prices, and the pressure that their own shareholders are putting on them. Considering the difficult headwinds that were working against us, I'm actually very pleased with our overall financial results for the third quarter, especially for our Eastern Hemisphere operations. Now, let me cover some of the key headlines. Total company revenue of $5.6 billion declined 6% sequentially, outperforming our largest peer. I'm very pleased with the resilience of our international business, where we again outperformed our largest peer on both a sequential and year-over-year basis for both revenue and margins. This demonstrates once again that we are not getting distracted as we go through the merger process, and I'm confident that from what we are seeing in the marketplace, this is the same for Baker Hughes. And despite lower revenues as a result of pricing concessions and activity reductions, we were able to maintain operating margins due to a relentless focus on cost management. As expected, North America revenue and operating income declined further as a result of lower activity levels and pricing pressure. However, relative to the overall market, I am pleased with our performance. From the peak that we saw last November, our completions related activity has declined approximately 18%, relative to a 58% reduction in the U.S. land rig count. This clearly demonstrates the customer flight to quality that has emerged during this downturn, and it positions us well for when the market recovers. And finally, we took an additional restructuring charge to reflect current market conditions. But let me remind you, as we approach the finish line on the Baker Hughes acquisition, we continue to maintain North American infrastructure well beyond current market needs, incurring a cost which we would have otherwise eliminated. This cost impacted North America margins by approximately 400 basis points in the third quarter. Now, turning to operations, in North America prices continue to erode during the third quarter, impacting the total services industry profitability, obviously including ourselves. We believe these prices are clearly unsustainable, but as we have been saying all along, pricing cannot stabilize until activity stabilizes. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, visibility is murky at best. Based on current feedback, we believe most operators have exhausted their 2015 budgets, and will take extended breaks, starting as early as thanksgiving. Therefore our activity levels could drop substantially in the last five weeks of the year. In my 22 years in this business, I've never seen a market where we've had less near-term visibility. In reality, we are managing this business on a near real-time basis, customer-by-customer, district-by-district, product line-by-product line, and, yes, even crew-by-crew. But you know me, and you know our management team. Nobody knows the North America land market better than us. We are the execution company, and we know what leverage to pull to make this market work. Our view is that the first quarter could end up being a mirror image of the fourth quarter. So, just as the fourth quarter is facing a steep drop-off post Thanksgiving, we expect to see a slow ramp up beginning in January, and improving from there, suggesting that the first quarter could be the bottom of this cycle. If you pull back and look at the full year 2016 and compare it to 2015, you could envision a similar mirror image, directionally a slow start and then perhaps picking up speed in the second half of the year. Now, there obviously are a number of moving parts in North America, and I'm not confident enough yet to call the exact shape on this recovery. But we do expect that the longer it takes, the sharper it will be. Until then, we will continue to execute on our strategy, and we will be watching the same external data points that you do : What is happening to oil production? What is the rig count doing? What is happening with operators' cash flows, and how are re-determinations impacting our customers' credit lines? And in addition, we have our own proprietary internal metrics that we will follow. We will continue to adjust our cost structure to market conditions, but to me it does not make sense to reduce costs or infrastructure to reflect expected fourth quarter's reduced activity levels. Instead, we are positioning our North America land business for future success, and to ultimately outperform the industry as the market recovers. Internationally, I remain very happy with where our business is today. The international markets have held up better than North America, but they are not immune to the impacts of lower commodity prices. We did experience lower prices during the quarter, but in anticipation of these reductions we aggressively went after further cost adjustments. And although we had to concede some on pricing, we have worked closely with our customers during the past year to improve their project economics through technology and operating efficiency. Internationally, for 2016, we expect to see a continuation of trends from 2015. Land-based activity, including mature fields should be the most resilient, while we expect offshore to see additional project delays. Now I'd like to provide you with an update on the Baker Hughes acquisition. During the quarter, we announced the second tranche of businesses to be marketed for sale in connection with the acquisition of Baker Hughes, and we expect that marketing process to begin shortly. On the first tranche of divestitures, we have now moved into the negotiation process. On the regulatory front, during the quarter, the timing agreement with the DoJ was extended by three weeks, and accordingly, Halliburton and Baker Hughes agreed to extend the closing date to December 16th. Outside of the U.S., we continue to make progress with completing the required filings, and obtaining the necessary approvals. Specific to the European Commission, we are working cooperatively to respond to their information requests, and expect to resubmit our filing in the near future, which will start the formal review process. Let me be very clear. We remain confident this deal will be approved. We continue to target a 2015 close, but the transaction could move into 2016, which is allowed under the merger agreement. We are enthusiastic about, and fully committed to closing this compelling transaction and achieving our annual cost synergy target of nearly $2 billion. I want to be clear, this $2 billion will be on top of any cost reductions that we've made to date. We are very excited about the benefits of this combination, and what it will provide to the shareholders, customers, and other stakeholders of both companies. This combination with Baker Hughes will create a bellwether global oil field services company, combining our highly complementary suites of services and products into a comprehensive offering that will deliver an unsurpassed depth and breadth of cost effective solutions to our customers. Now, let me turn the call over to Christian to provide more details on our financial results. Christian? Christian Garcia : Thanks, Dave, and good morning everyone. Let me begin with a comparison of our third quarter results to the second quarter of 2015. Total company revenue of 5.6 billion represented a 6% decline, while operating income declined 21% to 506 million. North America led the decline as a result of continued activity and pricing headwinds. For our international business, third quarter revenue declined by 5%, while operating income margins remained unchanged to second quarter levels. The impact of price negotiations with our customers in the first half has been offset primarily by a proactive reduction in operational cost. In the Middle East, Asia region, revenue declined by 4% with a similar decline in operating income of 3%. Lower activity levels across the Asia Pacific markets were partially offset by increased activity in the UAE and Iraq. Turning to Europe, Africa, CIS, we saw our third quarter revenue decline by 7%, with a decrease in operating income of 9%. The decline for the quarter was primarily driven by lower activity in Angola and East Africa. Latin America revenue and operating income both declined 4% during the quarter, driven primarily by reduced activity in Mexico. Partially offsetting this decline was improved unconventional activity levels in Argentina. Moving to North America, revenue declined 7% with operating income at near breakeven levels. Reduced activity levels throughout U.S. land were accompanied by further price reductions across the business, especially in the pumping-related product lines. Globally, the continued activity declines and pricing pressures led us to take additional actions to adjust the cost structure. As a result, we incurred an additional restructuring charge of 257 million after tax in the third quarter consisting primarily of asset write-offs and severance-related costs. As this market plays out, we will evaluate our operations and make further adjustments as required. Our corporate and other expense totaled 58 million for the quarter, and we estimate that our corporate expenses for the fourth quarter will be approximately $65 million. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter came in a bit higher at 29% due to the impact of gains from our foreign currency hedging program. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 26% to 27% for the fourth quarter. Given the ongoing decline in activity levels, we are reducing our capital expenditure guidance by an additional 200 million to $2.4 billion for the year. This represents a 27% year-over-year decline. However, our Q10 program remains intact as we derive significant cost savings from its deployment, and the Q10 provides us the ability to address the higher completions intensity experienced by the industry. Finally, let me give you some comments on our operations outlook starting with our international business. We believe the typical seasonal uptick in year end sales will be minimal this year, as customer budgets are exhausted, and may not fully offset continued pricing pressures. As such, we expect fourth quarter revenue and margins to come in flat to modestly lower, compared to the third quarter. In North America, the prospects of reduced borrowing capacity for operators, and a prolonged holiday season make the fourth quarter challenging and difficult to predict. So far, the average horizontal rig count is down a little less than 10% from the third quarter average. If these headwinds play out, we estimate that the fourth quarter average horizontal rig count could drop about 15% to 20% sequentially. We expect our North America revenues and margins to decline, but we anticipate sequential decrementals to be only in the mid-teens due to our cost reduction efforts. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff? Jeff Miller : Thanks, Christian, and good morning everyone. To begin, I would like to take this opportunity to commend our operational teams for once again executing to our playbook. I am telling you we are not distracted. I particularly like to recognize the performance of our international employees for staying dead focused on our business in a very difficult market. Now, what\u2019s on everyone\u2019s mind is North America. So let me give you a little more granularity on North America by division. Our drilling-related businesses have been much more resilient than our completions related businesses. In fact, drilling division margins increased this quarter to 10%, and this is including the 400 basis point impact of the added cost that we are carrying in anticipation of the Baker Hughes acquisition. Obviously, the most stressed part of our business is pumping. Now, this is the business that we know the best. It\u2019s the business that recovers the fastest. It\u2019s the business that recovers the most sharply, and we know what that path looks like. It looks like this. It looks like staying with the fairway players in the basins that we know. It does not mean chasing every stake. It looks like staying with the customers that are loyal, even if that means working at a price that we don\u2019t like, collaborating on our path forward that lowers their costs per BOE to a place where we can both be successful, and it looks like staying with the overall strategy to focus on long-term returns; meaning, we see a path to profitability. This is a very simple solution, but simple does not mean easy. So if you are looking for a silver lining here, the most competitive piece of the business, pumping, is the one that we know the best. It\u2019s the business that recovers the fastest and the most sharply, and you can be confident that we have the team that gets it done. Last time we reported earnings, oil was in the upper 50s, and the outlook was cautiously optimistic. Since then, we saw oil drop into the 30s, which I can tell you elicited an immediate and visceral reaction from our customer base. And as I described at a conference during the quarter, the rig count followed the oil price down soon thereafter. Now, this has caused us to continue to look carefully and strategically at the business and how we're structured to execute. In the short-term, we further adjusted our operations. Recent actions we\u2019ve taken include partnering with our suppliers to find better ways to work together in these tougher times. Leveraging our logistics infrastructure, including higher rate usage of unit trains, and stacking additional equipment during the quarter where we either were unable to make an acceptable return, or cannot see a path to acceptable returns, and finally, rightsizing the business to reflect current activity levels. Unfortunately, since the beginning of the year, market conditions have forced us to reduce our global headcount by over 21%. Now, these are always tough decisions affecting great people, but they are simply decisions that we have to make. Consistent with maintaining our service delivery model to obtain the cost synergy savings in the Baker acquisition, we\u2019ve taken a bottoms-up look at our service processes, including comparing our current structure to previous similarly-sized markets. This is an examination of how we work. Those things absolutely require to deliver our value proposition, which also means stripping away everything that is not required. For example, in the third quarter, we eliminated an entire level of management in North America. In my view, this is not a one-time initiative. By clarifying and controlling how we execute, we can retain this efficiency, these cost savings as the market recovers. We have a two-pronged strategy. The first part being to control what we control in the short-term. And the second is looking beyond the cycle and preparing for the recovery. Q10 is our great example. The cost savings we derive from these new generation fleets is substantial compared to legacy equipment; 25% less capital on location, 30% less labor on site, and up to 50% less maintenance cost. Q10 spreads now represent close to 50% of our fleet, and we should be near 60% by the end of the year. At the same time, those legacy assets that are still deployed are being strategically placed to maximize our potential in locations, or functions that maximize their cost effectiveness.  While the industry is seeing average fleet sizes increase by 15% to 20% over the last two years due to rise in completions intensity, our average fleet size has been essentially flat as a result of the more efficient Q10s. So when coupled with our logistics platform, we believe Halliburton offers the lowest total cost of service to our customers at any point in the cycle. We are pleased with our customer portfolio. Both in North America and on an international basis, we\u2019ve aligned with customers who have strong balance sheets and assets in the fairway positions in the basins. These are the customers that have better well economics, and are continuing to work through the downturn, and are engaged in the important cost per barrel discussions. Improving a customer's cost per barrel of oil equivalent is core to our value proposition. This is why we continue to invest in technology, and our emphasis is two basic tenants. One is increasing reliability, eliminating moving parts, simplifying designs, and helping eliminate nonproductive time at the well site. The second is making better wells. Products like AccessFrac, CoreVault, and DecisionSpace help customers identify, and access the sweet spots of their reservoirs. And more importantly, these products are seeing increased uptake during this downturn. Adoption of DecisionSpace is up double digits from 2014, for example. And the usage of AccessFrac has grown more than 60% over the last year. There is no question that this is a challenging market today. But our playbook remains the same. We are looking through this cycle to ensure that we will accelerate our growth when the industry recovers. And we are managing through the downturn by drawing on our Management's deep experience in navigating through past cycles. In the long term, we anticipate that unconventionals, mature fields, and deepwater will offer the most significant growth opportunities. That hasn\u2019t changed, although each of these markets faces economic challenges right now. Ultimately, when this market recovers, we believe North America will respond the quickest, and offer the greatest upside. And Halliburton is best positioned to outperform.  Now, I'd like to turn it back over to Dave for closing remarks. Dave Lesar : Okay, to sum up. We continue to make progress with the Baker Hughes acquisition, and we are diligently focused on finalizing all regulatory matters, completing the divestiture process, and preparing for integration activities after closing the deal. We are managing the downturn by executing our two-pronged strategy, getting down to our purest form of cost, while retaining the flexibility to grow in our usual disciplined way, as activity levels recover. For the fourth quarter, there's a lot of uncertainty as we approach the holiday season. But we believe that customer budgets will reload in the first quarter, and anticipate activity to ramp up in the second half of 2016. Looking ahead, we're not going to try to call the exact shape of recovery. But we do believe that the longer it takes, the sharper it will be. And when that recovery comes, we expect North America will offer the greatest upside, and that Halliburton will be best positioned to lead the way. And finally, there is no doubt that this is going to be a bumpy road. But history would tell you that we have outperformed in these kinds of markets, turning them into a new catalyst for growth. We are the execution company. So you can be sure that whatever the market gives us, we will take it, and then take some more. Now, let's open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jud Bailey from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open, please go ahead. Jud Bailey : Thank you, good morning. I wanted to start off by asking about your international margins, where you continue to put up good results in spite of the downturn? Could you give us a little more color, first of all, on the resiliency of your margins, and what you are doing there to keep those at relatively flat levels of 2Q, and year-over-year? And also, how should we think about margin progression internationally in 2016 with pricing continuing to come down and offshore activity probably going to be weak again? Jeff Miller : Yes, thanks, Jud, this is Jeff. Well, look, really these guys internationally are absolutely on top of their business. So they are, you know, as you say, continuing to outperform our competitors in a very tough market, and it really gets down to a couple of things. They are winning the right contracts and they are winning quite a few important contracts in markets that are important to them, and also managing the heck out of their costs. And so -- and this is a team that I fully expect will continue to outperform even when the market starts to recover. Christian Garcia : Jud, this is Christian. Let me take the question -- your question on 2016. If you look at how our margins behaved on a year-to-date basis, our international margins actually had improvement despite revenues lower by 11%. So we actually had incrementals this year. If fact, we are compressed with a margin gap between us and our largest competitor by about 200 basis points in a scenario where our revenues declined less. Now, in 2016, it is unrealistic for us to think that we can continue to see our margin increase or even remain at these levels over the next year, given that we are going to continue to deal with a tough environment. Now, in terms of margin progressions or decrementals, it would be very dependent on the magnitude of the declines between activity and pricing, and it is way too difficult to say at this point, but I will tell you we will continue to aspire to continue to outperform our competition. Jud Bailey : All right, thanks for that. And then I guess my follow-up, maybe for Dave, if I could just follow up on your comment to clarify the mirror image that you see maybe from 1Q relative to 4Q. Do you think we can actually see revenues rebound modestly, it sounds like in the first quarter. And if so, did the margins slip down a little bit more in the first quarter, or do you think they can hold stable with where you come in, in the fourth quarter? Dave Lesar : I think it really depends. Obviously, there has to be, and there will be a budget reload that takes place in Q1. I think the big question mark is how fast do our customers go back to work once they do reload their budgets, given off what we think we will be a relatively low rig count volume in the latter part of the quarter, especially in December. So it really depends on the bounce back, but the cash will be there. And I think one of the things that our customers demonstrate, and believe me, we love all our customers. If they have cash they are going to spend it. And so, really, it depends on how quickly they want to ramp up, but I do think that as we look at the potentiality of Q1, if there is a slow ramp up that gets a little better toward the end of the first quarter, I think that could be the bottom from a margin standpoint then at that point in time. And then my comment about sort of the rest of 2016 for North America looking a bit like a mirror image of 2015, if you get off the mark slow on your spend, then I think it really does come a little stronger in the back half of the year, and that gives us some hope at this point in time. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Sean Meakim from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Sean Meakim : Thank you, good morning. Dave Lesar : Good morning. Sean Meakim : I was hoping, Dave, just to get your perspective, maybe from Jeff as well. Looking at, we've got call it may be at least half or more than half of the pumping equipment on the sidelines these days. Do you have any sense of how much of that equipment is unlikely to come off the fence once there is a call on it? And does the duration of the downturn increase or increase what that could look like in terms of attrition? Jeff Miller : Thanks, Sean. If we look at the amount of horsepower that's idled right now, just on the side lines, about half of it is on the sidelines today in terms of stacked equipment. And that\u2019s equipment that\u2019s not getting any maintenance, and it's being cannibalized for parts. The other factor that we see now, service intensity continues to increase actually on a per well basis. And so, that\u2019s yet again harder on the equipment that is working. So if we look at what\u2019s stacked today, we think about half of that equipment stacked today will not be ultimately serviceable. So that maybe in their estimates four to six million horsepower out of the market in \u201916, and that\u2019s very realistic. If we go back and think about 2013 Q4, we had talked about a 30% or so overhang of equipment then, and that capacity overage narrowed to 5% by the end of Q1 of \u201914. So that didn\u2019t happen in 90 days. That happened throughout that downturn period. So, the takeaway is that\u2019s exactly why we are committed to Frac of the Future, and having equipment in place, it's able to perform in this environment. Sean Meakim : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. I guess just a follow-up on North America. What do you think E&Ps need to see in terms of not just higher oil prices but their perceived sustainability of those higher levels? And if we don't see, maybe the number $60-plus WTI early in 2016, is there a point at which you think that starts to put a second half recovery at risk? Dave Lesar : I think you can -- this is Dave, you can argue all the macroeconomics, where is the breakeven price point. I think it's \u2013- there's really actually, I think, a different way you need to think about the customer base in North America, especially the independent customer base. And that\u2019s essentially with the high decline curves that exist on these unconventional plays. They are really are in drill or die mode. So if you go a year without drilling a well, and your production starts to turnover, you are going to have to start drilling or you are going to have to take your infrastructure apart that you\u2019ve built up as a company. So I think that as we get to the end of the year, if these guys have money, they are going to drill it up, and that\u2019s just the fact that it is. Now, oil is at 60, I think the banks will be more comfortable with extending lines of credit with the debt positions that are there, but I think that the real key is going to be the production declines you see, and when these companies get to the point where they have to start drilling or they have to start dismantling their companies, and they are not going to want to do that. Operator : Thank you. And your next question from David Anderson from Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. David Anderson : Thanks. So in regards to your cost control efforts, you mentioned on the call, removing an entire level of management in North America. That got me thinking here can you may be expand a bit in terms of what this redundancy was, and perhaps maybe with some of the other opportunities to remove fixed costs from your system? Jeff Miller : Yes. Thanks. As we look at how we do business, we get a lot of opportunities to clarify precisely what are those moving parts. And so as we look at what\u2019s absolutely required to deliver in terms of span and control, and oversight of process execution, it became clear that there was a service line component in North America, an entire layer that we were able to remove. This is really -- we can do that, because of the discipline that we have around how we execute process. And as that has continued to tighten, we\u2019ve actually seen at into the downturn, service quality getting better, not worse. And that\u2019s unusual actually going into a market like this. I attribute that to the discipline around execution. And so that then allows us to remove that layer as we -- so that\u2019s that that thought. If we think about other opportunities, we are constantly evaluating things that we can do to take cost out of our business, and this is in North America and the rest of the world in terms of maintenance process, value engineering exercises, kaizen events. So we are highly engaged in looking at those opportunities. David Anderson : So as it relates to -- as you're saying the nearly $2 billion in cost synergies after closing Baker Hughes, I was just curious if that, what you just talked about, impacts that $2 billion number at all? Obviously market conditions have deteriorated. So I assume there are some give and takes around that figure. Can you maybe provide a little bit of color around maybe some of the expectations of how this changed at all or maybe are there more opportunities or is there maybe a little bit less opportunities considering the market has shifted obviously? Dave Lesar : No, I mean we are absolutely confident in the synergies of nearly $2 billion that we\u2019ve talked about, and I say that because those aren\u2019t synergies associated with necessarily the market-related taking out a layer at Halliburton that we were talking about. These are more around changing basic ways that we work that then drive meaningful, sustainable savings. And they range -\u2013 won't give you too much granularity on them, but it is the way that we, for example, plug into North America's supply chain being an example of that. I mean, that is a very valuable asset that immediately allows cost savings that are very sustainable. We can think about the same things in technology in a lot places around the company, where changing the way we work together is actually going to eliminate that, the bigger piece of cost. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Angie Sedita from UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Angie Sedita : Thanks. Good morning, guys, and good job on international. It's pretty impressive. So if we think about North America, and if we go back to actually about 2012, when we had significant overcapacity and pressure pumping, and you think about going into 2013 and 2014 we had no movement in price, but you saw steady increases in your margin on activity gains, and increasing utilization. So if we think about the cycle, and then Jeff you made the reference that you see the path for a return of profitability in North America, so if we think about this cycle going into 2016 and 2017, have you guys have done some work to think through where you need to be on utilization or even a rig count to get back into those high single-digit margins, and even move back into the double-digit margins, could you then see high single-digit margins at 1,100 to 1,200 rig count, assuming we get there in 2017? Dave Lesar : Thanks, Angie. Yes, I mean the playbook as I described is as simple, but not easy. And it means that we stay with the customers that can be efficient -- that want to be efficient, and that are in the fairways. We stay in the basins where the efficiency matters, and by matters, I mean it always matters, but it matters the most to us when it creates a critical mass that allows us to leverage up on the volume and take advantage of our lowest unit cost delivery. And then finally, there's clients with the sense of urgency. And by sense of urgency, I mean the urgency to keep the equipment working, which ultimately does drive outsized profitability for Halliburton. And so with activity, I see the same the path as we saw before. That hasn\u2019t changed at all. Angie Sedita : All right. So your thought would be, we could move back to those single-digit margins, high single-digit margins even in a muted recovery, in 2016 going into 2017, even double-digit margins? Dave Lesar : Yes, absolutely. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from James West from Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. James West : Hey, good morning guys. Dave Lesar : Hi, James. Good morning. James West : David or Jeff, you guys talk to your customers every single day. And I'm curious about how those conversations are evolving, given that the vast majority of them are facing production declines next year. And, Dave, I know you highlighted you either dismantle your business or you drill, but is there some percentage of the companies out there that are willing to allow production declines in '16, and not get after it? Dave Lesar : So, I think it really depends on what their bankers are going to let them do or whether their stock price has reasonably well held up in this market. Obviously, some of our customers had their share prices just crushed, and some have pulled back, but also to the point where they do believe that maybe they can go back in the market for equity if there is a more optimistic view of where WTI prices are. I think the customer discussions are really -- we\u2019re going to wait and see right now, but we are going to reload our capital for next year. Some of them are talking about getting back to work as early as January, coming off a Q4 lull, and some, I think, are going to take a bit of a wait and see, but I think very, very few of them, and certainly I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had a single discussion where the customer are going to let themselves get into a position of a meaningful decline in production before they figure out a way to start drilling again. And then there is another group of customers out there that really view that there is a subset of the customer base that will not get access to money, that will see a decline, that have good acreage, and they are going to be absolutely juicy takeover candidates at that point. So I think it's just we just got to wait and see the -- these re-determinations are going on, and it looks, generally to me, like it\u2019s a sort of kick-the-can-down-a-road approach that's being taken at this point. But that really just pushes the day of reckoning into sort of the first quarter of next year. But the reality is that the strong customers are going to survive. They are going to have money, and they\u2019re going to drill at some point next year. James West : Got it. And then a follow-up for me on North America; pricing, obviously visibility is not great, so pricing is still a little sloppy here. But at what point do you say, all right, enough is enough, we're not going to go down further, or I guess the flipside is the attrition rate is picking up pretty quickly with your smaller competitors. At what point can pricing does not drop because the competition has basically gone away? Jeff Miller : Yes, well, the -- yes, when we look at -- I won't give you a price, James, on the call, but what I will tell you is that we look at a number of factors when we look at customers challenging as it is right now. And so, I\u2019ll give you not the price, but I will talk about the factors. So we absolutely look at the efficiency as clearly a component of how we look at pricing. It\u2019s also again customers and basins where we not only see resilience, and customers able to execute. So it\u2019s not so much a number though we have taken equipment, and we have that equipment in 2015 when we got into situations where it simply did not make sense to put equipment to work. Dave Lesar : Yes, I guess let me just add to that. I mean there is the point that, yes, we have walked away from work and are walking away from work every day. However, there are some key customers as Jeff said in key basins that have been very loyal to us, and we want to stay loyal to them. We know they are going to survive. We know they have good assets. We know they are going to get a budget reload, and we know that they want to take advantage of the services pricing that's out there today, even if I don\u2019t like that service pricing, it is there. It\u2019s a fact of the market. This is a long-term game we are in. These are long-term customers we have. We typically make good money from them in good times, and I\u2019m not going to walk away from them in the kind of times we are in today because it will pay off in the long run, and I think that\u2019s in my view the smart way to approach this. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Bill Herbert : Thank you. Jeff, or Dave, can you just comment a little bit and/or question with regard to you've given a pretty Darwinian outlook for the fourth quarter in North America, but D&E so outperformed that expectations in the third quarter. Do we see similar resilience in the fourth quarter, or how should we think about that? I mean, C&P is clear, but how should we think about D&E for North America in Q4? Jeff Miller : I think the -- Bill, this is Jeff. Q4 right now is murky across the piece, and I think it's the unrealistic -- if clients stop working at the thanksgiving, if we look back to 2012, there was significant slowdown around thanksgiving that sort of continue through to the New Year. It would be hard to imagine that D&E is immune to the same activity slowdown. That said, although what it does emphasize is sort of the bifurcation in the marketplace, and how stressed pressure pumping is today. And that\u2019s why I get back to -- and I have a lot of confidence in our team, and our team knows how to manage through market like this. Bill Herbert : Okay. And question with regard to -- I think I heard you say $2.4 billion in CapEx for 2015, and how should we think about free cash flow generation and working capital harvest for the next few quarters? Christian Garcia : For the next few quarters, our year-to-date cash flows has been impacted by a couple of things, Macondo legacy payment with restructuring and acquisition-related cost. But if you look at our historical seasonality in cash generation, we typically do not generate a lot of cash in the third quarter anyway. But we generate the majority of our cash for the year in the fourth quarter. So we anticipate that our historical seasonality will hold true for this year, and expect to generate cash in the fourth quarter. So in terms of CapEx, as we pointed out, 2.4 billion took out another 200 million, but as we reiterated in our prepared remarks, we are still committed to the Q10 program. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Scott Gruber : Yes, good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, but I had one on the agreement that you guys executed with BlackRock to execute refracs in the US. Can you just provide an update on that? What's been the reception from the E&P community, and has capital been put to work? Jeff Miller : Thanks, Scott. The reality is this is a very small piece of the market certainly today with effect to refract. That said, we are finalizing terms on a deal under that arrangement. I think the real story -- the real and probably more important story is around the technology, the diversion capability, and how that applies not only to refrac and to new wells and how that\u2019s able to improve production to make better wells. The other thing that when we look at refrac is we see it really more as a portfolio approach to asset management, meaning, it\u2019s in the toolbox, it\u2019s something important that clients can use to better manage pressure in the field, pressure sinks, and the relationship between parent wells and daughter wells. So, the takeaway though is that the technology and the funding are both in place and we are well prepared for that as -- or to the extent that it does develop. Scott Gruber : And as you look out into 2016, do you see an environment where pumping demand could do better than the horizontal rig count for the market as a whole, given some incremental refrac demand and incremental demand to draw down on the drilled but uncompleted? Jeff Miller : Yes. I mean when we talk about -- when I think about drilled but uncompleted is arguably deferred revenue, and it makes sense to do when rigs are contract and a company is trying to converse cash. Nevertheless, those are there in the ground and they are ready source cash flow, and so, I think they may end up a little bit uncoupled from the rig count, per se, just because it\u2019s there and needs to be done. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Tillery from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Jeff Tillery : Hi, good morning. Christian, I just have one question around the near-term. You talked about North America relatively harsh year-end, but also relatively shallow decremental margins. So I'm just curious how you manage costs in the near-term to achieve those shallow decrementals. Christian Garcia : That\u2019s right, decrementals are 67% in the third quarter and we are guiding to a decrementals in the mid-teens in Q4. Well, the reason for that is most of the cost reductions that we did were towards the end of the quarter, savings of which did not have a material impact in the third quarter. So we expect those savings will be in the fourth quarter, and that\u2019s why we expect to see a drop in decrementals quarter-over-quarter. Jeff Tillery : Thank you. And then just you talked a little bit prospectively about the international margin outlook, but I was just curious of the pricing reductions internationally that have been agreed to to-date, how much of that would you say was realized in the Q3 results? Is it more than half, less than half; just looking for a ballpark? Jeff Miller : Yes. I mean in terms of -- these are negotiations that seem be that are ongoing, and so, round one arguably occur early in the cycle, actually much was stressed even at 100 in deep water. And so, this has been an ongoing discussion of both negotiation and re-tendering of work. So what we talked about in the last quarter probably a quarter has been -- a quarter to a half has been absorbed during the current quarter though as long as we see pricing -- commodity pricing, where it is, and delays in terms of activity, I wholly expect we will continue to see this. Now, the better discussion that we have with clients is around how to do drive efficiency and how to use those things that are in our value proposition around increasing reliability and reducing uncertainty to help lower their overall cost, and I would say I am pleased that we are having more discussions that look like that with clients as they realize that they reached kind of limits around what\u2019s available in the service sector. Dave Lesar : Yes, I think -- and let me just add a little bit more color to that, because I think it\u2019s important to sort of sit back and understand where does the customer have a leverage point in these negotiations. So if you go back to a -- let\u2019s say U.S. horizontal unconventional well, and it costs a dollar, about -- say about $0.70 of that dollar is focused on the completion, particularly the frac. So that\u2019s naturally where customers have gone in terms of the pressure to reduce cost. If you go to an offshore kind of a project, the cost is really in the E&C cost, it\u2019s in the day rate and the drilling rig, and other services work that we do is maybe 20% of that. And so, the leverage point that customers have gone for there, and obviously you all follow the sector, has been to the day rates on the drilling contractors and to the E&C companies with a discussion with us on services rates, but we are not the sort of cost tail wagging the dog on the offshore stuff. It\u2019s really the other guys, and that\u2019s really where the pricing leverage has been directed initially. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Dan Boyd from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Dan Boyd : Hi, thanks. So Dave, it sounds like you don't expect a lag between higher oil prices and activity in North America. But what's your best guess on the lag between higher oil prices and the first quarter we may see higher international activity? Dave Lesar : Yes, that\u2019s a -- it\u2019s actually a great question, and I don\u2019t know the answer to that, but it will be a longer lag, mainly because you look inside of the two sort of I guess tranches of customers internationally. The NOCs have not pulled back as dramatically as the IOCs have, with respect to their deepwater projects. And so, the NOCs I think will -- if you think about sort of a slow wave up and down, I think that\u2019s what you are going to see, but I think that if you look at the economics of deepwater development, I believe the IOCs are going to have to be convinced that not only are the prices at a point where these things can at least cash flow in the long run that they see an upward trajectory in oil prices that they can make a return on these deepwater projects over a period a year. So, it's certainly not going to be the first quarter or two of high oil prices before you see a bounce back in the actual contracting for revenue and the offshore. You might see some feeds startup. You might see some pre-engineering startup. You might see project planning starting up. And all of that would be good, because it\u2019s a sign that they are thinking about going more and quickly into the deeper water, but it's going to be several quarters and it really is going to be building confidence back up in the IOCs that the market is there for the long run. Dan Boyd : Thanks. Then just the follow-up would be of the three international regions is there one you would expect to respond more quickly? Jeff Miller : Probably, I could see response in West Africa pretty quickly, the infrastructure is in place. It\u2019s not as hard to startup there as it would be maybe in some other markets, but again the -- there certainly would be the lag that Dave is describing. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from James Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. James Wicklund : Good morning, guys. The Middle East has been one of the better markets for everybody for a while and Saudi always gets mentioned. You guys have a lot of exposure there. There were reports out yesterday, this morning that Saudi like every other oil company I guess out there is being slow to pay its bills. But when we hear that from Saudi we get a little bit more concerned than your credit checks on E&P companies. Can you tell us if you're being impacted by that in Saudi or anyplace else in the world and the implications for that? Christian Garcia : Jim, as a just general statement, that we are seeing lengthening of payment patterns from our customers, whether it\u2019s in the Middle East or everywhere else, but I am just happy to say that when you look at us versus our peers, our day sales outstanding continues to lead the pack. James Wicklund : Okay, but you don't have any particular issues in Saudi? Christian Garcia : No. No, we don\u2019t have \u2026 Jeff Miller : No, I mean I wouldn\u2019t point to anything there. James Wicklund : Okay. My follow-up, Jeff, getting to double-digit margins by late next year gives me some idea of this, but you make some pretty good points about changes in prices in cost and structural. How much do you think -- and if we assume 30% just as a rounding point, there's been 30% cost deflation to an E&P Company, how much of that 30% do you think will end up being structural several years from now and how much of that will end up being cyclical? Jeff Miller : Yes, that\u2019s a great question, Jim. I think if the margins are at the tail, the beginning and ending tail, you see sort of dramatic behavior. So I think that, you know, that has not been given away. I think that the path sort of more in the middle will be retained when we get back in balance here with the service companies. So the short answer is I think we keep most of that. We do get most of that back under the right conditions, but the very right hand side of the upper limits that we saw even going back to 2012, and 2009, '10, '11, those sort of numbers -- we stay more sustainable higher margins based on how we execute, how we take off that out of the system, and that maybe preferentially better performance by Halliburton around those things. Dave Lesar : So, I guess the only thing I would add, Jim, is to the extent we have seen any structural change that we have given up to our customer, we will take the same structural change out of our supply chain. And so, hopefully would end up basically net even. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I would like to now turn the call back to management for any closing remarks. Jeff Miller : Yes, thank you, Danielle. So I'd like to wrap up this call with just a few key takeaways. First, the pumping business in North America is clearly the most stressed segment of the market today, but it\u2019s also the market that we know the best. We know our approach works when the market turns, and it will. This is the segment that we expect to rebound the most sharply. Second, we are maintaining our North American infrastructure required to accelerate delivery of the Baker Hughes acquisition synergies at a cost of about 400 basis points. And then finally, our international franchise continues to deliver market-leading performance on relative basis both year-over-year, and sequentially in a tough, tough market. So I look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Danielle, you can close out the call. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Kelly Youngblood, Halliburton's Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Kelly Youngblood : Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton fourth quarter 2015 conference call. Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Christian Garcia, acting CFO; and Jeff Miller, President. During our prepared remarks, Dave will provide an update on the pending Baker Hughes transaction. However, due to the ongoing regulatory review we will not be taking any questions today related to regulatory matters. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risk and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today include non-GAAP financial measures and unless otherwise noted, in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of these items. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our fourth quarter press release, which can be found on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave? Dave Lesar : Thank you, Kelly and good morning everyone. I want to begin with a few of our key accomplishments in 2015. First, total company revenue of $23.6 billion declined 28% year-over-year, outperforming a 35% decline in both the average worldwide rig count and global drilling and completion spend. And even though it was a very tough market, I am pleased to say that once again, we outpaced our peer group in North America and internationally both sequentially and on a full-year basis. I am especially pleased with the resilience of our international business, despite lower revenues as a result of pricing concessions and activity reductions, we were able to improve operating margins during the year due to a relentless focus on cost management. We also outperformed our largest peers sequentially and on a full year basis in both revenue and in margins. And in North America, of course, it was beyond a challenging year where we saw unprecedented declines in activity. However, relative to the overall market, I am pleased with our performance. From the 2014 peak, our completions-related activity declined approximately 33% relative to a 64% reduction in the US land rig count. This clearly again demonstrates the customer flight to quality that has emerged during this downturn and positions us well for the market's eventual recovery. Now I would like to provide you with an update on the pending Baker Hughes acquisition. During the quarter, we announced that our timing agreement with the Department of Justice expired without reaching a settlement or the DoJ initiating litigation. In December, the DoJ informed us that they do not believe that our previously announced proposed divestitures are sufficient to address the DoJ's concerns, but acknowledged that they would assess further proposals. With respect to the European Commission, the review has entered phase 2, which was anticipated and we recently advised the commission that we plan to formally propose remedies which we believe should satisfy any competition concerns. Earlier this month, Halliburton presented to the DoJ an enhanced set of proposed divestitures in order to seek their approval of the transaction. We also informally notified the EC and other jurisdictions about the enhanced divestiture package. The sales process for the planned divestiture continues and we are in discussions with interested buyers. There is no agreement to date with the DoJ or EC as to the adequacy of the proposed divestitures. Our conversations with the DoJ and the EC and other enforcement authorities continue with the desire to resolve their competition-related concerns as soon as possible. Now I want to be clear that we remain committed to seeing this deal through despite the extended time required to obtain regulatory approvals. Now while it is taking longer than originally expected, we believe the compelling strategic and financial benefits for our shareholders inherent in this combination continues to remain intact. We strongly believe that the proposed merger is good for the industry and for our customers. The combination is expected to create an even stronger company and achieve substantial efficiencies, enabling us to compete aggressively to provide efficient, innovative and low-cost services. Completion of the transaction would allow us to better meet our customers oil services needs and help them operate more cost effectively, which is increasingly important due to the current state of the energy industry and oil and gas prices. Finally, we agreed with Baker Hughes to extend the period to obtain required regulatory approvals to no later than April 30, 2016, but remain focused on completing the deal as early as possible. In the event regulatory approvals have not been received by April 30, the merger agreement does not terminate automatically. Both companies may continue to seek regulatory approval or either company may terminate the merger agreement. Now, let me discuss what we're seeing in the market today and our prospects and challenges for the coming year, and then Christian will discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail. Now this has certainly been the most challenging downturn that I've seen in my many, many years in business. We expect the market will continue to remain challenged in 2016 and that it will be the first time since the late '80s that global upstream spending will decline for two consecutive years. Commodity prices have been a moving target, forcing our customers to be cautious in providing visibility to us and their shareholders into their 2016 capital expenditure plans. Although we do not believe current oil prices are sustainable, they are without a doubt negatively influencing customer plans in the near term. On a geographic basis, North America is expected to be the most impacted in 2016. Third party surveys have also been a moving target, indicating a year-on-year decline in service spending from 30% up to as much as 50% and that's on top of the estimated 40% decline in industry spend in 2015. But the reality is, due to the macro uncertainties, many of our customers are managing their businesses in real time, rig-by-rig. Accordingly, we are going to take this market week-by-week and in some cases crew-by-crew. This is unlikely to change until our customers have confidence in a sustainable and economical oil price. Now there are a number of moving parts in North America and my experience has taught me not to bet on the exact timing of a recovery. But we do expect that the longer it takes, the sharper the recovery will be. Until then, we will continue to execute our playbook and adapt our cost structure to market conditions, while also positioning our North America land business for future success and ultimately to outperform the industry as the market recovers. The international markets held up much better than North America in 2015, but they are also not immune to the impacts of lower commodity prices. Recent third party surveys for international spend indicate a decline that may be up to 20%, which will be slightly worse than last year. We're working diligently with our customers to improve economics of their projects through technology and operating efficiency, but do expect margins to be negatively impacted by lower activity levels and pricing pressures throughout the year. Now looking at our geographies, we expect activity in the Middle East, Asia region to again be the most resilient in 2016 as recent mature field project awards throughout the Middle East are anticipated to move forward. However, we expect Australia, India and other markets across Asia to be impacted by reduced customer spending and delayed projects. Europe/Africa/CIS is also expected to experience activity declines across the entire region in 2016 with the most vulnerable areas being the North Sea and Angola where the offshore markets continue to face extremely challenging economics. Customers are focused on reducing their cost structures through more efficient well design and the adoption of new standards for production systems. But these are structural changes that will take time to fully implement. And in Latin America, we expect lower activities across the region with the largest declines projected in Brazil and Mexico as a result of significant NOC budget constraints. Latin America is currently expected to have the largest percentage decline within our international markets. So in summary, 2016 is simply going to be a tough slog through the mud, but I can tell you we'll do what we have to do. We know what buttons to push and levers to pull and we will. We believe our customers will remain focused on cost per barrel optimization and gaining higher levels of efficiency, both of which bode very well for Halliburton. Now it is very difficult to predict the exact timing, but once the market has visibility of the trough the recovery will come into view and when it does, we expect the recovery will play out very similar to others where North America will rebound first and the strongest, followed by the international markets where the rebound will be more methodical. Now let me turn the call over to Christian to provide more details on our financial results. Christian? Christian Garcia : Thanks, Dave and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a comparison of our fourth quarter results to the third quarter of 2015. Total company revenue of $5.1 billion represented a 9% decline, while operating income declined by 7% to $473 million. All regions experienced revenue declines during the quarter led by North America as a result of continued activity and pricing headwinds. For our international business, fourth quarter revenue and operating income declined by 5% and 10% respectively as a result of price concessions and activity declines with our customers during the quarter. Additionally, due to customer budget constraints, we did not see the typical benefit from year end equipment and software sales. In the Middle East, Asia region, revenue declined by 5% with a similar decline in operating income of 6%. Lower activity levels in Saudi Arabia and Iraq led the decline, partially offset by modestly higher sales in China and increased activity in Kuwait and Oman. Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, we saw the fourth quarter revenue decline by 6% with a decrease in operating income of 18%. The decline for the quarter was primarily driven by a sharp reduction of activity in the North Sea, partially offset by higher activity in Angola and Algeria. Latin America revenue and operating income declined by 6% and 9% respectively driven by reduced activity throughout most of the region, partially offsetting this decline was improved activity levels in Mexico. Moving to North America, revenue declined 13% with operating margins improving by approximately 160 basis points. Reduced activity throughout the US land was the primary driver of the revenue decline, especially in the pumping-related product lines. The margin improvement was primarily due to a spike in year end completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico, which is not expected to repeat in the first quarter. Margins also benefited from our aggressive cost-reduction efforts and minimal weather disruptions during the quarter. Our margins continue to include an elevated cost structure in North America in anticipation of the pending Baker Hughes acquisition. For 2015, our total company decrementals were about half of the previous cycle due to actions we've been taking to adjust our cost structure throughout the year. In the fourth quarter, we incurred a charge of $192 million after tax consisting primarily of asset write-offs and severance-related costs. As industry fundamentals continue to weaken, we will continue to make further structural adjustments and may incur additional charges in the first quarter. Our corporate and other expense totaled $70 million for the quarter, excluding costs related to the pending Baker Hughes acquisition. We anticipate that our corporate expenses for the first quarter will be approximately $70 million, excluding acquisition-related costs and this will be the new run rate for 2016. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of approximately 19% includes a retroactive benefit from Congress's recent approval of the Federal Research and Experimentation Tax Credit. As we go forward in 2016, we are expecting the first quarter and full year effective tax rates to be approximately 24% to 25%. Given the ongoing decline in activity levels, we further reduced our capital expenditures as we exited the year, ending 2015 with a total CapEx spend of $2.2 billion. Our current guidance for 2016 capital expenditures is $1.6 billion. This CapEx guidance includes the continued conversion of our fleet to Q10 pumps to support our service efficiency strategy, which is critical in this environment. We also expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $1.9 billion for 2016. This is the first time in over a decade that our CapEx is lower than our expected DD&A expense, which demonstrates our commitment to live within our cash flows during this challenging period for the industry. Turning to our operational outlook, the severity of the activity decline in the coming year continues to be unclear, but let me give you some comments for the first quarter. Our first quarter international results will be subject to weather-related seasonality that occurs in geographies such as the North Sea and Russia, exacerbated by the uncertainty around customer spending levels for the coming year. Although difficult to predict at this point, we anticipate first quarter Eastern Hemisphere revenues to decline sequentially by a low double-digit percentage with margins similar to the first quarter of 2015 levels. In Latin America, we anticipate revenues to decline sequentially by a mid-teens percentage with margins retreating to the upper single digits. In North America, we also have limited visibility, but estimate that first quarter revenues will decline with the US rig count, which is already down double digits against the fourth-quarter average. We currently anticipate margins to come in at around breakeven levels. And finally, we enter 2016 on a solid financial position with strong liquidity, which will enable us to address the current market challenges and be well positioned for the industry's eventual recovery. Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff? Jeff Miller : Thank you, Christian and good morning, everyone. To begin, I'd like to take a moment to congratulate all of our front line people for delivering solid fourth quarter results in a tough market. As Dave mentioned earlier, we're expecting 2016 to be a very challenging year due to poor commodity prices and shrinking customer budgets. We believe that as the coming cycle unfolds, we'll see a continuation of what began in 2015, customers seeking efficiency gains and discrete technology to help them bend the cost curve. At lower commodity price levels, we believe the market will continue to evolve in this direction and customers will adopt products and services that help them produce wells with a lower cost per barrel of oil equivalent. Now this plays directly into Halliburton's strengths, helping our customers become more efficient on location can maximize their production, all of which contribute to lowering their unit cost per barrel of oil. So regardless of the commodity price, we're continuing to execute on our proven two pronged strategy in this downturn. The first part being to control what we can control in the short term and second is to look beyond the cycle to prepare for recovery. And with respect to the short term, this means making the tactical changes necessary to right size the business to the market. We revisited our cost profile throughout 2015 and made significant changes to help mitigate the impact on our operating margins and we'll continue to do so. It started with where we were. We systematically reviewed profitability at a granular, sub product line level. This resulted in the consolidation of facilities in more than 20 countries around the world and closing down operations in two countries. And finally, current market conditions forced us to reduce global headcount by 25% in 2015, a necessary but very unfortunate reality. The second part of our strategy is to look beyond the cycle and ensure the long-term health of the franchise. For example, aligning ourselves with the right customers, investing in technology and staying dead focused on superior execution. In terms of customer portfolio, we work to align ourselves with customers that have stronger balance sheets and fairway acreage in the basins. In North America, our top 17 customers make up 50% of our revenue. When the downturn began, these customers were among the last to lay down rigs. Today, we're collaborating with them on ways to lower their cost per BOE to a place where we can both be successful, and when the recovery comes, we believe that these operators and therefore Halliburton will be best positioned for the upside. In terms of technology, 2015 was a successful year, despite the downturn in activity, we saw an uptake of new technologies such as DecisionSpace and RockPerm helping customers maximize production and lower their cost per barrel of oil. A recent addition to our custom chemistry portfolio is our MicroScout service. MicroScout is a hydraulic fracturing treatment designed to deliver proppant into far field micro fractures enhancing the productive life of new wells. Early trials have indicated more than a 20% uplift in production compared to offset wells. Now technologies like MicroScout represent years of research through a disciplined, multistage, gate program and although I typically spend more time talking about execution and how we get things done in the field, it's important to point out that we're executing in the technology side of our business as well. Through joint reach projects with our customers and by elevating field developed solutions, Halliburton is among the more efficient innovators in any industry. Last year, Halliburton secured new patents at an R&D cost of less than $1 million per patent. In terms of R&D patent efficiency, which is central to the return on intellectual property, Halliburton is in the same range as other top global US patent leaders. And finally, superior execution. Service quality is a frequently underappreciated piece of our business, but I can tell you that in a market like this a timely efficient job can be the difference between an economic well and an uneconomic well. So for many markets, contract extensions and project awards are influenced by service quality or simply put, it's how we distinguish ourselves to win and retain the work. Now looking at 2015, it was an extremely strong year for the quality of our operations. This was our third straight year of improvement in both safety and service quality metrics, both of which saw significant double-digit reductions from 2014. Even while the market is forcing us to streamline our footprint in the field, we're improving our performance rates, essentially doing more with less and doing it better. We're refining our processes and systems, eliminating everything that's not required to deliver our value proposition. You'll be hearing more about this throughout 2016 as this is not a one time event. It's the relentless focus on efficiency and process improvement that makes us the execution company. We believe that these elements, our strong customer portfolio, our efficient technology spend and our superior service quality provide a strong foundation for our business. We are confident that by executing on our strategy and building on the successes, we can continue to outperform our competitors both during the downturn and when the recovery comes. Now let me turn the call back to Dave for his closing comments. Dave? Dave Lesar : Thanks, Jeff. Let me sum it up. As I said, 2016 is shaping up to be one tough slog through the mud and the industry is going to have to take it a quarter at a time. We have a seasoned management team and a proven playbook that has served us well during previous cycles and we're entering the year from a position of strength with a solid financial position. We are focused on maintaining a strong customer portfolio, investing in more efficient technology and delivering reliable, best-in-class service quality for our customers and are preparing the business for growth when the industry recovers. And as we demonstrated this year whatever the market gives us we will take it and then take some more. And finally, we remain fully committed to closing the pending acquisition of Baker Hughes. We are diligently focused on the regulatory reviews, the divestiture process and planning for integration activities after we close the deal. So with that, let's open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from James West from Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. James West : Hey, good morning, guys. Dave Lesar : Morning, James. James West : So Jeff, really impressed with the international operations in 2015, I mean, growing margins, outperforming on the revenue decline. Obviously, there's a lot of cost management going on there. Could you maybe highlight a little bit further how you guys were able to outperform and what '16 looks like in terms of your ability to continue to outperform? Jeff Miller : Yes. Well, thank you, James. It really is around aggressive cost control. And we've been outperforming for a number of quarters. This looks like winning the right contracts and managing the heck out of the costs most certainly and it's also a mature field strategy in action. I mean, a big piece of this is mature fields and where we see the benefit of scope, scale and that clarity of strategy, it's a recipe for success. So really pleased with the performance and that team is right on top of their business. James West : And you think that out performance could continue as we go through '16? Jeff Miller : Yes. So if we look at '16, I mean, it will be a tougher slog in '16, no question. I mean, we're seeing fairly constant pressure around negotiation and tenders. But, in some cases, we are having what I would say positive collaborative discussions with clients around how to reduce uncertainty, increase system efficiency. So certainly pleased with our performance right now. James West : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jud Bailey from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Jud Bailey : Thanks. Good morning. Follow up question on some of the international commentary earlier, specifically Latin America. I think there was a sequential revenue decline somewhere in the mid-teens. Christian or Dave, could you maybe give us a little bit of color, is that based on activity declines, is it pricing, both or do you have any other major projects that may be rolling off? Just maybe a little more commentary over what's driving Latin America at least in the first quarter? Christian Garcia : So in Latin America, if you look at our sequential declines, it was 6%, down 6%. It was driven by almost all countries except for Mexico. Now on a product line by product line basis, we had actually good Landmark and Baroid. However, we also had some expenses associated with our vessels in Mexico. Dave Lesar : Maybe one further comment. I mean, across the piece it's a tough slog in Latin America. Nearly every country is facing some sort of particular challenge, whether it's macroeconomic or just pure facing down commodity price, which is an example for a Colombia for example. So we're seeing historical lows in terms of rig activity in a couple of countries and I don't see that changing. Jud Bailey : Okay. I guess I was more referencing the first quarter, some of the commentary. I think - didn't you say, Christian, mid-teens sequential decline for revenue? Christian Garcia : Yes, that is absolutely correct. And it's because of the macro headwinds that Latin America is facing. As Dave pointed out, Latin America will probably be the most challenged international region that we have and it's particularly acute in Mexico and Brazil. Jud Bailey : Okay. All right. And my follow-up, Dave, maybe if you could maybe talk a little more about North America and I guess specifically the nature of discussions with customers and maybe how those are evolving with commodity prices to start the year. They are obviously going through a number of different budget initiatives. Maybe you could talk a little bit about any visibility that you have or don't have and kind of what customers are communicating and how they are thinking about the first half of 2016 in North America? Dave Lesar : Yes, I mean, I'm talking almost every day with the CEOs of our customers and I would say that it's a real challenge out there. And I guess the way I would sum it up is there is sort of a constant revision of budgets going on and those revisions are clearly with a downward bias. So the way I would describe it is, right now, our customers don't know what they are going to spend, where they are going to spend it and when they are going to spend it in North America at this point in time, which is why I made the comment earlier we really are trying to run the business on literally a week-by-week, crew-by-crew, unit-by-unit basis until our customers see some stability in pricing where they can then put a stake in the ground. But until they can put that stake in the ground, we're just going to have to remain very flexible and I like our chances in that kind of a market. Jud Bailey : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Angie Sedita from UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Angie Sedita : Thanks. Good morning, guys and certainly I echo James comments on a very impressive quarter and year given overall market conditions. Dave Lesar : Thank you. Christian Garcia : Thank you. Angie Sedita : So a little bit of granularity on the US pressure pumping market. In the past, you've done some work on the potential level of attrition, specifically for pumps and engines versus fluid ends, so any color further on the attrition side? And are you starting to see a change of behavior by the small pressure pumpers where they are starting to become more aggressive in either pulling out of the market or on the cost side or can they? Jeff Miller : Angie, this is Jeff. Attrition is really the story here and consistent with remarks before, we see today about half the equipment is idled. That's equipment that's not being maintained and is being cannibalized for parts more broadly. The service intensity, believe it or not, continues to creep up. So we saw a 9% sequential increase in profit pumped on a per well basis, which means equipment is working harder than it ever has. We estimate 4 million to 6 million horsepower that will be out of the market by the second half of 2016. My gut says we're at the top end of that range right now. And this is really why we're committed to Frac of the Future. I mean, it's the cost of the pump and it's the total operating cost of the equipment that matters in my view the most and that's what will have Halliburton best positioned for the recovery. Angie Sedita : Okay, very, very helpful. And then any change in behavior with the small guys given where their margins are and overall profitability or status quo with what you saw in the second half of '15? Jeff Miller : Yes. I mean, we don't see ourselves as competing with that group, but they are certainly aggressive in the marketplace. We haven't seen them back off. But, again, this is the reason why we have strategically invested in Frac of the Future and surface efficiency and then the custom chemistry that we deliver. I talked about some of that in my earlier comments, I mean, those are the things that differentiate Halliburton. Angie Sedita : Okay. Perfect. And then as an unrelated follow-up, on the merger, obviously, you can't talk about the regulatory process, but, Dave and Mark, you've commented in the past that you've reiterated your confidence on the cost synergies with Baker cutting pretty aggressively as well on the cost side. Can you talk about the cost synergies, your confidence there into 2016, '17? Dave Lesar : Angie, I don't want to elaborate anymore, but the cost synergy story stays intact. Angie Sedita : Okay, perfect. Thanks. I'll turn it over. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Dave Anderson from Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Dave Anderson : Great. Thank you. So you mentioned several mature field projects in the Middle East, I think, you said are poised to move ahead. How do you think the Baker Hughes transaction is having an impact on bidding of this type of work? I guess I'm just kind of wondering, with the uncertainty around the divestitures it must make it a bit challenging for both you and your customers in terms of putting together and evaluating bids. Can you just talk a little bit about how this is being handled? Dave Lesar : Yes. Dave, as you can appreciate, I don't think we want to go there. Dave Anderson : Okay. Dave Lesar : They still compete with us. We're still running our companies separately and they are in the market making their own pricing decisions and where they tender and how they tender and we don't have any visibility into that. Dave Anderson : Okay. On a separate subject on North America, on your North American margins, I noticed the D&E margins in North America improved quite a bit this quarter. C&P was more or less as expected. I think you said in the release it was something to do with offshore. Can you expand a bit, obviously, it wasn't the completion sales. Can you talk a little bit about what's going on? Is that a trend we should be expecting and maybe kind of your outlook on how you are seeing the Gulf of Mexico this year? Christian Garcia : So on your question around D&E, D&E was also benefited from obviously aggressive cost reductions, as well as Baroid and Landmark had good quarters. In terms of just the overall completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico, as we pointed out in the prepared remarks, we don't expect that to repeat in the first quarter. Dave Anderson : Okay. Jeff Miller : I think it's important, let me just follow that up because our D&E business is executing really well. I mean, those guys are dead focused on winning the right contracts. We're seeing the benefit of a lot of work in key markets for all of our D&E service lines. Dave Anderson : Do you think you can keep those margins where they are over the next couple quarters in D&E? Christian Garcia : Well, we're taking it one quarter at a time and we'll just have to see. Dave Anderson : Fair enough. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Bill Herbert : Thanks. Good morning. Dave, with regard to your cost structure, I mean, you extolled an exceedingly realistic outlook for 2016, international down as much as 20% and North America down anywhere from 30% to 50%. And given the adjustments that you've made over the preceding two quarters, are you right sized for this expected level of activity in 2016 now? Jeff Miller : Yes, Bill, this Jeff. I mean, we are always reducing costs and so as Dave described, it is a moving target. But there are still a number of areas where we continue to work on reducing costs, both at the variable cost, as well as around some of those sustainable fixed cost items like refining our maintenance processes takes out cost, value engineering exercises that are taking place. We, in one case took more than 20% of the cost out of 20 products. So we're constantly, as I say, reviewing the structure. But I do believe these are things that best position Halliburton for the recovery. Bill Herbert : Okay. And two housekeeping items for me to sort of end it, magnitude [ph] to Gulf of Mexico year end completion tool sales and then also depreciation, why is it going up when your capital spending is going down by as much as it is in 2016? Christian Garcia : Well, it was because of additional CapEx, right. So obviously, there is a layering effect on the CapEx. On your first question, what was the first question again, Bill, on the completion? Bill Herbert : Gulf of Mexico year-end sales, what was magnitude [ph] Christian Garcia : We're not going to provide that sort of detail. As I pointed out in the prepared remarks, the margin increase in North America has been due to both the completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico and also the impact of cost reductions that we did at the end of the third quarter. To give you just a little bit of additional color, the sequential decrementals for the US land in the fourth quarter was in the very low single digits. So as you can see, there has been a significant contribution from the cost cuts that we did in the third quarter. Bill Herbert : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Scott Gruber : Good morning. Dave Lesar : Morning. Christian Garcia : Good morning. Scott Gruber : I want to circle back to the international margin risk as this is very top of mind for investors currently. Obviously, your margins have proven very resilient, so kudos to you and your team. But this does lead some investors to believe that your clients abroad will simply continue to ask for larger and larger concessions until you're down to very thin margins. Can you just comment conceptually on why this risk is low to help allay these fears in the marketplace? Jeff Miller : I think the investment internationally, at least by Halliburton, we were always sizing largely to the market that we saw. It's a little bit different than maybe what we saw in North America. And so I think that our ability to pull levers internationally in key markets is probably more focused. The - and again, I think the ability to size as we move along will bode well for us. Dave Lesar : Yes, I think, let me just add a little color to that. Of course the way you do business between international markets and the US market is also quite different. With the drilling and completion efficiencies that we've gotten in the US, the time to drill and complete a well has been dramatically reduced, which means the time between when you can price what does a frac cost or what does drilling cost or what does a mud job cost is very dynamic, very real time and it's very transactional. The international market still continues to be a long-term contract market. So the discussions that you have with customers around price concessions and scope changes is typically done within the context of an existing long-term contract, which gives you more of a seat at the table and more of an ability to convince the customer that what you're delivering is adding value or that you have ideas where their contracts can get more efficient and therefore reduce their cost per BOE. And customers always have the ability to go out on tender, but those things typically take a while to come to fruition. So I think really the velocity by which business is done in North America is quite faster than it does in the international market. And therefore, I think the margins will stay up at a higher level and not be compressed down to US levels. Scott Gruber : That's good color. How should we think about the contract real risk then over the medium term, especially in light of these pricing concessions? So if I recall, the contract role risk was material last recovery period. The starting point for pricing was obviously very high going into 2009. But just given the renegotiations that are ongoing today, does this minimize the contract role risk as we think about potential recovery in '17, '18? Jeff Miller : I think the - this is an international question? Scott Gruber : Yes, focused on international, yes. Jeff Miller : Yes, and so one of the things that we typically see internationally obviously that cycle lags the US cycle. And again these are also economies, in many cases, that are built around production of oil and gas. And so from an activity perspective, they tend to be, on a relative basis, more resilient. The second thing it does is it does provide the opportunity to better manage the work with some visibility, which helps us support margins and the second work with clients who are committed to a level of activity to then optimize that level of activity and that serves, I think, both our customers and us. Scott Gruber : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Boyd from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Dan Boyd : Hi, thanks. Dave, can you update us on your mature field strategy, the opportunities you are seeing in this market? And then, sort of specifically, maybe tie that to Latin American margin projections going forward. I was under the assumption that mature fields was becoming a bigger piece of the pie in Latin America. So I'm wondering if once you adjust cost to the lower level of activity, can we actually see margins trend higher after the first quarter? Dave Lesar : Thanks. These are a good opportunity and we're seeing more of them. But I would say they are still on a relative basis a small part of our business. Market conditions are creating demand for these sorts of investments, but clearly they bring a different risk profile. And so with that, they've got to have some key criteria like good rocks, good terms and service pull-through. And so when we look in a commodity price like the one today, these projects will be more challenged. And what happens in those is we'll slow down activity around those the same as any operator would. Dan Boyd : Okay. And then unrelated follow up, but can you give us an update on the additional costs you're carrying in North America in preparation for the Baker acquisition? Christian Garcia : The costs associated with the service delivery platform that we're keeping intact remains essentially the same in the last two quarters. It ran somewhere between 300 to 400 basis points and it remains at that level in the fourth quarter. Dan Boyd : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Kurt Hallead : Hey. Good morning. Dave Lesar : Good morning, Kurt. Kurt Hallead : I was curious on the CapEx front at $1.6 billion, how would we characterize say maintenance as a percentage of that? Christian Garcia : We really don't look at it that way. Most of the maintenance expenditure is actually expensed and as such our CapEx is pretty much based on the line of sight contracts and also the implementation of our strategic initiatives like the Q10. Kurt Hallead : Okay. And then you expect that $1.6 billion - I know there is a lot of change in the marketplace, clearly, but that $1.6 billion, you feel confident is based on existing contracts and not much movement on that going forward? Christian Garcia : Yes, yes. Let me give you kind of an indication of how we run our capital program. Our capital program, as I said is based on line of sight contracts, as well as the implementation of strategic initiatives. But as you know, we manufacture our own equipment. That gives us really a good ability to ramp down and ramp up depending on the market conditions that we're seeing. So if you recall, in 2015, we began the year with guiding to flat CapEx to 2014 and ended up being down about 30% versus 2014. So that manufacturing capability has become a significant advantage here in this environment. So the fact that we can ramp up and ramp down, we're going to adjust our CapEx program depending on the market conditions that we're seeing in 2016, and if we do so, we will communicate that to the street. Kurt Hallead : All right, thanks. And then a follow-up would be you mentioned, Christian, North American decremental margins in low single digits during the fourth quarter. Do you feel you guys are at a point where the combination of your cost-reduction efforts. And maybe good handle on where this market may be heading is that the decrementals you would continue to expect in North America as you move forward? Christian Garcia : Well, we take it one quarter at a time, Kurt, if you think about Q1, if you look at our decrementals for the whole year in 2015, it was - for North America it was about 40%. And if you do the math implied by our guidance for Q1, the sequential decrementals would be less than that, which incorporates the lower activities from a continuing decline in the US rig count, as well as not having the completion tools repeat in the first quarter. So we're taking it one quarter at a time. Kurt Hallead : Okay. That's great color. I do appreciate it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Sean Meakim from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Sean Meakim : Hi, good morning. Dave Lesar : Good morning. Christian Garcia : Morning. Sean Meakim : On your international margin performance, I was just trying to look at it a little bit differently. I'm curious how much of the mix shift between offshore and onshore and spend the last couple of years has helped your margins and how that could be a benefit going forward? Jeff Miller : I think it's more of a shift between exploration and development may have a bigger impact than maybe onshore or offshore. Onshore is certainly an important and growing piece of our business in certain markets. But when we get to not only drilling, but also completions of the development space is right in our wheelhouse and we've seen, as the markets have contracted, quite a move that direction. Dave Lesar : If I can add to that, if you look at where Europe, Africa would have the most concentration of offshore is really the weakest. However, we also saw out performance in that region and the Middle East, Asia has the highest concentration of mature fields and we also outperformed in that region. So both regions have been outperforming both on the onshore and offshore segments of our business. Sean Meakim : Right. Those are fair points. Thank you. And then just back to North America. On Frac of the Future, do you guys have an update of where your Q10 mix stands today and what you think it would look like at the end of the year based on the new CapEx guide? Christian Garcia : Right. At the end of the year, we had about 60% of our fleet is Q10, so actually that's higher than what we've guided during our Analyst Day. We said 50% by the end of 2016. We are at 60% right now and based on our capital plan, it should reach close to 75% by the end of 2016. Sean Meakim : Perfect. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Michael LaMotte : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Dave, I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on the comment in the press release about the CGG collaboration? What is entailed in that agreement and where you think it goes? Jeff Miller : Yes, this is Jeff. Look, we're excited about that arrangement and we think it's a great combination. A couple of points though, I think it demonstrates the value of DecisionSpace and its ability to adapt to and help in seismic interpretation. It also, I think, the relationship advances our position there and our access to data to further develop fab software and serve a broader group of customers. The other thing that it does from our perspective is it puts us in the seismic interpretation part of that business where we believe it is - where there is a lot of value, but then keeps us out of the seismic acquisition business. Michael LaMotte : Is there any potential pull-through on other services you think once you are in the door at the interpretation level? Jeff Miller : Well, I think that we'll work together. But I think the ability to advance the software and have bigger data sets to work with will always pull through, probably more in the software space than more traditional services. But clearly we believe this is a positive move by Landmark. Michael LaMotte : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jim Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Jim Wicklund : Good afternoon, guys. Dave Lesar : Good afternoon, Jim. Jim Wicklund : How long will it take the industry to respond if oil prices one day were to go up and activity one day started to move up? How long would it take the industry to recover 15% of activity in terms of people, but industry overall? Jeff Miller : Jim, this is Jeff. I'd love to have that conversation with you. I think that it would be a real mix of response and by that I mean the service industry broadly has been beaten up pretty good at what we believe are unsustainable prices. But I think from our perspective, at least at Halliburton, I'm confident that we would respond quite quickly. If you recall, it was just 2014 when we hired more than 20,000 people onto the payroll at Halliburton. And then the way we're taking care of our equipment now, I talked about the maintenance processes and the Q10 pumps, our ability to respond would be fairly quick. Jim Wicklund : Okay. I appreciate that. And you talk about slower velocity in the international sector. We've seen guys like Chevron and obviously Pemex in Brazil cut CapEx. Usually they are done, like I said, more on a lower velocity level, more annual, longer-term contracts. How soon US onshore can react immediately. How long will it take the NOCs and IOCs to start to pick up activity, will it take an annual turn? Jeff Miller : Yes, again, you're right that that velocity is slower, but at the same time it doesn't slow down as quickly. So typically, we have seen that about a six-month lag behind the US internationally in terms of activity build, though it just tends to be more stable. A lot of government approval is required and partner requirements to get that ramped up. But inside of existing projects, I would say within six months to a year that activity could pick back up. Jim Wicklund : Six months to a year, okay. My unrelated follow up, how many lower tertiary completions do you expect to do this year versus how many did you do last year? Jeff Miller : Look, again, a bit of a moving target, so I won't comment. If you think about it though as the lower tertiary is certainly a positive piece of our business. We love our position there with our ESTMZ and some of our other capability in the lower tertiary. Jim Wicklund : Okay, gentlemen. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Rob Mackenzie from Iberia Capital. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Rob Mackenzie : Great. Thanks for fitting me in guys. My question, I guess it's for Christian on receivables. Can you give us a feel for how much of your receivables might be with E&P companies that are distressed or at risk of being distressed to get a feel for the risk we might see for capital accounts? Christian Garcia : As Jeff pointed out in his prepared remarks, one of the key tenets of our strategy is customer alignment and based on that, the concentration of our customer in North America, 17 customers represent 50% of our revenues and those are the largest companies with better balance sheets that can withstand this downturn. Now, as such, we don't have much exposure to the smaller guys, not to say that we're totally immune. But there is much, much lower than other service providers in the market today. Rob Mackenzie : Okay. And my related follow-up I guess would be a similar question internationally, vis-\u00e0-vis, NOCs such as PDVSA, Pemex, et cetera? Christian Garcia : Absolutely. There is no question they have been slow paying. In fact, if you look at their base working capital, that's gone up. Good to say that we lead in that metric and I think we've widened the gap against our peers. But in terms of international, those are the largest companies in the world and we don't expect to have issues there as well. Rob Mackenzie : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I would now like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks. Jeff Miller : Okay, thank you, Danielle. So I'd like to wrap up the call with just a couple of key points. First, we continue to manage the near term, controlling costs, while managing to our clients' fluid capital spend outlooks. Second, we remain committed to positioning Halliburton for the recovery, which means delivering efficient technology that lowers the cost per BOE for our clients, while aligning with those clients with stronger balance sheets and fairway acreage positions. I thank you. I look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Danielle, you can close out the call. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Halliburton First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Lance Loeffler Halliburton's Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Lance Loeffler - Vice President, Investor Relations, Halliburton Co.: Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton first quarter 2016 conference call. Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Christian Garcia, Acting CFO; and Jeff Miller, President. During our prepared remarks, Dave will provide commentary on the termination of the Baker Hughes transaction. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today include non-GAAP financial measures and unless otherwise noted, in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of impairment charges and other costs. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our first quarter press release which can be found on our website. Now I will turn the call over to Dave. David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Lance and good morning everyone. Our prepared remarks today will be brief, leaving more time for the question-and-answer period. We would like to start by providing some background on our mutual decision with Baker Hughes to terminate our merger agreement. From the time we announced the deal in November 2014, we knew that putting together two companies with the global size and scale of Halliburton and Baker would be no small task. But we believed that we could close the deal and do so in a timely manner because it truly made sense. We expected the deal would create compelling benefits for the stockholders, customers and other stakeholders of each company. The potential annual cost synergies were substantial and the transaction was expected to be accretive to cash flow and earnings within only a couple of years. In addition, the transaction would have allowed us to further reduce our customers' cost per barrel of oil equivalent. This was truly a great deal. One that was unanimously approved by each company's Board of Directors, and overwhelmingly approved by each companies' shareholders. Unfortunately, things have changed quite a bit since we signed the merger agreement. From a regulatory perspective, we completely understood that the transaction would draw regulatory scrutiny and that substantial divestitures would be required to obtain regulatory approval. However, obtaining the U.S. anti-trust approval of large complex business combinations, regardless of the industry, has become increasingly time intensive and difficult, as evidenced by the termination and litigation of several other large proposed transactions over the last 16 months. We continue to believe the proposed Baker Hughes transaction would have been pro-competitive, that our proposed divestitures were more than sufficient to address any regulatory concerns and that the position taken in the U.S. Department of Justice's lawsuit and the European Commission statement of objections, are incorrect. We also continue to believe that the transaction would be good for the industry and customers, particularly now at a time when customers are focused on lowering costs per barrel of oil equivalent. However, the DOJ's lawsuit and EC's statement of objections, combined with the elongated review process in all jurisdictions, created substantial hurdles with respect to timing and deal certainty. We would also like to correct a misimpression about the proposed divestiture package that may have resulted from the statements made during the DOJ's April press conference regarding the lawsuit. We proposed to the DOJ, a divestiture package worth billions of dollars that we believe would facilitate the entry of new competition in markets in which products and services are being divested. And we had buyers expressing a strong desire to acquire those businesses. The proposed divestitures where, for most part, divestitures of complete worldwide product lines including employees, management teams, business development personnel, manufacturing, R&D facilities, intellectual property portfolios, and customer contracts. They addressed most of the markets alleged in the DOJ complaint. We believe that the proposed divestiture package was sufficient to address the DOJ's specific competitive concerns. In addition to regulatory matters, the unprecedented deterioration of the oil and gas industry decimated the economics of the deal. During the pendency of the deal, the WTI price of oil has gone from over $76 in November of 2014 to a low of just over $26 in February of this year, while the global rig count has gone to a 17 year low and you all know what's happened in North America, where each week we seem to hit new historical lows. As a consequence, the aggregate quarterly revenues of Baker Hughes have decreased nearly 60% from $6.6 billion for fourth quarter of 2014 to $2.7 billion for first quarter of this year. Given the abrupt and deep downturn in the oil services market, we were unable to obtain adequate value for the businesses we proposed to divest. This, coupled with the decline in each company's business, eroded the expected synergies and accretive aspects of the transaction, including the timeline to integrate the businesses to levels which we believe severely undermine the originally anticipated synergy benefits of the deal. As a result, it became clear that continuing to pursue the transaction was no longer in the best interest of our stockholders, despite having to pay the termination fee to Baker Hughes. Moving forward with the transaction did not make sense in light of the elongated regulatory scrutiny, the projected timelines for closing the transaction, the poor deal economics and the current market environment. Now, to be clear, we recommended this transaction to our board and to our shareholders for approval. We believed trying to do this transaction was worth the risk because of our strong belief in our strategy, process, employees and management team, but it wasn't to be. There is no doubt we are disappointed and I want to thank both our employees, as well as the employees of Baker Hughes for their tireless efforts throughout the regulatory process. But you know what? We are Halliburton. And we will continue to provide the same innovative services and products that we've delivered to our customers for more than 97 years. We have a world-class management team, who has industry knowledge and experience to drive value for our shareholders. Prior to the potential transactions, we were in a strong number two position in the market with a proven successful strategy of gaining market share through outperforming against the rig count and having among the highest margins and returns in the industry. We were successful in executing that strategy and knew our process was scalable to a larger company. That fact has not changed. If we had been successful, adding the Baker Hughes assets would have given us that scale quickly. But our strategy has not changed, we still expect to outperform the rig count, we plan to scale up our product service line capability by addressing one product line building block at a time through internal growth, investment and selective acquisitions. Going forward, we will strive to deliver the same predictable, reliable execution and industry-leading growth, margins and returns from our world-class employees and management team. Over the past 18 months, despite our intensive efforts to close the Baker Hughes transaction, we have been executing on our key strategic areas and adapting to the new reality that we face in a very difficult market. Compared to where we were a year-and-a-half ago, we have outperformed our peers, both in North America and internationally. In the first quarter, we addressed some of our access infrastructure costs that we were carrying pending the Baker Hughes transaction. We will now move aggressively to remove the remainder of those costs from our operations over the next couple of quarters. I am very proud of the outstanding operational and customer focus our employees have kept during this entire process. Their dedication, resiliency and hard work are the foundation of our company's strength and why together we can and will weather any challenges that we face. Now let me turn the call to Christian to provide some financial details. Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President of Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Dave, and good morning everyone. Let me start with a summary of our first quarter results. Total company revenue came in at $4.2 billion, which represents a 17% sequential decline compared to worldwide rig count decline of 21%. We experienced weakening activity levels and pricing concessions during the quarter along with seasonal weather disruptions in the North Sea and Russia. At this point, our overall decremental margins have been less than that of the previous cycle despite this downturn being deeper and longer. We've provided financial comparisons of our first quarter results to the fourth quarter of 2015 in our April 22nd press release and we would like to refer you to our commentary in that release. Due to our ongoing restructuring efforts, we've revised our financial reporting presentation to only furnish overall regional results and global division results and we will no longer provide divisional results by region. For Completion and Production and Drilling and Evaluation segments, we will only provide total global results for each segment going forward. In the first quarter, we recognized a restructuring charge of $2.1 billion after tax to further adjust our cost structure to market conditions. This charge consisted primarily of asset impairments, including most of our non-Q10 pressure pumping equipment, as well severance costs. As Dave mentioned, in the coming quarters we will continue to make further structural adjustments including the remaining escalated cost structure we've kept in North America. Further, in accordance with accounting rules, we no longer classified our assets included in the proposed divestitures as assets held for sale at the end of the first quarter. As a result, in the first quarter, we incurred an after tax charge to recognize the depreciation related to these assets that had been suspended since April of 2015. Beginning in the second quarter, our operational results will include the depreciation expense from these assets. Our corporate and other expense totaled $46 million for the first quarter excluding costs related to the Baker Hughes transaction. We anticipate that our corporate expenses for the second quarter will be approximately $50 million to $55 million excluding acquisition-related costs we incurred in April and this will be the new quarterly run rate for the rest of 2016. Our first quarter free cash flow was negative $355 million driven by about $250 million of restructuring payments and acquisition -related costs. We continue to commit to living within our cash flows for the year and given the ongoing decline in activity levels, we've further reduced our capital expenditure plans for 2016 to approximately $850 million. We've been disciplined in the deployment of capital equipment during this downturn and expect to reduce our CapEx spend by approximately 75% compared to 2014. Depreciation and amortization for the first quarter was $346 million. For the second quarter, we expect depreciation and amortization to be about $400 billion as a result of recommencing the depreciation for the assets that were previously classified as held for sale, the impact of our multi-year reduction of capital expenditures and the impairments we have taken. In conjunction with the termination of the Baker Hughes transaction, $2.5 billion of debt that we issued in late 2015 will be mandatorily redeemed. At the end of the first quarter, we had $9.6 billion of cash and equivalents available taking into account the debt redemption plus the $3.5 billion termination fee, we would still have had approximately $3.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We also have $3 billion available under our revolving credit facility which with our cash balance provides us with ample liquidity of $6.6 billion to address the challenges and opportunities of the current market. For modeling purposes starting in the second quarter we will begin reflecting the incremental interest expense on the debt taking into account the redemption of $2.5 million. As such, our estimated net interest expense for the second quarter will be approximately $165 million and the quarterly run rate interest expense for the second half of 2016 will be approximately $155 million. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 23%. Our income tax expense for the second quarter will be impacted by several factors including recognition of the incremental interest and higher depreciation, the statutory rates for the various geographies where we expect to generate income or losses, and any discrete tax items. These factors will lead to a high degree of variability on our effective tax rate. Based upon our current forecast and expected earnings mix we anticipate that we will recognize approximately $10 million to $15 million of tax expense in the second quarter. Turning to our operational outlook, the market dynamics continued to make forecasting a challenge, but let me provide you with our current thoughts on how we see the second quarter shaping up. The following regional guidance comments reflect the higher depreciation expense. In the Eastern Hemisphere, we anticipate second quarter revenues to come in at similar levels as the first quarter, but with margins lower by 300 basis points to 400 basis points due to the impact of ongoing and expected pricing concessions and additional depreciation. In Latin America, we expect an upper single digit decline in revenues with margins declining by approximately 200 basis points to 300 basis points from the first quarter levels. In North America, the U.S. land rig count is already down 23% compared to the first quarter average and has continued to deteriorate week after week. As is typical, we expect our sequential revenue decline to outperform the rig count by several hundred basis points and anticipate that our decremental margins will be approximately 25% in the second quarter. Now I'll turn the call to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff? Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director: Thank you Christian and good morning everyone. Before anything else, I'd like to thank each of our employees for their focus on execution in spite of the distractions presented by both the marketplace and current events. We are the execution company. As we've announced, we're sizing our cost structure to the market conditions we're experiencing. I remain confident that when the market activity stabilizes margins can start on the road to recovery. We've had a dedicated team focused on the Baker transaction which freed the rest of us from distraction and gave us the ability to aggressively pursue our corporate strategy. We've prepared the franchise to deliver industry-leading growth and returns when we exit this down cycle. Halliburton is the execution company and led our peer group in returns throughout this most recent cycle. Our strategy remains focused on what our customers value most highly. Maximizing production at the lowest cost per BOE. Clearly, this is a dynamic formula depending on where we are in the cycle. Today, there's no doubt that the numerator, meaning cost, has most of our customers' attention. Cost is something we can control and we do it well at Halliburton and I'm pleased with our progress. We've consistently delivered the strategy for two components. First, converting customer insight into cost effective solutions and second, by providing reliable service quality. Our capabilities and our execution culture are built around systematically collecting insight from our customers on their operational challenges and collaborating with them and within Halliburton to design the programs and technology to solve their economic and technical challenges. For example, during the first quarter we delivered production maximizing gravel pack chemistry for a major deepwater customer. However, instead of executing from a costly stimulation vessel, we were able to deliver the job from a substantially lower cost supply vessel by employing modular pumping equipment. The second component, executing reliably on our solutions is something Halliburton does well and our customers appreciate. Our concentration on executing key processes has realized a multiyear double-digit service quality improvement, a demonstration of our clear focus on the lowest cost per BOE in action. And finally, closing the loop on our performance is where I focus my attention every day. This is execution meaning getting things done. Are we delivering what we promised to our customers? And how do we tighten our unique fit around collaboration, technology and service quality while systematically reducing our cost and capital requirements to deliver the growth and returns we expect. This is an ongoing effort and recent example of this is our North American restructuring where we removed a layer of management. Now, this has changed our cost profile certainly but also simplified and improved our internal collaboration and execution. Commodity prices in markets will move up and down, but the one thing about which I am certain, one thing that won't change over time is that the lowest cost per BOE wins. We believe our collaborative approach to converting client insight into cost-effective solutions and our focus on reliable execution will consistently deliver the lowest cost per BOE and allow our customers to make better wells and be more successful over time. We continue to believe that the longer it takes for the recovery to occur, the sharper the recovery will be. And that North America represents the greatest upside and that Halliburton is positioned to outperform. Now, I will turn the call over to Dave for closing comments. Dave? David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Jeff. Let me sum things up. We are disappointed in the outcome of the Baker Hughes transaction, but we are not going to do a deal that is not economic for our shareholders and we are confident that our focused strategy will allow us to continue to outperform. Given our market outlook, we made significant changes to the fundamental cost structure of the business which, we believe, will help protect margins in the near term and drive outsize incrementals going forward. This market has generated a sense of urgency in many of our customers and we are having better conversations with them around improving their cost per barrel economics. And ultimately, we believe that when this market recovers, it will be North America that responds the fastest, offering the greatest upside and that Halliburton will be positioned to outperform. Now, let's open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. One moment for questions. Our first question comes from Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. You may begin. Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you, good morning. David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : A question, maybe for Jeff, maybe circle back a little bit, you touched on it in the opening comments, but the elevated cost structure you were carrying waiting for the Baker acquisition to close, could you maybe talk a little bit more and quantify that the cost cutting opportunities you see, the timing it could take to whittle that down? And I guess also, is some of that included in Christian's guidance for the second quarter margins? Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director: Sure, Jud, thanks. Let me provide you with some color on where we are regarding cost savings. In North America, we've been carrying around 300 basis points of added costs, which we started to dismantle in Q1. Now that process is going to continue through the end of the year and we expect to eliminate 100 basis points per quarter. Now that's just in North America. So we're also looking at doing the same in the Eastern Hemisphere and Latin America as well as in all of our product service lines and corporate structures. So we're scrutinizing every cost, from manufacturing, to supply logistics, to field operations and we're doing this on a global basis. So, overall, we'll be reducing our structural costs by about 25% or maybe said another way, we'll lower our annual run rate on costs by around $1 billion by the end of the year, but with little of that happening in Q1. So these structural reductions are on top of volume-related cuts as we continue to adjust our operations for the market. Now, the structural changes, by definition, are stickier. And all this doesn't come without a cost. But looking ahead \u2013 we are thoughtfully looking at how we work, what makes us more effective in the way that we go to market as we make these reductions. And in many ways, we're more effective now than we were before, or at least certainly in terms of safety and service quality. So for those reasons, the changes we're making, in my view, do not impact our ability to scale in a recovery. And at the same time, positioning Halliburton to outperform through the cycle. Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President of Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer : And, Jud, this is Christian, it is included in my guidance. Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you for that, I appreciate it. And my follow up is, maybe for Dave, you mentioned it, again, in your comments, you're having discussions with customers on lowering costs, but I'm curious, with commodity prices poking their head up this quarter, are you having any more dialog from your customers on potentially going back to work in the third or fourth quarter? Or are they still taking a more cautious tone towards the back half of the year at this point? David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, I think that clearly they're marginally more optimistic about things. I don't think we've seen that optimism translated into any set plans to actively increase the rigs in the back half of the year, certainly those discussions are taking place. I think if you look at our release we put out last week, we thought the rig count would bottom in Q2, I think we still believe that's the fact. But certainly, with the oil prices a little higher, people are more optimistic and we do think that potentially we'll see an upswing in the rig count in the back half of the year. Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from James West with Evercore ISI. You may begin. James C. West - Evercore ISI : Hey, good morning, guys. David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, James. James C. West - Evercore ISI : Hey, Dave and Jeff, maybe for you guys, so Baker is done and not going to happen and it is what it is, and you guys have seen my written comments about the DOJ overstepping their bounds here, but you still have some, I guess portfolio gaps, if you will, in production chemistry, artificial lift, how do you think about \u2013 where does Halliburton go now? What's the Halliburton of a year from now, two years from now look like? David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay, let me handle that, James. I guess before we talk about what we're going to look like going forward, I think it's really important that we really review where we are today. First and foremost, we're an integrated global oil services company, and I think in order to make that claim, you have to have a broad portfolio, offer every service to every customer in every market. And if you are an integrated company, you essentially can't pick and choose where you provide, who you provide it to, where you operate and what customers you work for. If you look at our individual product lines, our current portfolio is actually pretty good. We're in a number one market position in fracturing, in cementing and completions. Our drill bits is number one in North America. Sperry, Wireline, Baroid and Landmark are all in strong number two positions. And you referenced the ones that we need some help in and certainly the Baker Hughes transaction would have helped in artificial lift and production chemicals. In those areas clearly we're not in any sort of a market-leading position, and I said that in my prepared remarks. But we have an ability to grow product lines. I think a great example of that is our testing business, where just over the last several years, we've gone from essentially a startup to almost a number two in the market position and with the contracts that we've won, we believe we'll very soon get into a number two position there. So I like where we are, we certainly have the ability, as I said in my remarks, we are going to invest in those product lines where we're a little bit weak and we'll look at selective acquisitions to round them out. I think as far as then what comes next, from a shareholder standpoint, I want to reiterate, we are continuing to be dead focused on our growth, margin and returns and leading the industry in those areas, get the billion dollars out of the business that Jeff just referenced and then take advantage of the North America rebound when it comes. So yes, we are disappointed, but we've got a good portfolio, we're going to continue to execute our strategy and we're going to be fine. James C. West - Evercore ISI : Okay, got it thanks, Dave. And then on the North American market, it looks to us at least, and we're fairly bullish on oil prices, that cash flows for your customers will be up next year versus this year and certainly that will go back into the ground in drilling wells and could be a pretty significant recovery. As I understand, there's no translation on the current oil prices to pick up actively now, but are you starting to have conversations, Dave at your level or Jeff at your level, with your clients about their 2017 outlook? And they're going to have, in my view, they're going to have to get back after it or their production is going to go down, but are they starting to have those conversations about a pickup in activity? David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, certainly as I said earlier, they're more optimistic because of where prices have gone back to. There's clearly been a re-basing, a re-setting of breakeven points through a combination of, obviously, service costs coming down, and I would argue, coming down to certainly an unsustainable level. James C. West - Evercore ISI : Right. David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : There's going to be an element of balance sheet repair that has to go forward, but clearly, that is going to be offset by what should be some pretty significant production declines that these guys are going to see. And I think given the nature of these companies and they are independents, they're very confident in their own skill set, they're confident in the acreage they have and I think that when they believe that the time is right to start drilling, they will do it. And generally, I think what we've seen is they'll be able to get the money to do that either through commodity prices, or through going back into the equity markets or the debt markets. So, yeah, they are feeling better and I think they're trying to survive to 2017 and then get on with things. James C. West - Evercore ISI : Got it, thanks, Dave. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Angie Sedita with UBS. You may begin. Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning, guys. David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC : Clearly, I'll start off by saying, clearly a year-and-a-half ago no one would've expected conditions to deteriorate so severely, so it's very good to see the market react as well as it did and see that the best move for Halliburton was actually pulling away from the deal given the current market conditions. The question I would have for you, Dave, is we'll go to the bread and butter of the U.S., on the frac side, there's a lot of discussion on the attrition side. And so therefore, I wanted to hear your thoughts, or Jeff, on how much attrition do you think is merely replacing capital goods versus true attrition of equipment that could not come back? And how old you think equipment needs to be before you see it as no longer committed, or the customers see it as no longer actually competitive? And how much of equipment out there is that? David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Sure, Angie. And certainly Jeff and Jim Brown live this every day, so I'll let Jeff handle this one. Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director: Angie, our thoughts are that about half of that equipment is idle today and that idled equipment is not being maintained. We hear companies talking publicly even about cannibalizing equipment that is stacked, and that's equipment that really doesn't go back to work. It gets rained on, it sits there, it's more and more difficult to bring back. So I think that is continuing all of the time. From our perspective \u2013 actually interestingly enough though, the volumes pump which probably has more impact on equipment continued to increase, so we saw 17% increase in sand volume on a per well basis which says that the equipment has to work harder than it ever has. And so for that reason, we are really happy with our Frac of the Future configuration in the Q10 pumps just because they handle it so well. So, again, I think the equipment is out of the market, much of that equipment is probably out to stay. Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC : And then do you have any thoughts on the range of horsepower that that would be? Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director: That's probably, we estimate in the 30% range. Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Okay. And then as a follow up of our discussion here on the DUC thesis, on it potentially or maybe not tightening up the frac market. So any thoughts there on what oil prices you think we would need to see for those to start to be completed? And the timeframe and horsepower needed to complete these extra DUCs in the market? Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director: I think the DUCs right now are we estimate around 4,800 to 5,000, some of those are seasonal. We don't see volume continuing to build and in fact it's kind of being worked off in the stream of work that's out there today. So I don't see them as impactful, all at one time. We continue to describe them as deferred revenue for us as they get done. As far as price, I think it's more a sentiment than it is a price per se. It needs to be confidence around a price is probably as important as whatever a price may be. Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC : So then you don't see the completing of these DUCs as a tightening of horsepower? It's not enough to actually make a difference on or a meaningful difference on demand versus supply? David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No I don't think so. Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Okay. Thanks. I'll turn it over. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. You may begin. Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning. David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So just to continue on that line of thinking a little bit, when we get to a recovery scenario, is there one in which... David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sean, can you turn \u2013 it sounds like you've got your speaker on in the background, so we're getting a double.... Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Sorry about that. David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Here we go. Okay. Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Sorry about that. Thanks. Just on that line of thinking, in a recovery, is there a scenario in which some of your pre-Q10 horsepower goes back to work? Or do we think next cycle effectively your fleet is going to be fully Q10 irrespective of the slope of the recovery? Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director: Our target was to be fully Q10, and I think what we continue to believe that that performance out of the Q10 is differential and so that would be a target. That said, the equipment that we have, our older equipment is still better than what's available in the marketplace. So I'm always comfortable bringing that equipment back to the extent it fills the gap. So I feel like we're very well positioned in terms of responding to the market from an equipment standpoint. Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. Think you. And then just on the balance sheet side, Christian, you noted the plan to continue to spend within cash flow. Following the breakup fee payment, may be an update on how you're prioritizing cash uses considering the more levered balance sheet that you are going to have? Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President of Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer : Right. So we estimate that we need somewhere around $1 billion to run the company, so we're carrying more than enough cash, as I pointed out in my prepared remarks. Our use of cash is prioritized, first, with ensuring that we have the resources to take advantage of organic opportunities as they come. Second, the bolt-on acquisitions as well as any sort of ventures that we need to make to execute the strategy, cost per BOE strategy that Jeff laid out. And third would be any excess cash after that will be delivered back to the shareholders through buybacks. Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, Fair enough. Thanks for your time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Boyd with BMO Capital Markets. You may begin. Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Thanks, guys. David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Dan. David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Dave, you have a very strong track record of outperforming the rig count in the U.S. in down markets and in up markets, and as we look forward here, the one thing I'd like to get an update on is, your utilization sounds very high on your frac equipment, especially the Q10 pumps, just given what you are experiencing in your completion revenue in U.S. versus what peers are reporting. So in order for you to continue to outperform as the rig count increases, is that going to need to come from price increases? Or do you expect to get further market share gains and on the further market share gains, is that going to require potentially unstacking some of the equipment that you recently impaired? David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think. Dan, it's actually a good question, it's one we talk about a lot internally. I think you have to go back to the basic strategy that we follow in North America and that is to be in every basin, to be with the right customers in those basins and have the right relationships with those customers. So there's a number of ways to outperform the rig count when it comes back. And obviously, I won't give a detailed roadmap as to how you do that but, certainly, by being and having the right customers as your bread and butter from a revenue stream, they generally are the ones that are more financially secure. They have the better acreage, and they are the best positioned. They are likely the ones to put the earliest rigs up. And therefore, it's a natural extension of your market share by you take a customer that we have a great relationship, might be running five rigs today when they go to eight rigs, you automatically get that work. So that's one way. Second is the efficiency of our equipment. When things bounce back and it will, lowest cost per BOE and efficiency is still going to be very, very important. And having the Q10, having our Frac of the Future, having our footprint, having our logistical system and all of those things in place because we have not and will not dismantle any of that, as part of the exercise Jeff talked about, will still allow us to be the low-cost provider in a market that's expanding. I think another reason that we have worked hard to keep our utilization up is, it is I don't care what people say, it is going to be harder to crew frac spreads, it's going to be harder to crew cementing equipment and those sorts of things when this thing turns back. And so by keeping and preserving as much of our workforce and as much of our equipment being active, we can basically leverage that workforce more quickly across an expanding rig count. So I like where we are, it hasn't come without, obviously, a cost. We've worked hard with our customers to make sure that they in a position to keep rigs in the air. That's not, as I said, come without a cost on our margins, but I think it's a good trade-off because when this thing snaps back it's going to snap back hard and I really like the position we're going to be in at that point in time. Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And somewhat related, when I look at your CapEx, it's coming down quite a bit this year and it's really running about mid-single-digits at least of my revenue estimate and that's down from low-double-digits in the past. As the cycle snaps back, as you say and we start to get in that recovery mode, will CapEx get back to that level of near double-digit or are we at a structurally lower level? David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, I think at least in the near term we're probably at a structurally lower level. If you look at our release that we put out a week ago, clearly the whole industry is overcapitalized at this point in time, and it's overcapitalized with some really good equipment. So I think that as it flexes back and the rig count comes up, customer start to spend more money, the need to spend on capital, if in fact you are maintaining your equipment, maintaining your tools, which is what we are doing. We're not cold stacking stuff and letting it deteriorate, it's really just going to be an issue of getting the people to man that equipment as it comes back. So I don't really see us getting back to that level unless the market got really frothy like it did last time. Hey, that would be a great position to be in, I just don't see it at this point though. Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah. Absolutely. Thanks for the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim. You may begin. David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Mike. Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks, guys. A lot of questions on the operation side have been answered. I wanted to just ask a quick one on capital structure. You talked about, Christian, the priorities of use of cash, but how do you think about the mix of debt versus equity right now and into the next couple, three years? Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President of Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer : So one of the metrics that we use, Mike, is the way we look at our leverage is through \u2013 is the ratio of net debt to net cap, and we expect that ratio which is about 30% to go into the mid-40%s, so it is still very manageable. But you're right, we have to look at ways to delever the balance sheet and we're putting on plans to do that. Now having said that, Mike, and you know this, we are an investment-grade company and even though much like the rest of the industry, we are being reviewed by the credit rating agencies, we fully expect that after the smoke clears that we will remain an investment-grade company. So we will have ample liquidity and the financial flexibility to do whatever we need to do to make sure that we continue to add value to our stakeholders. David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I think, Mike, this is Dave, we'll have an obvious quick decision or quick opportunity to assess things. We have a $600 million debt repayment due in the fall and whether we just pay that off with the excess liquidity we have or look at the total capital structure, that's something that we'll be doing over the summer and into the fall. As Christian said in the call, even after the dust settles, we're going to have over $3.5 billion of cash sitting on the balance sheet. That is actually too much given where we are in the cycle and the fact that it costs us about $1 billion to sort of run the company. So we actually have that problem sitting in front of us right now, great problem to have. And we'll spend the balance of the second quarter here watching the market. There could be additional acquisition opportunities come up. As Christian said, we would consider buybacks, and any of the whole range of options. So we're in a good position to just sit back right now, make that decision, but clearly capital structure is on the top of our priority list right now Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Great. Thanks so much guys. David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from James Wicklund with Credit Suisse. You may begin. James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning, guys. David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, James. James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): By everybody's agreement, North America is going to come back first. In the international sector, I'm just kind of curious how you guys see how long it takes for international to come back, and which markets to come back first? Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director: Thanks, Jim. The international cycles are just longer, and so they are longer on the way down because structurally the contracts are longer, they're also slower on the uptick as well. So, I don't expect to see improvement internationally until we see some improvement in North America. That timeframe has usually been six months to a year in terms of the lag between North America and the rest of the world. I think if we look around the world though, the... David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hang on, hang on \u2013 hey, Jim, just like a couple guys ago, you've got your speaker on in the background, so we're getting an echo I suspect everybody is too. James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. I will try and fix that. Thank you. David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director: Internationally, it does not have the same overcapitalization that we saw in the U.S., so I think that that will help it react more quickly. As far as markets returning, I think the mature fields part of the business is the first to tighten back up, would start with the better markets like Middle East would be \u2013 it's most resilient but it tightens first. Probably we'd think Asia would be next as we looked around. James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. I appreciate that. And my follow-up if I could, Jeff, you talked a lot about the cost per BOE, and then, Christian, you talked about bolt on acquisitions and possible costs related to Jeff's cost per BOE strategy. What are the capital requirements for the implementation or continuation, Jeff, of your cost per BOE strategy and what products was the capital actually spent on? Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director: Well, capital is spent on the things that drive a lower cost per BOE, and by that I don't mean to be trite, but there are technologies, there are pieces of the business that, in my view, contribute to that. How we work and how we integrate internally is a big part of how we put those things to work. So there will be gaps here and there that say, hey, if we can put that to work in our system to drive a differentially lower cost per BOE, those are the things we want to spend money on. From an equipment perspective, Q10 is a great example of that. Because it differentially drives a lower cost for us and a lower cost per BOE for the market. So I think you'll see us consistently evaluate things through that lens. James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you, gentlemen. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Rob MacKenzie with IBERIA Capital. You may begin. Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC : Thank you, guys. I had a question, followed up on Baker's call and tying it into what you guys said about this morning, Dave, about weakness, obviously, in artificial lift and production chemicals. Can you foresee a return to Baker perhaps selling those product lines through Halliburton in an integrated type offering? David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'm not going to speculate on that. Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC : Okay. Well, that was my question, thank you. I will turn it back. David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Believe me, I've got lawyers shaking their heads at me like crazy right now. Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC : Okay. Well, then \u2013 I guess, my follow-up then would be, how do you see based on Baker's, if you can comment, based on Baker's strategy change, how do you see the competitive dynamic changing in a lot of particularly international markets but also in the U.S., say, pressure pumping market where they seem to be pulling back largely from that business? David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I think let me just stipulate, I did not listen to Baker's call this morning, so I really don't know what they said. So I can just sort of respond to what we see in the marketplace. I think that pressure pumping, in my view, to be successful at it in the U.S. you have to have the U.S. wide business because so much of the advantage you get in that business is through scope and scale. It's being the biggest procurer of sand, it's having the infrastructure, it's having the rail cars, it's having the transload centers, it's having the ability to spend on technology, on chemistry, on footprint, on downhole capabilities. And I think pulling back into a limited number of basins just doesn't allow you to have that scope and scale. So our strategy has always been one that you have to be, if you're committed to being an integrated services company, you have to take the benefit and the downside of that. And in a market like this, there is some downside because you are operating in some markets, you are operating in some product lines that maybe are not giving you the kinds of returns that you want. But at the end of the day when it does bounce back and you're making hay from a margin standpoint, it's way better to be essentially in every basin with every product line, so that's our strategy. As I said, I don't know what was said this morning, but our strategy is to be a full-service company, integrated across our product lines in every place that our customers want us to work. Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from David Anderson with Barclays. You may begin. David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Dave. J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Just following on the same line of thinking, bundling of services was a big subject of last few years before the downturn, I'm wondering if anything has changed in your philosophy in North America. Obviously the low-cost operator you talked about, the vertical integration; nobody is going to be more efficient than you guys. Is that still the thought that we're going to lead with the pressure pumping, that efficiency is pulling the rest of this technology and that's where margins come from in North America? Has anything changed with this downturn in that line of thinking? David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No. In fact, I think bundling and the ability to bundle, will be even more important as we come out of this for one simple reason. This thing finally got so bad that our customers had to lay people off, and by basically reducing their G&G capabilities, their engineering capabilities, their exploration capabilities, their drilling departments, they don't have those people internally that maybe were basically not as interested in bundling as they may have been in the last go around. So as this thing turns back up, they are going to be also more stressed from a people standpoint, and the conversations we're having with them today is about the advantages of bundling, from not only an efficiency standpoint, but from a cost standpoint. J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So if we just think about your Q10 pumps, obviously you're talking about kind of hydrating your all equipment with all the Q10s. Can you help us understand a little bit on that fleet? I'm not sure how you measure the bundling. I think in the past you've talked about maybe two or three product lines that are pulling through. Can you give us sort of, I don't know, a measurement of where we stand right now on that? Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director: Look, the Q10 is a key component of how we go to market, it drives our cost down most certainly. So we see just more things bundled around the wellhead. There is not as clear a measure around that. I think, it's more we bundle to the degree it drives lower cost for BOE for our clients, and those things become clearer as the activities around the completion start to pile up. And that's clearly an advantage for us because the equipment works together, or people work together and ultimately it does deliver a lower cost per BOE. J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Marshall Adkins with Raymond James. You may begin. J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, guys. A quick question on the asset impairments. How many pressure pumping horsepower was that that was impaired? Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President of Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer : We're not going to provide that level of detail, Marshall, but just to give you a flavor of the restructuring. Of that, C&P was two-thirds of that amount and one-third is D&E. That's probably what the level of detail that we're going to provide. J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Right. It helps. And what happens to that horsepower once it's written down? Is it just scrapped or what do you see happen there? Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President of Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer : Well, the way we've impaired the assets, there's really two buckets. One that is actually written off and therefore we're going to get rid of it. And then there's a portion of the assets that actually are idled, cold-stacked and we did an impairment analysis on that amount. Those are the larger components of our restructuring charge around fixed asset impairments. J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. One last just quick one on labor. You all mentioned labor issues, and recrewing these crews. Could you give us a little more color on that because I've been hearing the same thing from different industry sectors. And where do you see the limitations on labor as we ramp back up over the next couple of years? Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director: This is Jeff, I think we're differentially advantaged there, just because as Dave mentioned, we stay in the market and we keep experienced people, and know how to hire those kinds of people. If we look back just to 2014, we hired 21,000 people at Halliburton during that year, absolute adds. So we do know how to add people to the payroll when we need to. So those people are out there, it's not easy to recruit them, but we certainly know how to recruit them and I think we've demonstrated our ability to do that. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks. Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director: Okay. Thanks, Shannon. So I'd like to wrap the call up with just a couple of comments. So first, while we are disappointed about the outcome of the Baker Hughes transaction, we are excited about the future and our differentiated strategy to maximize production at the lowest cost per BOE for our clients. We are having productive conversation with clients around how we do this in the current marketplace. Second, we are systematically removing structural costs to address the current market outlook while retaining our ability to rebound quickly when activity turns up. We remain dead focused on revenue growth margins and returns, and clearly believe that Halliburton will be best positioned to outperform when the market recovers. So thank you, I look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Shannon, you can end the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator instructions]. As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Lance Loeffler, Halliburton's Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Lance Loeffler : Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton second quarter 2016 conference call. Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Jeff Miller, President. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other securities and exchange commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today include non-GAP financial measures and unless otherwise noted in our discussion today, we will be excluding the Baker Hughes termination fee and the impact of impairment and several other charges. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAP financial measures are included in our second quarter press release, which can be found on our website.  Now I'll turn the call over to Dave. David Lesar : Thank you, Lance and good morning to everyone. Our second quarter results showed great resilience in the face of a very challenging environment, which included declining rig activity and even more pricing headwinds. Our total company revenue declined only 9% sequentially compared to the 19% decline in the global rig count. Our North America revenue was down 15% from the prior quarter, significantly outperforming a 23% decline in the average US rig count. However, despite these continuing headwinds, based on the recent improvements to North American activity, I believe that this second quarter will mark the trough for our earnings.  Now we're at a dynamic point in the cycle and I'm not going to waste the limited time we have with you on the call this morning discussing things like the macroeconomics, the worldwide demand, the general economy or commodity prices. There are many public sources out there where you can get this data, including our customers because that is the world that they live in every day. What I want to talk about today is the world that we know best. Now, conventional wisdom coming out of the first quarter was that the rig count would continue to drop. We said we saw North America differently and were the first to call a bottom for the rig count. This is precisely what happened.  So let's talk about the reality of today's North America market. I can summarize this market in one sentence. Today our customers are thinking about growing their business again rather than being focused on survival. There are 2 distinct factors at work in North America; psychological and economic and I think it's critical to understand them both. Now, you haven't heard me talk about the psychology of North American producers before, but given what has happened to many of our customers in the last 18 months, I think it's an important point to understand. I spent a large amount of time with customers late in the quarter taking their pulse and I can tell you there was a growing survivor mentality out there, and you can't underestimate the positive change in attitude that we're seeing in our North American customers. There is a spring in their step that I didn't see earlier in the year and in almost every case, they are talking about adding rigs, buying assets or doing something value accretive. In short they are getting back to business.  The psychological factors are getting better. Oil reaching $50 per barrel, even for a brief time, was a critical emotional milestone for our customers as was being able to buy a strip above $50 per barrel. So maybe it can be summed up best by one customer who told me, Dave, it's actually a light at the end of the tunnel and not an incoming train. To borrow a Keynesian economic term, the animal spirits are back in North America, but also understanding the economic reality in North America is equally important. Pricing has helped cash flow but not enough. Hedges rolling off have created cash flow uncertainty. Balance sheet repair is still critical and many customers are looking at severe declines in production as many of them have drilled few wells in the last 18 months. And while there are many customers that have adequate liquidity, there is also a large segment evaluating how to access capital. This evaluation is around whether to do dilutive equity deals, accessing the high yield markets, looking at Reserve Base lending or partnering with private equity. But the important point is, they are back in business. Now our North America customer management teams are great to work with. They are creative, adaptive and increasingly confident and I believe they will find the solutions best tailored for their companies. This is also a smart group and they see today's looming supply shortfall and know that US unconventionals will likely be the first and deepest beneficiary of growing supply shortages. And you can be sure they want to reap some of that benefit. So let's talk about how the cycle is starting to stack up and how this coming up cycle will play out. Now obviously, the last 2 years has been a period of significant under investment, where global CapEx has been reduced by nearly $400 billion. As a result, the industry will have to find a lot of new barrels in the next 5 years. Now, you can choose your own energy supply expert and there are many of them out there, but most agree we will need between 18 and 22 million barrels per day of new production by 2021. Meaning we have to find nearly 2 Saudi Arabias worth of production in the next 5 years. To achieve this production goal, we believe there will need to be structural changes that have to happen. It clearly starts with a supportive commodity price and we're not there yet today. The prices will have to get there soon or the supply challenges will be even greater.  Industry balance sheets will need to be repaired. The industry will need to replenish experience lost to retirement and cutbacks. We\u2019ll have to find sustainable ways to deepen the relationships between operators and service companies, collaborating to integrate better, eliminate duplication and drive down delivery cost. And finally, producers will have to accept the reality of service company economics. Some of the efficiency gains we have made with our customers are in fact sustainable and will continue, but others, including deep uneconomic pricing cuts, are unsustainable and will have to be reversed.  In this environment, we are confident that North America will recover the fastest. The North America market has turned and we expect to see a continued modest uptick in the US rig count during the second half of the year and becoming more meaningful as we go into 2017. And now that we have seen the flow in activity levels, we expect revenue to increase based on higher utilization rates. And as we have said consistently, rig count stabilization is the first step on the road to margin repair, and Jeff will discuss that in a few minutes.  Current service pricing in North America is unsustainable. We are in an environment where service providers are unable to meet their cost of capital and many are struggling to recover even their cash costs. Historically, as we reached the bottom, the downward momentum on pricing creates a headwind and margin repair tends to lag activity recovery by a quarter or so. To break this typical cycle, we have made structural changes to our delivery platform, eliminating management layers and consolidating roles and locations. As a result of these savings, we are confident that North America margins can begin to recover in the third quarter.  When this downturn started, we said that we were entering it from a position of strength in all of our markets. Since that time, we have executed our downturn playbook and have continuously outperformed the market, both in North America as well as the Eastern Hemisphere, gaining market share in both. So to summarize, the market has played out as we predicted and our strategy is working. North America has turned and with our market share increase during the downturn, we believe we are the best positioned company. During the coming recovery, we plan to scale up our delivery platform by addressing our product line building blocks one at a time, through a combination of organic growth and selective acquisitions.  With that, let me turn the call over to Mark and Jeff to cover our financial and operational results. Mark? Mark McCollum : Thanks Dave and good morning everyone. Let me start with a summary of our second quarter results compared to our first quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.8 billion, which declined 9% compared to a 19% percent decline in the worldwide rig count. Total company operating income declined 72%, primarily due to the continued decline in global activity in pricing, as well as the reintroduction of depreciation expense for our previously held for sale assets.  Moving to our region results, North America revenue declined 15%, with margins moving down to an operating loss of 8%. The primary drivers were the impact of reduced pricing and activity in our stimulation, wireline and drilling product lines.  In Latin America, revenue declined 12% and operating income declined 54%, as a result of reduced activity levels in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia and by our decision to curtail our activity in Venezuela. Rig activity in both Brazil and Mexico is at a 20 year low, while Venezuela continues to experience significant political and economic turmoil.  Turning to Middle East Asia, revenue declined 3%, while operating income declined 22%. We saw increased activity in Kuwait and fairly consistent activity in Saudi Arabia. However, we also began to experience pricing pressure across the region and activity levels declined in Iraq, Australia and Indonesia. In Europe Africa CIS, second quarter revenue increased 2% and operating income increased 12%, as a result of the seasonal recovery of activity in the North Sea and Russia. Our corporate and other expense for the second quarter totaled $60 million and we expect third quarter expense to come in at similar levels.  We recorded a tax benefit for the second quarter of approximately $6 million. Based upon our current outlook for the third quarter, we anticipate that our effective tax rate will be approximately 50%. These unusual rate results from having tax losses in the US that are then offset by taxable income in the foreign jurisdictions with lower statutory rates.  During the second quarter, we had several special charges that we need to highlight. First, as we've previously disclosed, we recognize the $3.5 billion termination fee associated with the Baker Hughes transaction. We also recognize pretax restructuring and other charges of $423 million. These charges consist primarily of severance cost and asset impairments, as we continue to adjust our cost structure and footprint to the current operating environment. The largest single item in that charge was a fair market value adjustment, required by accounting rules for exchanging $200 million of our Venezuela receivable, for an interest bearing promissory note. This instrument provides a more defined schedule around the timing of payments, while generating a return while we await payment. There is an immediate expense because accounting rules require that these notes be revalued to their current trading value, even if you intend to hold them to maturity. Our current intent is to hold them to maturity and we expect to collect 100% of the principle. As such, the notes will accrete back to their par value as they mature over the next few years. All of these adjustments are tax deductible, but the tax benefit we recorded also includes the impact of removing our accounting assertion on permanently reinvesting our foreign earnings and some adjustments related to the carry-back of our now sizable US NOL. The NOL carry-back will provide us with a significant cash flow benefit later this year. Speaking of cash flow, this quarter was particularly noisy because of the termination of the Baker Hughes deal and continued restructuring work we are doing. When the smoke clears from the unusual items however, cash flow from operations was slightly positive and we closed the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and equivalents. Over our history, it's not unusual for our annual cash flow to be back end loaded in the year and 2016 is no exception. We continue to commit to living within our cash flows during this challenging environment and improving earnings and a number of working capital initiatives that we are implementing should get us alternately to breakeven for the year.  Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be approximately $850 million. Turning to our short term operational outlook, let me provide you with our thoughts on the third quarter. In North America, the US land rig count is already up 5% sequentially on average and is expected to improve modestly over the remainder of the third quarter. We anticipate revenue will outperform the rig count by several hundred basis points and that margins will improve by 100 to 200 basis points as a result of our cost control initiatives and better utilization.  In Latin America, we are anticipating a mid-teens percentage decline in revenue with margins moving down to the low single digits. Although we may see some end of year sales, Latin America is expected to remain our most challenged region throughout the international down cycle and we do not expect to see a fundamental improvement this year. And finally, third quarter Eastern Hemisphere revenue is expected to be down modestly low single digits due to declining activity and continued pricing headwinds. Looking ahead, we anticipate Eastern Hemisphere activity to decline over the balance of the year. However, we expect margins to remain flat in the third quarter as they also benefit from our cost control initiatives.  Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff? Jeffrey Miller : Thank you, Mark and good morning everyone. Let me start today with a headline. 900 is the new 2,000 for US rig activity. Now what I mean by that? I believe it\u2019ll the only take 900 rigs to consume all of the horsepower available in the market. Why? We know the North American market best and we're in every single part of that market. What's clear to us is that the increases in rig efficiency, lateral length and sand per well create a compounding effect that consumes increasingly more horsepower per rig. In addition, we watch the effect of the downturn on North America service capacity every day in every basin. We've seen the attrition of equipment, people and companies. Let me take these in order. First, horsepower attrition continues due to scrapping and cannibalization. We believe up to four million horsepower and maybe even more has been permanently removed from the market, representing about 20% of the horsepower capacity reported at the peak and more is permanently impaired each day. Industry headcount reductions continue and many of these people are leaving the industry. Finally, company bankruptcies and consolidations also work to accelerate equipment attrition.  Now I want to address what we do as we scrape along the bottom and look ahead to the recovery. The steps are, must be present to win and we are. We are present in every market. Second is reduced directional cost. We're doing it. Third, increased utilization, we\u2019re positioned for it. And finally get pricing help. This happens when utilization increases. To be ready for the recovery, we played offense. First, we actively protected our market position with key customers, kept the majority of our fleet deployed and delivered fantastic service quality.  Despite absorbing the pain of pricing reaching unsustainable levels, we made a strategic decision to stay in every market and keep crews running. In spite of the nearly 80% decline in rig count, our stage count only declined 33%. So here's what we're doing now. We preserved idle equipment outside of our field locations so it doesn't get cannibalized. It's clear to me that it will be cheaper to reactivate our cold stacked equipment than to put capital into cannibalized horsepower. This means we are best positioned to more quickly get back to work in the market recovery and are prepared to activate equipment when we see economic opportunities to do so.  In terms of structural cost control, we're making significant progress towards reducing our annual cost structure by $1 billion. We've reduced headcount and consolidated facilities in every region. At the end of the second quarter, we're about halfway there, both internationally and in North America. We anticipate the remaining savings will come in the second half of the year and will reach the $1 billion run rate cost savings as we go into 2017.  The next step is increased utilization. We know our platform is most effective when it's fully utilized. So job one is to fill the white space in the calendar. This is why we work with customers that best utilize our platform, in turn helping our customers produce at the lowest cost per BOE. Throughout the downturn, our superior delivery platform, which is our value proposition, our people, processes and equipment, results in a margin gap to nearly every competitor and we expect to maintain that advantage in the recovery.  The last step will be the return of pricing. Price negotiations have been a bar room row. In certain situations, as we've seen signs of recovery, we've elected to walk away from money losing jobs in recent months. We've been reviewing every contracting and program down to individual wells on a pad by pad basis, including opportunities for pass-through and cost related pricing and surcharging.  It's a tough market but we believe pricing will recover as activity increases. When we have these 4 things, we're confident our North America margins will return to double digits, but beyond North America land, our key focus areas are unconventional, mature fields and deep water and I'm pleased with how we're executing around the world. Though they may be limited, we're working closely with our customers to unlock unconventionals in every region around the world, including recent projects in Abu Dhabi and Argentina.  In the Middle East we've made significant inroads in our IPM business, taking a market leading position during the downturn. This reflects the dedication our employees have for understanding their customer needs, identifying solutions, and helping to reduce risks, all while improving efficiency in this uncertain market. This creates a great environment for our collaborative and integrated business model, helping our customers to deliver the lowest cost per barrel of oil.  Though we know deep water is the most challenged, we are collaborating closely with our customers who are working hard to drive down structural cost and make economic wells. BaraECD is an engineered drilling fluid system that allows us to manage narrow frac gradients while drilling. In addition to reducing overall growing times, BaraECD has helped break records on rate of penetration and is one of multiple systems that have allowed us to take a number one position in the Gulf of Mexico fluids market. In Southeast Asia we have a great example of a collaborative effort with a client that optimized the drilling solution, including drill bits and fluids for exploration well, reducing the drilling time by 14 days. This cost savings helped to deliver the lowest cost per BOE and is proof that when we work together with our customers and internally, we can provide efficient solutions in any market. The ability to input customer requirements into our drill bit development in short order, is what enables us to deliver this collaborative solution.  Collaboration is central to everything we do. Not only do we say it, we do it. A great example is our new resource for customers and partners called iEnergy, available through Landmark. It's an open architecture approach to problem solving. iEnergy was conceived as a community of stakeholders sharing data and building applications. Think of it as our open architecture approach in contrast to proprietary and closed models in the market today. This is highly indicative of how we collaborate at Halliburton, not only collaborating internally, but collaborating more closely with our customers. I could go on all day about specific products and services. Let me wrap up with what we do. Our competitive advantage is this. We collaborate, engineer solutions and execute to maximize our client's asset value, which means a lower cost and making more barrels. This is why we maintain our global service footprint. We will own the last mile, be present across the globe and maintain dead focus on service quality.  To sum it up, we like our position. As we expected, the North American unconventional market has responded the fastest, demonstrated by the recent activity pick up. International markets will take more time to rebound, but we're certainly well positioned for when they do. I want to close by thanking our employees for maintaining their focus on service quality and executing at every level in this challenging market. Simply put, service quality is central to how we win and retain work. We've seen a record low incidence rates so far this year and it's important we keep this focus on safety and service quality as the market begins to pick up.  Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave for closing comments. Dave? David Lesar : Thank you, Jeff and let me sum things up. We are prepared for the North American upcycle. Our approach to the market remains unchanged. The North American market is turning. It will recovery the fastest and Halliburton will be the biggest beneficiary. In the next North America rig cycle, 900 is the new 2,000. The international markets will follow and we are maintaining our integrated global services footprint, managing costs and continuing to gain share. We are working hard at reducing structural costs. We expect to achieve a billion dollars lower run rate going in to 2017. We remain laser focused on consistent execution, generating superior financial performance, and providing industry leading shareholder returns. And finally, we expect that the second quarter will be the trough of our earnings and we are confident that Halliburton will be best position to outperform in the recovery phase of the cycle.  Now before we open it up for questions, I would like to thank Christian Garcia for his outstanding work over his 20 years at Halliburton, and particularly his work as interim CFO during the past 18 months. I very much wish him well in the future.  Now, let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Scott Gruber : Good morning. Jeff, as someone who spends an inordinate amount of time on headlines and titles, I really like your rig count headlines. It\u2019s a good one. Jeffrey Miller : Than you. Scott Gruber : You stated that about four million horsepower has been removed from the North American frac fleet. Can you just provide some color on this figure? How much do you think has been disassembled, cut up and won't come back? How much is in more of a mothballed state? And overall where do you think these figures could stand by year end? Jeffrey Miller : Let me go, maybe start with how we get to the 900 as the new 2,000 and then address your question along the way. So going into the downturn, equilibrium was about 2,000 rigs and 600 frac crews in the US. So a little more than 3 rigs kept every frac crew busy. Really 3 factors at play here. So first drilling efficiency and then completions, intensity and attrition. So from a drilling efficiency standpoint, rigs have gotten almost 30% faster meaning more wells per rig per year. So that new ratio is closer to 2 to 2.5 rigs for every crew. Second is around completions intensity and the jobs have gotten twice as big, meaning more horsepower per crew almost 20% more, meaning that the same horsepower that made up 600 crews now only make up 500. And so then we get to the attrition part of that and there are estimates that range from 3 to 7 million horsepower that have left the market. We think it's about 4. We see that because we're out in the market every day looking at horsepower. But the fact is there's more horsepower that it trips every day just given the type of intensity. So I think the important point is that you know the market can tighten maybe faster than you think. Scott Gruber : We certainly agree with that point. A quick follow up. We hear that some of the most dilapidated fleets that require 20 million, 25 million per fleet to reactivate are giving that really a full refurb on all the key components that\u2019s needed. Is there an argument to be made that pump technology has progressed to the point where it's just simply a better use of capital to build a new fleet than invest 20 million, 25 million to bring a legacy fleet back out? Jeffrey Miller : Scott, certainly our view and that is the way why we kept our equipment the way we have, we segregated it with the end -- I described it is we stacked equipment with the end in mind so it doesn't take capital to do that. But I do believe that equipment that has not been maintained and has been cannibalized can be very difficult to get that economically back into the marketplace. Scott Gruber : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from James West with Evercore ISI Group. You may begin. James West : Good morning gentlemen and congratulations on a well-executed quarter. So Jeff, probably for you in terms of the North American land market and really just because of the devastation of the industry, particularly your competition, we see a lot of bottlenecks that are going to appear, labor, working capital, attrition like you discussed, the logistics. Could you maybe comment on what you see from the competitive landscape on where these bottlenecks, these pinch points might occur first or earliest and then how Halliburton can mitigate these issues relative to the competition that really can't do a lot? Jeffrey Miller : Thank you James. Yeah, you nailed it. The pinch points will be equipment, sand and people. We spent time on equipment, but clearly the approach we've taken around equipment is to be best positioned to get that equipment back into the marketplace. So we\u2019ve talked about that. From a sand standpoint, it's not the sand as much as it is the logistics and in our view we're very well positioned around that, having built out our infrastructure over the last several years. We've got sand delivery in every basin and we've got sufficient rail infrastructure to address the logistics part of that. And then finally around people, we've been careful as we've gone through these restructurings to do our very best anyway to retain experienced people and we have those today. Then don't forget it was just in 2014, we put 21,000 people on to the payroll and so we know how to do that and we know how to make those people effective. So we feel like Halliburton is well positioned. James West : Right. I totally agree. Do you think that some of the market share gains in North America have occurred because of your ability to ramp back up relative to the competition and your customer base, you understand these bottlenecks, these issues? Jeffrey Miller : Yes I do. It\u2019s part of the flight to quality. As I described our value proposition, it's our process people and equipment and a big part of that is the reliability of Halliburton to stay and we have stayed in all of the key markets. James West : Got it. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. Judson Bailey : Thanks. Good morning. Dave, I was hoping to get a little more color what your thoughts on thinking about North America over the back half of the year. Oil touched 50 as you noted. It\u2019s pulled back a little bit, closer to 45 or a little below now. How does that impact expectations in terms of activity increase the back half of the year? Is 45 enough and also is it sufficient to stabilize the pricing environment? It sounds like the pricing is still under pressure. So just like to get your thoughts on maybe the moving parts in the back half of the year as we think about oil in the mid-40s. A \u2013 Jeffrey Miller : Let me start that and then maybe follow up. We call it a landing point, which means rigs stop falling, but I think it's important that the \u2013 it\u2019s a sentiment that trumps the oil price right now. Based on conversations, they are clearly more positive and constructive than they have been in the past, but realize we were starting at the worst part of the market. A lot of the worst had been factored in the plan so moving up from what were clearly the worst plans. And I would call it a measured step up as opposed to a boom. And so certainly seeing positive things we think we will be well positioned for that whatever shape that recovery takes. Judson Bailey : Okay. No, that's helpful. Thanks. My follow up is maybe from Mark. Mark, the margin guidance for North America up. I think you said 100, 200 basis point. That implies probably lower incremental margins than I would have thought given the cost cutting you guys are doing. Can you maybe talk a little more about the moving parts and thinking about how margins can move up in 3Q and then again in 4Q given the cost-cutting initiatives? A \u2013 Mark McCollum : Clearly the cost -cutting initiatives are helping us, being able to get out there and address, but I think that the thing you've got key off of what Jeff was saying, that while the sentiment has changed, we\u2019re still in a very low activity environment. Our first course of action is to get utilization on the equipment that's out there in the field and depress that quite a bit. There are because you can see it in our numbers, there\u2019s equipment out there that's ultimately not covering fixed cost. And so we're working on trying to make sure that that equipment as we get it utilized is being as efficient as possible to move our margins up.  I think that as we work through the restructuring, that's going to continue to add margin points here on everything. I guess what we're saying is, we're not counting on price at this point. The market itself, this utilization and what we're going after, we'll fight for price every single day, but it\u2019s still this hand to hand combat is just set out there and so we're not necessarily baking that into the forward look today. Judson Bailey : Okay, all right. Thanks guys. I'll turn it back. Operator : Our next question is from Angie Sedita with UBS. You may begin. Angie Sedita : Thanks. Good morning guys. So Jeff, I also thought it was very interesting your comments there on the 900 rigs is the new 2,000. And so if you take that one step further, I guess you can conclude that that would imply in your mind that frac utilization will probably be near the last cycle peaks of 90% and then if you can take that another step forward, what would that imply on normalized margins this cycle and how you think the pricing will play out this cycle? Is it once we start to reach that 90% utilization or could we see pricing before then? Jeffrey Miller : I think we see the state -- take the pricing first. That will follow utilization. So as we've described it in the past, we\u2019d expect to see utilization begin to tighten and at which point you start to see pass-throughs of things and opportunities to improve margins that aren\u2019t necessarily price. The real pricing leverage we actually didn't see in the last cycle. We were getting to that in late \u201914, just about the time things slowed down. So a lot of the value creation we're able to accomplish with our platform that\u2019s efficient and putting the utilization to it. I think the rest of that was the look forward around margin progression.  Look, I would expect very able to accomplish what we did last time, except probably do better given the fact that we've done some of the heavy lifting around structural cost. So very encouraged about how things would look in the future. Angie Sedita : Okay, that's helpful. So you think margins could go back to where they were last cycle given the cost cutting at a 900 rig count? Jeffrey Miller : Yes, certainly. Angie Sedita : Very helpful. And then on the international side, can you, whatever color you do have, thoughts on when you think we could see the bottom in some of these regions. And also it was very impressive you saw some market share gains in your international markets. Maybe you could talk about that a little bit. Jeffrey Miller : Yeah. So typically international business will trail US behavior by 6 to 9 months and it\u2019s historically done that. I don't expect that it's any different. So that means that it is still an absolute brawl in the Eastern Hemisphere. The things that mute that a little bit are the length of the contract terms, which causes it to respond more slowly. And then so from a, in my view margin resilience is really reflecting better visibility that we have because of the longer timeframe and our team, the Alberta team just absolutely executing on all points. Angie Sedita : And then on the market share again? Mark McCollum : Angie, let me take that one because I think it's important to understand, the Eastern Hemisphere is sort of a tale of two customer groups. You've got the NOCs generally with mature fields and they're just trying to squeeze more out of their mature fields through their existing infrastructure and that part of the business actually has held up pretty well. There\u2019s certainly some pricing pressure there. There's certainly some issues with customers trying to lower their cost per BOE. I think it's the deep water complex that is the most challenged in this commodity price environment, and we clearly are working with our customers as are all the other contractors, to try to push that cost, that breakeven cost down in the deep water complex.  But where pricing is today, it just doesn't work generally in the deep water, especially the new deep water. So we\u2019ve been focused on making sure that we get market share gains, even as the market has shrunk because in the long term, contracting nature of that market, when it does turn back up, you've got those contracts in hand and now market share becomes very sticky at that point in time. Angie Sedita : Perfect. Appreciate the color and of course my best to Christian as he moves on. Thank you guys. Operator : Our next question is from Bill Herbert with Simmons. You may begin. Bill Herbert : Thanks. Good morning. Mark, back to the North American margin question. Just trying to understand it better. If you just focus on the quarterly rate of change and let\u2019s just presume, you made a prophecy I think with reason that your revenues would markedly outperform the recount in the third quarter. Just presuming a 10% increase in topline and only a 200 basis point improvement in margins, that implies a 15% incremental. At this stage, that just seems to be woefully anemic, recognizing the fact that you're unemployed from an asset employment standpoint. Is there a negative pricing role that's also being taken into account in the third quarter or would you characterize the guidance as conservative? Mark McCollum : Bill, I actually am glad you asked that question because I was sitting here thinking there was another point that I didn't get a chance to make on the earlier comment. One of the things that we're already beginning to see in the marketplace is a little bit of cost inflation. Diesel, we're seeing it in some commodities and things. And so we're already, believe it or not, at this point beginning to fight inflation. During this period of time, it\u2019s off the bottom here with the slope of -- The shallow slope that we're on, it makes it challenging, right? We've got to get capacity utilization before you can really go get price and we're going to push, but some of the commodities are starting to poke their head up and it's catching us a little bit and that's part of what's being reflected in there. Bill Herbert : Okay and then Jeff, with regard to the evolution of your Q2 stage count, how would you characterize -- how did that evolve? I guess the specific question is whether the June exit rate stage count was markedly higher than the Q2 average. Jeffrey Miller : Yeah. We saw it was higher in June, so the exit rates were higher than so the quarter average, which is reflective of a couple of things, which is modest amount of rig activity, but also we see ducts being worked off. And I wouldn't describe ducks as the bow wave, but they are in the mix and because we're in the market the way we are, we're a beneficiary of that. Bill Herbert : And how would you describe the frac calendar for the second half of the year? Is it disproportionately weighted towards Q3 and pretty solid and hopeful for Q4 or pretty evenly distributed? How would you characterize your frac calendar right now? Jeffrey Miller : We've always got better visibility sooner than we do further out, but I would describe it as more evenly weighted at this point in time then heavier to Q3. Bill Herbert : Okay, thanks very much guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. You may begin. Sean Meakim : Hey, good morning. So just sticking on the frac business, Jeff talked about walking away from work in some cases and some of your peers have talked about requiring 20% to 30% higher pricing in order to justify reactivating frac crews. Just curious if you see it the same way. Thinking about your thoughts on what will it take for pricing to move higher and how much you need in order to bring equipment to the market? Jeffrey Miller : Sean, this is Jeff. Look, we're just not going to talk about pricing at this point in time. So we continue to look at every crew in terms of what's economic. And as we described before, we care a lot about customer alignment, basin alignment and customers that are able to consume our platform in a way that helps us and helps them. So we continue to view it that way. Sean Meakim : Okay, fair enough. And then Mark, you talked about, in previous discussions you talked about being opportunistic on some of the upcoming debt maturities. Maybe you pay down so much cash on hand, maybe in some cases you extend, so depending on what the market is giving you. Capital markets is fairly amenable today for those with even more challenged balance sheets. Just curious how you're thinking about debt reduction measures or the other potential changes to the capital structure over time. Mark McCollum : I think our best opportunity right now is continue to look at maturities as they come due. We\u2019ve got a $600 million maturity coming up in the back half of the year. Our current intent right now is to make that payment out of our cash flow. We should have the ability to do that. That\u2019s a part of our cash flow forecast for the year. So that's the current intent. We're just going to continue to watch it. We\u2019ll just continue to watch it very carefully, but we\u2019ve got $3.1 billion dollars of cash on the balance sheet. It\u2019s a little more than we need. With some of these maturities coming, you'll notice that we've taken the tax hits to be able to move our money around as we need it no matter where it is in the world. So right now, our current plan is just continue to naturally delever. Sean Meakim : Understood. Thanks for your time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may begin. Timna Tanners : Hey, thanks. Good morning everyone. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color about some of your international comments, in particular wanted to take advantage of you being the first call since Brexit to see if you have any comments on your broader thinking about what that might imply for North Sea operations. Jeffrey Miller : Look, we don't see Brexit alone having a dramatic effect, though clearly like in so many economies around the world, oil and gas is a clear path to help an economy. So in some ways, I think that that would be structurally a positive in the UK sector or the North Sea but immediately, no impact. Timna Tanners : Okay, great. And then similarly, you talked about the 6 to 9 month lag in international operations, but more challenges in Latin America. What do you think we should watch for to think about what would trigger the recovery in that region? Jeffrey Miller : Latin America has terrific reserves. The bottom line is the reserves are there and we've been in some countries in Latin America for 80 years. So I think that the positive signs are going to be production. It\u2019s pleasing to see in Brazil for example, Petrobras is clearly back on the business pages today, talking about wells that are producing. But I think stability in commodity price is going to have to be one of the first things that helps in Latin America just given kind of financially where some of our customers are. But look, it is the kind of market that over time will clearly rebound. Timna Tanners : But it\u2019s just going to be later because of the more reliance on oil prices or what makes it so much later, or what do you think is going to be that trigger like you said? Jeffrey Miller : I think it's later partly because you've got to almost go country by country in terms of some of the disruption that's going on. And so Mexico is working through sort of a market reorganization along with some other things that have to settle out. I believe Brazil in terms of sort of the cost of Deepwater is always an overhang and how they work through that. And then the other big one being Venezuela. Clearly a lot of turmoil there too and it\u2019s very unfortunate, but hope to see resolution over time. Mark McCollum : Part of it is just the natural budgeting cycle for many of our NOC clients. Their annual budgets, they\u2019ll have to take their budgets and get it approved by legislative bodies. They're working off a year without significant -- they're not spending and they don't have a lot of cash flow and so that means that really until those budgets are approved, they're not going to be spending and oftentimes, that ends up happening sort of later, in the late first quarter or even into the second quarter before everything's approved. And so that starts to push out the ramp in spending. Even if they see higher prices, that pushes out the ramp in spending beyond what others might see. Whereas in North America, they\u2019re not relying on legislative bodies. They get out and they spend quickly as soon as they have the cash flow. Timna Tanners : Okay. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question is from David Anderson with Barclays. You may begin. David Anderson : Thanks. Dave, you talked about the psychology of the E&P getting better. I was just curious, one big part of that has to be the lower breakeven cost that they're seeing. I\u2019ve been seeing a number of presentations from E&Ps who seem to think that the costs they have now are basically locked in place. Just curious how those discussions go. Are they expecting to see oil service inflation? Is this kind of how they're kind of locking in the next couple of years? I'm just kind of wondering what that part of the psychology of the cost side. David Lesar : Good question, Dave. I think the conversations go like this. Hey, we've finally driven service prices down to where we can breakeven, sort of a plus 40. My response to that is yeah, for right now, but you're not going to have any service industry to take care of you if you think that's where pricing is going to stay. And then you get into sort of a to and fro about what is sustainable. And you know Jeff hit on some of them. Rig efficiency is sustainable. That speed that we can drill out laterals is sustainable. The bigger jobs and higher production is sustainable. But that doesn't come without a cost.  And so as I said, these are a great set of customers. They know in their heart of hearts that service prices have to go up. They're going to fight that impact of prices coming up as fast and as long as they can, but the reality is they know they need a viable service industry to be successful in the long run. So it'll be give and take and my guess is as we listen to the calls over the next few quarters is, the operators will say they've got them locked in and the service companies are going to say we've got to have price increases and we'll end up in the middle somewhere like we always do. David Anderson : Okay. So it\u2019s a bit of a disconnect now that kind of gets played out over the next year or 2, but there is an acknowledgement that the service cost do have to go up at some point though within -- do you think in the heart of hearts that they do acknowledge that there has to be some in there? David Lesar : I: David Anderson : All right. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Kurt Hallead with RBC. You may begin. Kurt Hallead : Hey, good Morning. I just wanted to calibrate, see if you guys could calibrate some information for me. So you guys talk about a 4 million horsepower reduction in the US frac market. So that puts maybe the market at about 14 million horsepower give or take. We\u2019ve heard depending on who you want to talk to, maybe about 6 million of that horsepower is currently active in the market. That 6 million horsepower you guys talked about, a lot of whitespace, that 6 million horsepower maybe working 50% of the time. Does that kind of jibe with how you see the market right now or could you help me understand it a little bit better if you think some of those numbers are off? Jeffrey Miller : No man, I don\u2019t think those numbers are inconsistent with how we view the market and that's why we described the path back is it starts with utilization of what's there. I think there are barriers to a lot of that equipment ever makes it back into the market and I do think that unintended equipment almost retreats on its own, particularly with cannibalization that we hear others talking about it. So I don't think you're wrong. Kurt Hallead : So then in the context as we try to think about the opportunity for margin improvement vis-\u00e0-vis pricing, do we need to get back up to 8 million horsepower now being active in the market give or take or is it sufficient to get that 6 million horsepower we all agree generally on those numbers? Can we get that 6 million horsepower up to 80% utilization and is that sufficient, just to drive some pricing? Any viewpoints on that? David Lesar : Yeah, I think -- Let me take that one because I think -- again, we're not going to go down any pricing path today. We have a pricing strategy that we're going to follow. We're not going to share it with anybody. It\u2019ll be sort of a discussion customer by customer, but I would say one thing is necessary. Don't fall into the trap is not all pumping equipment is the same. There are pumping companies out there that have zero utilization today because they can't find a customer or they\u2019re in the wrong basin or their equipment is not qualified to basically set a pump to formation where they are.  So I think that there is a bifurcation, trifurcation, whatever you want to call it, amongst the pressure pumping companies. And I think a lot of people like to lump everybody together and sort of talk about averages. But I really think it's important to sort of segregate the market into the various basins, the various customers that are drilling, the types of formations that are being drilled, the kinds of completions that are getting done, before you start to get a more granular view of sort of what is really going on out there. And I think that's a view we have and I think there's a strategic advantage that we have. But I think it's important to sort of stay away from averages because I think you can actually draw the wrong conclusions about sort of the health of the industry. Kurt Hallead : All right, that's great color. And my follow up is on the international front. What region do you think will lead the way out and what product lines you think if frac is where you're very well positioned in the US among others to lead. Where do you think internationally Halliburton is best positioned to lead on the way out internationally? David Lesar : Look, I think the Middle East has demonstrated the most resilience and I think that when we think about our business, we tend to think more mature fields, unconventionals, and Deepwater. And so from a mature field standpoint, setting aside the Middle East, I think Asia probably has sort of the next chunk of runway and we're very well positioned there I'd say in all of our service lines. Kurt Hallead : Okay, thanks. Appreciate all that color. Operator : Thank you. Our last question is from Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse. You may begin. James Wicklund : I think that's great that you guys saved the best for last. I appreciate it. Mark, welcome back to the conference call. Mark McCollum : Glad to be back. James Wicklund : We look at the results and you give guidance in Q3 that margins will improve. The whole industry has had trouble keeping up with the decline in activity and now that we're starting to stabilize that gives you guys an opportunity to catch up. At what quarter, Q4, Q1 next year, at what point should we expect you to get to breakeven in North America? Mark McCollum : I think right now just as we triangulate, Q1 of next year. I think that's where it will be. James Wicklund : Okay. That\u2019s great, but the way incrementals work, we never can -- We're stuck with guessing. The second thing, playing golf the other day with a couple of guys in the forgings business, which is kind of leading edge, I got a report that the largest frac pump forging order in 12 months has been issued and I'm not assuming it\u2019s you guys, because you guys do a lot of your, most all your own work. But are we to the point in terms of sentiment and you mentioned optimism by your customers and clearly you're optimistic. Have we gotten to the point that service companies are now willing to look at increasing CapEx in anticipation of \u201917? And then that really applies more to your state of mind for the future. You guys state that the recover this year will be anemic, but it will get better next year. Are we starting to free up that sentiment in terms of capital from the service side? Jeffrey Miller : Jim, it\u2019s interesting. Forging actually indicate more to me that they are trying to replace cannibalized parts in a lot of ways. Forging tend to be consumables as they repair equipment. One could interpret that as we've run out of cannibalized equipment and now are having to replace things. I don't see that as maybe the change in sentiment that maybe you do. But anyway \u2026 James Wicklund : I\u2019ll take restocking consumables. I\u2019ll take that as the first step. Jeffrey Miller : Okay. Step one. James Wicklund : Okay guys, I appreciate it. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Jeffrey Miller : Okay, thank you, Shannon. I\u2019d like wrap up this call with just a few key takeaways. First, we like our position. We've maintained our global integrated service footprint, outperformed during the downturn and taken share. Second, for North America the landing point is now behind us and our customers are talking about growth, not survival. And finally, we\u2019re the best position for the recovery. We will on the last mile continue to address our cost structure and collaborate with our customers to maximize their asset value. Look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Shannon, you can close out the call. Operator : Ladies and gentleman, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Lance Loeffler, Halliburton\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Lance Loeffler : Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton third quarter 2016 conference call. Today\u2019s call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton\u2019s website for seven days. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Jeff Miller, President. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton\u2019s views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton\u2019s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other securities and exchange commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also may include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our third quarter press release, which can be found on our website. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave. Dave Lesar : Thank you, Lance and good morning to everyone. Let me start by saying that I am very pleased with our results. I never thought I would be so satisfied by barely making a profit. But given where this market is, I certainly am. Through hard work and determination, we have returned to positive territory for our earnings. Now, this has been a historic down cycle for the industry and it\u2019s had its fair share of challenges. Our organization is meeting those challenges head-on and fighting through them. I am very proud of our leadership and all of our employees. We are the execution Company and I believe this quarter we out-executed even the very high expectations we placed on our organization. Let\u2019s take a minute and talk about what transpired over the quarter. Our North America revenue grew 9% for the period, representing the first revenue increase in seven quarters. Our results improved as we took advantage of the rig count growth by focusing on increasing utilization and working our surface efficiency model. Our customers\u2019 animal spirits remain alive and well in North America even though for some they may feel caged in a bit by cash flow constraints in the short-term. The average U.S. rig count increased 14% over the quarter, driven primarily by rig additions to smaller operators where we saw a trend of less service intensive wells, which is not activity typically worth chasing at today\u2019s pricing. This quarter was also impacted by the natural lag time between drilling and completion activity. However, we are now seeing completion activities starting to pick-up as we start the fourth quarter. We continue to aggressively implement our structural cost reductions announced in our first quarter call, and we have met our goal. On a monthly basis, we have already achieved the run rate of a $1 billion of cost savings annually. We also generated over a $1 billion in cash flow from operating activities this quarter. As you all know, as we executed our playbook, we gained significant market share globally through the downturn. As the markets stabilize, our primary focus will now switch to improving our margins while maintaining that market share. In the U.S., we believe we now have the highest market share we\u2019ve ever had. And at this point, if we have to give some of it back to move margins up, we might take that approach. In North America, we achieved a 41% incremental margin. This is a strong step in the right direction as we work to regain profitability there. We remain steadfast in our belief that significant activity increases from our customers starts with sustainable commodity prices over $50 per barrel, which we haven\u2019t seen in any meaningful way yet since the rig count activity bottomed out.  Operators have had time to reflect on our future drilling plans, and I believe they will approach the recovery with a rational, methodical response in activity based on commodity price fluctuations. Now, looking ahead to the fourth quarter on North America land, activity levels are difficult to call at this point. Based on current customer feedback, we remain cautious around customer activity due to holiday and seasonal weather related downturns. Our customers may take extended breaks, starting as early as Thanksgiving and push additional work to the first quarter of 2017. As one customer told me, Dave, it doesn\u2019t make any sense for me to rent an efficient high-spec rig, if I have to start and stop all the time for the holidays or the last five weeks of the year. I just can\u2019t get the efficiencies I\u2019m paying for in the rig. I would rather just wait till next year to start drilling. And I believe we will see a lot of that mentality in the fourth quarter. But that being said, it does not change our view that things are getting better for us and our customers. Now, let\u2019s turn internationally. I like where our market share is today in the international markets, and I believe we continue to outperform our peers. I expect the international markets to slowly grind downward due to the lower commodity price environment. We experienced activity and pricing headwinds during the quarter, but in anticipation of those forces, we aggressively managed our cost. Although we have had to concede some on pricing, we have worked closely with our customers during the past year to improve their project economics to technology and operating efficiency. We expect to see a bottoming of the international rig count in the first half of 2017. Land-based mature field activity should lead the international recovery, while we expect the deepwater complex to remain so severely challenged for the foreseeable future. Even though the light at the end of the tunnel is getting brighter, there is no question we remain in a very challenging market. However, we\u2019re confident in our ability to navigate through this cycle and in our continued focus on unconventional mature fields in deepwater markets. As we have said before, unconventional, particularly those in North America are leading their recovery in activity, providing the optimal combination of short cycle returns and fastest incremental barrel to market. Mature fields continue to be resilient given their relatively low lifting cost. And finally, deepwater remains structurally challenged with higher costs and long duration project characteristics. While each faces a different set of circumstances today, you can be sure we\u2019re looking at our business closely to ensure that we accelerate our growth in each sector as the industry begins to heal. As we have said for some time, North America has assumed there role of swing producer in global oil production. Because of this shift away from production discipline, which was historically created by OPEC, our industry will likely experience shorter commodity price cycles going forward. So, we see the future market as a combination of shorter cycles and range-bound commodity prices. In that environment, it is imperative that we returns-focused companies like Halliburton be more asset-light. Having an organization, structuring in a way that is flexible, nimble and efficient and that can adapt to these new quick-moving cycles will be critical to drive the returns results our shareholders have come to expect. Our philosophy is then in prioritizing returns over margins and revenue, and that philosophy will continue. Now don\u2019t get me wrong. We are always focused on improving margins. But keep in mind, the last cycle of $100 oil covered up terrible inefficiencies across the industry. In today\u2019s environment, asset utilization will be just as critical to improving margins. And I have full confidence we\u2019re taking the necessary steps to achieve that. Positioning us for success while navigating through this deep cyclical downturn was one of the most intellectually stimulating management challenges we have ever had. And I am confident that Halliburton management team has and will continue to successfully meet each and every challenge. With that let me turn the call over to Mark and Jeff to cover our financial and operational results. Mark? Mark McCollum : Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s start with the summary of our third quarter results compared to our second quarter results on an adjusted basis. Total Company revenue for the quarter was flat at $3.8 billion, while our operating income doubled to a $128 million. These results were primarily driven by increased activity in North America and the continued impact of our global cost savings initiatives. Moving to our regional results, North America revenue increased 9% with the $58 million increase in operating results or 47% sequentially. The higher U.S. land rig count coupled with better equipment utilization and our ongoing cost management efforts drove this improvement. In Latin America, revenue and operating income declined by 13% and 50% respectively. These results primarily reflect reduced activity levels in Mexico, Argentina and Venezuela as we\u2019ve now experienced a 15-year low in the regional rig count. Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue declined 6% as a result of lower drilling activity in West Africa and Continental Europe. Operating income increased 19%, primarily related to our cost savings initiatives and improved pressure pumping and pipeline service profitability throughout the region. In Middle East/Asia, revenue declined 3% with the decline in operating income of 4%. The decrease through the quarter was primarily driven by reduced activity across Asia Pacific, including Australia and Indonesia as well as pricing pressure across the entire region. Our corporate and other expense for the third quarter totaled approximately $47 million, which was positively impacted by a true-up of some of our insurance reserves. For the fourth quarter, we expect our corporate expense to return to our previous run rate of approximately $60 million. Interest expense for the quarter was a $141 million and was positively impacted by the interest income we\u2019re now earning on the Venezuelan promissory notes we accepted in exchange for some of our trade receivables last quarter. We expect that this level of net interest expense will be our new run rate for the next several quarters. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was a 114% benefit, well above the already unusual 50% rate we anticipated on our last call. As we\u2019ve discussed before, these unusual effective tax rates are primarily the result of having tax losses in the U.S. that are offset by taxable income in foreign jurisdictions with lower statutory rates. However, the difference this quarter from the rate we anticipated was largely due to an adjustment reflecting the beneficial use of an Argentinean tax treaty that limits the taxation of royalty payments for intellectual property and will allow for more efficient movement of our foreign cash in the future. Based on our current outlook, we anticipate that our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter will be approximately 65%. Turning to cash flow, we improved our cash position during the third quarter, ending the period with $3.3 billion in cash and equivalents even after paying off $600 million of senior notes. This increase in cash flow was primarily due to working capital improvements which included a seven-plus-day reduction of our day sales outstanding and the receipt of a series of tax refunds. Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be approximately $850 million. Now, turning to our short-term operational outlook, let me provide you with our thoughts on the fourth quarter. In North America, the uncertainty surrounding customer activity around the holiday season makes the quarter difficult to predict. Based on what our customers are collectively telling us, we anticipate our revenue to perform in line with the rig count and we expect our sequential incremental margins to be 35% to 40%. In our international business, we believe the typical seasonal uptick in year in software and products sales will be minimal this year as customer budgets are exhausted and may not fully offset continued pricing and activity pressures. As such, we expect fourth quarter revenue and margins to come in flat compared to the third quarter. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff? Jeff Miller : Thank you, Mark and good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to thank and congratulate all of our employees for their fantastic execution throughout the cycle. It\u2019s been a tough two years and our organization has delivered on service quality, has delivered on cost savings and has absolutely executed on our value preposition, collaborating and engineering solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. The result of this execution was improved margins and repeat business. So, let\u2019s start with North America. While the supply and demand balance for U.S. onshore services is heading in the right direction, we are still in an oversupplied equipment market. Our customers remain focused on cost and producing more barrels. I believe this puts us in an excellent position. No one is better collaborating with customers to engineer solutions that deliver the lowest cost per BOE than Halliburton. In fact, the more I talk to customers, the more I\u2019m convinced this is the winning formula. In pressure pumping, we estimate that the U.S. active fleet, I emphasize \u2018active\u2019 grew to over $7 million horsepower and the utilization of that active marketed fleet is about 70%. This is a long way from full capacity, but it represents substantial tightening during the third quarter. And as I said last quarter, this is the first step towards a balanced market for the industry\u2019s available fleet. And while we know the industry has additional horsepower on the sidelines that could come into the market, we also know that this additional equipment require substantial maintenance to be put back to work, and will require adequate price increases to justify its return. So, as we look ahead, we expect pricing to work its way through a couple of predicable steps. The first step which we\u2019re starting to see now is a tightening of active capacity. This will have a modest price impact but more importantly, it allows increased utilization to have a positive contribution to earnings. Step two is when we see equipment requiring significant investment returning to the market. I expect that this will require a significantly higher pricing to justify the investment. This is by no means traditional pricing power; instead, it\u2019s the industry recognizing the relationship between investments and returns plateau. Market share is valuable and that\u2019s why we build it in the downturn. I think Dave was crystal clear that our target is leading returns, and we have not forgotten that. High market share gives us choice in the recovery to work with the most efficient customers and value what we do and who ultimately reward us for helping them make better wells. There is no doubt that in this environment our clients are planning work based on commodity price. The stakes had never been higher for us to help maximize the value of their assets. And this is exactly what we\u2019re doing. So, let me take you through some examples of how we\u2019re doing this today. Last quarter, we worked with a Permian operator who wanted to step outside of their core assets and find a way to optimize the value of their acreage. With the robust drilling and completion plan in place, the customer started to minimize completion damage during flowback and maximize overall recovery. Through the use of our CALIBR Engineered Flowback service, we were able to prevent damage and achieve a 15% higher cumulative production on this well than on wells nearby with similar completions. The well is now the best producer in the customer\u2019s portfolio despite it being in the geology that had been originally considered marginal. There has been a lot of talk about drilling in core reservoir rock recently. I believe it\u2019s now our job to help our customers extend the definition of core. This is a great example of how we listen to our customers drivers and work with them to develop a unique solution to make their goals. CALIBR not been used before in the Permian but thanks to this success, it\u2019s gained traction in that basin. In the Middle East, we recently engaged in a highly collaborative project where the customer\u2019s drivers were to improve delivery time and production. We developed a solution that stimulated a well in less time and in a more cost effective manner. Using our surgi-squeeze technique where coiled tubing is used to deliver more focused stimulation to selective areas we were able to use fewer chemicals and reduce pumping time by 40%. This highlights how Halliburton systematically collaborates with the customer, the engineered solution that maximizes our asset value. In Brazil, we worked to maximize our customer\u2019s asset value through intelligent completions. These are essential in the pre-salt area to improve reservoir management and production, while reducing the overall well cost. In the quarter, we completed a multiyear campaign of 40 successful intelligent completions, which lowered the lifting cost dramatically. This is what clients like about Halliburton. We collaborate, meaning listen and respond to our customers. We focus on creating and maintaining strong client relationships. It\u2019s why we win and keep work. It\u2019s why we get things done and why we are the execution Company. To sum up, I\u2019ve walked through our value proposition and action, and it\u2019s equally effective in all of our strategic markets unconventionals, mature fields and deepwater. The takeaway is that Halliburton is well-positioned to win the recovery in each of these markets. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave for closing comments. Dave? Dave Lesar : Thanks Jeff, and let me summarize. As we predicted, the North America unconventional market has responded the quickest demonstrated by the increase in recent rig count activity. However, we continue to believe meaningful activity increases from our customers will not start until we see sustainable commodity prices above $50 per barrel. And while the international markets will take a little more time to rebound, we are maintaining our integrated global services footprint, managing costs and continuing to fight for market share. We expect to see the bottom for activity in this market to occur in the first half of 2017. In this global recovery, we expect cycle times to accelerate. I believe successful companies will be characterized by a lighter asset base, faster asset velocity and job side execution, all geared to respond quickly to deliver returns. So, to me, no matter what market is handed to us, Halliburton is well-positioned, and our dedication to execution gives me confidence that we will continue to outperform our peers. With that, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from James West with Evercore ISI. You may begin. James West : I wanted to dig in, Dave or Jeff, on the pricing question around North American pressure pumping. At this point, I know you\u2019ve indicated you\u2019ve got the market share, so you\u2019ll give up some in order to get profitability up. Are you starting to see the early signs of some pricing gains in certain basins, and maybe it\u2019s not in the Permian but maybe some of the basins where equipment has migrated out of? Jeff Miller : Pricing is still, yes, I\u2019ll describe it overall as a brawl. As I said, we\u2019re always pushing on pricing. We\u2019re seeing small increases in different basins, but where we\u2019re most focused around those customers with whom to collaborate the best. And I\u2019ve always said that the tightening of utilization was a critical first step and we are beginning to see that. We\u2019re also moving away in some cases from work where we don\u2019t see a similar clear path to returns. James West : And then maybe a follow-up on that, so I guess your strategy for unstacking equipment at this point, you suggested it\u2019s more of a conversation about returns on the assets. That would assume that you need at least some level of price increase to bring stacked equipment, even if it\u2019s in great shape back to work? Jeff Miller : Spot on James, I mean the equipment\u2019s got to make returns. And in my view this does require step up in price. And so for that reason, we don\u2019t have current plans to have or start to the market. I would expect the next round of investment broadly to drive better discipline related to returns. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. You may begin. Jud Bailey : A question for Dave or Jeff, I was hoping -- could you expand maybe Dave on your comments, in your prepared comments, on the need to be asset light, I think you said in the context of a shorter cycle that you envisioned, does this reflect any type of change in how you are going to run the business or strategy or how you think about investing in the business given your comments? Jeff Miller : We\u2019re focused on everything that drives returns. And in my view, the shorter cycles are really closer to our value preposition, which is execution and the last mile. And so for example, it\u2019s not vertical integration for the sake of integration and it\u2019s not -- and it\u2019s variabilizing everything that makes sense to variabilizing our business. So, then therefore, we\u2019re improving margins through better utilization and obviously pricing. Velocity, as we come out of this will be more important than ever and we continue to do things that drive that velocity in all parts of our business. And we clearly believe this is how we drive leading industry returns. Jud Bailey : And I guess my follow-up is the guidance for North America in the fourth quarters is pretty straight forward. I was wondering do you -- what kind of visibility you may have in terms of calendar for the first quarter, early 2017. Obviously it will be dependent on where oil prices shake out and what OPEC ultimately does. It sounds like you\u2019ve got some customers who are starting to lineup work for 2017 at this point. And I was wondering if you could perhaps give any color to that effect. Jeff Miller : Well, we see -- as we talked about Q4, I mean at this point, the board is full. But we\u2019re not clear whether that\u2019s customer optionality or not. History would say, we slow down in the holidays. That would push more work into the first part of next year. But again that part of the market is not as clear at this point in time. So, we are going to manage our cost and manage our businesses. We look at that to keep the structural cost and savings in place and be absolutely positioned for when the recovery happens or where that happens. Mark McCollum : This is Mark. I think our general view is that Q1 is going to be better, right. And the customers are engaging but the amount -- how much better it\u2019s going to be is still going to be highly dependent on what the commodity price is going into the first part of next year. So, we think we\u2019re clearly on a path for recovery. Operator : Thank you. Our next is from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your may begin. Scott Gruber : So, I was down in the Permian about a month ago and met with a collection of operators, and everyone just was discussing more sand per well and longer laterals, two trends that everyone has been discussing for a while. The trend that stuck out to me and which appears less well appreciated is the trend towards more frack stages per well. A couple of operators were discussing shifting towards fully 40, 50-stage wells and one was actually discussing pushing towards 90-stage wells. Are you seeing this trend in the Permian? And if so, can you discuss the impact on the requisite pump time to complete these wells? Jeff Miller : Look, we are seeing a move towards shorter spacing on the stages which ultimately drives more stages, and this will drive more service intensity for us. More stages means more plugs, means more perfs, earns more sand. So, you get the point but just don\u2019t forget that the most important thing is making a better well, ultimately which involves stimulating more rock. And so, I would say that the precise placement of the sand is probably the most important thing. And that\u2019s where we spend our time is optimal frac design and placement and really further precisely why we focus so much around sub surface inside, and ultimately how to make a better well. Scott Gruber : And just generally, are you seeing operators outside of the Permian squeeze the spacing as well as is this just a Permian phenomenon? Jeff Miller : I would say that what\u2019s right is what\u2019s right for the rock. And I think you\u2019re seeing that moving into Permian basin, probably less so in another places, so constantly trying new ways to again get more sand in the right place as opposed to just more sand. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Angie Sedita with UBS. You may begin. Angie Sedita : I echo the congrats on impressive quarter given market conditions and also Dave your sense of realism on shorter cycles and range-bound oil prices is certainly appreciated. On the question, I think the first question for Mark is do you -- we are talking about this asset light model, do you still see other structural costs that you can be pulling out of the system in North America and internationally into 2017? Mark McCollum : I think that we\u2019ve never finished in terms of reviewing our overall structural costs. Jeff made the comment earlier about variabalizing costs. And I think there are some things that we haven\u2019t necessarily always thought of as structural. They are -- they would be variable in a definition of how we would typically look at them. But when we talk about variabalizing those, we\u2019re talking about possibly looking at do lease versus buy; do we turn the depreciation charge into a lease charge; do we rent versus own; what can we do to continue to try to increasingly create optionality in our business, so that we can flex with the market overall but more importantly flex with our customers, to making sure as they continue to evaluate, how they want to do their wells or where they want to do their wells that we can move with them and be as nimble as possible. So, I think that we\u2019re going to go into next year. Jeff alluded to this, even though we believe the year will be better, we\u2019re going to plan very aggressively flat in terms of our structural cost. And even planning flat requires the organization to continue to really focus on what can we do from a continuous improvement standpoint to continue to drive that cost. I believe you\u2019re never done, and we\u2019re going to continue to go forward. Angie Sedita : So going back to North America pressure pumping, you\u2019ve made comments in the past on what you thought the margin outlook would be, if you have your fully deployed fleets at full utilization. Can you give us your updated thoughts there? The currently deployed fleet at full utilization. Jeff Miller : Yes. What I would do is let\u2019s go back to kind of a margin progression for the business and in my view it\u2019s a path back rather than a dramatic job. And so, as we said, certain things have to happen around equipment tightening and attrition and it starts with making positive operating income then returning the cost to capital, and then pushing for industry leading returns. Clearly, we\u2019re starting from a lower base, but the formula is very much the same and it\u2019s the formula that we know. Mark McCollum : We\u2019re definitely going to need some price to back toward the historic margins that we\u2019ve had in the past and historic returns. But the first order of business is to get capacity tightened up in the market. We believe the activity levels in the Permian and others all are serving to work equip harder, it\u2019s going to tighten up equipment faster and we\u2019re starting to see price against the edges and we\u2019ll continue to drive that forward as we hold the line of cost and it\u2019s -- we\u2019re going to get there. The model is the same and we\u2019ve just got to execute. Angie Sedita : And so, is it fair to assume that that pricing outlook, that improvement is back half 2017 based on what you know today? Mark McCollum : I think we\u2019ll start seeing pricing earlier than that. I mean we\u2019re working on it every day with every customer and the fringes -- and it\u2019ll be probably a slow march forward initially until things tighten up and then begin to accelerate. And hopefully we\u2019re going to be pushing this hard as we can to get back to 20% as quick as we can. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Herbert with Simmons. You may begin. Bill Herbert : So, Mark, a quick question with regard to the guidance for the fourth quarter and sensibly, you seem to be a little bit conservative about North American top line and sort of in line with the rig count obviously [ph] expectation. But you\u2019ve got a loaded frac calendar according to Jeff\u2019s commentary, Dave\u2019s commentary completions lagged activity in the third quarter and now starting to pull through in the fourth quarter. Why wouldn\u2019t completions and frac activity in Halliburton\u2019s North American top line outpace the rig count in Q4? Dave Lesar : Let me take that one. I think as Jeff said, the frac calendar is full but my 20 years of being -- 20 years or so of being in-charge of this thing shows me that customers like to grab optionality in the fourth quarter by filling the frac calendar. And it doesn\u2019t always come true that we utilize that work, and that calendar can get dumped pretty aggressively toward the end of the year, toward the end of the fourth quarter. So, we\u2019re just cautioning people that we don\u2019t know yet. It\u2019s really up to our customers as to whether they\u2019re going to go forward and turn the optionality into real work. And my experience has been some years it happens but most years they start to pull things off the calendar as the holidays get there. And you\u2019ve got the added I think dimension this year, where the commodity price is, what they can buy -- are, they going to spend their money buying strips for next year, are they going to basically want to continue to use these high spec rigs in a sporadic way or just wait till next year where they can run them out on a pad and run them for 60, 80, 90, 100 days and get the efficiencies from them. So, we\u2019re just trying to draw a little bit of caution out there that there\u2019s probably more variables in this Q4 than typically there might be because we\u2019re bouncing off the bottom at this point in time. Bill Herbert : And in line with\u2026 Jeff Miller : Bill, I was just going to say the follow-on, you also recognize we saw little bit in Q3 that as we try to improve our margins and returns on this, we are in some cases letting some bad contracts go, things that don\u2019t work for us making money in order to improve the utilization and profitability on others. And so, it may not necessarily follow directly with the rig count to get out\u2026. Bill Herbert : And then Dave, in line with your pretty stark but realistic commentary about deepwater, I\u2019m just curious as to how you\u2019re thinking about your global deepwater footprint right now and whether that represents another significant round of call it right-sizing for Halliburton in terms of cost cutting reductions? Dave Lesar : Bill, let me let Jeff handle that one because he\u2019s dealing with it every day. Jeff Miller : We like our footprint around the world and I think deepwater certainly has important role to play. It\u2019s clearly the most stressed today and that\u2019s partly just because as we collaborate and look at ways to lower the cost per BOE that they just don\u2019t get as many add backs. Clearly, it\u2019s structurally disadvantaged because of duration which gets to not only the time value of money but also the speed with which those barrels meet demand requirements. All of that said, still believe it has an important role. And we know how to flex the cost around those facilities but I will tell you keeping that footprint in place is something we will do. Again, I have described our value preposition around last mile execution. That means you have to be present to win, and we plan to be present. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. You may begin. David Anderson : Thank you. I think Mark, you just kind of touched on I was going to ask you there. I was wondering if you could expand a bit on the increased utilization in North America. Is that just continuing to squeeze up a wide space, is it dropping certain customers as far as active? It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re reactivating equipment. And I\u2019m just trying to understand how I should think about utilization going forward concerning your saying margins are now taking a priority over market share. Mark McCollum : Well, I guess we\u2019re in a unique point in the market right now where we are setting up with -- we\u2019ve got choice because we have market share. And so, as we go through that, it\u2019s not one way or the other necessarily, it\u2019s all about where we see the path to profitability, those clients that utilize what we do best in the best way so that is mutually beneficial for both of us. So, it\u2019s not as clear as one or the other by any means, particularly as we work through this part of the market. What I really like is where we\u2019re positioned. And as I\u2019ve said, we\u2019re not going to add equipment until we see clearly better returns, and I think that\u2019s going to be prohibited to others to add equipment until the price moves where it needs to be. Dave Lesar : Clearly, our utilization has gone up quite dramatically as a part of this process and that was a large part of what helped the margins this quarter; we\u2019re going to continue to work that formula here for the next quarter or so. David Anderson : Okay. And just a follow-up question; one of the other things we hear from E&Ps now there\u2019s been a talk about moving more to slickwater fracks. Just wondering how that could potentially change kind of revenue and margin potential on your pressure pumping business as we move ahead to next year. Dave Lesar : I mean slickwater is clearly harder on equipment and it\u2019s something we ought to get paid for. Fortunately, the Q10s were designed to operate more effectively at the higher rates that are demanded by slickwater. So, we\u2019re preferentially positioned around that. And I would also go further to say that today\u2019s market is the mix bag of frac designs, So, we still see quite a bit of gel, some hybrid and yes certainly slickwater. But when I think about the longer-term future, where does it go, the key point is controlling the frac in our view. And that\u2019s why we study chemistry. And we think that it\u2019s not one size fits all; it\u2019s actually what is the right size for that rock and that\u2019s why we\u2019re that focused on making better wells. Jeff Miller : It\u2019s always important to remember that Halliburton operates in every basin across the whole of North America. And what\u2019s happening just in the Midland or Delaware, in the Permian isn\u2019t -- every basin, every rock is different. And so, we go to market where the customer needs to get the best well in those markets. And so, it will be -- we\u2019re uniquely positioned to get the best out of our equipment and of our projects. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital. You may begin. Kurt Hallead : Dave, a question for you, you mentioned the shift in the strategy to go asset light. By definition, frac is very asset intensive. So, I was hoping you give a little bit more color around the context of asset light. Dave Lesar : I think as we\u2019ve said, it\u2019s not a shift in strategy; it\u2019s a continuation of a strategy where more continuation of a philosophy is that we\u2019re returns driven first. And to the extent we can get by with less assets, we can variablize our asset base, then we are going to continue to do that and that\u2019s really all it means. So, I don\u2019t want anybody to read too much into this. It\u2019s just a prioritization of returns and when you\u2019re prioritizing returns first, the fewer assets you can do the same amount of work with, the better your returns are going to be, the better your margins are going to be. And that\u2019s really where we are. Kurt Hallead : Got it. And then, follow-up on the comment about potentially being willing to get some share for margins, was that U.S. market specific? Dave Lesar : We take a look at every basin, every customer, every geography every day and make those decisions on a real time basis. It\u2019s the benefit of having the market share we have, having the great customer base we have, having a great footprint that we have and allows us the optionality of making those decisions each and every day. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse. You may begin. Jim Wicklund : There has been a lot made about the rigs that have gone to work so far have been low calorie rigs, private companies by private equity sponsor drilling wells, primarily in the Permian and trying to drill as cheap as they can. It would seem that in your market share progression that you\u2019ve gone after bigger companies that work 24/7 that the drill complex wells. Has the move so for off the bottom been a rig count that is not clearly beneficial to you guys and is that one of the issues that will be solved as we get into 2017 and more established companies pick up drilling? Jeff Miller : Jim, the rigs that we\u2019re seeing, as you describe them are probably less service intensive and they have also tended to be less about big new capital programs and more around -- and what we\u2019ve seen has been more around repairing or trying to sustain a bit of production, which looks and feels quite a bit different. I fully believe tough that this comes right over the next period of time because, again where we can do engage is when they start to make the bigger decisions around how to design fracs where we are going to be positioned and getting up to sort of full speed and full velocity. That\u2019s when our assets work the hardest and that\u2019s where we\u2019re the most efficient. And again part of being, as Dave said around asset light is not -- is velocity as much as it is anything else. And so, we\u2019re drilling long horizontals and we\u2019re full on. That\u2019s where we absolutely are best. Jim Wicklund : Yes. I have no doubt about that, it\u2019s just that we haven\u2019t seen a lot of the drilling that\u2019s taken place here in the last six months be those kind of programs and those kinds of wells, but I\u2019m sure that\u2019ll turn. My follow-up if I could, sand, if I just do back of the envelope stuff, you guys buy and supply to your customers a great deal of sand and coming out with at least $1.5 billion a year of it, and dollars that comes through, does that all come through your income statement, Mark, and is there a margin to that, or if I were to take these sand pass-through revenues off your income statement, would that have the appreciable benefit to margins, am I looking at this right? Mark McCollum : So, yes, we do buy sand for our customers account and that that\u2019s on the ticket. We bill -- we in a typical market, we would bill that sand with the margin that\u2019s designed to recover the cost of the delivery. We do the delivery; we take it to mine; we move it by rail through transloading and essentially then arrange logistics to move the last mile to the well site. So, we don\u2019t articulate all that cost out but the margin is designed to recover that cost and put it in line with the other margins that we have across the pumping and other service side of our business. Obviously, what\u2019s happening right now is we\u2019re not earning a margin on a lot of that business, I mean in some cases we may. But the practical reality when you\u2019re negative in North America and particularly on the pressure pumping side, you\u2019re not making money on the sand. I mean, you can look at it as right now we\u2019re buying sand for our customers account. And that\u2019s not a sustainable practice. And so that\u2019s a large part of what we\u2019re trying to repair. But, we do believe that our ability -- the scale of the operation that we have, the amount of sand that we move, the quality and the efficiency of the transloading operation and we provide a significant value add to our customers. We can make sure that arise on time and quantity. When the supplies get tight, our logistics get complex, they don\u2019t have to worry about working with Halliburton to get it there. And we\u2019re never waiting on sand\u2026 Jim Wicklund : I figure if MLP valuations ever come back, you\u2019re going to get a great deal of pressure to spin that off, that\u2019s how good you are. Okay, Mark. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JP Morgan. You may begin. Sean Meakim : You guided the flattish margins next quarter for international, given the minimal seasonal benefit. Thinking about the first half of \u201817, how much of that bottoming comes from the seasonal drop off in the first quarter versus ongoing budget challenges in some markets, maybe like Latin America? Just trying to think about does that guidance imply 2017 budgets likely flatter or say flat to lower year-over-year but with that sequential improvement in the back half? Jeff Miller : The international business traditionally lags North America by six to nine months. So, that\u2019s just sort of broadly across all of the markets in terms of activity. And we\u2019re continuing to see and if you look at sort of geographically outside of the resilience in the Middle East business, there\u2019s been a substantial decline in activity commensurate with the commodities. And certainly Latin America\u2019s had historical low; Asia Pacific is down in some ways as much as 50% in terms of rig count that we see in the marketplace. And so, and I think that that continues into kind of the first part of next year and there is obviously the resetting budgets with the national oil companies and a lot of things that conspire to slow that down. So certainly not clear but we expect consistent with sort of our outlook that middle of next year\u2019s where we start to see that repairing. Mark McCollum : I think that we don\u2019t really have a lot of visibility from customers yet. The first quarter will be down seasonally as usually in North Sea and Russia that has the largest impacts and then to a lesser extent in Latin America you\u2019ll have some delays as NOCs reset their budgets and then begin to work. But I think that veracity of the -- once we hit the bottom in international in early part of the next year, the veracity of any recovery is going to be based on what the commodity price outlook gives at that point in time. Sean Meakim : Got it, understood, it\u2019s that it\u2019s still early. And then just one more question on the Permian if I could, the Permian is very much the focus among the E&Ps today, particularly the Delaware and the Midland. Just curious if the recovery in activity is less broad based than last cycle and more limited to the Permian? Just how do we think about competition in that market, mix of wells, and customers and how some of that could have an impact on margins and pricing in that basin? Jeff Miller : Permian basin is the most competitive basin in North America today, the majority of the rig adds were in the Permian basin, quite a mix of customers that added rigs doing a variety of things as we\u2019ve already talked about some vertical wells, some proving up acreage, just a range of activity. Starting from a smaller base and other parts of the country, are we seeing some pick up, yes in the rig count and that\u2019s part of the reason we stay engaged in all parts of the market. So, I think that Permian from an activity standpoint will be busy but again, it\u2019s a highly supplied marketplace as well. Sean Meakim : So, maybe some of those other areas could provide opportunities for you all, given how much competition is likely left with those lower activity basins? Jeff Miller : Yes. I mean, our strategy is clear that we want to be in the business and we want to be in the business in a full service way in all of the markets. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Boyd with BMO Capital Markets. You may begin. Daniel Boyd : I\u2019d like to follow up on one of the questions earlier from Jim. And as you think about your logistical network and the infrastructure, I think that\u2019s something we all view as one of the key competitive advantages of Halliburton. Can you maybe give us an update on where your infrastructure currently stands, maybe how much capital was invested in that business, and would you consider different structures to get that off of your book in the future? Dave Lesar : So, we\u2019re not going to give specifics on the total capital invested or anything like that. But I would tell you that we\u2019ve got transloading capabilities in all of the major basins that we feel like that we\u2019ve got sufficient capital and resources to make sure that we can service our own business. It was purposely designed in a way that doesn\u2019t meet 100% of our needs. That\u2019s I\u2019m talking about how you variablize your business. One of those things has been that we have tried to construct that in a manner that meets a significant portion of our transloading needs that allows us to also to be able to flex with the market, should the need arise. And so, we believe right now that it\u2019s an important strategic asset. We\u2019re going to continue to hold that but, I can\u2019t tell you where or if. It\u2019s just one of those things that like any other portion of our business, we will continually look at that, look at the returns that we earn off of that business, its relative importance to customers in the market and make evaluations as we get there. Daniel Boyd : A follow-up is just looking at the Permian and the transloading facilities and basically the sand deliverability infrastructure there, how well utilized is that network and could that be a limit to activity in the Permian at some point? Jeff Miller : Look I don\u2019t see -- I don\u2019t see any limitations currently. There are always parts of that chain that we\u2019re working on how to improve, how to make better, but ultimately we\u2019re able to overcome those sorts of things pretty consistently and as we\u2019ve demonstrated in the past, we\u2019ve led and how we\u2019ve resolved those types of opportunities in market so. And I think to the extent the Permian continues to strengthen, those investments will be made where required. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Rob Mackenzie with Iberia Capital. You may begin. Rob Mackenzie : Thank you, guys. I had a follow-up question on the margin front from earlier. I guess my question is, is with the lean cost structure you talked about, variabalizing cost where you can underutilized existing asset base, why would incremental margins only be in the 35% to 40% range; why shouldn\u2019t we be able to expect to see something higher than that? Mark McCollum : At some point, they will go higher. And it\u2019s usually a progression, right now coming off of bottom, there is still -- we\u2019re fighting every day for some level of pricing and trying to get crews above water. When you have crews below water, it creates some level of stress on your incrementals. And it\u2019s not consistent. Crews -- crew one month could be doing fine, the next month, based on customer choices about working or downtime, maintenance whatever else could go under water. So, until you get everybody consistently above water, the incrementals stay a little bit choppy, but they\u2019ve moved up from what we were expecting. And as a result of the utilization we\u2019re getting, we\u2019re now sort of seeing in that 35% to 40% and making go higher from there. Jeff Miller : Historically, we would see a trough following, the trough in rigs was followed by a trough in margins. And so in my view, we\u2019ve actually accelerated that and a lot of that on the back of the cost reductions and the structural cost moves that we\u2019ve made, which we\u2019ve always said, we wouldn\u2019t see the real benefit of those until we saw some sort of bottom. And so, we\u2019re seeing that. And so in some ways, we\u2019re moving more quickly than we would expect it. Mark McCollum : Yes. And I would just add one more thing and it continues to be -- the comment was on incremental margins for the fourth quarter for North America. And as we said earlier, we\u2019re continuing to factor in some downtime over the holidays, which means your revenues go away but your costs don\u2019t, and that clearly has an impact on your incremental margins at that point in time. But all of that being said and as we said in the call, we said in the release, things are getting better in North America. And I think if you take something away from this call, it\u2019s that thought, not the sort of tactical things we have to do day-to-day to work our way through the quarter. Rob Mackenzie : That\u2019s a good answer, guys. And my follow-up question comes back to I guess the frac calendar, if you will. What are you seeing if anything in terms of larger job requests from your clients, either term work, multi-well pads versus kind of the real very structured spot work we\u2019ve seen; where does that stand in terms of evolution of backlog for you guys? Jeff Miller : Yes. We\u2019re obviously seeing some increase in that in terms of both terms and size. Obviously, we\u2019re not going to comment on strategy at this point in time, but we manage through kind of the optionality and manage our entire portfolio. Dave Lesar : I would just say, listen, our customers are smart, they see 2017 shaping up to be better and they\u2019re going to try to lock in as much time and price as they can at this point in time. And it\u2019s up to us to navigate our way through those requests and make sure that we -- we\u2019re not only there to service them with the equipment they need but we\u2019re there with a price that gives us the kind of returns we need to satisfy our own shareholders. So, it\u2019s going to be a give-and-take but there\u2019s certainly some of that going on right now. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks. Jeff Miller : Thank you, Shannon. And I\u2019d like wrap up the call with just a couple of key points. First, North America unconventional market has a predicted recovered, first, and should continue to strengthen in a plus $50 oil price environment. Secondly, Halliburton strategy is directly pointed at the most important part of the market and collaborating and engineering solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. This along with our customer relationships, geographic footprint and service quality positions Halliburton outperform in the recovery. Now, thank you and I look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentleman, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Lance Loeffler, Halliburton\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Lance Loeffler : Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton fourth quarter 2016 conference call. Today\u2019s call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton\u2019s website for seven days. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Jeff Miller, President; and Mark McCollum, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton\u2019s views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton\u2019s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other securities and exchange commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures, and unless otherwise noted in our discussion, we will be excluding the impact of impairments and other charges and a class action lawsuit settlement. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our fourth quarter press release, which can be found on our website. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave. Dave Lesar : Thank you, Lance and good morning to everyone. Never before in my nearly 40 years in and around the oil and gas industry have I seen a more difficult year for the industry. The down cycle in the 1980s was bad, but 2016 represented the sharpest and deepest industry decline in history. However, today, I\u2019m really excited about what I see happening. Now, we came through 2016 in pretty good shape. First, I want to highlight a few of our 2016 accomplishments. We finished the year with total Company revenue of nearly $16 billion and adjusted operating income of $690 million. And once again, we believe we outpaced our primary competitor in growing our market share. We generated significant cash flow from operating activities during the second half of the year and increased our cash position for the full year. We successfully completed our structural cost initiatives and were able to cut more than a $1 billion in costs out of our business. Now for some fourth quarter highlights. I believe, we had a fantastic quarter in executing our strategy. First and foremost, I am very pleased to announce that we returned to operating profitability in North America after three quarters of losing money. We achieved incremental margins of 65% in North America, and we continue to clearly gain market share as we outgrew our primary competitor in not only North America, but Latin America and the Eastern Hemisphere. We gained significant market share throughout the downturn, coming out of it the highest market share in North America that we\u2019ve ever had. And in Q4, we utilized this increased share to drive margin improvement, and I\u2019ll discuss that in a few minutes. In the Eastern Hemisphere, we maintained our margins quarter-over-quarter, despite continued stress on pricing and revenue activity. We achieved over a $1 billion in cash flow from operations in Q4 alone, underlining our commitment to efficient working capital management. On a low light, as a result of the devaluation of the Egyptian pound, our $0.04 per share adjusted operating results did get hit by significant foreign exchange loss of $53 million or $0.06 per share. Now, these results reflect successful execution in a tough environment and position us for the challenges and opportunities ahead. Now, let me take a few minutes to discuss what we\u2019re seeing in the market today, and our prospects and challenges for the coming year. Despite the positive sentiment surrounding North American land, it is important to remember that our world is still a tale of two cycles. While the North America market appears to have rounded the corner and is on the upswing, the international downswing is still playing out. Let\u2019s talk about North America. On the second quarter call, I told you that customer animal spirits were back in North America. Last quarter, I said that these animal spirits were alive, but somewhat caged up. Now, these animal spirits have broken free and they are running. However, not all customers are running in the same direction or as a pack, but they are running. These animal spirits can be seen by the dramatic increase in customer M&A activity, energy industry initial and secondary company offerings, the significant private equity capital moving into resource plays and of course the increase in the rig count. Customers are excited again, and our conversations have changed from being only about cost control to how we can meet their incremental demand. As things began to recover in Q3 and Q4, we made a conscious strategic choice to not chase additional market share and erode our profits further. Therefore, our North American revenue did not grow at the same pace as the rig count for the last several quarters. The historically high level of market share we built in the downturn gives us what we call the power of choice in the recovery. This is the ability to work with the most efficient customers who value what we do and who reward us for helping them make better wells. With this power of choice, we continued to execute our strategy of high grading the profitability of our portfolio with customers that value our services. Let me tell you how that strategy worked. In Q1 and Q2 in a competitive pricing environment, we built the highest market share we ever had in North America, by demonstrating to our customers the benefits of our efficiency and technology and the ability to make better wells. We saw that historical high market share as an advantage and we wanted to utilize it. In Q3, we told you that we were willing to strategically trade some of that historically high market share for better profitability. Clearly, the time had come to improve returns and that is what we told our customers. In Q4, as demand for our equipment increased and availability tightened, our customer discussions revolved around the unsustainable pricing that was in place and the need for us to make a return before we were willing to continue to work for them or add new equipment. If a customer agreed to better pricing, we continued to work for them, if not, we took that equipment and use it to fill the incremental demand with a customer that shared our view on how to work together and make better wells. These conversations about the need for a healthy, profitable and viable service industry were sometimes hard, but they needed to happen. So in effect, we kept active equipment working at a higher price, while we believe our competition brought equipment into the market to fill that demand at a lower price point. They gained share that we no longer wanted while tying up their equipment at a lower price point in an accelerated market. By executing the strategy, we intentionally gave up some market share in the short run, but we met our goal of returning to operating profitability in North America. We did this because it\u2019s important to keep in mind that above all, we are a returns focused Company. As we go into Q1, we continue to benefit from increased demand from customers and are now at the point where we are bringing back cold stacked equipment. This newly activated equipment is only being added at a rate that ensures it is profitable. It should also stabilize our market share at above historical levels. This action is a meaningful step in the right direction to maintaining the leading market share while at the same time achieving industry leading returns. Bringing back equipment is not without a cost, and Jeff will talk about this in today\u2019s pricing dynamics in a minute. So, as I look at 2017 in North America, I really like how it\u2019s shaping up. I expect as we finalize the execution of our strategy that revenue will meet or exceed rig count growth in 2017. However, we will have to contend with the cost of reactivating frac spreads and inflation on our inputs. Keep in mind that our suppliers also expect to benefit from our customers\u2019 animal spirits. So, let\u2019s turn to the international markets. There pricing and activity levels remain under pressure as we near the bottom of the cycle. Low commodity prices have stressed budgets and impacted economics across the deepwater and mature field markets, which has led to decreased activity and pricing throughout 2016. These headwinds still persist today. Now, there has been a lot of debate as to what commodity price will reactivate the higher cost basins, such as the deepwater complex. It is clearly higher than the price that we are seeing today. Also impacting the price will be OPEC compliance with its new production guidance. Most people agree that the U.S. is now the world\u2019s swing producer and it has demonstrated its ability to ramp up production quickly at a price that may make it difficult for deepwater projects to compete. We believe that the race to get deepwater project cost down versus the impact on commodity prices on increasing U.S. shale production will have to play out over the course of 2017. Therefore, we do not expect to see an inflection in the international markets until the latter part of 2017. In the meantime, our international customers remain focused on cash flow, and traditional contracting cycles will likely mute any dramatic rebound coming off the bottom. We expect revenue and margins to slowly grind down during 2017, as the market seeks to stabilize. Overall, our 2016 results show that we have executed in a challenging market. Guided by the lessons learned from past industry cycles, our strategy focused not only on managing cost but also lining our resources to strengthen our market position, and I think we\u2019ve done that. With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff and Mark to cover our operational and financial results. Jeff? Jeff Miller : Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. 2016 certainly was a whale of a tough year. I want to thank each of our employees for their hard work and commitment to execute at every turn and deliver Halliburton\u2019s value proposition. We collaborate in engineered solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. There has been a lot of change in North America over the last few months. Dave shared with you how we used our market share strategy to regain profitability. The next step in boosting profitability is increasing prices. So, let me start by talking about where we see pricing. While rumors are circulating in the industry about huge price increases, that\u2019s just not a universal fact. Given our position in North America, no one knows more about pricing than we do, and here is what I do know. First, I like talking about price increases more than decreases, it\u2019s a nice change. Second, the service price recovery is starting from an extremely low base, in many cases below variable cash costs. Third, the level of pricing that satisfies a particular service company depends on where they are on the profitability continuum. Finally, even though the industry is starting in different profitability levels, every company will have to march back up the same path to profitability. Turning to downturn, our industry went through a steep regression in profitability as pricing and activity declined. The industry moved from positive operating margins to negative operating margins and into negative EBITDA and ultimately round up struggling to cover variable cash costs. It was a fast and hard road that caused a dramatic shift in landscape of the service industry and wiped out a significant amount of shareholder equity. The pricing brawl continues as the industry recovers and equipment availability tightens. Pricing at the margin is ultimately set by whoever is satisfied with the lowest returns. It\u2019s important to understand that our competitors\u2019 motivation from margin returns is largely built around where their pricing is anchored today. For example, if they are at negative variable cost, then they\u2019re trying to get to a negative EBITDA. If they\u2019re at negative EBITDA, then they\u2019re trying to get to negative margin and so on. I can tell you, despite what you hear in the market, it\u2019s clearly a bridge too far to skip from negative variable cash to positive operating margin in one step. So, the industry pricing regression I discussed earlier needs to become a pricing progression. This means that for now Halliburton will have to compete with companies that are satisfied with lower levels of short-term profitability. But, we don\u2019t believe their pricing is sustainable. You can\u2019t have negative margins forever. In the meantime, Halliburton will continue to maintain our focus on execution and service quality as we defend our position without sacrificing price. I believe the superior service quality is a prerequisite to having a meaningful pricing discussion, and our dedication to service quality helps create the profitability results for the quarter. As Dave said, we\u2019re at the point in the cycle where we feel it\u2019s appropriate to bring equipment back into the market. We have a disciplined approach which looks at the required combination of market demand, market share and profitable pricing. Our stacked equipment was the best in the industry when it went on the fence and is the best in the industry as we bring it back. Our manufacturing and maintenance capabilities provide us many levers to pull from reactivating cold stacked equipment to building new. This competitive advantage allows us to minimize the costs and time to deliver the necessary equipment to our customers. Our decision to bring equipment back is based on returns. However, there is an associated expense to activate cold stacked equipment. Industry estimates for reactivating spreads very-widely. And while our efficiency and expertise allows to be on the lower end of the scale, it doesn\u2019t make it free. Because we immediately spend some of the costs to reactivate the equipment, it will be a drag on our margins for a few quarters. To give you a rule of thumb, we believe on average, it will cost a penny per share in the quarter we bringing back a given spread. After we absorb the impact of this additional expense, our margins should accelerate towards the end of the year. Now, turning to the international markets. Latin America had a solid quarter. While the region continues to experience activity and pricing headwinds, we were able to finalize a number of items that have pending throughout the year for which we had deferred profit. We saw uptick in software sales [ph] in Venezuela and Mexico and improved activity in Colombia and Argentina. At the same time, headwinds persist in the larger Latin American markets and until these are alleviated, we do not believe we will see improvement. However, we are committed to the region and believe that oil and gas is a critical element to the region\u2019s broader economic recovery. The Eastern Hemisphere was similarly strong in the fourth quarter, but pricing pressure and offshore exposure mean that we continue to expect some decline for these reasons in the near term. We expect to see an inflection in the rig count in the latter half of 2017, supported by strengthening activity in the land-based mature fields markets. I\u2019m more excited than I have ever been about how our approach to collaboration and maximizing asset value resonates with our customers and employees. We continue to focus on increasing barrels and decreasing cost for our clients. This focus is being rewarded in tender wins across the globe. I could go on and on with examples, but I just want to highlight a few right now. In Oman, we\u2019ve recently started work on $0.5 billion production enhancement contract, which will bring our superior technology and expertise to an exciting tight gas market. In India, we were rewarded a five-rig multiyear contract across several product service lines. This win is a direct result of the team\u2019s integrated approach and efficient solutions, designed to execute the work. It\u2019s a great example of how we can collaborate both internally and whether customers to solve challenges and create results. Landmark had a great quarter and year, our digital solutions including OpenEarth and iEnergy are gain wide acceptance, both our platforms for collaboration that cultivate data sharing, application building, and knowledge discovery. Using our Exploration Insights platform, we started a strategic Basin Mastery project for a customer that will allow comparison of assets across their global portfolio. This will save the customer hundreds of hours of time and millions in financial investments. Reservoir Insight is a great example of how we can maximize our customers\u2019 asset value. These examples show our value proposition at work and highlight the successes we\u2019ve had this year. In many ways, 2016 was like a barroom brawl where everyone and I mean everyone took a punch. It is 2017 now and a brawl will continue but I like our chances in that fight. Why, because we are focused on adding capacity where it\u2019s required, keeping a lid on fixed costs and doing the best job serving our customers. I really look forward to seeing the year unfold. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mark for a financial update. Mark? Mark McCollum : Thanks, Jeff. Let\u2019s start with the summary of our adjusted fourth quarter results compared sequentially to the third quarter. Total Company revenue for the quarter was $4 billion and operating income was $276 million, representing a sequential increase of 5% and 115% respectively. These results were primarily driven by increased activity in North America, the continued impact of our global cost savings initiatives and end of the year software and product sales. Moving to our regional results, North America revenue increased 9% with operating margins improving by approximately 550 basis points. The higher U.S. land rig count drove increased equipment utilization, particularly in our drilling and evaluation product lines. We also saw the impact of our strategy to improve pricing and profitability in our pressure pumping business that Dave described earlier. Latin America revenue increased by 3% and operating income nearly tripled, primarily driven by increased activity levels in Colombia and Argentina, and year-end software sales and consulting in Venezuela and Mexico. Turning to Europe, Africa CIS, we saw fourth quarter revenue decline by 9% with the decrease in operating income of 5%. The decline for the quarter was primarily driven by weather related activity declines in the North Sea and Russia partially offset by improved activity in Egypt and Nigeria. In the Middle East, Asia region, revenue increased by 10% with an increase in operating income of 32%. These results were primarily driven by increased software sales and project management services across the region. Our corporate expense totaled $67 million for the quarter and we anticipate that our corporate expenses will remain in that range for the first quarter of 2017. Net interest expense for the quarter was $137 million, better than our guidance as a function of both higher cash balances and higher money market rates. We expect that this level of net interest expense will remain through the first quarter of 2017. We reported $91 million of other expense for the quarter; this line item was impacted by foreign exchange losses in various countries, primarily due to the strengthening in U.S. dollar. The single largest factor included in our adjusted results was a $53 million or $0.06 per share non-tax deductable impact from the devaluation of the Egyptian pound. Our ability to hedge our exposure to the Egyptian pound in front of this devaluation was limited due to the illiquid nature of the derivative market and the inordinate economic cost associated with entering into any available derivative contracts. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 34%; the quarterly rate is always a function of the tax rate you expect for the full year and 2016\u2019s rate estimates have been particularly volatile because earnings were so slow. This quarter\u2019s rate was also affected by foreign tax assessment and a new deemed profit jurisdiction, the non-deductible exchange loss in Egypt and our earnings mix as the U.S. begins to recover. For the full year 2016, however, our effective tax rate was 24%. And as we go forward in 2017, we\u2019re expecting the full year effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. During the fourth quarter, we also incurred impairments and other pretax charges of $169 million, approximately one-third of which was severance-related cost, primarily to headcount reductions in the Eastern Hemisphere and Latin America as we continue to right size our business to the current market. We also recorded $54 million for the net impact of the previously announced settlement of a long-standing class action lawsuit. This amount was recorded in corporate and other in our GAAP results. Turning to cash flow, we generated $720 million of cash, improving our cash position at year-end of $4 billion. This increase in cash was primarily due to working capital improvements and continued disciplined capital spending. We improved our days sales outstanding in the quarter by 10 days, while our days of inventory dropped by six days. We continue to believe that we\u2019ve moved into a period of shorter duration cycles. And given the amount of excess capital available in the market, we\u2019re hesitant to build any additional tools or equipment unless that is new technology, built for a specific contract we\u2019ve won or the expansion of market share. Consistent with that strategy, we further reduced our capital expenditures as we exited the year, ending 2016 with the total CapEx spend of approximately $800 million. Our current guidance for 2017 capital expenditures is $1 billion. This CapEx guidance includes reactivating cold stacked pressure pumping equipment and continued conversion of our hydraulic fracturing fleet to Q10 pumps to support our surface efficiency strategy. We also expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $1.4 billion for 2017. Of our $4 billion in cash, approximately half is offshore. We require about $1 billion to run the business. Given the strength of our cash position and the potential impact of U.S. tax reform, we\u2019re actively evaluating our options and opportunities around uses of cash, which could include accelerating the maturity of debt, funding acquisitions and organic growth projects or shareholder return opportunities. Now, turning to our near-term operational outlook, let me provide you some comments for the first quarter of 2017. Our international results will be subject to typical weather-related seasonality in the North Sea and Russia, and the roll-off of higher margin year-end software and product sales, which tends to hit Latin America more acutely. This will be exacerbated by the cyclical headwinds that Dave described earlier. Although difficult to predict, at this point, we anticipate first quarter Eastern Hemisphere revenues to decline sequentially by a little under 10% with margins down several hundred basis points. And in Latin America, we anticipate revenues to increase sequentially by mid to low single-digit percentages with margins retreating to the low single-digits. As we move into 2017 in North America, we anticipate subject to weather disruptions that our revenue growth will return to perform in line with U.S. rig count, which is already up 14% against the fourth quarter average. Furthermore, we believe our margins will reflect incrementals of 40% to 45% as they absorb the impact of adding additional pressure pumping equipment to the market. There is one last comment I\u2019d like to make in terms of financial reporting going forward. Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, we\u2019ll start reporting our four geographic regions showing revenue only and we\u2019ll only report operating income by area, which is consistent with our major peer. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Dave for closing comments. Dave? Dave Lesar : So, let\u2019s sum things up. To what it\u2019s worth, we believe we were one of the winners in the 2016 downturn. Our 2016 results reflect our successful execution in a historically tough environment and provides us with the position of strength for the markets ahead. The North America market share we built in the downturn provided us the power of choice and therefore the ability to drive returns. We strategically gave up market share in the short-run for the sake of regaining profitability, but we fully expect to get it back. We are bringing back cold stacked equipment to satisfy customer demand. This equipment will meet our return hurdles and stabilize our market share above historical levels. Each spread, however, will cost us $0.01 per share in the quarter that we bring it back. The headwinds we faced in the international markets in 2016 still persist, and we do not expect to see a turn until latter part of the year. As a result, we will continue to control our costs. And just like we were the winners in the downturn, I fully expect that we will win the recovery. Before we open it up for questions, I want to let you know that due to longstanding travel and business commitments, I will not be participating in our first quarter conference call. Jeff will be providing market comments on my behalf. With that, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Angie Sedita with UBS. You may begin. Angie, your line is open, please check the mute button. Our next question is from David Anderson with Barclays. You may begin. David Anderson : [Technical Difficulty] in terms of your utilization of your logistical network, you\u2019ve mentioned bringing cost structure more variable, at the same time, I just wondered if you consider expanding any part of the chain at this stage? Dave Lesar : Hey, David, you came on -- we missed the first part of your question. David Anderson : Okay. Sorry about that Dave. Yes, I was just asking about with increasing profit intensity in the market share gains you\u2019ve talked about, just curious about where you\u2019re in the utilization of your supply chain and kind of your logistical network as you build that out. Can you kind of help us understand kind of where you think you are and whether or not you think you need to expand that? Jeff Miller : Yes. Thanks, Dave. This is Jeff. Look, the logistical infrastructure that we have continues to prove itself extremely valuable. And as the market tightens, it gets utilized even more. We\u2019ve got sand positions -- trans-load type positions in every market; we\u2019ve invested in the logistics, which in my view is the most important part of that supply chain and that\u2019s the part that gets the tightest the quickest. And so, we like where we are. We even completed some activities through the downturn in key markets. So, we actually never backed away from that, and it will be valuable. David Anderson : Thanks, Jeff. And Dave, maybe a bigger picture question here. I was just kind of curious your take on kind of what the E&Ps are saying now, somewhat publicly. It really continued to downplay or even dismiss the impact of service cost inflation, continue to be adamant the majority of these cost savings have been structural. I was just kind of curious what your take is on this. And if you were in their seat, would you be factoring 5% to 10% increase in cost in the budget or would you be using something higher at this stage? Dave Lesar : I would be using something higher, number one. Number two, clearly, some of the cost reductions are structural, but I think as the equipment tightens, commodity prices increase that everybody wants availability of equipment when they want it, where they want it and how they want it. I don\u2019t see that there is going to be the ability to -- for the customer to hold prices down. I mean it\u2019s going to be a supply and demand market, it always is; we will work with those customers that want to work with us. And really, the model for us hasn\u2019t changed. Efficiency is way more important than pricing. And those customers that want to work with us to keep our equipment efficient are those that we\u2019re going to work with. And I think that we\u2019ll both be winners in that scenario. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Angie Sedita with UBS. You may begin. Angie, your line is open. Please check your mute button. Angie Sedita : So, this question is really for Dave or Jeff. I thought it was very noteworthy here that you\u2019re reactivating fleets today. And I\u2019d appreciate more color on this decision as you actively way out pricing versus sharing your thought? Jeff Miller : Yes. Thanks, Angie. Look, I mean, the decision to add equipment is really around we see the market tightening. And in our view, the market share strategy works through the downturn, and as we bring equipment back, clearly it\u2019s an economic decision; each time we put the equipment back to work, we expect to remain returns. But we also want to maintain that power of choice which is very important to us as the market recovers. And so, as Dave just said, we really like our customer mix today, and we want to make certain that we can serve those customers. And we see that\u2019s a key component of how we win the recovery. Angie Sedita : And then, maybe you could talk about the potential or do you see or is there potential for any bottlenecks in the second half of 2017 at the logistics, sand or people, and is there possibility that could lead to an increase in the pace of pricing across the industry? Jeff Miller : Well, it\u2019s always the same sort of three things. It\u2019s equipment, sand and people that tend to crop up. I\u2019ll take those one at a time though. From an equipment perspective, it\u2019s as much speed the market as it is anything else. And we\u2019re so happy with our manufacturing footprint in Duncan. So, differentially we have that advantage. Sand, again, it\u2019s not the sand volume I believe will be adequate but it\u2019s the logistics. And again, from our perspective, we\u2019re well-positioned there. We\u2019ve maintained that infrastructure and then finally, people. And we were fortunate to keep our experienced people to the degree that we could through the downturn that will pay back as we go into recover mode. And it is easy to forget, but in 2014, we actually hired 21,000 people onto our payroll. So, we have the ability to flex, and so all of those things are being managed today. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from James West with Evercore ISI. You may begin. James West : Jeff, when you talk about the price -- the frac pricing in North America and your ability to raise pricing or to raise pricing with the customers you want to be working with, I guess a couple of things. One is, is all the price increases that you\u2019ve asked were so far sticking? And then two, if you are -- as you on stacked equipment, are you meeting your full return threshold or is this more of a let\u2019s get in front of the market with some market share to get that return later? Jeff Miller : Well, James, the pricing is still the fight. I mean it\u2019s not -- what we\u2019ve seen so far is I\u2019d say to start the utilization and efficiency largely got us to where we are, though clearly we have seen some pricing and that\u2019s progress, but we are absolutely not where we want to be. And so, as we look at equipment, we expect better returns. I think it\u2019s important to note that at least in the last 90 days, we are at a place where more work is in fact helpful. James West : And then, maybe for Mark, just to clarify, I am coming up with on our math about $0.11 of negative currency adjustments for the quarter, so the quarter would be more like $0.15; obviously $0.06 of that from Egypt. And are we correct on that that it all drops to the bottom line, so it would be more like a $0.15 quarter, or I guess you could call it $0.10, if you wanted to say Egypt is the outlier? Mark McCollum : You\u2019re right to assume generally speaking currency losses, because they are essentially -- we are a dollar denominated Company, aren\u2019t tax affected. It\u2019s not at realizable loss in the countries that they recorded. So, that\u2019s true that they\u2019re not tax affected. However, I don\u2019t know that I would jump to that conclusion. Clearly, the Egyptian pound devaluation was something that was something that was sort of out of the norm. The pounds had been pegged to the dollar, and all of a sudden they decided not to be, it was an immediate 50% reduction in the currency. The other parts of the currency losses though, I would say, we experienced those quarter in and quarter out. And I would say that for the most part, the rest of them are not unusual, depending our function of the strengthening dollar. But if you look back for the last several quarters, we\u2019ve had them as they\u2019re in the numbers and they were a part of how we had guided the Street as well. So, I don\u2019t know that I would necessarily exclude those as being necessarily unusual. And we\u2019ll expect that they will continue as long as the dollar continues to be as strong as it is and continue to strengthen. James West : Okay. So, about $0.10. Got it. Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. You may begin. Jud Bailey : I wanted to follow up on some of the commentary regarding the reactivation of pressure pumping spreads if I could. Jeff or Dave, is there any way to give any color on maybe the magnitude of the reactivations that you are discussing with customers and for the ones you are contemplating, do you incur the costs, primarily in the first quarter or are you in talks about also reactivating equipment in the second quarter and so, does that drag from a cost standpoint continue in the second quarter as well? Dave Lesar : Jud, we\u2019re not going to answer that; it\u2019s just competitive and it\u2019s a key part of our strategy in terms of how we go to market. I think the color we would give is that what we want to do is be in a position to work with those customers that value our services. And we expect to see the flight to quality that\u2019s pretty consistent in this part of the market. And for that reason, we put the time and the effort in to make it certain that our equipment is best in the business. Jeff Miller : Okay, understood. I guess another question, even though you are seeing the headwinds from reactivation costs in 1Q, the first quarter guidance is for incrementals of 40% to 45%. Just to make sure I am thinking about it the right way, as you get some of the reactivation headwinds behind you and of course see higher pricing, is it reasonable to anticipate later in the year for some quarters, we should see higher incrementals than that 45%, as you get pricing and the alleviation of the reactivation related headwinds out of the way? Mark McCollum : Jud, one of the things you need -- we talked about the cost being in Q1, but there will be cost in Q2 as well, because the ability to get all the fleets activated is going to take a little bit of time. We\u2019re not going to be activating all of the cold stacked equipment that we have, but there is some decisions around how much we\u2019re going to make available in the market at this point in time and we\u2019ll make later decisions. And again, we talk about being very flexible in this kind of market, watching how the market behaves, but as Jeff said, we are going to get equipment ready to go; it\u2019s going to cost us something and we\u2019ll probably be doing that through the course of the end of Q2 and then sort of decide where the market is and where we are to address how much further we go. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Herbert with Simmons. You may begin. Bill Herbert : Jeff, back to the pricing narrative here, I am a little bit confused. On the one hand, you state explicitly in the narrative that the sequential improvement is driven by pricing and activity; secondly, your refusal to reactivate equipment without adequate rates of return and yet we\u2019re processing non-trivial reactivations over the first half of this year. So, by implication, pricing is improving, notwithstanding the fact that it might not be of the same magnitude that you\u2019d want it to. Jeff Miller : Correct. Bill, yes, seeing improvement; our visibility is improvement further into the future as opposed to the other way. And as a result, that\u2019s the case for reactivating equipment. We see places for that equipment to go and make it return, albeit not the returns we would like but certainly a return and getting us on the path to making those kinds of returns. Bill Herbert : And, notwithstanding the fact that we had a margin strategy in the fourth quarter versus a market share strategy and thus the delta between revenues and rig count, I would suspect that over the course of 2017 and beyond, the fundamental completions intensity versus drilling intensity would probably put an upward bias on your revenue versus rig count. And so at some point, over the course of 2017, the rate of revenue expansion should outstrip the rate of rig count expansion, correct? Jeff Miller : Yes. That\u2019s a fair analysis. I agree with that. Bill Herbert : And then last one from me, Mark. I know it\u2019s hard to expound on this at this stage, because of the fluid nature of the subject. But, can you talk a little bit about Halliburton\u2019s tax rate optionality in the event of the fact that the U.S. corporate tax rate is bent lower? Mark McCollum : I don\u2019t know that I can say much. I mean, I think that one of the things that we think about is in relationship to where cash is, and we our U.S. domiciled Company, it would have a dramatic impact on us, you see particularly during this period of time, when North America is beginning to expand, a drop in the U.S. tax rate would make a difference. From a manufacturing perspective, most of our equipment is manufactured in the U.S., we actually have worked a strategy to move manufacturing around where it was geographically located to serve the markets where it was situated; and so all of that would be helpful. This past year in 2016, if you recall, we have already taken the tax hit to basically, if a situation presented itself that we could bring our cash back to the U.S. in a tax advantage way, we could do that without a significant impact on our results. We watch that very carefully. But we have -- I guess, what I\u2019m telling you is we have tremendous optionality. I think what we\u2019re just going to pay attention to is how is that going to move forward. We\u2019re going to be working with Congress and the Hill. Our tax Senior VP will be going to the Hill in a couple of weeks, and we\u2019ll just -- we\u2019ll continue to try stay tied8 into where things will be moving and to move as quickly as we can to take advantage of whatever present itself. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. You may begin. Ole Slorer : I was quite impressed with the international margins, and you highlighted of course year-end software and product sales, like we always see. But, could you be a little bit more specific on the margin development into the first quarter as well as the revenue numbers that you guided? Mark McCollum : Well, maybe, when you say more specific, I mean, I think we tried to give guidance by area, right? I think North America revenue should be in line with the rig count; our incrementals should be in that 40% to 45% range. When you look outside of North America, our Eastern Hemisphere which probably benefited more from some of the product -- year-end product sales but also gets hit more by weather-related seasonality; in the Q1, we expect that the revenues will be down a little under 10%, high single-digits. The margins, the impact -- the margins did look great; they\u2019re very strong because of the product sales; they should drop off a couple of hundred basis points in the first quarter. And then, Latin America, even though we had strong software sales of consulting which impacted, and those come at very, very high incremental, we actually think revenues will be up a little bit, but that it will have a marginal impact and they\u2019ll still fall back down to low single-digits. Ole Slorer : Sorry. And margins in Latin America? Mark McCollum : Margins will fall back into the low single digits. Ole Slorer : Low single digits, okay. Yes, I thought that\u2019s the revenue. Okay. And second question would just be on the North American reactivation of pressure pumping. At what point do you believe that you have to add new capacity rather than cold-stacked and relatively intact capacity? Jeff Miller : Yes. Look, that\u2019s decisions we\u2019ll make as we work through the process and certainly not something we\u2019re going to share today, just from a competitive perspective. But, we do believe that we like where we are now and we like the plan we have in place. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse. You may begin. Jim Wicklund : Good morning, guys. And when you all complain about getting too much pricing or note that you\u2019ve gotten enough pricing, that\u2019s the day the world ends. The comments about reactivation costing a penny, was that a penny per spread that you reactivate? Because if I do just math on a 35% tax rate, that\u2019s $10 million to $12 million reactivation cost per spread. Am I doing the math correctly, guys? Mark McCollum : You\u2019re doing the math correctly. Jeff Miller : Yes. Maybe, it\u2019s worth a little color on what that is. And so, as we think about penny per spread, we see estimates are all over the place. I actually believe we\u2019re at the lower end of the range in a sense that it is equipment repair but it\u2019s also advanced hiring, it\u2019s logistics that go with each spreads. So, that\u2019s sort of a fully loaded look at reactivation. And we expect to have the best equipment in the marketplace. So, we certainly put the time into that. Jim Wicklund : Okay. That clarification is helpful. And if I could on the international side, you guys note that the international inflection is probably going to be later in 2017. And, Jeff, I think you said it was onshore that you expected to move up first in mature fields. Where do you guys see sub-Saharan Africa and offshore Brazil, when do we start to see an improvement in deepwater? Jeff Miller : Well, I think that\u2019s the toughest hand in terms of efficiency. And I would say at this point in time, the commodity price just had to stabilize at a high enough number that makes it as attractive. And I\u2019m just looking at recent headlines but a lot of investment moving to North America; unconventionals that -- where that money had choices. So, I also think that from an inflection timing perspective, the lead time between investment decision drilling activity is long in those markets for a lot of reasons; and every day that we see delay that gets pushed out yet even further. So, we like our position in both of those places and we\u2019ll be ready when it does recover, but I really don\u2019t -- we think it\u2019s further out than -- further out. Dave Lesar : Yes. Jim, let me give you an anecdote. I was talking to the CEO of one of our IOC customers Friday, obviously not going to say who it was. And he said that there was not a single asset in their portfolio outside the U.S. that competes with their U.S. opportunities right now. And to me that\u2019s a pretty amazing statement to me in terms of really how much further commodity prices have to go up to bring some of these more either highly complicated or longer duration projects to the front of the queue get an FID decision made around them. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your may begin. Scott Gruber : Just a quick question on the reactivation cost, a penny per quarter per spread. Is that quarterly impact including both, OpEx and CapEx framed relative to your earnings power or is that actually what hits the P&L during the quarter? Mark McCollum : Yes. So, it\u2019s not a penny per quarter per spread, it\u2019s just a penny per spread, and it is just the operating expense impact to cost. As Jeff indicated, it\u2019s more of just the maintenance on the quarter itself; it\u2019s also the recruiting cost and the other activation cost that we are incurring to get that spread ready to go. It does not include the capital cost. And so, as I articulated, our capital forecast for 2017 is right now as I said about $1 billion. And that incremental that we\u2019re looking at between 2016 and 2017 is a fairly good estimate of some of the activation costs that will be incurred on the capital side to get some of that equipment ready to go, including retrofitting some of our old equipment with Q10s as we get them ready to get back in the market. Dave Lesar : I think here is a simple way to think about it. We bring a spread back this quarter, the negative impact on our earnings is $0.01; in the second quarter that spread starts to earn revenue and will give us the incremental margins and incremental revenue for that spread. So the penny is a one quarter impact. But clearly, we will be likely to be bringing some spreads back in Q2. So, the impact of those spreads in Q2 will be a penny per share, which is why I made the comment earlier that it\u2019s really going to be toward the end of the year. Once we\u2019ve absorbed the frontend cost of these spreads coming on where we really expect to see our stimulation and pumping margins pop-up. Scott Gruber : And then a question on sand delivery. Jeff, have you seen any degradation to the percentage of jobs that you are supplying sand for in the marketplace? Jeff Miller : No, not necessarily. We continue to deliver sand and most of the jobs where we work that\u2019s -- assurity of supply such an important piece of our own efficiency model that we make certain that we control those variables when we go to work and we found it to be very effective. Scott Gruber : And so, today, when you talk about putting fleets back to work at a profit, one, is that an operating profit; and two, does it include the logistics cost and investment? Jeff Miller : Yes. I mean that\u2019s -- when we think about making an economic decision about putting a spread to work and making returns, it\u2019s a fully loaded operating income returns for the Company. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JP Morgan. You may begin. Sean Meakim : I was hoping to elaborate on the logistical challenges we discussed earlier, specifically from the E&P perspective. Are there any pinch points to focus on beyond labor and proppant that could create some challenges, as we move up the cycle here; just I am thinking about things like water and electricity? Some of these emerging plays like the Delaware, it seems like that could be an issue for E&Ps and just curious how you are partnering with your customers try to work through those issues. Jeff Miller : Look, I mean, essential to our value proposition is how we collaborate engineered solutions to maximize asset value and a key component of that is collaboration around all of those things that help our customers be successful. I don\u2019t see those necessarily as issues that can\u2019t be overcome by any means, water and electricity or things that our customers are very good at managing. And so, I think we\u2019ll find solutions to those. Sean Meakim : And then, just a follow-up on the reactivations, could you give us a sense of the mix today for Q10s and maybe how that could progress through this year, given the CapEx budget that you laid out? Jeff Miller : So, about 60% of our overall fleet that\u2019s out there today that\u2019s Q10s. So, as we reactivate crews coming in, we are going to be placing an emphasis on Q10 fleets including that we talked about retrofitting some old equipment, they need pump replacement, we are going to retrofit with Q10 pumps on that equipment. And so, our hope is that as this new equipment comes out, it will continue to increase the total percentage of Q10 fleets in the market. Dave Lesar : Yes. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of the Q10 technology. I think it\u2019s delivering the efficiency and the differential, capital efficiency that we\u2019d expected when we brought those out. So, we are certainly incentivized to make those the growing part of our fleet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital. You may begin. Kurt Hallead : A question for Dave; you bring up some very interesting points in your earlier commentary; and given your history now in the business and through the cycles, I was wondering if you can share your perspectives on the number of different companies in the frac space that are going to be coming public. On one hand, you can probably make an argument that it\u2019s positive because at the end of the day when you go public, you\u2019ve got to be as profitable as you can be, but on the other hand as you go public, I\u2019m sure shareholders are going to expect some sort of growth, which means more capital being deployed into the business and this excess capacity factor may be dampening the prospect for profit improvement. So, I am curious as to your perspective on that, Dave. How are you guys thinking about it and what\u2019d be a good way for people like us outside the industry to think about that? Dave Lesar : I think I guess the way I think about it is in a couple of ways. One is, you\u2019ve got some sort of brand names and I won\u2019t say who, who are actually exiting the pressure pumping business. So, they have looked at the space and have decided that they don\u2019t want to be in it for now or don\u2019t want to be in it at all, while at the same time, you clearly have a wave of companies that are really just pumping companies only coming into the public market. And you absolutely put your finger on it. I think by being public, there is an expectation that you have profit and that you get paid for growth. And so, what they hear from their shareholders, and I suspect to some extent, most of their shareholders are on this call listening, and it really is going to be the message that they get from those shareholders as to what\u2019s more important, growth or profitability. In our case, because of our position, we think we can have it both; we\u2019re not a afraid of competition; we\u2019ve had a lot of competition come into the market over the past many years. We like our position there; we like our customers that we have. So, at the end of the day, we\u2019ll compete with whatever is out there with whatever message their shareholders are getting. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s about providing a good service to a customer at the right price. And I absolutely love where we\u2019re positioned, if that\u2019s going to be the state of play, and it is. Kurt Hallead : And follow-up, maybe for you Dave too; your comment before was pretty intriguing about your conversation with an IOC executive and how they are thinking about their portfolio. Would you say that that is -- could you kind of extrapolate that and say that the vast majority of the IOCs that you talk to have that same mindset? And I would just try to put it into a context that the largest IOC in the world placed a $6.5 billion bet on the Permian, last week. So, I think that does speak a lot for their view of where their opportunity set is. So, any incremental perspectives on that? Dave Lesar : No, I think each company is different; their portfolio is different; when they acquire those assets are different; how long their production sharing contracts in many cases have to go. So, I wouldn\u2019t generalize the comment to the broader industry. I just thought it was in an interesting anecdotal point from a particular customer. But, you\u2019re absolutely right, even the largest of the IOCs clearly have a focus on the unconventional in the U.S. And I think that bodes well, not only for our position in North America, but the future of the industry here. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Jeff Miller for closing remarks. Jeff Miller : Yes. Thank you, Shannon. So, before we finish, I\u2019d like to emphasize two points. First, our strategy to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value, meaning deliver the lowest costs per BOE is built on Halliburton\u2019s competitive advantage and is well aligned with our customers and is winning contracts and follow-on work. Second, our focus on fairway customers who best utilize our approach to delivering the lowest cost per BOE and our ability to flex quickly with the market, place Halliburton in a fantastic position to win the recovery. We\u2019ll look forward to talking with you next quarter. Shannon, you may now close out the call. Operator : Ladies and gentleman, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Halliburton first quarter 2017 earnings call. At this time, all participants are a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Lance Loeffler, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Lance Loeffler - Halliburton Co.: Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton first quarter 2017 conference call. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Joining me this morning are Jeff Miller, President; and Robb Voyles, Interim CFO. As mentioned on our last quarterly call, due to a long-standing business commitment, Dave Lesar, Halliburton's Chairman and CEO, will not be present this morning but will return for our second quarter call. Today, Jeff will be providing market and operational commentary; and Robb will discuss our quarterly financial results. As a reminder, from our fourth quarter earnings call, we have changed the reporting for our divisions in geographic regions consistent with our major peer. In doing so, we will now provide revenue and profit for our divisions and revenue only for our four geographic regions : North America; Latin America; Europe/Africa/CIS; and Middle East/Asia. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, recent current reports on Form 8-K, and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures, and unless otherwise noted, in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of certain items which consists of impairments and other charges, a class-action lawsuit settlement, and loss on debt extinguishment. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our first quarter press release, which can be found on our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Thank you, Lance, and good morning, everyone. We are the execution company, focused on achieving industry-leading returns. I'm thankful to the Halliburton team around the world for their consistent execution and for collaborating and engineering solutions to maximize asset value for our customers in every single market where we operate. Now, following our operational update a few weeks ago, the quarter wrapped up in line with what we expected. Our highlights for the quarter were total company revenue of $4.3 billion, representing a 6% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. I'm pleased that our U.S. land revenue increased by nearly 30%, outperforming the average sequential U.S. land rig count growth of 27%. And total North America revenue was up 24% sequentially, significantly outperforming our largest peer. Latin America revenue grew in excess of 8% sequentially, outperforming what is typically a seasonal decline following year-end product sales. Operating income was $203 million, primarily driven by improving market conditions in North America, which were partially offset by activity declines and pricing pressure internationally. We completed the early redemption of $1.4 billion of senior notes during the quarter using cash on hand, reducing both leverage and interest expense going forward. As we described in our operational update, the market is a tale of two cycles. North America activity increased rapidly but not without growing pains, while activity in the rest of the world declined due to typical seasonal pressures that were exacerbated by current cyclical headwinds. In North America, the first quarter brought a lot of change, both to our strategy and our customers' view of the market. And I love the way the market is shaping up. I'm excited because customers are investing to meet production targets; pricing is moving; supply versus demand dynamics are tight; our reactivated equipment is going to work at leading-edge pricing, and we are working to manage our input costs. So, we said we would outgrow the U.S. land market, and we did. The cost and benefits of our reactivation program continue as we march into the second quarter. And to be crystal clear, we're adding reactivated equipment at market-leading prices to stabilize market share. At the same time, we're repairing margins in the rest of the portfolio. North America incremental margins improved throughout the quarter in spite of absorbing transitory inflation costs, reactivation costs, and typical seasonal declines in the Gulf of Mexico. In short, our first quarter results reflect that we are not chasing market share at the cost of pricing. Our strategy to deliver industry-leading returns is at the center of everything we do. We see the path to normalized margins and know it's better to invest now to maintain hard-earned market share, so that when we earn normalized margins, it will be on a bigger base of business. We still think this is the smart choice and the right choice. While production increases could moderate the pace of activity increases in the second half of the year, we see sufficient demand for the equipment we're bringing into the market. As we look at the second half of the year, we'll assess our options for continued redeployment beyond our current plans, but have made no decisions. Because we build our own equipment, we have the unique luxury to wait longer than our competitors to make any new build decisions. We believe that the industry's active fleet of pumping equipment is fully utilized. And we know from our own experience, as we get near the bottom of the stacked equipment pile, it will be progressively harder and more expensive for the industry to reactivate equipment. Our experience through many cycles is that when this happens, we see a customer flight to quality due to their strong desire to make better wells and reduce their cost per BOE. Let me reiterate, we foresee increased demand for new build equipment, but will not consider responding to this demand until the economics make sense. What's important is that we see multiple paths to normalized margins, and we'll maintain optionality to travel the path that gets us there the fastest with the highest market share. The following factors influence our decision on which path to choose : determining where and how we add equipment at leading-edge pricing; chasing price up, not down; evaluating, winding up, and repairing pricing on older contracts, this is happening every day; aligning with customers that are racing to meet production targets or will work with us to maximize our collective efficiency; managing our input costs; and finally, a relentless focus on reducing internal costs and implementing technology. Outside of North America, our more conservative outlook for the last several quarters is proving accurate. Our customers around the world have different breakeven thresholds and production requirements, but none are immune to the impacts of the current commodity price environment. We continue to see customers defer new projects, most notably in the offshore exploration markets. Now due to lower cash flow and project economics, they are more focused than ever on lowering costs. The result of this combination is less activity and more pricing pressure. Now I believe the first quarter represents the bottom in the Eastern Hemisphere rig count. The full-year average for 2017 will likely only be marginally higher than the full-year average for 2016. Further, due to the long-term contractual nature of international markets and the level of continuing price pressure, I expect discounts will offset activity gains over the near term. In Latin America, we saw sequential improvement in revenue from activity in Brazil and Mexico in the first quarter. Now while we're seeing an improvement in certain basins, there are a variety of country-specific headwinds that must be overcome for a meaningful recovery in the region. In contrast to North America, where we believe that a $50 oil price would drive a significant increase in activity, customers tell me that longer duration international markets will react less to an absolute oil price but more to a positive view of where price will be for several years. This isn't a surprise given the longer investment cycle that many of our customers face. To sum it up, in North America the momentum is building, and we only see it getting better. And we believe we've seen the bottom in the international market. Now I'll turn the call to Robb to cover our financial results. Robb L. Voyles - Halliburton Co.: Thanks, Jeff. Good morning. Let's start with a summary of our first quarter results compared sequentially to our fourth quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $4.3 billion, representing an increase of 6%, while operating income was $203 million. These results were primarily driven by increased activity in our North America land business, offset by the typical seasonal impact in the international markets that were exacerbated by the cyclical headwinds that Jeff described earlier. Now let me compare our divisional results to the fourth quarter of 2016. In our Completion and Production division, first quarter revenue increased by 15% while operating income increased 73%. These results were primarily driven by improved pressure pumping pricing and utilization in our U.S. land business, offset by a seasonal decline in completion tool sales across the Eastern Hemisphere and the Gulf of Mexico. Turning to our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue and operating income declined by 4% and 51% respectively, primarily as a result of reduced software sales as well as lower pricing and decreased fluid sales across the Middle East-Asia region. Let me take a minute to compare our geographic results. In North America, revenue increased 24% sequentially, primarily driven by increased pricing and activity in our pressure pumping and well construction product service lines. In Latin America, we saw revenue increase by 8%, primarily due to increased activity in well completion, fluid services, and production solutions in Brazil, as well as pressure pumping, fluid services, and project management in Mexico. Turning to Europe-Africa-CIS, revenue declined 11%, resulting primarily from reduced activity in West Africa and weather-related activity reductions in the North Sea and Russia. For Middle East-Asia, revenue declined 12% as a result of reduced pricing and activity across the region, particularly completion tool sales, project management, and drilling services. Our Corporate and Other expense totaled $66 million in the first quarter, and we anticipate that our corporate expenses will be a similar amount for the second quarter of 2017. In March 2017, we redeemed $1.4 billion of our senior notes with cash on hand. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $104 million on the early extinguishment of debt, which included the redemption premium and a write-off of the remaining original debt issuance costs and debt discount, partially offset by a gain from the termination of related interest rate swap agreements. This loss on the early debt extinguishment is included in the $242 million of interest expense for the first quarter. As a function of our reduced debt balance, we expect net interest expense for the second quarter to be approximately $120 million, a savings of close to $20 million. This savings will continue in future quarters. We reported $18 million of other expenses for the quarter. This was lower than we anticipated due to lower volatility associated with foreign exchange movements during the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter came in slightly higher than expected at approximately 27%, due to a shift in the geographic mix of our earnings. For the remainder of 2017, we are expecting the effective tax rate to be approximately 29% to 30%. Cash flow from operations during the first quarter was approximately $5 million, which represents $340 million of cash flow from operations, excluding the final Macondo payment. And we ended the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion in cash and equivalents. As we progress through 2017, we believe we are well-positioned to generate significantly more cash from operations. Turning now to our near-term operational outlook. Market dynamics continue to make forecasting a challenge, but let me provide you with some comments on how we believe the second quarter is shaping up. For our Drilling and Evaluation division, we are anticipating a second quarter rebound from typical seasonal weather disruptions in drilling activity, such that sequential revenue will experience a mid-single-digit increase compared to first quarter levels, with margins increasing 75 basis points to 125 basis points. In our Completion and Production division, we believe that revenues will increase in the upper teens, while margins will increase by 275 basis points to 325 basis points. As for our regional outlook, as in the first quarter, we expect our revenue growth in North America to outperform the average U.S. land rig count growth, which is already up significantly for the second quarter. In Latin America, we anticipate revenues will increase sequentially by mid-single digits. We expect Europe/Africa/CIS revenues to increase by low-double digits as a result of increased activity after the winter months. And we believe Middle East/Asia revenue will remain relatively flat sequentially. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff for a technology review and a few closing comments. Jeff? Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: As I said earlier, our strategy is to deliver leading shareholder returns. That shapes all of the decisions that we make. We work closely with our customers, and what we do is clearly aligned with what's most important to them, delivering oil and gas at the lowest cost per BOE, even more so in what is a challenging commodity price environment. We execute our strategy with three main levers, and those levers are : people; capital investment; and technology. Each is pointed towards generating leading returns. Our people collaborate, listen and use a broad range of technology to engineer solutions. I know this is working, because it wins with our customers. We have leading service quality that translates into larger work allocations and contract awards, which ultimately result in higher market share. Our capital investment strategy is absolutely focused on the things that competitively differentiate us. For example, we are always developing solutions that drive capital off location and make us more efficient. In hydraulic fracturing, we already make the most efficient pumps and have the most efficient surface configuration. What you probably don't know is that we're doing the same thing in all other parts of our business. For example, our subsea intervention systems are more compact. Our rotary coring tool is the ultra-deepwater market leader; and our state-of-the-art completions tools manufacturing allow us to design and deliver lower-cost tools. We have continuous improvement initiatives across all of the company to maximize the efficiency of our capital investment. From a mergers and acquisitions perspective, we're interested in acquiring businesses and technologies that enhance the depth of our product line portfolio or breadth of our offering in specific areas, such as production chemicals and artificial lift. As we're a returns-focused company, we do not want to get into product lines that we believe would be dilutive to our return profile, such as subsea equipment. There are good companies in this industry segment that we can partner with to provide those capabilities to our customers without diluting our returns. Our customers are more open to technology adoption than ever before and continuously engage with us to help direct our technology investment. I believe that technology is valuable when it satisfies two criteria : first, it meets the customer requirement; and then, second, it provides a return to Halliburton. We look for technology and equipment that differentiates us from our competitors, helps our customers, and drives our returns. If it doesn't, we'd rather rent it than own it or partner with an expert in that field. We believe differentiated technology and ability to integrate technology using an open-architecture approach is what sets us apart from our competitors, helps our customers, and drives returns. Through the downturn, we've been very active, deepening those investments and relationships that we believe offer the best full-cycle returns. Our competitive technology position is demonstrated by our onshore market leadership in North America and our contract awards and share gains in what are historically some of the most technology-driven markets, such as deepwater exploration with openhole wireline and testing; deepwater Gulf of Mexico, where Halliburton now enjoys an overall market leadership position; and, finally, in the Middle East, where we have a market leadership position in project management. The feedback from our customers has been overwhelming. We're aligned with what's most important to them, maximizing asset value, and doing so with our proven commitment to execution service quality and technology. Now, because we provided an operational update a month ago, we have a few spare minutes today to cover topics we don't normally have time to discuss. I hear a lot of discussion in the industry today about digital initiatives, for example, big data, analytics, Internet of Things, and automation. And I'd like to share my views on the subject. Let's start with the underlying concept. Our industry challenges remain the same, but today, we have an opportunity to solve problems in a fundamentally different way, enabled by the development of reliable, inexpensive sensors, data processing capabilities in the cloud, and advances in machine learning techniques. Now, digital technologies are valuable, only when they solve a problem. The value is created by the combination of domain expertise with digital technologies. Arguably, the most popular talking point is big data. Now, big data standing alone is nothing but big data collection. It's really only valuable when used for automation and optimization. To me, the big data story is still being written. We collect different E&P data types, and because Landmark's DecisionSpace is the go-to platform for the industry, we power the collection and storage of big data more so than anyone else. Our customers use DecisionSpace to collect, monitor, analyze, and sometimes control their assets through the life of the field. Each customer is unique and will have specific goals. The open-architecture platform we provide allows customization and enables customers to use their domain expertise to its fullest advantage. Let me give you some other examples of what digital looks like at Halliburton, starting with the direct application of these innovations to help customers lower their cost per BOE. In the production space, we're a leader in smart fields, with Voice of the Oilfield, where digital technologies are combined with subsurface understanding to optimize production. In the Eastern Hemisphere, we have completed the first phase of the smart field project in heavy oil. The project included modeling, automated workflows, and optimizing production and injection networks. This is made possible by the incorporation of new data sources into an analytical framework. This allowed our customer to have a constant view of their facilities, reservoir, and operations to monitor and optimize production in real-time. This project has substantially reduced the cost of production, and the process is now being implemented on a series of fields with over 1,000 wells. We have similar projects ongoing with major operators in deepwater as well as unconventionals. In hydraulic fracturing, we continue to innovate and push the envelope by automating the fracturing process. This is accomplished by acquiring data from frac treatments in real-time and applying machine learning to make decisions previously taken by on-site personnel, such as rate or pressure adjustments, and volume, and timing the release of materials. As a result, we've seen dramatic improvements in fracture efficiencies in the field. We have similar efforts ongoing in our Drilling and Completion arenas, which I'm excited about and will share details about at a later date. Internally, we are far along in rolling out various digital initiatives. For example, in the area of condition-based maintenance, over 90% of our pumps are equipped with IntelliScan, advanced sensors and algorithms to measure and monitor pump health in real-time. In summary, our industry is in the very early stages of defining the digital story. We believe an open digital architecture is a prerequisite for our industry to enable faster innovation and collaboration with our customers. This is why we've invested in and standardized on the industry's only open-standards-based platform, DecisionSpace. We're excited to open up access to this platform code through OpenEarth, a community of E&P scientists and developers, to speed up and lower the cost of digital innovation for the entire industry. In closing, there are a few things that I want to highlight. We are the execution company, and I'm excited by the activity I see in North America. We outperformed the U.S. land rig count in North America and expect to do so again in the second quarter. As we stated on our operational update, we've nearly doubled our reactivated equipment additions for the full year and are bringing that equipment out in the first six months of the year. Our conservative international view is playing out, and I am confident in our ability to handle the challenges in these markets. We are focused on achieving industry-leading returns, and I believe we have the best strategy to achieve that. Now let's open it up for questions. Operator : And our first question comes from David Anderson of Barclays. Your line is now open. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great and thanks. Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Good morning, Dave. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So I was just wondering. So with a strong catch-up in completion activity that you saw on U.S. land this quarter, is it fair to say you think we're entering a new completion-intensive phase of this cycle? And I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how you see that relationship between rigs and completion activity now. You had previously talked about 900 being the new 2,000 in terms of full industry utilization. I was just wondering if you could go into that math a little bit and see if that's adjusted at all. Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Thanks, Dave. There's no doubt that the pace of completions activity is catching up with the rig count, and we expect to see that relationship continue into next quarter most certainly. And it is partly around \u2013 the increasing intensity continues to build. And when I said 900 was the new 2,000, I probably overshot that number in a sense that we are seeing that kind of tightness in the marketplace today. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And as a related, as we're talking about preserving market share that you've talked about and reactivating it, clearly you did this. I've seen some of this capacity from smaller competitors out there. There are two questions around that. I guess one, what do you think are the biggest impediments for the industry bringing this back? Do you think there's going to be shortages of repair? Is it finding and training crews? Is it something else? And secondarily, you had talked in your prepared remarks about a flight to quality. I was just wondering if we're starting to see that yet. Are customers starting to experience the poor jobs or equipment delivery delays, or is that a little bit further out? Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Look, the flight to quality is happening, and that is what we see when equipment comes into the market. And most importantly, as clients get urgent, reliability, service quality, and technology even matter more. And so we are confident that that pivot to what we deliver will continue through the marketplace. As far as things that are tight, equipment broadly is tight I think for the industry today. Sand is one of those things that will recover in terms of availability. There's a lot of capacity coming into the market. And then from a people perspective, we're confident with where we are on people. And it is partly because we retained our folks, our most experienced people through the downturn, and we know how to hire folks. We hired 21,000 in 2014. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning, guys. Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Good morning, Jim. Robb L. Voyles - Halliburton Co.: Good morning, Jim. James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: I actually heard an advertisement on the radio the other day here in Dallas for a Halliburton job fair in Abilene. So that's the first time I've heard that, so I guess your hiring efforts are going farther afield than Midland. Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Yes. James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: The Gulf of Mexico, my sources are telling me, Jeff, that you guys have just won some work from Chevron and Shell in the Gulf of Mexico that previously had been held by a competitor. And you guys are a little bit smaller in the Gulf of Mexico than your nearest competitor. And I was wondering if you could tell us if this is true, who it is, and how did you do it? Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: I'm not going to tell you about customers, but I think we know what the customer set is in the Gulf of Mexico. Yes, we've been quite successful in the Gulf of Mexico, and it's really built around our strategy, Jim. It's collaborating and engineering solutions to maximize asset value for our customers, so we're clearly focused on the things that are important to them. And the other thing I think it tells you is that our technology portfolio is extremely competitive. And I think we've demonstrated that by what we're doing in deepwater in the Gulf of Mexico and in other places. James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And if I could follow up on the U.S., you guys said in your operational update that you're definitely accelerating pressure pumping capacity. Would it be fair to say that in Q3, you'd probably have about twice as much pressure pumping capacity in the field than you had on January 1? And I know that new contracts are getting a big price hike. I think you all confirmed something close to 25% for Q1. Would all the equipment you have in the field be benefiting from that higher price by say Q3? Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Jim, I think the amount of equipment that we're adding is not nearly as much as you're suggesting. But what I will tell you is that we are working constantly on the broader portfolio. And without giving you a time, we actually have seen quite a bit of progress on that since the beginning of the year. I can't predict precisely what that timing is, but the right things are happening. And I'd say that in the sense of customer urgency, we're seeing that supply and demand tightness. And the bottom line is we really like the way the market's shaping up. I think we're on that path. James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: I guess what I'm really asking though is that, I know that new fleets are going to work at a nice price hike from where we were, say, exiting Q4, but the equipment that you already had in the field in Q4, how long does it take before the new prices for new equipment, how long before that price hike hits all the legacy activity and equipment you already have in the field, how long should that take to flow through? Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Again, that should happen over the next, I would say, four quarters, somewhere in that range depending on pace and efficiency of customers. But it's something that gets done in due course as contracts roll over, or we move things around. So we kind of control the when, and the where, and the how. We work on that every day, Jim. James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Is this new equipment going to work on contract, or just more like commitment? Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Jim, everyone would like to commit equipment at this point in the marketplace. I think we're being very thoughtful about where we place equipment. We are aligned with the right customers, we believe, in the right markets. But we also move equipment around, and that's part of where we see the flight to quality happen as we move equipment around. James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from James West of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. James West - Evercore ISI : Hey, good morning, guys. Robb L. Voyles - Halliburton Co.: Good morning. Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Good morning. James West - Evercore ISI : Jeff, as you think about the second half of the year in North America, given all the equipment you've put back to work and the pricing power that you're achieving now, what do you see as the momentum of North American margins going forward? I know we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves here, but incremental margins were, as you have talked about previously, light this quarter, but they should, in my mind, at least explode in the back half. Is that a fair assessment? I mean, when you're running your models and you're thinking about your earnings power here for North America, what do you see? Robb L. Voyles - Halliburton Co.: Jim, this is Robb. I'm not sure about what you would characterize explosion, but... James West - Evercore ISI : Fair enough, Robb. Robb L. Voyles - Halliburton Co.: ...this is a transition quarter for us in terms of how we're reporting our operating income in areas. But given that it is a transition, and given the way North America's rapidly expanding, what I can say is that margins improved throughout the quarter, and that our exit incrementals for North America approximated what we'd anticipated for the whole quarter. We really like the momentum that we see going into the second quarter, and we fully anticipate that momentum to continue throughout the year. James West - Evercore ISI : Okay, okay. That's helpful, Robb. Thanks. And Robb and Jeff, I saw you guys about what, five, six weeks ago or so and at that time, we were starting to talk about new build capacity. And Jeff, I believe, that you had indicated that you would probably make that call as we got closer to kind of mid-year. I suspect you and Robb, too, probably have Jim Brown in your office every day asking for CapEx and trying to build new equipment. So how are you thinking about that right now? And how are you thinking about when you make that decision to start adding incremental capacity, think about new builds to the market? Robb L. Voyles - Halliburton Co.: Well, fortunately, Jim Brown lives in Denver, and he can't be in our office. James West - Evercore ISI : Sorry calling you, yeah. Robb L. Voyles - Halliburton Co.: Well, we also have the call ID, so we don't always answer the phone. But I think what we were trying to make clear in our prepared remarks is that we have not made that decision yet. We're constantly monitoring the situation, looking closely at capacity in the marketplace, our customer relationships and what their demands are. Bottom line is we're not going to be bringing new build equipment into the market unless and until we see the kind of margins that we want to achieve, and that's normalized margins and a good return on that equipment. We're fortunate, as you know, in that we manufacture our own equipment. And so we've got a lot of optionality in that area, and we can react rapidly when we need to. But at this point, we're comfortable with where we are, and we've not made any decisions on new builds. James West - Evercore ISI : Okay, fair enough. All right, thanks, Robb. Robb L. Voyles - Halliburton Co.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons. Your line is now open. William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International : Thanks. Good morning. So on the guidance, it looks like the incremental for the second quarter for CPS is in the vicinity of like 25%. And I'm just curious as to when you conducted your call of a few weeks back on the operational update, Dave talked about aspirational North America margins over the course of the next several quarters and then a couple of years in the 20% arena. And in order to do that, we had to land kind of a sort of glide path of 40% to 45% sequential incrementals for several quarters. And I'm just curious, with regard to CPS, I think you guys had an 18% incremental Q1, a guided 25% incremental for Q2. And relative to that aspired 40% to 45% North American incremental, what do CPS incrementals have to be in order to land that 20% North America margin? Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Bill, I think the outlook we gave on the operational update is accurate. But without a precise number, what we need to do is continue to put the equipment to work that we have in the marketplace. And I expect that we will be on a glide path that will materialize over the balance of the year that take us to what those normalized margins are and should be seeing that reflected as we, again, move through the second half of the year and into next year. William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International : Okay. And just my takeaway from the call a few weeks back is that what was burdening your incrementals was a combination of insufficient net pricing traction, one; second, ramp-up and reactivation friction; and third, supply chain cost inflation. And I'm just curious as if you could talk briefly about each of those with regard to how we're evolving, and sort of progressing, and transcending those challenges, and what we can expect. Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: So with respect to bringing equipment back out, I mean, we laid out the path to these assets through sort of mid-year. And at that point, that burden is behind us. With respect to supply chain, and we were working on that every single day, that in many ways, the short-term supply shortages that were at least generated by year-end activity should begin to abate as we move through Q2. This is sand shortages. And so those are the most prominent couple of items that come under control as we move through the year. William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International : And with regard to net pricing traction, I think, an earlier questioner said 25% on new equipment rolling out. Is that correct? And what kind of pricing traction are you getting with regard to equipment in the field currently working? Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Yes. I mean, there's great momentum. So we talked about moving up at the leading edge, but we're seeing pricing improvement in every basin where we work around North America. And as I said, on the legacy portfolio, it is getting traction. And as we work that every day, again, it is making progress. And we expect that, that momentum continues as we work through the year. William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Your line is now open. Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning. Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Good morning. Robb L. Voyles - Halliburton Co.: Good morning, Scott. Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): I want to follow on from Bill's question. I think we all understand that margins should improve nicely in the second half of the year as these restart costs fade, but do you need additional pricing to reach those 20% plus normalized margins in North America, or can you get there through the repricing of active spreads and reaching full utilization? I realize you're not going to be reporting geomarket margins anymore, but conceptually, color on this point, I think would help us all forecast. Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Yes, so we would expect to continue to make pricing gains. But with that said, there are a lot of other levers that we have once we start to move the full portfolio up on pricing, and that's where we start to get into the customer urgency that we're seeing, which then leads to hyper-utilization. As the excess capacity comes out of the marketplace, we get a lot more control over the calendar, some would call that calendar power, and we don't have all of that today. But I think all of those things conspire to a path to normalized margins that is somewhat dependent on price to the degree it repairs the portfolio. But if we think back to 2014, as we were moving up that chain, we nearly never got to what I would call the pricing power piece of that, but it was more around utilization. Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. So just to be clear, you would need some incremental pricing above and beyond leading edge to get to those normalized margins? Is that fair? Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Yeah, I mean, some at leading edge but, more importantly, repairing the broader portfolio. Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. And just a follow-up on strategy. We heard from your largest competitor on Friday regarding their strategy to enter various aspects of the value chain in North America. Can you provide an update regarding your strategy toward investing across the value chain and broader integration in North America? Has anything changed as some of the different links in that chain start to tighten? Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: No. I mean, we want to invest in those things where we believe we add unique value to them, so clearly, that's our equipment, and the kind of technology we can roll out to make that more efficient. As we look up and down the value chain, we try to be fairly surgical about those things that we think we need to own, one of those being the logistics piece of that, just because it's quite portable, actually, in terms of where sand is at any point in time. We don't have that experience, but our view of owning the actual commodity is that sand is rarely in the right place or is at the right mesh size. Those tastes change over time, and so that's not a place where we want to put a lot of capital. Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it, appreciate the color. Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is now open. Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Good morning, Angie. Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank : So Jeff, going back to the construction comments that you made in your prepared remarks and the Q&A here, you said that given that you build in-house, you can wait longer before you start to build. Can you give us a little perspective of your construction time for that equipment? And has the cost structure changed from building this cycle versus the last cycle? Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: I would say that we've seen the cost come down somewhat around the cost of building equipment. As we look out at what's available or what we can do in the marketplace, I think also some of that's our own value engineering as we think about how we take cost out of things and still achieve the same effective market-leading equipment. With respect to timing, I'm not going to give you the precise timing, but it is going to be faster than anyone else, simply because we control that part of the value chain in our manufacturing facility. And that allows us to make no decision, certainly at this time. And I think we can wait fairly deep into the cycle before we make any kind of decision about whether or not we bring out new equipment. Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank : Okay, okay, that's helpful. And then on the cost pass-throughs, correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought a third of your sand that you're purchasing on the spot market. And can you talk about the lag in passing through the cost to your customers? And are you seeing any challenges, at least maybe on your legacy equipment on getting the cost pass-throughs fully redeemed? Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Look, that's very competitive in terms around how we work with each of our customers, and they're different. What we do see is a path to manage inflation. And I do think in addition to that, some element of that inflation will abate as we get into the later half of the year. Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank : Okay. And then finally on pricing, besides frac and maybe directional drilling, are you seeing pricing gains in any other product lines? Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: We are seeing pricing gains in the well construction service lines. However, those never fell quite as far, and so I don't think they have as far to move back up. But we are seeing, certainly, tightness in some of those service lines. Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank : Okay, great. Thanks, I'll turn it over. Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jud Bailey of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks, good morning. I wanted to just touch base on your international outlook. Jeff, you mentioned in your comments something regarding operator budgets. The absolute oil price may be not as important as perception on stability and where it's going to be for the next several quarters. If we're in a $50 to $55 world for an extended period, what is your sense on, number one, how international revenue would progress? But then also how do we think about your margins in that environment as well? It sounds like price pressure continues in certain areas. Can you maybe talk about revenue outlook in a low to mid-$50 type environment, and how we could think about your international margins perhaps over the back half of the year and maybe on a longer-term basis? Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: I think what we see is the stress in that part of the market is simply a cost piece of the issue. And so how do we bring cost down to make a lot of those plays more competitive? And I think our customers are working on that now, but doesn't change the macro view that as North America is more competitive, where does that put some of these other markets? And our strategy is working with our customers, but it works slowly and in terms of bringing that cost down. So as we look out, I think it will be muted in a range-bound world, that deepwater will be the slowest to come back. I think there is room to move around in the mature fields, and I think those will recover probably ahead of that in terms of activity, which is what we're seeing through the balance of the year. But it is very competitive given the amount of equipment that is out around the world today. Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right, thanks for that. And just to follow up on that, as we think about your international businesses, do you have other levers you could pull if revenue outlook is perhaps flat for a period and you make that determination? Do you have other levers you can pull to get your international margins higher to adjust for a new normal, if it comes to that? Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Yes, we do. We are constantly working on continuous improvement initiatives that take cost out of not only the business but also out of the equipment that we use. There are all kinds of breakthroughs as we look at how to make things work more effectively. When I talk about our value proposition and how we collaborate and engineer solutions, a lot of that is how do we systematically take cost out of what we do, which ultimately improves our margins. Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then just my follow-up is on North America. It's been asked a little bit, and I wanted to try take it from a different angle. If I were to think about your portfolio today in the U.S. in pressure pumping, is there a way to think about, I don't know, what percentage would be at leading-edge pricing, and then trying to think about how much is still under legacy pricing if I were to think about where it is today? Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Look, it's moving all of the time. So I'm really not, from a competitive standpoint, sharing with you where we are specifically. What I will tell you is that it's all moving up but in different paces, as commitments roll off and as new opportunities come along. What I would tell you though is that the entire fleet is on that path moving up and to the right. What percentage of that, we will work through that through the balance of the year. Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ole Slorer of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. High-level question for me on North America. In the last cycle, you had your SandKing systems that delivered tremendous efficiencies to the industry. And today, we're seeing a range of third-party last-mile and storage systems come into the industry of North America that delivers increased efficiency cycle-over-cycle for sand logistics. In the last cycle, the infrastructure broke down around 50 million tons, 60 million tons, it might have been north of that. You can clearly handle more. But I'd like to have your view on what the bottleneck that creep into the industry will be, and when they should hit, and when do you think that will become evident? What are the other black swans, in other words? Could you offer us that, Jeff? Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: I think, Ole, the definition of a black swan is we don't see it, but the... Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, the grey swans then. Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: The grey swans. Look, I think that the industry has demonstrated ability to overcome all of these. And that's one of the reasons that I'm very careful about how we invest in those things and what part of it that we own. I think that logistics will get tight, and it probably gets tight over the balance of the year. I like where we are in that place particularly because of our investment in logistics, and rail, and all that goes with that, so confident there. Then I think about getting the cost out, you referenced how we handle sand and move it around. I think the containerized solutions are going to be very good. I think they'll remove a lot of demurrage and allow us to move more sand more quickly. That's an example of technology having an impact. The other people and whatnot, I really do think is quite manageable, but with investment and the infrastructure that knows how to hire them, train them and put equipment to work. Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: You highlighted investment in a new coil tubing system, for example. Are there other product lines that because of changes in relative science or new ways of doing things could become problematic? Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: No. I mean, I think, we're in the market all the time. So I tried to walk you through some of how we view technology and how we approached that, but I think we are very effective in the market at addressing those things that if we want to invest in them, and we think that they create value for us, we can. And we do those things that we feel like are going to be commoditized over time, or also the rents don't clearly accrue to us. I mean, that's another area where it may be better to partner with someone and not tie capital up where those rents don't accrue to us. And we've seen that over time. Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Oh, and I would totally agree with that. The bottleneck might be very short in life, so I was more thinking about industry bottlenecks as opposed to Halliburton-specific bottlenecks. Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Yeah, and I mean, as I said, I think it'll be around people over time. Talking about North America, will be challenging to get staffed up. And I do think logistics, overtime, will get tight, I do think so. Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just one follow-up on Iraq. You've put in your press release, a commentary that you're going back to work for Shell. Could you give us your view on activity in Iraq, in particular? The rig count has come down a lot, and those service companies talking about Iraq anymore. What's going on in terms of investments into the existing fields and infrastructure there? Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Yeah, so I would say from a pay standpoint, it's kind of steady as she goes. What we like about it is our position in that market and the success that we've had with project management. And that's been a launch pad for us to kind of move that model more effectively into other parts of the Middle East and other parts of the world. So we like our position in that market. The Middle East, overall, has been generally resilient, but again, from our standpoint, important piece of business. Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Good morning, Sean. Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So, Jeff, could you maybe just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of competitive dynamics between the basins in North America? So at this point, are things materially different for Halliburton in the Permian versus, say, the Bakken and Eagle Ford, or maybe there's less incremental activity so far but also for your competitors? Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Well, we've stayed invested in all of the basins throughout all of the cycles, and so we feel like it's important that we're there, that we have the basin expertise to work in all those basins. So we're, and to a certain degree, basin agnostic in terms of how we are positioned. Now, clearly, the Permian Basin's got the most activity. I mean, you see all of those things. Look, I like the way we're positioned in each market. Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, fair enough. Is it fair to say that you're back to working mostly all your fleets at 24/7 operation to this point? Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Yes, fleets are busy. We're starting to see even sort of the calendar firm up around customers with more than one rig and those sorts of things, which again, all inspire to help improve utilization. Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. And then just on international, you talked about better cash generation expectation the next couple of quarters. Assuming with international customers, where are you still seeing challenges, and where are you going to get traction in terms of collections? Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: I think generally seeing, with the exception of a few countries, we're seeing collections improving, not where they were at the end of the last cycle, but we see a path, we've got a great organization to connect with our customers and expect to see working capital continue to improve over the balance of the year. Thank you. Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Yes. Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Jeff Miller for closing remarks. Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Thank you, Candice. Look, I'd like to wrap up the call with a couple of key points. First, we're excited about the way North America's shaping up and believe that we'll outgrow the rig count in North America. Our reactivated equipment is going to work at leading-edge market pricing, while we wind up and repair pricing on our legacy portfolio. And these are marking the path towards normalized margins. Now, while our more conservative international view is playing out, the international rig count has bottomed. And our strategy to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value is absolutely aligned with what's most important to our customers. I'm confident that our team can handle the challenges in these markets. And so with that, thank you, and I look forward to talking with you next quarter. Candice, please close out the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

And welcome to the Halliburton Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Lance Loeffler. Please go ahead. Lance Loeffler : Good morning. And welcome to the Halliburton second quarter 2017 conference call. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Joining me this morning is Dave Lesar, Executive Chairman. Jeff Miller, President and CEO; and Chris Weber, CFO.  Before we begin, I'd like to point out that this will be Dave's last time to participate on our earnings call given his new role as Executive Chairman.  As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, Form 10- Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, recent current reports on Form 8-K, and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures, and unless otherwise noted, in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of the early extinguishment of debt and charges related to interest bearing promissory note that Halliburton intends to execute with its primary customer in Venezuela. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our second quarter press release, which can be found on our website. Finally, our after our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow more time for others who may be in the queue. Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave Lesar : Thank you, Lance, and good morning to everyone. Our performance this quarter demonstrates that Halliburton is the execution company, and we are the leader in North America. Here are our few key highlights. Total North America revenue increased 24%, outpacing the average outpacing the average sequential US land rig count growth of 21%. North America margins grew into the double digits. And although our international operations continued to be challenged, the numbers came in about as expected. And we continue to tailor our business to the market as we wait for our recovery. And we outperformed our major peer in every single geo market, demonstrating once again that we continue to grow our market share globally.  Since this is my last call, today I want to share with you my view of the evolution of the North America land market. Our customer base there and why I believe it will continue to surprise to the upside. Now for 25 years I have had fantastic front row seat to the development of US unconventional resources. We have become the largest service company in North America and that growth didn't by accident. First, it was due to the leadership of Jim Brown and his visionary management team. They saw the potential of unconventional resources in the region but the same time as a group of key early mover customers. As a result, we decided to work together using lots of trial and error to unlock this resource. We established enduring customer relationships and gained unparallel base and knowledge that still provides us a sustained advantage today.  I think it's important to look at the North America unconventional ecosystem to understand our customers' behavior. And why their ability to so quickly increase production has expanded rapidly. Currently, there is strongly held view by energy investors that the US independent operators behave as a group. That view is wrong. When thousands of companies make discrete decisions about the same market, each day they do have tendency to swing the activity and production pendulum to far one way or the other. That is not group bank, is the impact of individuals trying to do the right thing for their investors.  Our US customer base is not 10 or so countries like OPEC. It is made of thousands of companies from IOCs to individually owned businesses. When you look at them separately, you see thousands of entrepreneurial, smart and motivated risk takers. They readily adapt to the quality of their reservoirs, have almost unlimited access to capital, aggressively applying new technology and quickly mark their business model and structures to meet changing market conditions. And, yes, sometimes even take advantage of US restructuring laws. They are you are classic American entrepreneurs, and their success should recognized. In Silicon Valley, such a success would be greatly celebrated as another industry disruptor. The unconventional disruption is not widely celebrated beyond the energy space, but it should be. The development of US unconventional resources has been as disruptive to the global energy market as Amazon has been to Big Box Retailing or Uber to the taxi business. You don't leash to wave of cheap, reliable energy that is disrupted global geopolitical and energy dynamics. Made the US more energy independent caused OPEC to react and changed the fundamental economic of offshore production. And I believe it is created a hundreds of billions of dollars of economic value, added hundreds of millions of dollars to government tax coffers and provided untold savings for consumers. So unconventional is what I would call a disruptor, so let's celebrate that. I've heard energy investors say that today's customer behavior shows nothing was learned in the last downturn. That simply is not true. Our customers are smart and adoptive. And they do learn from the past. Their business DNA is to be survivors and they are. Look at the reaction in the past several weeks. Today, rig count growth is showing signs of plateauing and customers are tapping the brakes. This demonstrates that individual companies are making rational decision in the best interest of their shareholders. This tapping of the brakes is happening all over the place in North America. I can tell you the market will respond, it will rebalance and these companies will stay alive, survive and thrive because that's what they do.  I said several quarters ago the customer and animal spirits back and they are with a vengeance and they are now running free to North America. Here is my last piece of wisdom for you. Do not bet against the animal spirits that our North America customers embody. I never have and I never will because that is the bet that you will lose. Now today is my last conference call. And I'd like to take a moment to thank our analysts and investors. It has been pleasure working with you and although we haven't always agreed, I've always enjoyed the spirited debate and intelligent conversations. I'd also like to thank the employees at Halliburton for their hard work throughout my career. We've been through many cycles, emerging stronger from each one and I am proud of what we've accomplished together. And even though I'll be absent from future calls, I look forward to the next 18 months serving Halliburton as Executive Chairman. I am happy to leave these calls in capable hands of Jeff, Chris and the other members of our experienced management team. I have not doubt they will continue to lead the company as a customer centric and returns focused business. And remember one thing, we are the execution company.  With that I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Well, thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased with our second quarter results. We continue to execute our strategy to maximize asset value for our customers and deliver differentiated technology and services that we believe will generate superior returns over the long term.  Here are some highlights for the second quarter. Total company revenue was $5 billion, representing a 16% increase compared to the first quarter of this year. Total adjusted operating income was $408 million, primarily driven by continued strengthening of market conditions in North America, which were partially offset by pricing pressure internationally. Our North America revenue increased by 24% outperforming the average sequential U.S. land rig count growth of 21%. The Completion and Production division revenue increased 20% and operating margins improved by an impressive 700 basis points to approximately 13%, driven by the strength of our production enhancement, cementing and completion tools product service lines. Cash flow from operations delivered about $350 million. I'd like to a moment now to welcome some of the Summit ESP and its employees to the Halliburton family. We are pleased to announce this recent transaction and are excited about what it means for us as we continue to strengthen our artificial lift capabilities. Now I'd like to provide some regional commentary around our quarterly performance. I believe we found the bottom of the international rig count in the first quarter. However, I don't expect a near term rebound in the international markets for several reasons. First, the lengthy contracting cycles will mute any near-term pricing inflection. Second, our international customers need confidence and commodity prices in order to overcome the duration risk in their project. We continue to collaborate with our customers to lower the cost on these projects and while some are moving towards FID, it's important to remember that there is a significant time between planning FID and revenue generation for Halliburton. And finally, I've been consistently more conservative on the international market. And it's played out exactly how I called it. Today, I expect that there will be improvement and activity over the remainder of the year. But these improvements are not concentrated enough to offset the continued pricing pressure. As a result, the international markets will continue to move sideways. With all of this said, it's important to understand that we are now into the third sequential year of significant under spending in the international markets. This implies that the production decline outside of certain OPEC countries will begin to accelerate, particularly next year as the backlogs of new projects are completed and additional projects are not coming behind. In the meantime, we are actively managing cost while protecting our valuable international position for the eventual market recovery. With the current level of under investment internationally, production declines are a certainty and you know where that leads.  Our Drilling and Evaluation division is driven in large part by our international footprint. And while we experienced a modest increase this quarter, largely driven by increased drilling activity in Latin America and the seasonal rebound in North Sea and Russia, the overall market continues to move side ways with continued pricing pressure.  Now turning to North America. After the operation we gave in the first quarter, some of you were skeptical when we accelerated our equipment reactivation. But based on performance during the second quarter, there is no doubt we successfully executed our plan and that this decision was not only right but dead on target. Why is that? During the second quarter, we continue to see strong incremental demand for completion equipment from customers. The reactivated equipment we brought back with the market leading edge pricing and it has been accretive to overall margin and is expected to deliver acceptable returns that exceed our cost of capital.  Our sand war room and logistic central structure allow us to manage the completions intensity our customer demand today. And we've been successful passing along supply cost increases to our customers. Our internal manufacturing capability is a proven differentiator in today's environment. It allows us to be flexible. And being able to build what we need, when we needed particularly in a rapidly changing market. Now today, we believe the current customer demand has outpaced the supply of completions equipment and this should create runway for a strong utilization through the second half of the year. We remain committed to generating industry leading returns and reactivating our equipment was the first step towards delivering the results you have come to expect from us. As some of you've heard me say before, customer urgency is the foundation for the path to normalize margin. Today, our customers remain urgent. And therefore, we believe our path to normalized margins is achievable. We get there through a combination of increasing leading pricing, improved legacy pricing, better utilization and continued cost control. Let me be clear. Our pressure pumping equipment is sold out in the third quarter. As we gauge the utilization of our equivalent on a 24x7 basis, we see a significant opportunity to improve and drive the downtime out of our calendar. In this environment, it's imperative to be aligned with the most efficient customers where we can create value for them while delivering the best returns for Halliburton. Filling our calendar with high proficient customers is an important part what allows us to achieve margin goal. Looking forward, it's too early to tell the impact of commodity prices on customer plans for 2018. However, as Dave said earlier in Halliburton we never underestimate our customers' ability to adapt to the environment. In the first quarter, we experienced significant inflation in sand prices and increased volumes. As we continue to pass through sand cost to our customers, we expect to see greater technology adoption making better wells through engineered solutions.  For the first time in years, in the second quarter we experienced our first decline in average sand pump for well. Let me repeat that because I think this is important. We saw a decline in the average sand pump per well. And while this is only one data point, it's something we will be watching. We believe current sand price levels have encouraged operators to optimize their completion design using more science as opposed to simply maximizing sand and trade for increased production. We maximize returns on our technology investment by being the most effective in the market at lowering our customer's cost per BOE. Our strategy around technology development is to make returns for Halliburton. Very simply our decision process around technology can be summed up in a three questions. First, does it reduce cost? Second, does it produce more barrels? Or third, does it do both? As a result, we create cutting technology that sets new standards for service quality and performance while making better wells for our customers.  For example, on a recent effort in the Permian basin we used our Trans and permeability modifiers to increase production by over 60% compared to previous completion methods. The Trans and permeability enhancer portfolio is our premier offering for flow enhancing technology. Using proprietary micro motion technology Trans and enhancer expand the reservoir contact area and improve fluid flow to increase the recovery factor for our customers. For unconventional matured fields, we developed the bare shield like fluid system. Tailored to reservoirs salt formation and low fracture pressure to reduce circulation loss and washout. This custom tailoring allows us to reduce muddle off, increase drilling efficiency and ensures zonal isolation for an efficient completion. In today's environment, it's crucial that technology be adaptable to customer demand and improves efficiency. During the second quarter, our industry leading cementing technology [Neosam] was used in over 350 wells per month. Including cementing the longest onshore lateral in history. A well that we are now completing. Neosam delivers high performance compressor strength, elasticity and share bond that lower density in conventional system saving time and providing improved performance. Now these three examples show the creativity of our chemistry based research and development teams. We have terrific engineers and scientists looking at every way we can create efficiencies, reduce cost and make more barrels.  Internally, we have similar initiative of continuous improvement, including reducing the time for R&D projects to come to market like our very deep resistivity tool which went from design to field in only nine months. Our surface efficiency initiative of hydraulic fracturing that reduce the downtime between stages. We are always pushing to improving our processes and optimize the services that we bring in the market.  Overall, I am confident about Halliburton's ability to grow North America margins and maintain a run rate for our international business for the remainder of the year. Our strategy is working well. And we intend to stay to course. We'll continue to drive superior execution and remain absolutely focused on delivering best in class returns. North America is clearly serving us as the world swing producer which means this is where the game will be played and Halliburton is the distinct leader in this market.  Now I'd like to welcome Chris Weber to the Halliburton team as our new CFO. Throughout his career, he is working consulting operations and finance with significant international experiences. These combined traits will help Halliburton and may make him an excellent fit for our team.  With that I'm going to turn the call over to Chris to provide some details around our financials. Chris? Chris Weber : Thanks Jeff. And good morning, everyone. Let's start with the summary of our second quarter results compared sequentially to our first quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5 billion, representing an increase of 16%, while operating income doubled to $408 million. These results were primarily driven by the improved activity in pricing in our completion and production division in our North America. Now let me compare our divisional results to the first quarter of 2017. In our Completion and Production division, second quarter revenue increased by 20% while operating income increased 170% primarily driven by increased activity in pricing in our U.S. land pressure pumping business. We also experienced well completion activity primarily in the Gulf of Mexico, North Sea and Russia, partially offset by pricing pressure in the Middle East.  Turning to our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue and operating income increased by 9% and 2% respectively, primarily due to increased US drilling activity. In United States, our drilling and evaluation revenue grew in line with rig count. On the international side, revenue was up due to increased drilling activity in Latin America, North Sea and Russia, partially offset by price pressure across the international markets. Now let me take a minute to compare our geographic results. In North America, revenue increased 24% sequentially, primarily driven by continued improvement in pricing and activity in our US land business, particularly our pressure pumping and well construction product service lines, as well as higher completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico. In Latin America, we saw revenue increase by 10%, primarily driven by increased drilling activity in Mexico, Venezuela and Columbia, as well as higher stimulation activity in Argentina.  Turning to Europe-Africa-CIS, revenue increased 12%, primarily due to a seasonal rebound in the North Sea and Russia resulting in higher drilling, well completions and pipeline and process service activity. For Middle East-Asia, revenue increased 2% primarily as a result of increased fluid services in Asia-Pac and higher wire line and well completion activity in the Middle East, partially offsetting these increases were pricing pressure throughout the region, as well as declines in fluids and stimulation services in the Middle East. Our Corporate and Other expense totaled $114 million in the second quarter, which was higher than originally anticipated, primarily due to approximately $42 million in litigation settlement and one time executive compensation expense during the quarter. Of which $29 million in a loss contingency in connection with an understanding with the SEC staff to settle the previously disclosed investigation of certain past matters related to our operations in Angola and Iraq. The settlement is pending approval by the commissioners of the SEC. Separately; the DOJ has advised this but has completed its investigation of these matters and will not be taking any action. We anticipate that our corporate expenses will be approximately $70 million for the third quarter of 2017. During the quarter, we also recognized a pretax charge of $262 million for a fair market adjustment which is required by accounting rule related to an expected exchange of $375 million of our Venezuela receivables for an interest bearing promissory note of that same value. This note is with our long standing primary customer in Venezuela similar to the Venezuela notes exchange we did in the second quarter of 2016; this new instrument will provide a defined payment schedule while generating a return. We intend to hold the notes to maturity and expect to collect 100% of the principal. It's important to note that to date, we've received all payments required by the 2016 notes.  At a function of reduced debt balance, we reported a $121 million in net interest expense for the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect net interest expense for the third quarter to remain at a similar level. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter came in lower than expected at approximately 23%, due to certain discrete items related to prior year audits. For the remainder of 2017, we still expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 29% to 30%.  Cash flow from operations during the second quarter was approximately $350 million and we ended the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion in cash and equivalents. These results were largely driven by improvement in day sales outstanding. Historically, our annual cash flow is backend loaded for the year and we don't believe that 2017 will be any difference. Continued improvement in our earnings in a number of working capital initiatives should strengthen our cash generated from operations as the year progresses.  Now I'd like to provide some color on our near-term operational outlook. The Macro micro dynamics make forecasting a challenge but this is how we see the third quarter playing out. For our Completion and Production division, we expect that our North America sequential revenue will outperform average US land rig count, while international revenue will remain flat. In addition, we expect margins for the division to increase by 225 to 325 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we are anticipating North America revenue will grow in line with the average US land rig count, while the international market will remain flat to slightly down. We expect margins for this division to remain relatively flat sequentially. Now I'll turn the call back over to Jeff for a few closing comments. Jeff? Jeff Miller : In closing, there are few things I want to highlight. Our second quarter results clearly demonstrated the strength of our franchise in North America and our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing environment. If you believe in energy, you should be invested in North America. Halliburton's relative performance for the balance of the year will remain strong. As a result of our ability to grow our North America margins and continues to maintain revenue and margins in our international business. Our strategy is working well and we intend to stay the course. We'll continue to drive superior execution and remain focused on delivering best-in-class returns.  I want to take a moment to thank Dave for his leadership at Halliburton during the 17 years as CEO. He created an amazing legacy and our employees, customers and shareholders have benefited greatly from his management of our company. I have had the pleasure of working with Dave for almost 30 years. He is an important mentor to me. Together, we developed the strategy and leadership team for our company and I look forward to working with him over the next 18 months.  Before we open the call up for question, I'll go ahead and ask the first one myself because I know it's on everyone's mind. What are we doing around new build equipment? The simple answer is that we are first and foremost a returns focused organization. We have the ability to make a series of discrete decisions around equipment and will only bring it out under certain conditions. First, that it is backed by customer commitment. Second, that it captures leading edge pricing which is accretive to our margins. And finally, it generates acceptable return on investment. So let me remind everyone, that we have not invested in our legacy fleet in two and half years, prudently managing the health of our fleet is important to maintain the type of service quality and reliability that our customers have come to expect. Therefore, some replacement of equipment will be necessary over time. Our manufacturing center in Duncan is a powerful, competitive differentiator for our organization. It allows us to be nimble and build equipment is needed with short lead times. This flexibility allows us to control the rate at which we manufacture, building as little as 2,000 horsepower at a time if need be. We delivered what we said we would on the reactivation plan. When we build additional equipment, we will do it with same discipline around returns. Halliburton is the execution company and you have to trust me to do the right thing. Run the business in the right way and make the right decisions. That answers it.  Now let's open it up for other questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jud Bailey of Wells Fargo. Jud Bailey : Thank you. Good morning. Great and first let me say it, Dave, congratulation on a great career, CEO of Halliburton. I enjoyed working with you last several years. Okay, thanks. First question, I wanted to just circle back on the impact of reactivation in 2Q and how to think about any impact on our third quarter. It was talked about in terms of impacting, negative impacting margins on your first quarter call. You still had incrementals in CMP close to 50%. Could you maybe walk us through how you are able to offset some of the reactivation costs? And then to what extent will reactivation cost impact the third quarter? And do you intend to reactive any more equipment or is it more refers or new build at this point? Jeff Miller : Look, Jud. Thanks. Bottom line is the costs were lower than expected in Q2. And that's because we got there faster and cheaper than we thought. Our Duncan manufacturing team just simply way out performed both by speed and bringing down the cost of everything. The other thing that happened is our people went back to work faster and that's principally because of all of the demand that we saw for our equipment. I supposed one other thing as we were successful in bringing back a large quantity of former Halliburton employees which is something we always wanted to do, but that also mean to say go back to work more quickly with substantially less training. As we look ahead to Q3, obviously there will be new challenges to deal with. For example our employees. Our employees haven't had raises in three years. So we plan to for example provide our employees with raises. But I would like to do is to listen Chris' guidance on completion and production. We said we outperformed the rig count growth on revenue and continue to improve margin. So that's truly how we see that. Jud Bailey : Okay. And I just as my follow up just to kind of think about the progress on or just to CMP for now. One of the scenarios that talked about if oil prices stay between 45 and 50 that we continue to step up in terms of completion activity next couple of quarters then maybe level off. Is getting to normalized margins are realistic scenario in your mind? And if so, do we hit those by the fourth quarter or can we -- would it be reasonable to anticipate being at normalized margins in next year if activity were to kind of level off at 4Q levels? Jeff Miller : Look, we are not backing off our expectation on normalized margins. As I said it and I won't give you a date but I don't have a crystal ball but I'd suspect it would be into 2018. But it starts with customer urgency as I've described. And that really means having targets, to meet targets and that's where we absolutely shine it on. That's what our value proposition does. And we still see supply and demand tightness. I mean our calendar is full as we look out. And so I don't see any change in my outlook. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from James West of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. James West : Hey, good morning, gentlemen. And Dave my congrats as well on one hell of a run at Halliburton. Jeff, I know you answered my question already to a certain extent at the end of your prepared comments there. But as we think about new builds in the market, you laid out your three criteria for new build. Are we at those criteria yet and are you contemplating new builds kind of as we speak besides replacement of increment and new builds? Jeff Miller : Yes, look, I am going to go back to what I said on this, James. And I'd be crazy to lay out our market strategy in detail here. But I laid out the conditions which is committed client contracts or commitments from clients, leading edge pricing and then the ability to generate adequate return. Short answer is we haven't built anything so far this quarter. But I'd say if the opportunity above does present itself then we have the ability and the capability to quickly meet that demand with Duncan. James West : Okay, fair enough. And then Jeff as my follow up here, we have seen some additions by smaller companies that are most of the ones that either IPO or tried IPO need to show some growth to do that. But as you look at your major competitors and look across the pressure pumping marketplace, do you see much additional or incremental horsepower being added outside of kind of what's probably the natural attrition in the market? Jeff Miller : No. I mean our view had always been that there would be attrition. We see that and today our view that market is in fact sold out. That's part of the reason we see ducks building and other thing, and we really got the same amount of horsepower that's been in the market, changed hands in a couple of instances but with respect to the headline amount of horsepower that was there in 2014, we are well short off that today. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons. Bill Herbert : Thank you. Good morning. Jeff, a quick question here for you. Just given the absence of reactivation friction or at least not as much as in the third quarter, a sort of pricing that you are gleaning given the under supply nature of the frac market and the sense of urgency that you talked about, and a leveling off the supply chain inflation. And, yes, so that mentioned some wage inflation but why one incrementals in the third quarter for CMP be better than what they were in the second quarter because your guidance implies assuming a low double digit rate of revenue extension somewhere kind of in the 40% to 45% kind of margin range and strikes me as conservative based upon the fact as you have laid them out. Jeff Miller : Well, first of all, I won't lay all of that out and when we think about what Dave said in terms of tapping the brakes. And so we see some tapping of the brake which in my view better described as let's going from 80 miles an hour to 70 miles an hour. But it hasn't limited the ability to push on price. And our guys absolutely doing that everyday. And as I said, we still see the customer urgency. So we are losing on price all of the time but I think that if we go back to Chris' guidance, I mean that's solid progress and particularly as I described kind of the macro environment that we -- I guess all have talked about. Bill Herbert : Okay. With regard to the cadence of reactivation during the second quarter. Would you describe those as having been relatively evenly distributed over the course of Q2, front end loaded or backend loaded? Jeff Miller : I think ratable sort of Q1, Q2. There was no particularly weighting one way or the other. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ange Sedita of UBS. Your line is now open. Ange Sedita : Thanks. Good morning. Certainly an impressive quarter to be your last one, Dave. And you'll certainly be missed and we wish you well in your new role. So on the question, for Jeff or Dave is on the completion of frac intensity. Is it fair to say that you haven't seen that year peak, and if so when you think about North American revenues going into 2018 in a flat rig market, should we still see revenues starting to flatten out as well or could you see still some growth in that revenue cadence with the completion intensity so thoughts on 2018 and its flattening rig market. Jeff Miller : Well, Ange, it's too early to call on 2018. What I would say the pace that we see, we see a solid ramp in terms of ability to execute and deliver on the things that we talked about with respect to normalized margins. We do see currently ducks Building, there is back and waiting to activity. And quite frankly the science continues to drive the business. And so I think in terms of peak, the peak is going to be probably more science based in the future and maybe less volume driven. Ange Sedita : All right. Fair enough. And then on pricing and pressure pumping. Thoughts on the outlook for pricing as we go into the back half of 2017 and even into 2018. Have you started to see deceleration in recent weeks? And going back to those flat rig market thoughts on pricing in a flat rig market. Jeff Miller : So as I said, Ange, I am not going to layout our pricing strategy here on this call by any means. What I would go back to -- we push price all time, our guys, what we do is in high demand. And particularly in a market like we are in now where urgency matters, delivering targets matters to our customers. And that's where high proficiency and the technology that we bring are so valuable. And so I am confident that we are continuing to work. We talked about the leverage that we have in terms of leading edge priced, legacy fleet and then obviously cost and efficiency. So we work on all of those all the time. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Sean Meakim of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Sean Meakim : Hi, good morning. So, Jeff, you made a point and emphasis around sand demand perhaps starting to get smarter. But is it fair to say that service intensity likely continues to increase on average well basis going forward? And how would characterize the rate of change on overall service intensity? Jeff Miller : Yes that the intensity continues to increase both rate and numbers of stages and those sorts of things. So I think it's more of - I'll bring it up simply because I've always believe that sand, a, is not infinite and it's not free. And so as we started to put constraints on sand in terms of availability cost, it's actually had a very rational impact driving thought around where it goes and how much in terms of total volume. But I'd say in terms of how it gets placed, I talked about it a couple technology examples in my prepared remarks. So those kinds of things the equipment work just as hard but it is how it is applied. So that's I bring that up today. We haven't seen that before really gosh in five years, six years and so it's one data point but it's one that I am certainly going to watch. Sean Meakim : Absolutely. And then just I wanted to also touch --based on the acquisition on Summit. Could you give us maybe a little more detail on the expansion strategy for that new business and just as you bring about M&A, is there other tuck-in need that keep filling up that lift portfolio or can you build also Summit here to really get where you think you need to go? Jeff Miller : Yes, thanks, Sean. I mean the Summit deal is fantastic fit and fantastic people, is what I can say about that. I mean it was a great add for our artificial lift business. When we put our business together with Summit, it creates solid number two position and US, ESP, other technology and really loves their value proposition. I mean they are so dialed into how they respond to customers and they build the plumbing around that to do it very, very well. And so the strategy going forward is to use our footprint to create even more value which we know we can do. Starting here in the US but also internationally. We've talked about M&A before and I don't see -- we continue to be interested in growing our production group which includes all forms of lift. Happy with what we've done two on ESP today and then I've also talked about chemicals being probably more organic and less M&A but nevertheless there will be some M&A in that. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Jim Wicklund : Good morning, guys. And Dave it's been a fabulous almost two decades. But you are not going yet so we'll see other than on the conference call but congratulation on a great run. Dave Lesar : You are right. I am not gone yet. Jim Wicklund : Now we got to bring that that up, make sure everybody understands he is hanging around for 18 more months. Jeff, you made an excellent point on the pricing of international saying that while overall activity is quick going down there is not enough bulk of activity in several markets to really get pricing improvement. Where do you expect to see internationally that the first level of activity getting high enough that we are not giving away price any more and a beginning of recovery? Jeff Miller : Jim, it's going to be some spot whether as a discovery or there is enough sort of base load of activity to move quickly. If I had to guess there is probably some places in Latin America that might fill that bill. But as far as broad region that's really part of the issue, Jim, it's like peanut butter being spread around the world and gets enough traction in a particular spot. So that's why what makes it tough is simply because it will be very concentrated place when we start to see that. Now, the other side of that, that's one of the reasons we do protect our international franchise. We think that the investment we made over the last several years is valuable and will be more valuable in the future when that time comes but it's not -- yes, I think we are moving side wise for a while. Jim Wicklund : And in drilling and evaluation, you note that you had a $150 million increase in revenue but only a $3 million increase in income. And that clearly points to price issues. I am just wondering that you had a seasonal recovery in the North Sea and in Russia and those are two places we normally don't associate with Halliburton being leading edge. Were those two of your better markets or your worse markets? Can you talk about just on the drilling and evaluation side? Where those two markets fit? Jeff Miller : Yes. I mean on a relative basis relatively smaller but quite frankly very good markets for us. And once I really want to give kudos to Joe Rainey and their team who have absolutely executed and build those businesses. So those are businesses that are in my view gaining traction in the DNA part of our business. Better alignment around customers, I think closer alignment with customers particularly in Russia today and very encouraging. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from David Anderson of Barclays. Your line is now open. David Anderson : Great. So, Dave, all the time on the road I think you've earned your downtime. Good luck on your next venture there. So, Jeff, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the pricing -- slightly different way, you talked about getting leading edge pricing on your reactivated equipment. But I am curious for your legacy fleets out there. I think that's been one area you have been trying to keep that, you want to keep those relationships there. What's that spread now and the pricing between the legacy and kind of new equipment go on the market and when do you think that's start to close? Is that a year end? Is that kind of 12 months it takes to close that gap? What are your thoughts there? Jeff Miller : Look, that's something that is closing I'd say sort of everyday as we work it. But let's go back to why there is a spread there. And it's because we are aligning with very good customers, they are very efficient and so we want to be part of their business. And we believe we can do a lot to help drive down sort of their overall cost and lower their cost per BOE. And so that's why we never had -- we abandoned half the market to go move somewhere else. We absolutely want to support all of our customers. So I am not going to give that spread. But I'll tell you it's something like I said in Q1 that we would be closing in on that over four quarters. So look for some time early in 2018 to have that done. David Anderson : Great. Thanks. And then on -- in terms of your fleet now, what percentage of your rough fleet has your modern Q10 pump out there? And I was wondering if you could extend a little bit upon on that pump and how that changes in terms of the useful life of your equipment versus what's out there in the market? You touched on it before about the attrition out there. But just trying to get kind of senses as to kind of how your equipment is different in the market than other equipment out there and why we should we think about that differently? Jeff Miller : Yes. So I mean I'd say we are probably in the 60% range or so for the following reactivation. The important thing about that equipment is that it is build for total cost of ownership. I mean we don't sell this equipment in the market. Our guys at Duncan are absolutely motivated by one thing. What is the most resilient, the efficient piece of equipment? And I go out and check to make sure that it's competitively priced which it is, but more important thing is cost is what it does for our guys in the field. And the way that it is integrated. So it runs a higher rate, it uses all the available horsepower, it's more efficient by still about a 20% efficiency compared to what we see in the market. So when I think about how do we make the best returns in the marketplace, we always think about how do we drive capital off of location and first thing to do is have more efficient pumps on location. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Kurt Hallead from RBC. Your line is now open. Kurt Hallead : Hey, good morning. And Dave congratulation and all the best. So, hey, Jeff, you run up very interesting comment little bit earlier about seeing first quarter here where sand used per well has declined. So wondering if you might be able to elaborate on that a little bit more? Do you sense that as you mentioned that it is truly purely an economic decision? Do you think it's an anomaly? Do you think there is shortage of sand that's driving it? Just kind of get trying to look for little bit more color on what you may be seeing? Jeff Miller : Look, I think it's really is part of the science of frac and that is if not the only thing it's not the customers are running from the economics but they are making very thoughtful economic decisions and as the availability or the actually the applicability of science so the better they understand, we collectively understand how to make more barrels. That gives put to work with clearly an economic backdrop. And I think that back to Dave's earlier comments on our customers. I mean this is an incredibly adaptive group of customers that I think it demonstrated through tougher cycle in our history and ability to consume science, consume lesson learned and move the cost per BOE down almost in the face of anything. And so I think what you are seeing is really the nature evolution of, okay as inputs move up for better ways to get more barrels and in some cases we are seeing that. This is not across the board but on overall basis that was the data point we saw. Kurt Hallead : Okay, thank you. And just maybe on the international front. I know you mentioned-- use the spreading the peanut butter analogy, but it seems like there is more concentrated increased activity levels going on in Latin America in a number of different countries. Do you feel like you could get pricing power moving in right direction in Latin America before some other region? Jeff Miller : Well, again I am not going to get our strategy around price anywhere but what I'd say Latin America is not too different in terms of the contract cycle terms of -- length of contracts typically have a muting impact. There is plenty of -- quite a bit of equipment in the world today and so certainly look forward to that but I'd not -- it's not enough to change the overall trajectory. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Waqar Syed : Thank you. And Dave congratulation again and you'll be certainly missed and your comments would be missed greatly on the calls. My question relates to the Permian sand that's been recently got FERC's, a new capacity additions have been announced and there is good chance that prices are going to fall quietly sharply in the Permian for EMP companies there. What impact does that have for pressure pumping companies as sand prices fall in the Permian? Is it neutral or is it negative or positive? And then also how do you think about your own investment in Trans loading and rail transportation? Would that change if most of the sand is regionally sourced? Jeff Miller : Look, that's great for us. It's good for our customers. It's good for us in terms of lowering cost per BOE. I've been very vocal about why we don't own mines and that's -- this is an example of why not bring it from Halliburton standpoint, why we wouldn't want to be invested and tied, was not cost to places, technology moves a different direction. Trans load infrastructure that we have is valuable. I'd say probably the toughest part to get to realistically is the Permian basin and local sand in my view opens up a whole new avenue of what is lower cost. And some of the things that we are doing around delivering sand. We are always looking at how do we get sand delivered at a lower cost point and I think our containerized solutions that we are implementing are right, right in the sweet spot of that kind of development. Waqar Syed : Okay. And you don't see -- are there any long -term negative implications of -- cost implications for railcars or other things that you may have leased? Or the industry may have leased? Jeff Miller : No. I mean that's the stuff works all over the country and that's fairly localized solution. So I like what we are invested in. And we've always been careful. Again, we target about 50% of our capacities manage internally. And we do that so that we can flex with the market. And that's how I see this. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ole Slorer of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Ole Slorer : Thank you very much. And again, Dave, congratulation for the very solid runs at Halliburton. Jeff, question to you again regarding kind of the sand logistics and the changes in completion again. I mean before you highlighted that at Halliburton doesn't really have any interest in owning sand but once the fork is on the logistics because of the changing nature of the type of proppants, that's preferred. So could you talk a little bit about the kind of capacity thing added at the moment in West Texas is kind of 100 mesh largely some 470 and address that in context of other proppants, how you see the mix evolving? And how that impacts Halliburton? Jeff Miller : Well, look, we are in large part agnostic to the type of sand, the reality is we study sand closely to understand how to better design chemistry to make better frac. Cost is always a component of that. But we've seen other media sort of go into vogue and out of vogue and we've got mark risk out which is an NO style solution or micro style solution. So I think that obviously what's being talked about today is consistent with what I hear from customers. And what is being consumed today. But again that the drive for better science is always going on and that's one of the reasons our labs are constantly looking at, how to take what's available and make it better and how to either or to substitute with things that are better. So I think just the answer [Multiple Speakers] is inappropriate. Ole Slorer : So the reduction that you saw on a per well basis. Was that a function of shortages and sand pricing and therefore forcing industry to adopt different methods or do you see this trend continuing even it's kind of sand gets the bottlenecked? Jeff Miller : Well, it's one data point so I will clearly be watching that. Since that I get this more around design and what is the most -- our clients are dead focused on lowest cost per BOE, making more barrels and at a lower cost. And so designing things that can consume less sand but deliver more barrels or as many barrels is clearly what they want to do. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Miller for any closing remarks. Jeff Miller : Thank you, Candice. Before we close, there are a couple points I'd like to highlight. First, our second quarter performance demonstrates strength of our North American franchise and our ability to adapt to rapidly changing environment. Second, Halliburton's relative performance for the balance of this year will remain strong as a result of our ability to grow North America margins and maintain revenue and margins internationally. Look forward to talking with you next quarter. Candice, you may now close out the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. And you may all disconnect. Have a great day everyone.",

Welcome to the Halliburton Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are a listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Lance Loeffler, Halliburton\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Lance Loeffler : Good morning. And welcome to the Halliburton third quarter 2017 conference call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on Halliburton\u2019s website for seven days. Joining me this morning are Jeff Miller, President and CEO; and Chris Weber, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton\u2019s views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton\u2019s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, recent current reports on Form 8-K, and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. And unless otherwise noted, in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of the second quarter fair market value adjustment related to Venezuela. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our third quarter press release, which can be found on our website. Finally, after our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow more time for others who may be in the queue. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you, Lance, and good morning everyone. Overall, we had a fantastic quarter and I\u2019m very pleased with our results. We are hitting on all cylinders just like we said we would and this quarter\u2019s performance is another example of why Halliburton is the execution company. Here are few highlights from the third quarter. Total company revenue was $5.4 billion, representing a 10% increase compared to our second quarter results, and we generated $1.1 billion of operating cash flow. Once again, we outgrew our peers on a global basis showing that we are taking global market share. Our North American revenue increased by 14%, significantly outpacing the average sequential U.S. land rig count growth of 6%. Total operating income increased 55% to over $630 million, primarily driven by continued strengthening of market conditions in North America and improved profitability in our drilling and evaluation product lines. Our completion and production division revenue increased 13% with 215 basis points of margin expansion, despite the approximately 50 basis-point negative impact of Hurricane Harvey. The drilling and evaluation division revenue increased 4% while operating margins expanded by 260 basis points to approximately 9%, demonstrating solid execution in our international franchise. Finally, during the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Summit ESP, which is an important strategic step in building out our production oriented business lines and makes us the number two ESP provider in North America. In August, the Texas Gulf Coast was severely impacted by Hurricane Harvey and our fantastic employees worked closely together to support those in our organization and the entire community affected by the storm. As a result of the weather, we had a few customers temporarily suspend activity in both the Gulf of Mexico and the Eagle Ford. We also experienced increased costs because diesel fuel was temporarily unavailable and reduced deficiency due to sand supply chain disruptions, both of which negatively affected our margins for the quarter. In spite of these disruptions, the sophistication and hard work of our supply chain organization allowed us to quickly adapt to these challenges and continue to execute and deliver superior service quality. Let me take a moment and talk about a few things we said about North America in the second quarter call. We told you the rig count growth would plateau, and that\u2019s exactly what it did. We said our North America sequential revenue would significantly outperform average U.S. land rig count growth, and it did. We told you that our completion and production margins would continue to expand, and they did. We said operators were beginning to optimize as opposed to maximize the use of sand and turn to technology to increase production; this trend held true as we saw average sand per well remain flat sequentially. And finally, we said we would have the highest returns in the industry, and we do as we continue to outgrow our peers and take market share. Now, let me spend some more time on each of these topics. During the quarter, the U.S. land rig count effectively flattened as customers reacted to shareholder input and their own view of market conditions for the balance of the year. However, our revenue increased and we saw improved activity in our completions related product lines due to the natural lag between drilling and completing wells. Today, the industry is drilling approximately the same footage as in 2014 with half the rigs while completions intensity has significantly increased. As the rig count stabilizes, our customers are focused on efficiencies, optimization and making more barrels. These are all things Halliburton does really well, differentiating us from our peers. And I\u2019m pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made this quarter towards normalized margins in North America. Our strategy is working. And as I said in the past, the path to normalized margins begins with customer urgency, and I still see that urgency today. We have three levers to achieve our margin goals. And they\u2019re, one, increasing pricing; two, improving equipment utilization; and three, structurally reducing our costs. Increasing pricing is important, but it\u2019s just one component we can leverage to reach our goal. Ultimately, we will utilize a combination of all three levers to return to normalized margins. All three levers are important, and the great thing about Halliburton\u2019s scope and scale is that we have the ability to pull on them all in a meaningful way. And you know Halliburton is the execution company. We\u2019re going to pull these levers as necessary to get to our normalized margins. The North America completions market remains tight and we continue to push pricing across our portfolio every day. Demand for our completions equipment and service quality remains strong. The improving oil price outlook provides runway for us to increase our portfolio pricing as we go forward. So, let me be clear; we still have the ability to push price. Equipment utilization comes in a couple of forms. First, it has to be working; and second, it has to be working for the right customers. Our fleet is sold out for the remainder of the year and into 2018. We continue to place our equipment with those customers who know how to effectively and efficiently use us to increase their productivity, which improves our utilization. As for reducing costs, we continue to remove unnecessary costs from our company. It\u2019s also critical that we save costs and increase utilization through the use of technology. Our wellhead ExpressKinect unit is a perfect example. This equipment allows us to increase our utilization by switching wellheads faster and more safely when doing zipper-frac operations. As a result, we\u2019re able to reduce the number of people on location and improve our equipment efficiency. Let\u2019s now take a minute and talk about a few topics that I hear frequently debated in the market. The first is sand. During the third quarter, total sand volume for Halliburton continued to increase, but our average sand per well remained sequentially flat. Data points from the last two quarters and my discussions with customers indicate customers are focused on cost-effective production. They hear a lot of conflicting anecdotes about sand used today, because they are based on individual operators and individual basis. But the facts are, for Halliburton, sand per well was down in the Bakken, Rockies and Northeast, and it was up in the Permian Basin. This happened because customers that know the production characteristics of the reservoirs have streamlined their operations to focus on cost per barrel of oil equivalent and are optimizing sand utilization. Conversely, those customers that are still drilling the whole acreage or exploring production boundaries at their reservoirs are continuing the pump jobs with higher sand loads. At the end of the day, Halliburton benefits from both scenarios. The second topic is supply and demand for pressure pumping equipment. Now, first, let me be clear. I believe the market is undersupplied today. At the same time, equipment is being used harder and maintenance costs are higher. As a result, there will be a greater call for new equipment, just to replace the active equipment that\u2019s being worn out more quickly, meaning the day when supply and demand come into balance is further out than people think. Now, I believe companies that are not making money will struggle to build new equipment beyond their current fleet, take or pay commitments, as they work with constraint budgets and struggle to find capital to fund further purchases. You see many announcements of new fleet deployments, but no announcement of fleet retirements. But, I can tell you, they are happening. Next, completions intensity is not slowing down. We are pumping more sand with less equipment, and as a result, the maintenance costs associated with today\u2019s completion designs are increasing. The design of our equipment gives us an advantage over the market that even we have seen an increase in maintenance costs. I believe deferred maintenance is happening throughout the industry. A proxy for deferred maintenance and the simplest place to see it is in the industry and horsepower creeping crew size. Now, while Halliburton continues to operate with an average fleet size 36,000 horsepower per crew and have for the last several years, the rest of the industry is now averaging closer to 45,000 horsepower per crew. Deferred maintenance is creating this equipment redundancy on location. The bottom line is that Halliburton has the advantage to respond to customer demand by bringing less equipment to the well side and designing our equipment to require less maintenance cost. Building our equipment internally gives us the ability to respond quickly to market changes and to design our equipment to reduce the total cost of ownership. As a follow-up to that point, I said last quarter, I\u2019d be crazy to talk about new build equipment in detail terms, and this remains the case. But, what I said has not changed. We are first and foremost a returns focused organization. And we will only bring out new build equipment under certain conditions. And those conditions are, one, backed by customer commitment; two, captures leading-edge pricing, which is accretive to our margins; and finally, three, it generates acceptable return on investment. Turning to the international markets. Outside North America, our more conservative outlook for the last several quarters is proving accurate. Our customers around the world have different breakeven thresholds and production requirements that all face the headwinds of the current commodity price environment. Due to lower cash flow and project economics, they are more focused than ever on lowering costs. The result of this combination is less activity and more pricing pressure. In contrast to North America, where we believe that a $50 oil price drives significant activity, customers tell me, the longer duration international markets will react less to absolute oil price but more to a positive view of where price will be for several years. This isn\u2019t surprising, given the longer investment cycle that many of our customers face. I believe that we found a floor in the international rig count earlier this year. However, due to the longer term contractual nature of international markets and the level of continuing price pressure, I expect discounts will offset activity gains over the near-term. In this environment, we have to execute and maintain margin by controlling costs. Our international organization is committed to making the toughest of markets sustainable and has continued to rightsize the business during the quarter, demonstrating impressive control over their costs. In addition, customers embrace the way we go to market. We collaborate in engineered solutions to maximize asset value for our customers and it is paying off. In the eastern hemisphere, we achieved a modest improvement in activity in the third quarter but the landscape remains challenged. Pricing pressure and cost cutting remained major themes, and the use of technology to lower the cost per BOE is ever more important. Our products service lines continue to deliver technology that drives our value proposition, maximizing asset value. The Middle East remains our most active international market with the largest part of the work focused on mature fields. Among many important technologies deployed in the region, I\u2019d like to highlight our CoreVault system. This system effectively stores sidewall cores with up to 2.5 times more oil and gas than previously. This additional reservoir characterization and effective means for doing so allow our customers to make more barrels and reduce cost. In the Middle East, we continue to build on our leading position in project management because of our ability to work closely with our customers and deliver superior service quality. Our most recent contract win is a project to deliver over 300 wells in Oman, and we\u2019ve seen increased project management activity in this region, allowing us to showcase our services and technologies that reduce time and cost on a project. We have seen significant market share growth as we have a proven execution track record and deliver better wells for our customers. In the North Sea, this year has been about reducing production costs through standardization and technology optimization. We have the technology portfolio to solve our customers\u2019 problems from single density, variable slurry cement that can be used for all sections of well to our data sphere array monitoring system that due to its modular design provides customized reservoir monitoring. We help structurally reduce cost by decreasing the time to drill and complete a well or by producing more barrels. What\u2019s most important to point out is how we collaborate with customers and together we create terrific results. Another example is in the North Sea where our ruthless focus on service quality, collaboration with the operator and rig contractor, driving efficiency on critical path items and responding to customer insight has laid to record-breaking performance on a multi-well integrated services contract. This project is truly a collaborative effort and through the collective thought and execution of the team, they\u2019ve been able to reduce the time to finish a full year scope of work by over 165 days, saving over $170 million. The improved efficiency came from two areas, technique solutions for record growing performance and collaboration where our commercially aligned team coordinated collaborative planning and execution. Latin America saw a slight rig count growth in the third quarter, driven by increased activity in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil. While activity is improving, the pricing pressures across the region make it increasingly important to be efficient as we execute. This quarter in Mexico, we designed and ran especially drill bit to help tackle a particularly difficult reservoir. This design reduced the necessary runs in hole, resulting in a three-day reduction in rig time. This example shows that even in a tough pricing environment, there is an appetite for new technology, especially if there were reduced costs. Finally, in recent days, commodity prices have experienced the modest rebound, as we have seen some signs of tightening in the macro supply demand picture. However, I still believe that the oil and gas industry will largely remain in a range-bound commodity price environment in the near to medium term. I am confident that Halliburton has the right strategy. In this environment, we\u2019re focused on returns and capital discipline. In this type of sustaining market, I expect that our capital spending should be approximately aligned with our depreciation expense. Our working capital should continue to improve over time as our day sales outstanding declines to traditional levels and our free cash flow conversion should be in line with or exceed our peers, and to deliver these metrics, we\u2019re focused on maximizing asset utilization, improving working capital velocity, and capital discipline. When I take all of those together, I am confident that we will generate solid free cash flow in today\u2019s market environment. Pure and simple, Halliburton is proud to be a service company, and we believe our investors and customers appreciate that. I am confident that we\u2019re working on the right things that create the most value and generate the highest returns. Our strong competitive position is not only a function of geographic footprint, it\u2019s also the depths of the products and services that we provide to our customers and use it to generate industry-leading returns for our shareholders. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chris for a financial update. Chris Weber : Thanks, Jeff. Good morning. I\u2019ll start with the summary of our third quarter results compared sequentially to our second quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.4 billion, representing an increase of 10% while operating income was $634 million, an increase of 55%. These results were primarily driven by increased activity and pricing in North America. Turning to our division results. In our completion and production division, third quarter revenue increased by 13% while operating income increased 32%, primarily resulting from improved activity in pricing throughout North America land in our pressure pumping, completion tools and cementing product service lines. On the international side, increased completions activity in the Middle East and the start of new contracts in Brazil improved results. In our drilling and evaluation division, revenue and operating income increased by 4% and 44%, respectively. These increases were primarily due to increased drilling activity in the Middle East, North America and Latin America. Globally, we saw sequential improvement in all of our drilling and evaluation product lines. Let\u2019s take a minute to review our geographic results. In North America, revenue increased 14% sequentially, driven by increased utilization and pricing throughout the United States land sector in the majority of our products service lines, primarily pressure pumping as well as higher well completion and pressure pumping activity in Canada. In Latin America, we saw revenue increase by 4%, primarily driven by increased activity in Argentina, production group activity in Brazil, and increased drilling activity in Mexico. These results were partially offset by reduced well completion activity in Venezuela. Turning to Europe, Africa and CIS, revenue increased 6%, primarily due to improved utilization in the majority of our product service lines in the North Sea and improved drilling and well completion services in Russia and Nigeria. The results were partially offset by reduced activity in Angola. For Middle East/Asia, revenue increased 3%, primarily as a result of increased activity in the Middle East and project management activity in Indonesia, partially offset by reduced activity in pricing across Southeast Asia and lower project management activity in Iraq. Our corporate and other expense totaled $71 million in the third quarter and we expect our fourth quarter will be comparable to this quarter. As a function of our reduced debt balance, we reported $115 million in net interest expense for the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect net interest expense for the fourth quarter to remain at a similar level. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter came in at approximately 27%, slightly lower than expected due to variability in our earnings mix. For the fourth quarter, we expect the effective tax rate to range between 27% and 29%. Cash flow from operations during the third quarter was approximately $1.1 billion. Providing some color on our near-term operational outlook. As is typical for the fourth quarter, a combination of weather, holidays, budget constraints and year-end sales make forecasting a challenge, but this is how we see it playing out right now. Similar to prior years, we expect our U.S. land results to moderate in the fourth quarter due to the holidays and lower efficiency levels experienced in the winter months, particularly across the Rockies and Northern U.S. In our international business, we believe the typical seasonal uptick in year-end product and software sales will be lower this year versus traditional levels as customer budgets are largely exhausted. Given these factors, in our drilling and evaluation division, we expect North America revenue will change in line with the average U.S. land rig count while international revenue will increase by low-single digits. For our completion and production division, we expect that our North America revenue will outperform the average change in U.S. land rig count by several hundred basis points while international revenue will increase by low single digits. We expect the operating profitability for both of our divisions to increase marginally in the fourth quarter. Let me turn it back to Jeff for a few closing comments. Jeff Miller : Thanks, Chris. In closing, there are few things I want to highlight. First, I am very pleased with our third quarter results. I want to thank each of our employees for their hardworking commitment to execute at every turn and deliver Halliburton\u2019s value preposition. These results clearly demonstrate the strength of our franchise and our ability to adapt to any environment. Second, Halliburton\u2019s relative performance in the 2018 will remain strong, as a result of our ability to grow our North America revenue and margins, and improve our position in our international businesses. Finally, our strategy is working and we intend to stay the course. We are focused on delivering superior execution for our customers and achieving industry-leading returns and cash flow conversion for our shareholders. Now, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. You may begin. James West : Hey, good morning, guys. Jeff Miller : Good morning, James. James West : Jeff, for the first time, I think I can remember that your earnings met or if you exclude some of the Harvey impact, they Schlumberger\u2019s, which is pretty impressive I think. What part of your strategy would you attribute that to? Jeff Miller : Thanks, James. Look, our strategy is pretty simple and very executable, and it\u2019s to be the best service company. And that means we focused on leading returns, margins and revenue growth, and along with that technology, directly focused on returns, collaborating with our customers, the strong BD group, and then delivering service quality. I think that returns focused, I mean that is our strategy and is working. James West : Got it. And then a follow-up from me to a comment that you made towards the end of your prepared statements. It sounds like spending within or spending the levels, CapEx hitting level that depreciation would be really just sustaining CapEx, so little kind of growth in PP -- or no growth in PP&E. Can you perhaps discuss the discipline here on your side with respect to adding equipment to the market? Jeff Miller : Look, I -- when we look at the market as it\u2019s playing out, I think we have what we need to execute. And as I described, what we see in front of us in terms of activity as I described international, described North America, I think at that sort of pace, then we ought to have a business that returns solid cash flow from that kind of market. And so, when I\u2019ve described those types of parameters it\u2019s to describe what we see. And you know again, focused on returns means that we are very efficient and we drive a lot of velocity with the equipment that we have, utilization, things of that nature, spend a lot of time talking about that. But that is in fact how we see generating a lot of cash flow. Operator : Our next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. You may begin. David Anderson : Yes, thanks. Good morning, Jeff. Staying on the pressure pumping side just for a second here, your strategy in downturn is to gain share and stimulation. You talked about all your equipment deployed. So, I guess, I\u2019m wondering right now, does pricing out there currently support new build economics? It seems like we\u2019re in another one of those crossroads between maximizing returns or continuing to protect share. Can you discuss your thinking, please? Jeff Miller : Well, I think we\u2019re always going to be about returns. Clearly, we need share to drive the volume and the scale, and that\u2019s where the efficiency and some of the things that I talk about are more meaningful at scale. But, specific to the building question, I\u2019m just going to go back to what I said on this, answered this a couple of quarters now, but the three conditions being to meet client, leading edge pricing and generating adequate returns. But I don\u2019t think that -- there is a lot of juice in utilization, there is a lot of juice and in effect market share comes from better utilization. So, I think you kind of under estimate the number of levers that we have in the market when it comes down to something that binary. David Anderson : Thanks, Jeff. Kind of a different question, more strategic question, back in September, you talked about how HAL is not interested in financing E&P projects. It\u2019s been a subject, something up quite a bit lately. Can you update us on your thoughts around performance based contracts and is there any desire on Halliburton\u2019s part to invest in these types of projects along side your customers? Jeff Miller : Yes, thanks. This is -- for us, we call that integrated asset management, and it is really a capital allocation question; it\u2019s where do we put our capital and what will make the best returns. And so, -- and along with those better returns, my view, a key part of that is asset velocity and to produce returns for shareholders. So, we\u2019re not going to tie up our cash and things that we think had longer duration and likely lower returns. We have done some smaller deals, we\u2019ve done a few things, we understand this space. And when we do it, we\u2019ll do it with other people\u2019s money to maintain those kinds of returns. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company. You may begin. Bill Herbert : Thank you. Good morning. Hey, Jeff and Chris. I guess, a comment with regard to -- I mean, you\u2019ve made some I think some realistic and some encouraging comments with regard to your visibility and the continued pricing strength and tightness in the frac value chain accordingly. What should we expect for incrementals going forward? If you look at Q3 C&P, they were in the low 30s, which is typically reflective of volumetric incremental ramps in pricing, and I recognize that there was some Harvey nose. But, kind of in the market that we expect, not necessarily red hot from an activity standpoint but still tight and pricing still accommodating your utilization, you said that there is runway for improvement. Shouldn\u2019t we expect incrementals to be higher than what we have at the end of the third quarter? Chris Weber : Yes, this is Chris. We\u2019re not giving guidance on incrementals. We\u2019re focused on margin expansion. We talked about margin improvement and our profitability. When we look at the pace that we\u2019re at, I mean, we got almost a 1,000 basis points of margin expansion in few quarters of C&P. And Jeff spent a lot of time talking about the path towards those normalized margins, the levers that we have to pull. So, we\u2019re confident of that path. Now, remember C&P is more than just frac and P&E in North America. We\u2019ve also got our production business lines; we\u2019re investing in those business lines, looking to grow in line with that Summit acquisition. So, there are other elements of that, but we feel strongly about that path with the levers that we have to pull that Jeff laid out. Bill Herbert : Okay. And if we could drill down on pricing just a little bit more. I guess the narrative, industry-wide coming into this quarter was that leading edge pricing was still supportive of new build economics. But slope of the event that we witnessed year-to-date was flattening, not flattened, but flattening, and there was still continued convergence between leading edge and legacy pricing. Is that a fair summation as to where pricing stands today? Jeff Miller : Yes. Bill, I think that\u2019s reasonable. Our guys push price all of the time. And so, maybe not accelerating the way it did in the spring, but still opportunity and momentum in North America. I think if we look at Q3, bit of a cause just as commodity prices bounced into the 40s, but we talked about, first and foremost finding the right customer to drive efficiency, and it doesn\u2019t change the demand for our services today, and along with that comes ability to move on price. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Sedita with UBS. You may begin. Angie Sedita : So, I appreciate the color on returning to normalize margins for North America. And maybe you could a little bit more about two of the levers, right, utilization and cost cutting, a little bit more color there on how much more you think you have to be done on utilization side as well as on the cost cutting, and maybe even a little bit the timeline on how much we could see that clearing into 2018? Jeff Miller : Well, I think if the question\u2019s around the path to normalized margins, I\u2019ve always said, it starts with customer urgency. We see that, calendar power being also important in terms of driving utilization and working with the efficient client. In terms of how far there is to move, each of those levers has fair amount of ways to move. I won\u2019t give you the specifics, but it\u2019s one of those things that we work every day. But it\u2019s the precision around, for example what happens on location being able to measure all of those steps. And again, the measurement scale is a bit of a different matter. But, what\u2019s special about that is that now when we make changes and drive efficiency, again driving better utilization, we can drive across just a fleet at a time. And so that gives me a lot of confidence around the ability to improve the number of turns on equipment in a day. From a cost perspective, we\u2019re constantly working that. I\u2019ve talked about our continuous improvement being one of the pillars of our strategy but really, Angie that\u2019s what we do to systematically drive cost out of all of the components of our business. And often times that includes technology, I referred to some of that in my script. But, it\u2019ll also be technology that takes all kinds of forms, some is customer-facing, a lot of it internally facing, so that all of that value accrues to us in terms of reducing costs. I hope that helps. Angie Sedita : Yes. That does help. I appreciate that. And then, as an unrelated follow-up. Maybe you could talk a little bit about your fleet today and just as a reminder, how much of your frac fleet that\u2019s in the field today is Q10 versus legacy assets and just thoughts on the life of those assets and replacement or upgrades over time? Jeff Miller : Yes. Thanks, Angie. That\u2019s probably about 60% of the fleet Q10 today. But again, big push several years ago with our retrofit, the fleet with Q10, don\u2019t have that same requirement today, and that\u2019s when we talk about capital, that\u2019s why I\u2019m comfortable with the kind of capital progression we laid out in this kind of market, because there is a very natural sort of replacement that happens over time. I will do that with Q10s, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be -- it won\u2019t be anything like maybe what you\u2019ve seen in the past. And the Q10s really have delivered and we continue to go to market with solidly less horsepower than competitors. And I think that also gets to -- if we think about the industry\u2019s pace of replacement, I think we\u2019re going to well outperform that and that\u2019s going to show up in the form of returns. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. You may begin. Q - Jud Bailey : Thanks. Good morning. Just of follow up on Angie\u2019s question. You highlighted kind of the three levers you still have to pull you think you can pull to get to normalized margins. I\u2019d be curious is -- of the three, is one a bigger driver than the other at this point, or are they all kind of equal or is one going to be a bigger driver? And, is there a way to think about the timing in which to kind of get to that level, is that a still a realistic possibility in 2018? Jeff Miller : Yes. Short answer, yes, Jud, on to get there in 2018. The pulling on the different levers, you know us; we\u2019re going to pull every lever we got. But those are the big levers that when we pull them, have the more meaningful impact. So, I\u2019m not going to break one above the other necessarily, actually all three of them are very powerful. And we\u2019re working this. Jud Bailey : Okay. That\u2019s fair. And my follow-up question is you alluded to it in your prepared comments that your strategy on artificial lift and kind of the production side of the business. Could you -- you have Summit, is the strategy to kind of grow that platform across the Halliburton global platform or do you still see other opportunities out there that could supplement Summit on both production chemicals and artificial lift side? Jeff Miller : Yes, thanks. Well that\u2019s the all of production is an opportunity for us to grow, in our wheelhouse, it\u2019s -- as I talk about our strategy to collaborate an engineered solution, that fits well with what we do. Summit was such a nice add, I give a shout out to the new employees we have from Summit, fantastic business and yes, very scalable. And clearly, the plan is to scale that beyond the U.S. and to our international operations. And those activities are underway. The other components of that, I\u2019ve talked about chemicals. I think that will likely be a more organic move than it is M&A, maybe a little bit a bolt-on around that. But, the guys are working hard at that every day, and I really think that that is something that we will just systematically build out and we\u2019ll talk about it from time-to-time along that path, probably not every quarter but as it continues to grow, we\u2019ll give you a better insight into that. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse. You may begin. Jim Wicklund : The biggest issue, of course now we\u2019re talking about what 2019 earnings are going to be, but for the last several weeks, you had an all price high enough that E&Ps have been hedging, the head of Total mentioned at a London concert -- conference that U.S. E&Ps have been hedging like crazy, you guys have a little bit of visibility into 2018. I realize your customers really haven\u2019t set their budgets yet. But, the discussions that you are having, are they more constructive now than they were before? Can you give us what little outlook you may be able to have for 2018, as we sit here today? Jeff Miller : Yes. I mean, Jim, our board is full through the first part of 2018 and the reality is the only people that probably talk to more customers than me is my BD group and I talk to the BD group every day. And so, we\u2019re having constructive conversations about 2018 and encouraging discussions. I think the $50 oil through the planning cycle is a great thing, yes, and I mean this is the right time. And so, they are absolutely planning to work next year, hedges are getting in place. And I think it\u2019s -- interesting thing, when we talk to our customers, we don\u2019t lecture our customers, I mean, we listen to them. Because we listen to them, we hear the message that they are getting from their stakeholders, and I think this is important point. Because all of our -- with all of our conversations, my personal conversations, some are very focused on returns and there are others that are going to shoot them in because they like the acreage that they have. But that\u2019s because that\u2019s what their shareholders want. And at the end of the day, we work for both sets of customers. And so, I am very encouraged going into 2018, Jim. Jim Wicklund : That\u2019s positive; I\u2019ll take that, good. Second question if I could. Jud mentioned artificial lift; we all know Dover is in the market. Your balance sheet is a little over levered. Can you talk about what the plan is Chris, maybe through 2017 and through 2018 in terms of balance sheet ratios and freedom to do deals? Chris Weber : Yes. So, I mean, just in terms of the balance sheet and we\u2019ve talked about desire to further delever. I mean, we retired the $1.4 billion earlier this year. We\u2019ve got a maturity in August of next year, $400 million that we plan to retire. We like to see our credit metrics normalize, debt to EBITDA under 2.5 times, debt to cap moving back into 30s and so focused on working towards those metrics. Jeff Miller : And Jim, I\u2019ll just add the discussion around. Production and some of these things is part of what makes that C&P group a big group, and there is a lot of moving parts in there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Timna Tanners with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. You may begin. Timna Tanners : I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about any future improvement, international in particular, your comments on taking market share, if you can elaborate a little bit on how and where you have been doing that and if you have further rightsizing internationally? Jeff Miller : Yes. Thanks, Tim. I think that team absolutely executing in the marketplace. I think we are taking share by virtue of the performance that we saw this quarter and we\u2019ve seen for several quarters. But, I think probably what\u2019s more important when we think about international is I think we have a more realistic view what that market is. For example, we\u2019re seeing more activity or at least signs of activity in the form of FIDs and things. But those are not tenders; those don\u2019t convert the service revenue quickly. We did find the bottom, but I think that those are very competitive markets with a lot of visibility around the activity in those international markets. And so, I do believe that the pricing pressure will persist and likely offset a lot of the gains that you might expect from that kind of activity, particularly as we go into 2018. Timna Tanners : Okay. So, rightsizing may continue there, it sounds like? Jeff Miller : Yes. And I think that\u2019s just part of a process. It\u2019s a combination of our continuous improvement activities where we\u2019re consistently looking at technology to drive cost out. But, it\u2019s hard; it is taking those things and turning it into how do we operate at lower cost point. And I would say that that team has done that consistently. That\u2019s not a projection. They will just manage all the levers that they have to manage. Timna Tanners : Okay. And I just want to follow up on Harvey, if there is lingering impact into the fourth quarter and if that -- or if that\u2019s been what\u2019s behind in the third quarter? Jeff Miller : I think that\u2019s behind as at the end of Q3. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. You may begin. Scott Gruber : Jeff, I wanted to start with your digital transformation strategy. I think Halliburton is doing more than many investors realize. Can you discuss your broader strategy around this effort, such as the OpenEarth initiative, the Microsoft alliance? And importantly, are E&Ps more willing to share data in the credit environment or how do you work around the reluctance to share data if not and still deliver value enhancing tools? Jeff Miller : Yes. No, very excited about our strategy and I think we\u2019ve laid that out but it is -- at its heart, and this is an important distinction and open architecture strategy which makes it a lot easier for customers to use. I think there will always be competition around data between customers. And I think customers are taking a closer and closer look at their own data and who owns and controls that data, and I suspect they will control it more so. It is just very competitive for our customers. And so, when we think about that, we want to make certain that we have the right set of tools that can be used effectively by them. And they\u2019re open in the sense that our customers uptake of those tools and they can make them do what they need them to do. And I think tools is probably an oversimplification, I\u2019m describing more of a platform and the philosophy. But, as we work with Microsoft for example, that\u2019s again an ability to leverage I think a lot of investment and R&D and cloud that will help our customers. But again, I will tell you, we are very returns oriented. And so, when I think about what we do, we\u2019re very specific about where we create value and what it proves to us versus necessarily scatter shooting across the space. Scott Gruber : Got it, appreciate the color. And unrelated follow-up on the domestic frac market and the sand per well trend. What are you hearing from your customers regarding their potential response to falling sand prices as the new local Permian mines come on? Do you anticipate them using more sand per well? Does that uptrend begin to anew? Do they simply go out and drill more wells, which you may hear about through in discussions around on fleet expansion? How do you think they respond to falling sand prices, particularly in the Permian? Jeff Miller : I think all of our -- that will create -- lower costs, will create more headroom for our clients to work, no question. But I think the more important dynamic in the Permian than the price necessarily today is, is they better understand those reservoirs and how to make the best production at the lower cost per BOE. That\u2019s why I held out the Permian as one where we see sands per well increasing. And I think that\u2019s more evidentiary of our market that\u2019s being learned as opposed to one being optimized and that makes perfect sense and that\u2019s what our customers do. They make the best investment and they manage their business very carefully. And so, when they make decisions to do more of something, there will be a reason for that. I think that\u2019s more the reason in West Texas today as reservoirs are better understood in other parts of the country that\u2019s where you start to see more of that optimization. But, I would expect that it does free up more cash for doing more work, which is certainly positive. But, I would not assume that they don\u2019t optimize in West Texas at some point either. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Wolfe Research. You may begin. Chase Mulvehill : Good morning, Jeff. So, quick question on the C&P margin side. It came a little bit light of market expectations. Can you talk about what you are seeing as potential bottlenecks on the U.S. completion side and if they had an impact in 3Q? Jeff Miller : I think as I described earlier specific to margins in C&P, we are making investments in other things, like production group is in that group. And so, there is more going on in that than purely North America frac. But, as it is a different question in terms of what kind of bottlenecks do we see, obviously, the Hurricane drove some bottlenecks here and across the country. I think that as mines come on, a lot of the bottlenecks you hear about around sand get alleviated. Again, when you have a bit of a differentiated view to those things given where we are and the fact our ability to buy at scale particularly with respect to sand, but then equally around people, again, we talk about people lot and our ability to hire the national level for people I think gives us a differentiated position as we view those bottlenecks. Chase Mulvehill : Okay. And the guidance for 4Q on the margin side, you said profitability will be marginally better in 4Q. Was that percentage margins or an absolute margin dollar when you said marginally better? Chris Weber : Percentage margins. Chase Mulvehill : Okay. So, the last one, on the three levers that you mentioned with pricing utilization and cost reduction, how close are we to optimizing each of these levers? Jeff Miller : A plenty of room to move on all three. Chase Mulvehill : Okay. Jeff Miller : I mean that\u2019s what we do every day; we\u2019re always working on those. Operator : Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JP Morgan. You may begin. Sean Meakim : So, Chris noted in the marginally better margins, but on the D&E specifically, trying to get a better sense of sustainability of that 3Q run rate, given pricing remains pretty challenging internationally, activities up but not dramatically. Could you give a little more context with that move in the margin to give a sense of the look forward? Jeff Miller : I mean, if the question is, are the one-offs in there, the reality there aren\u2019t any one-offs in there; that group is absolutely executing very well, and I would say systematically driving cost out of the business, they winning the contracts they need to win and they are -0 we continue to drive technology into the D&E group that I think is paying off. And I\u2019ve talked about the investment we\u2019ve made in Sperry for some time. And I think that\u2019s beginning to pay off. I think there is a lot of runway actually left to go there. But, it will come probably in fits and starts as we go into next year. Sean Meakim : Okay. Thank you for that Jeff. That\u2019s helpful. And then just on -- following up on the expansion plans for production and Summit. How do you think about strategically owning assets versus aligning Halliburton in partnerships with others where you\u2019re trying to expand your reach globally? Jeff Miller : With respect to production specifically, it will be -- we\u2019ll invest in those things that we think we can uniquely use to drive value for us; in those places where we can\u2019t, we\u2019ll look to partner. I -- very much the strategy being executed now. So, I won\u2019t get into all -- anymore details than that. But I would say, generally speaking, we\u2019re not afraid to and in fact we will seek to, in some cases partner with companies that we believe are in businesses that we don\u2019t want to be in, but maybe form part of the value chain. And I think we\u2019ve demonstrated the ability to do that very effectively. In fact with rigs, we work very closely with rig contractors and had a lot of success in our project management business, driving lower cost and better returns, probably for us and the rig contractor than we would, if we were somehow jointly investing. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. You may begin. Kurt Hallead : I was wondering if you can give us an update, generate significant amount of cash and maybe kind of run through the priorities on that cash again for us between growth, dividend, buying back stock. And when you think about the growth dynamics, where would you be directing that? It sounds like North America, but just looking for some color on that. Chris Weber : Yes. This is Chris. I\u2019ll take that. As I mentioned earlier, in terms of use of free cash flow, we are still focused on debt retirement and we have the $400 million maturity next year that we intend to pay off. We\u2019ll consider growth opportunities, both acquisitions and organic and want to be value accretive, generate industry-leading service company returns, and that\u2019s in terms of absolute level and the speed with which we realize those returns or short duration or rapid payback. And after that, we\u2019ll look at returning cash to shareholders and considering both dividends and share buybacks. Kurt Hallead : Okay, great. And maybe follow-up to one of the prior questions when you kind of talk about your three levers, trying to get back to normalized earnings. In your mind, Jeff, which one of those three would probably carry the most weight in 2018, as you see it right now? Jeff Miller : We\u2019ll have to see when 2018 gets here, Kurt. I mean, we use all of them that are available. And I am not -- and I will tell you, I put sort of equal time in all three of them. I\u2019ll just go back to sort of Chris\u2019s view -- incredible, as he mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve come a long way, two quarters and we will continue to use all of those levers as we move into next year. Chris Weber : Yes, and this is Chris. Like we said, we\u2019re on the path, fourth quarter with the seasonality and weather, holidays, customer budgets, I mean, obviously not representative of what that normal path looks like, but with the margin guidance, the revenue guidance that we provided, we think that\u2019s generally aligned with consensus estimate. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks. Jeff Miller : Okay. Thank you, Shannon. Look, I\u2019d like to wrap the call up with a couple of key takeaways today. First, the third quarter results demonstrate the strength of our franchise and the effectiveness of our strategy. I thank all of our employees for their commitment to execution. Finally, I expect Halliburton\u2019s relative performance in 2018 will remain strong as a result of our ability to grow North America revenue and margins and improve our position in our international businesses. So, I look forward to talking with you next quarter. Shannon, you may close out the call. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you, Lance, and good morning everyone. Outstanding execution resulted in an excellent fourth quarter and we are in a strong position to take care of opportunities presented by a growing North America market and improving international conditions. 2017 was a dynamic year for the oil and gas sector that marked another step on the road to recovery for our industry. I am pleased with the way our Halliburton team executed our value proposition, maintained strong service quality, generated superior results and industry leading returns. I\u2019d like to thank the outstanding employees of Halliburton for their hard work and focus the entire year and for tremendous fourth quarter. I am very excited about the way 2018 is shaping up. Commodity prices have moved up. North America unconventional activity should be very busy, international markets are starting to show signs of life and our value proposition is resonating with our customers. I will address each of these in a few minutes. But first, I want to recap the highlights for the full year and fourth quarter. During the course of 2017, we grew our market share, generated industry-leading returns and outperformed our peers across every region. We accomplished this by aligning with customers in the fastest growing market segments and collaborating in engineering solutions to maximize their asset value. Total Company revenue grew 30% and adjusted operating income tripled, finishing the year with total Company revenue of $20.6 billion and adjusted operating income of $2 billion. In North America, we told you, we would win the recovery and we did. We recognized the changing market before anyone else, moved more quickly to reactive equipment, maintained historically high market share, raised prices and captured key customers before others could, a pretty tough task to pull off and we did it. Our international business began to show signs of recovery in the latter half of the year, driven primarily by improved performance in the Middle East, the North Sea and Latin America. And finally, we generated approximately $2.5 billion in operating cash flow and retired $1.4 billion in debt. And now, a few highlights for the fourth quarter. We finished the quarter with total Company revenue of $5.9 billion and adjusted operating income of $764 million, representing a sequential increase of 9% and 21%, respectively. Our Drilling and Evaluation division delivered a strong quarter, achieving nearly 50% incrementals, reflecting improved drilling activity in multiple regions and year-end software sales. As I've said many times before, we are way more than a completions company. Our Completion and Production division revenue grew 8% sequentially, once again outperforming the change in the average U.S. land rig count. And we increased our cash position by $440 million in the fourth quarter, demonstrating our commitment to capital discipline and efficient working capital management. This quarter demonstrates the strength and diversity of our portfolio. We have the leading position in hydraulic fracturing, which is clearly important. However, the results this quarter demonstrate the value of Halliburton's position as a multidisciplinary, integrated service provider with industry leading cementing, completion tools, drilling fluids, drill bits and software product lines, and much improved positions in artificial lift, directional drilling and wireline. Geographic diversity is also a key component of our strategy and our international business proved resilient. Middle East activity was consistent throughout 2017 in areas like the North Sea and Brazil that come on strong in the second half of the year. Our geographic diversity provided stability through the cycle and rounded out this quarter's excellent results. In the fourth quarter, our Completion and Production division margins were impacted by two expected transitory headwinds in North America, seasonality and cost inflation. As we expected, year-end presented some spotty activity caused by holiday schedules, weather and exhausted customer budgets. The frac calendar remained full due to the tightness in the overall market, but it came at a higher cost due to the increased idle time and mobilization required between jobs. I would rather serve our customers and capture revenue with temporarily lower margins than I would like as opposed to losing the revenue entirely. That is what our world-class business development organization allows us to do. During the fourth quarter, we also saw cost inflation in sand and trucking. The price of sand escalated over the last few months of 2017, but I believe that increasing sand capacity, particularly from localized mines combined with our supply chain strategy will reduce the cost throughout 2018. Trucking is tight across North America and is particularly tight in areas like the Permian where activity is strong and locations are remote. We believe our increasing use of containerized sand will help mitigate trucking inflation by reducing the required trucks per well site and demurrage. Now, these headwinds were anticipated, are transitory, and are not a surprise at this point in the cycle. Now, let's talk about 2018. To remove any doubt, I am confident that we will achieve our normalized margin goals and here is why. As I've said before, we have three levers to pull in order to achieve normalized margins and they\u2019re working. All three levers are important and the great thing about Halliburton\u2019s scope and scale is that we have the ability to pull them all in a meaningful way. Halliburton is the execution company. We are going to pull these levers to get to our normalized margins. The first lever is pricing. North America completions market remains tight and we are sold out. Therefore, we continue to push pricing across our portfolio. Improving oil price and demand for equipment provides runway for us to continue to increase our pricing through the first half of the year. The second lever is utilization. Equipment utilization is very impactful for a Company of our size. We continue to place our equipment with those customers who know how to effectively and efficiently use us to increase their productivity, which improves our utilization. I can tell you that customers rapidly returned to work after the holidays and we expect improved utilization to drive margin growth. Finally, the third lever is technology that reduces cost and increases efficiency and production. We use our continuous improvement initiatives to focus on designing technology that meets market demand and reduces costs for ourselves and our customers. A great example of this is Snapshot, our digital tracking and analytic system for our hydraulic fracturing equipment. With Snapshot, we can assess what every piece of equipment is doing every moment of the day. This big data application allows us to optimize operations to reduce downtime, minimize maintenance and compare the efficiency of completion designs. We\u2019re able to compare operations across basins and countries to get optimal results from our fleets. These levers, combined with superior service quality, allowed us to triple our margins in C&P since the fourth quarter of 2016. I believe the effort, economics and enthusiasm that I see today, puts Halliburton well along the path to 20% margins in 2018. Now, let\u2019s talk about new builds for a minute. We have a set criterion, it is return driven, and we follow that criterion. That criterion was met in the fourth quarter and we delivered a handful of spreads to the market. This additional equipment along with our existing equipment maintained market share, improved our margins, and generated industry-leading returns. So, let\u2019s get some perspective. We still have less equipment in the field than we did at our peak in 2014. You know I\u2019m committed to leading returns. We build our own equipment, we manufacture faster, cheaper and with less lead time. Most importantly, this allows me to make discrete decisions, and I\u2019ll do it through the prism of achieving leading returns. You trusted me to do this in the fourth quarter, you got leading industry returns. My plan is to do this going forward. Bottom-line is, I\u2019m excited about 2018. The supply and demand dynamic is correcting and commodity prices are improving, supporting activity around the globe. Our strategy resonates with our customers. This helped us navigate the downturn and more importantly, positioned us to win a recovery domestically and abroad. I believe that the U.S. land market will be very busy in 2018 and that demand for horsepower will continue to grow. Rigs continue to get more efficient, but more importantly, completions intensity continues to grow with longer laterals and tighter spacing. As a result, I believe that the rig count to frac spread ratio has narrowed such that today, this ratio is nearly 2 to 1. Think about that for a minute. It's gone from 4 to 1 to 2 to 1 in four years. Tightening rig to spread metrics, ignore the impact of increased wear and tear on equipment, there is no doubt that today's industry horsepower is working harder than ever before and that the pace of degradation is increasing on active equipment. The impact of wear and tear on the working fleet is demonstrated by the industry's rise and average horsepower per crew. Today, the industry is forced to employ redundancy measures to mitigate non-productive time on the well site. We know this is happening because we see, customers pushing our competitors to bring spreads of 45,000 to 50,000 horsepower to a job while Halliburton remains at 36,000. As a result of drilling efficiency, completions intensity and equipment degradation, I am confident the market will remain tight in 2018. We're using local sand with a few customers in the Permian and I believe this will become an increasing trend as additional capacity is activated. Therefore, sand cost should go down in 2018 as regional sand mines come on line and capacity is increased. We have contracted with multiple suppliers to optimize our value proposition and maximize our logistics plan in areas where local sand makes sense. This will not happen overnight, but we are working with our customers and suppliers to ensure that we can provide desired profit at a reasonable cost. As for the international markets, I am encouraged for the first time in three years. Green shoots are appearing in the form of more tender activity and constructive conversations with customers. It's great to hear the change of tone in our discussions with our customers and to be able to work collaboratively with them to create solutions that overcome the challenging economics. While we expect activity to gradually improve throughout the year, an overcapitalized market, pricing pressure and concessions that have been given throughout the cycle, need to be unwind. As a result, I believe the market will improve this year, but the recovery will be choppy. Our strategy is working and winning. A recent example is our contract award with Aker BP in North Sea. This win demonstrates the power of our value proposition and the strength of the people in this organization. We listened to what the customer wanted and collaborated together to create a business model that aligned incentives between the operator and its service providers. This five-year contract for well construction services will showcase our drilling and digital technology. Under the agreement, we execute integrated operations in the three-party collaboration with the operator and the rig contractor without owning a rig or taking on reservoir risk. We take on execution risk, but as the execution company, we welcome this risk and believe this agreement is a win-win for all parties. Throughout the downturn and during the recovery, we invested in new technologies that provide value to our customers and growth opportunities in new markets. Our wireline business is a great example. We broadened our capabilities and developed industry-leading services for formation, evaluation and well intervention. We saw positive results from this investment last year with solid market share gains including some key wins in the Middle East and deepwater Gulf of Mexico. I am pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made in this product service line and we plan to continue to invest and expand this business. In wireline, we are listening to our customers and responding with technology and solutions to meet their needs and expand our business. We\u2019re doing the same thing with our recently acquired Summit ESP business. Overall, our effective, clear and sustainable strategy combined with market momentum and our dedicated employees give me confidence that Halliburton is best positioned for the year ahead. We are the execution company. We will provide superior, technology and service quality for our customers, and this will result in industry leading returns and positive cash flow for our shareholders. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chris for a financial update. Chris Weber : Thanks, Jeff. Let\u2019s start with the summary of our fourth quarter results compared sequentially to the third quarter. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.9 billion and adjusted operating income was $764 million, representing a sequential increase of 9% and 21%, respectively. These results were primarily driven by increased global drilling activity and end of year software and product sales. Moving to our division results. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue increased by 12%, operating income increased 62% and operating margins improved by 420 basis points. These increases were primarily due to year-end software sales, which were stronger than expected and increased drilling activity in the Middle East, Brazil and North America. In our Completion and Production division, fourth quarter revenue increased by 8%, operating income increased by 5% and operating margin was generally flat. Revenues were up primarily due to improved pressure pumping activity and pricing in U.S. land, completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Latin America, and increased stimulation activity in the Eastern Hemisphere. The operating margin was impacted by the seasonality and cost inflation headwinds that just Jeff described. In North America, revenue increased by 7%, primarily driven by increased utilization and pricing throughout the United States land sector in the majority of our product service lines, primarily pressure pumping as well as higher drilling activity and completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico. Latin America revenue increased by 16%, primarily driven by increased drilling activity and software sales in Brazil, as well as higher software sales in Mexico and increased stimulation activity in Argentina; these results were partially offset by reduced drilling activity in Venezuela. Turning to Europe, Africa, CIS, we saw revenue grow by 7%, primarily due to improved drilling activity in the North Sea coupled with increased activity in Algeria and Egypt. These results were partially offset by a reduction in completion tool sales in Nigeria. In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue increased by 12%. These results were primarily driven by increased drilling and stimulation activity in the Middle East and year-end sales in China. Regarding Venezuela, we continue to experience delays in collecting payments on receivables from our primary customer. These delayed payments combined with recent credit rating downgrades and deteriorating market conditions required us to record an aggregate charge of $385 million under GAAP. This charge represents a fair market value adjustment on our existing promissory note, and a full reserve against our other accounts receivables with this customer. In addition, we will no longer accrete the value of our promissory note beginning in 2018. We actively manage our strategic relationship with this customer and we will continue to vigorously pursue collections as we do business going forward. In the fourth quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $79 million, which was slightly higher than anticipated as a result of an environmental charge. For the first quarter of 2018, we anticipate that our corporate expenses will be approximately $70 million. Net interest expense for the quarter was $115 million, in line with our guidance. For the first quarter of 2018, we expect our net interest expense to be approximately $140 million as we will no longer accrete the value of our promissory note in Venezuela. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter excluding tax reform and Venezuela-related charges came in at approximately 27%. In December, the President signed a comprehensive tax reform bill. That among other things lowered the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and moved the country towards a territorial tax system. For Halliburton, this tax reform bill is a big positive. We expect it to lower our effective tax rate percentage from the high-20s to the 21% to 23% range, reflecting the new U.S. corporate rate plus state and local taxes along with our geographic earnings mix. The lower effective tax rate will positively impact our future earnings and help level the playing field with our foreign domicile competitors. During the fourth quarter, we recorded an $882 million non-cash charge, primarily as a result of a preliminary provision for the net impact of tax reform. As I mentioned, this is a non-cash charge. Given our current U.S. tax attributes, we do not expect to pay any cash tax on our deemed repatriation tax obligations. We expect our 2018 full year and first quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 23% based on our expected geographic earnings mix. Turning to cash flow. We generated approximately $440 million of cash in the quarter, improving our cash position at year-end to $2.4 billion. The increase in cash was primarily due to strong cash flows from operations, which included working capital improvements, and continued disciplined capital spending. Our 2017 CapEx came in at approximately $1.4 billion, slightly below our depreciation and amortization expense of $1.5 billion. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately in line with our depreciation and amortization expense in 2018. This CapEx guidance includes deployment of new Sperry Drilling tools and the continued investment in our artificial lift and production chemical product lines and industry-leading pressure pumping fleet. Given the current operating strength of our business and the favorable outlook just described earlier, we are actively evaluating our options around usage of cash, which could include debt retirement, funding acquisitions and organic growth projects or return of capital to shareholders. Now, turning to the first quarter. Our 10-year historical average for adjusted earnings per share from the fourth to the first quarter is a decline of 16%. Because of improving North America land operations, we believe it will be about half that in the first quarter. Let me turn it back to Jeff for a few closing comments. Jeff Miller : Thanks, Chris. Let me sump it up. I\u2019m really happy with our 2017 results. They reflect our successful strategy and execution and put Halliburton in a great position. I\u2019m excited about what I see for Halliburton in 2018. The macro is self-correcting. Commodity prices have improved. Unconventional activity is strong. The international markets are recovering. We expect to generate significant cash flow. Our value proposition is resonating with customers. And all of this together will continue to result in industry-leading returns. Now, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Jim Wicklund : Good morning, guys. Good quarter, that needs to be said. This quarter that as we said. My question instead of dealing with domestic really is about international. We all talked last year about how the rig count probably bottomed in the middle of the year but pricing was difficult. Jeff, you mentioned that it started to improve a little bit in the second half. Can you talk about how far concessions and pricing went down and what\u2019s going on with pricing internationally now? Jeff Miller : Yes. Thanks, Jim. We\u2019re in every market around the world, so we have great visibility into that. And the short answer is there still a lot of pressure. When I describe green shoots, I\u2019m talking about activity. But that activity is spread thinly. A lot of capital available in the marketplace, and because activity is spread thinly, it doesn\u2019t create the kind of tightness for a price inflection. And then, the concessions given were significant and in some ways continuing into 2018, some of those haven\u2019t even been implemented. So, look, trust me, my tone is changed and I see price inflection, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s until later 2018 and certainly we will see it in 2019. Jim Wicklund : And just continuing on that, I know you had talked last year about the hope and expectation that we would get to normalized margins in the U.S. market and you made that comment again that you expect to get there in 2018 for domestic. When do we hit normalized margins over the next couple of years in the international sector? I know that\u2019s a big crystal ball question, Jeff. But I mean, just in general, how many years do you think it will take before we reach the level that we\u2019re getting to in 2018? Jeff Miller : I think it\u2019s not this year, it\u2019s not probably 2019. It takes -- that ramp is slower, Jim, because of contractual nature of the market and it\u2019s really driven off of, first and foremost, tightness in the U.S. But, what we are seeing is I think the kind of commodity price support that will build that confidence with our customers, which will then create the tightness, which then creates the path back. And so, and I guess, my last comment on that, I think our value proposition is perfectly suited to drive back towards those normalized international margins, because we are so focused on maximizing asset value. And I think quite frankly that paradigm will continue. Jim Wicklund : Well, I'd rather see a staged recovery, first domestic and then international that last a couple of years than everything peaking at the same time. And that sure doesn't look like going to happen. Jeff, thank you very much. I appreciate it, guys. Jeff Miller : Thanks, Jim. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from James West of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. James West : Hey, good morning guys and great quarter. Jeff Miller : Good morning, James. James West : So, I want to continue on international side, because clearly North America is going to be great this year and I'll let others talk in detail about that. But, on the international recovery that you are discussing, I know we talked about some seasonality of course in 1Q, but how should -- and I know you talked about uneven, but how should we think about one kind of the timing of those green shoots starting to show up in revenue? And then, I guess, two, which markets, which geographic markets are you say more excited about? Jeff Miller : Yes, thanks. So, I think that that progression is ratable as how I would describe that. I think, we see growing confidence and added rigs sort of progressively through 2018, obviously with some inflection coming later in those stages, as I've said. But, I don't see it as a spike. It's a confidence building and we grow into that activity. But, what I\u2019m most excited about internationally would certainly be North Sea. I think that's a market that's going to have legs in 2018 and we'll see activity growing there. And we're certainly excited about how we're positioned there, clearly excited about I think Middle East broadly. Again, I think we'll continue to be resilient and will have some pockets of better activity. James West : Okay. And then, I believe over the last kind of two or so upturns, you've built out the international infrastructure for Halliburton. You have most of -- you deployed most of the capital I think that you probably need to; you\u2019ve got the market share that supports that cost structure. Although, you always want more, I get that. But, it seems to me like, and correct me if I'm wrong, but you don\u2019t really need to deploy a lot of capital. This is more of a let's just soak in the revenue when it comes and get very good incremental margins or cash on cash returns as the cycle takes off internationally, is that fair? Jeff Miller : Yes. That is fair, James. I mean, look, we're very excited about that franchise. And I've said that throughout even the downturn that investment that we made four years ago, five years ago and building out that footprint that is a valuable piece of franchise. And yes, capital is largely in place to execute on that. And that should be a very good business for us. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is now open. Angie Sedita : So, Jeff, turning back to the U.S. a little bit. When you think about the market in 2018, just industry wide, have you done any work or any thoughts on how much newbuild equipment to be coming into the market in 2018 from the industry? And how much newbuild equipment could come in where you think it would be a concern as far as tampering or dampening the outlook for pricing? Jeff Miller : Well, Angie, I think, the activity in the market -- the market to start with is undersupplied. We\u2019re well aware of what\u2019s in the marketplace today and/or that\u2019s going. And everything I see given the increasing intensity in completions, actually the drawing in of that ratio of rigs to spreads, which from 4 to 1 to 2 to 1, which really is an example of what that intensity looks like gives me a lot of confidence that it stays tight. And that metric I\u2019m talking about doesn\u2019t take into account wear and tear on equipment, which I think we\u2019ve demonstrated is quite real, certainly through the downturn as we look at equipment that never came back in the market and the way that it\u2019s working right now. Angie Sedita : And then, in 2017, it really was a big focus on your legacy equipment and where we stand today, how much of that equipment is still beneath the market as far as the spot, and thoughts on timing there? Jeff Miller : Well, I think from my perspective that has -- I said, originally that would take about four quarters and it\u2019s taken about four quarters for things to turn over. So, as we look ahead, we\u2019ve got a lot of ability to move -- because of the tightness, opportunities with pricing as we go into 2018. In fact, I\u2019m quite confident that we\u2019ll see all three of our levers executed that being price, utilization and technology. Operator : And the next question comes from Jud Bailey of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Jud Bailey : I wanted to ask for -- maybe we could get a little more color on how to think about margin progression for both C&P and D&E, both for the first quarter and just thinking about the rest of the year. I know, internationally, we\u2019ll have a pullback seasonally, but it also sounds like in the North America, you still expect to get the normalized margins. You had some seasonality, which impacted you in the fourth quarter. So just trying to think about progression for both of those businesses for the next few quarters. If you could put some color around that would be great. Chris Weber : I mean, in line with our guidance, I mean, expect Q4 to be down. You\u2019ve got the typical benefit of year-end product sales in the fourth quarter and seasonal pullback in activity in the first quarter in certain international markets. But going forward, looking at C&P very much in line with what Jeff said, normalized margin target is still there and we\u2019re working towards it. And for us to be able to do that, C&P is going to have to be a big driver of that, and so, very much committed to achieving that sometime in 2018. Jud Bailey : Okay. But I guess, it\u2019s fair to think that if you were to hit normalized margins, you\u2019d probably do it before, certainly before the fourth quarter, given the seasonality impact. So, you\u2019d hit it during the one of the high points of your typical -- your best two quarters or typically the second, third quarter. Is that a fair way to think about it though? Jeff Miller : Yes. I mean, we certainly are confident we get there. And yes, it starts with customer urgency, which we see; it starts with -- the second component of that is to be sold out, which we are. So, those two give me a lot of confidence around our ability to move on price. And to deliver, when we deliver, to deliver the 20% normalized margins. Obviously, C&P division will be performing very, very well. D&E just to follow that up, D&E is solid business for us. And I talk about our franchise. We expect to see -- D&E has made consistent progress through the downturn, both in share and margin recovery. And so, I suspect that we continue with that also for the fullness of the year. Jud Bailey : Got it. I appreciate that. And then, if I could ask -- just step back and ask you about international again. You've obviously -- you've highlighted last couple of quarters have been very strong. You're taking share as you noted. Could you maybe just give us a little more color on where do you like you've executed your international strategy the best, whether it would be product lines, regions? Maybe just give a little more comments, because your performance has been quite strong. And so, I would like to just get your thought on where you\u2019re most pleased and where you're executing and then how you see the market in 2018? Thanks. Jeff Miller : Well, look, for us it all starts with our value proposition which is to collaborating engineered solutions and maximize asset value for our customers. But, if we think about that like a platform and then we add superior assets to that, then, our team is very effective at delivering integrated solutions where it\u2019s a project management type outcome, but also discrete solutions. And so, I'm very pleased with clearly what we've done in the Middle East and what we've done in Brazil and all around the world. But, it really comes back to service quality, is fantastic and when we deliver that. All of our solutions are well-aligned with our customers. And that again takes a geographic view as well as a service line view, because we're aligned with maximizing asset value for our customers. And I think that's a key paradigm and the feature that we believe in and that's what we do. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons & Company. Your line is now open. Bill Herbert : Good morning. Chris, I assume that when we're speaking of your targeted 20% normalized margin, that's for North American C&P. And I'm just curious as to what the spread is right now between North American C&P margins and overall C&P Margins. In other words, what overall C&P margin do we have to hit over the course of 2018 for you to hit your, quote unquote, targeted normalized margins? Chris Weber : Normalized margins obviously focus on North America. C&P is the biggest driver of North America results. And so, those are going to need to be in line. Bill Herbert : Okay. So, basically, effect -- you say in line, so we would expect to hit an overall C&P margin to 20%? Chris Weber : Then they\u2019re going to need to be in line. Bill Herbert : And what do you mean by that? Chris Weber : In same ballpark. Jeff Miller : In think there are other components to that. I think we've described that as having -- it's got international activity and it has got various different things in it that comprise that. But, I think it's a good surrogate for what we see in North America. Bill Herbert : Okay. That's great, Jeff. Thanks. And then, so, I -- different point is, we\u2019ve had -- I mean, you explained it very candidly and very clearly with regard to some of the constraints in the fourth quarter in terms of margin in relation to revenue uplift in Q4 for C&P. If you're going to hit kind of a high teens or even 20% margin in 2018 for C&P, even taking into account the seasonality in Q1, then, you guys must have a pretty strong line of sight in terms of pricing realization, net pricing improvement over the course of 2018 in order for you guys to hit that margin because typically, you guys are pretty comprehensive and complete with regard to formulating your guidance. Jeff Miller : Yes. That\u2019s what we see. I think, again, I\u2019d describe it in terms of levers, so price is an important part of that, but as is some of the other things. Bill Herbert : Okay. And Jeff, you talked about the fact that you are sold out for the first half. Does your frac calendar -- is it starting to substantially populate for the second half of the year? Jeff Miller : Yes. I mean, Bill, when I say foreseeable future, it\u2019s kind of out as far as I can see. Now, it has limits in terms of where is that -- visibility perfect or not. But, yes, I\u2019m confident that we have, works in 2018 and that\u2019s why say, I am really excited about 20018. Bill Herbert : And then, finally for me, we\u2019ve got a sort of historically tight domestic labor market and an especially tight labor market in the Midland basin and other energy markets, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Texas as a whole. And the difference between the unemployment rates today versus where we were that kind of trough unemployment rates in 2008, 2014 is that we have a lot of runway for the growth and what looks to be a sustained increase call on U.S. production. How are you dealing with these labor constraints, given this tight market and what is expected to be even tighter going forward? Jeff Miller : Yes. Bill, I trust in the strength and sophistication of our HR organization. We\u2019re the biggest service company in North America and that means we operate the business. I think we operate it across the entirety of the U.S. though as you say some markets are tighter than others. But, we\u2019re able to recruit and even non-traditional -- clearly recruit in non-traditional oilfield markets as well. And these are really good jobs in the oilfield. And so, we mitigate the labor issues through the national recruiting effort. And it\u2019s important to remember that this is the same human resources machine that hired 21,000 people in 2014. So, I\u2019m confident that we find the people to do the work. Operator : And our next question comes from Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Your line is now open. Scott Gruber : Jeff, just following on the normalized margining question for C&P. How do you think about normalized margins in the D&E segment? I realize it will take a longer to get there given the international exposure, but roughly where would you peg those at in the new environment, but after all your share gain? Jeff Miller : Look, I see them in the same ballpark just over maybe a different timeframe. But certainly, I mean, those businesses are substantial; they\u2019ve got great value propositions, they have grown share, delivering terrific results as well. I think about for example, I could pick on individual technologies, but it is BaraShale Lite for example, a fantastic breakthrough and fluids technology that does two things. It actually improves efficiency and it\u2019s just a better solution. So, we\u2019ve got a number of those and those are the kind of things that as they get rolled out, move margins up, it takes share to start with though. Scott Gruber : And then, Jeff, you had positive commentary on pricing during your remarks, typically investors to take that and interpret it as positive pricing for frac. But, we're also hearing about positive traction across a lot of the minor product lines in the U.S. today. Can you put some color on the pricing trends you're seeing in cements, wireline, directional coil? You have underappreciated exposure I think to some of these product lines. So some color here would be great. And do you actually see greater pricing traction in these wirelines versus frac or is about on par today? Jeff Miller : Look, I think, you see all of that to a degree moving together. We'd always said that, those didn't fall. Other service lines didn\u2019t fall as faster as far as frac. And so, the comeback would be less dramatic and pronounced than frac. But clearly, there is a flight to quality around those other service lines as well. And we do have pricing traction in those other service lines. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from David Anderson of Barclays. Your line is now open. David Anderson : Good morning, Jeff. So, E&P capital discipline has been one of the themes we've been hearing about quite a bit. I was wondering if you could give us your take on how you think E&P behavior is changing or could change with this cycle? Kind of hearing some of the E&Ps are talking about trimming some of their rig counts but they're selling to using some lower pricing. Can you give us your sense of what your conversations are like right now as we kind of start with 2018 and kind of how you think E&P behavior could change? Jeff Miller : Yes, great question. And look, we listen to our customers. And because we listen and don't lecture, we understand the message that they get from their shareholders. And there are many different customers with many different strategies. Clearly, there is a group that's interested in generating more cash and being more disciplined. There is another group that has acreage that they absolutely want to prove up and their stakeholders want them to do that. And so, I think you can't think North America was a single brush certainly in that regard. But, what I can tell you is that those sets of customers are going to be working and busy in 2018, and I expect busier in 2018 than they were in 2017. David Anderson : And then perhaps we can go back to on the capacity side, you made a few comparisons with 2014. And perhaps maybe one comparison I\u2019m very interested in is how you think about the useful life of your frac equipment in 2014 versus today. And then, within that context with the amount of capacity that\u2019s coming on in 2018, do you have a sense as to how much do you think needs to replaced for attrition? We've heard various numbers, I was curious your take as to what do you think that attrition number is? Jeff Miller : Yes. I think I'll start with attrition. And I think attrition is a real dynamic, though it may take the form -- I used the degradation on the call this quarter, just because in many cases what happens it become too expensive to bring back. But, there is a quite a bit of cost associated I think for the industry in terms of keeping that equipment in the marketplace. So, that's a real number, but it's difficult to give you a number on that though it drove -- if you try to look at what was in the market before the downturn, what did make it back out for the downturn I think is indicative of sort of the pace of degradation or attrition that happens. But, the market today clearly is undersupplied in our view. And, I think you ask about increased intensity or more stage counts and longer later is going to drive more wear and tear on equipment, which is simply the number of reps. When I compare it to 2014, I am more confident just because we've increased or we\u2019ve deepened the amount of Q10 technology we have in the market which consistently bears up better to that kind of stress, ergo the reason we\u2019re able to execute with less horsepower on location than what we see in the market. Operator : And the next question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Waqar Syed : First for Jeff, in the past, you\u2019ve given numbers on how the frac sand intensity per well has been changing, any updates on that? Jeff Miller : No, Waqar. I mean, it\u2019s just kind of down the middle. I would describe -- that dynamic is really what I think optimization looks like. And so, we will keep an eye on that, but we haven\u2019t seen a lot of change in the last quarter. Waqar Syed : And then, at our energy conference in early January, many of E&P remarked that they were seeing broad based service price inflations in the range of 5% to 15% in the U.S. Now, would you agree with that kind of range or do you think that that number still underestimates maybe what the price inflation could be in 2018? Jeff Miller : I think that underestimates it. But, I\u2019m not going to call on where we see pricing. That\u2019s certainly competitive for us and I think it\u2019s also a function of where you are in the marketplace. Where you start, drives what that percentage is. But, nevertheless, tightness and urgency, which all of this begins with customer urgency, which clearly we see today is the support for that price. Waqar Syed : And then, just one final question. You mentioned about stimulation business picking up outside of the U.S. as well. I can see it in Argentina and maybe Saudi. Are there any other market as well, where the stimulation business is increasing internationally? Jeff Miller : Look, primary activity being as we\u2019ve always said Argentina from an unconventional perspective has the kind of rocks and the beginnings of infrastructure that make that, we\u2019re very excited about that. We\u2019ve got solid pumping businesses in a number of markets around the world that we\u2019re excited about. And I\u2019m always also excited about the ability to apply multi-staged frac to tight reservoirs and what have been sort of historically under-produced reservoirs. So, you see those in a few other countries around the world and also in some offshore markets where we create value. Operator : And the next question comes from Sean Meakim with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Sean Meakim : In the prepared comments, I don\u2019t think I caught a CapEx budget for 2018. So, maybe you could just give us a sense on what your spend is going to look like this year and maybe what kind of flex there could be in North America depending on what the market gives you? Chris Weber : Yes. So, we -- right now, we said in the call that 2018 CapEx would be in line with D&A. We think D&A is going to be around $1.6 billion in 2018. Sean Meakim : And then, just one more point of clarification. On the one key you guided, you talked about half of sequential drop you\u2019ve experienced historically just given the faster start in North America. Was that an earnings-before-taxes comment or was that EPS, just curious how tax reform impacts the sequential change there as well? Chris Weber : Yes. That\u2019s EPS. And obviously, tax reform does impact, but don\u2019t forget, we have the -- we\u2019re losing that interest accretion on the promissory note in Venezuela. So that\u2019s why we guided to the higher net interest expense in the first quarter. Those could -- it's going to be a push. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Timna Tanners with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Timna Tanners : I would follow up if I could on Chris's comments about being actively evaluating options to use cash. Just, I'm not expecting you to lay it all for us, but to the extent possible if you can give us any thoughts on timing, order of preference and where you'd like to see some of your debt metrics going forward. Thanks. Chris Weber : Yes. So, we've discussed before, we\u2019ve got that $400 million maturity coming due in August this year and we intend to retire that. After that we\u2019re going to -- everything is really looked at through the returns lens. And we'll think about where we could deploy capital with regards to growing the business, where we can generate those leading returns. And if we don't have opportunity to present themselves there, we'll look at returning it to shareholders, both considering share buyback and dividends. Jeff Miller : Timna, I'm glad to be talking about that again. Timna Tanners : This is a good point. Do you have a sense of your timing, can you just talk about is there an urgency there, are you content to wait and look at opportunities, is the M&A market particularly attractive versus organic opportunities? Chris Weber : I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s urgent, it\u2019s something -- like Jeff said, we're excited to be having that be the dialogue, further dialogue internally and thinking about when and what the right timing is. And so, we think that's a great reflection of where we are from a cycle recovery perspective. And so, you\u2019d also ask just about kind of where we'd like to see debt metrics and we talked about this before. But mid-30s debt to cap, and we want that -- our debt-to-EBITDA to be under 2.5 times. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Chase Mulvehill : Hey. Good morning, Jeff. Quick question for Chris. When we think about free cash flow conversion over the next few years, if I kind of look at 2018, it looks like your free cash flow conversion versus kind of net income, based on your CapEx guidance is going to be about 80%. As we think about going forward, is that a fair number when we think about free cash flow conversion? Chris Weber : Yes. What we said is that we expect to achieve a free cash flow conversion kind of in line or greater than peers. And so, that's what we're working towards. And that largely comes through capital discipline. Obviously if the market is ripping and we see lots of opportunities to put capital to work at great returns, we'll have to look at that. But, in a sustaining market environment, free cash flow conversion, in line or better than peers is what we're shooting for. Chase Mulvehill : Okay. Chris Weber : And we had great results in 2017 on that. We were about 120% free cash flow conversion in 2017. Chase Mulvehill : Okay, great. And then thinking about where the pressure pumping horsepower demand is today in U.S. onshore, maybe if you want to take a stab -- at that, and just kind of how undersupplied do you think the market is today? Jeff Miller : Look, I think it's undersupplied. Clearly, we've estimated 1.5 million horsepower probably somewhere like that. And what continues to keep it there is the degradation on equipment and the intensity growing around completions. And that's meaningful and that's longer laterals, that's more stages; in some cases more sand, in some cases less; but in either case, simply more activity driving the demand. And then to that point, the flight to quality that we see towards our assets, our platform and approach to work, I\u2019m very confident and excited about 2018. Chase Mulvehill : And how much share have you been able to hold through the recovery? Have you been able to kind of maintain, kind of peak of share, have you given some of that back? Jeff Miller : Look, we said all along, we reached sort of the highest share we\u2019ve ever had as we worked through the downturn. And our intent had been to settle at a higher than our historical share through the recovery, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. Operator : And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Miller for any closing remarks. Jeff Miller : Thank you, Candice. Before we close up, I\u2019d like to just reinforce a couple of key points. First, I\u2019m excited about what I see for Halliburton in 2018. The commodity prices have improved and unconventional activity is strong. And finally, we expect to generate significant cash flows and industry-leading returns. So, I look forward talking to you next quarter. Candice, you can close out the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you, Lance, and good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s get right to it this morning. In the first quarter, Halliburton experienced significant challenges in North America related to rail disruptions. One of the things I\u2019m pleased with is the way our organization executed through the sand logistics complexities in order to minimize disruptions for our customers. The company you want to own and work with is a company that can execute through these issues and any other potential headwinds. Halliburton identified the problem, addressed it and worked through it. Business conditions are back to where we thought they would be. As a result, I really like what I see shaping up and I am confident in our ability to reach normalized margins in North America this year. After taking into account the impact from rail, we wrapped up the quarter in line with what we expected. Here are our highlights for the quarter. Total company revenue of $5.7 billion represents a 34% increase compared to the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted operating income was $619 million driven by robust market conditions in North America. Once again, for the last five quarters, we have delivered the highest returns in the industry. I\u2019m very pleased with the way our North America business exited the quarter. In March, our production enhancement product service line achieved record stage count per crew, higher than at the previous peak in 2014. Our international run rate for tender activity in 2018 is on a pace to double 2017 levels. Our Completion and Production division was impacted by U.S. rail disruption during the quarter but we still achieved a strong exit to the quarter with March margins in the mid upper teens. Finally, our Drilling and Evaluation division had strong year-over-year revenue growth of 15% with operating income growing 54%. Today, all eyes are on North America as it continues to play a larger role as a global producer. Activity in the U.S. remains resilient as our customers have a large portfolio of economically viable projects in today\u2019s commodity price environment. We expect our customers to remain busy through the rest of 2018 creating significant demand for our services. The combination of steady rig count growth and completions intensity is improving demand across all of our product service lines. In addition, we believe the pressure pumping market is undersupplied today and will remain tight for the rest of 2018. Despite the incremental horsepower coming into the market, I believe this undersupply will persist as wear and tear continues to degrade existing equipment. I\u2019ve been saying this for a bunch of quarters; degradation is real. Roughly 50% of announced horsepower does not translate into new crews. I know this because we analyze the difference between horsepower additions announced and the related number of crews that are produced. This means that about half the new build equipment is being used to replace or add to crews already in the field. A key driver of this degradation is service intensity which quickly translates to shorter equipment lives and higher maintenance costs. Maintenance costs are growing and the costs are real. Today, we pump three to four times of sand volume through equipment compared to 2014. We\u2019ve moved away from gel-based frac to slick water frac increasing the abrasion on our equipment. At the same time, we increased the pumping rate compounding the wear and tear on equipment. And with increased efficiency, we\u2019ve improved utilization achieving more pumping hours per day; again, more wear and tear. In this environment, Halliburton has a clear advantage with our proprietary equipment and preventative maintenance technology that reduces our relative maintenance expense. The expansion in our operating margins over the last year demonstrates our superior ability to manage through the increased maintenance. We have generated industry-leading returns while expensing our maintenance costs in contrast to many of our competitors who capitalize their costs. The current activity level in the U.S. is continuing to create tightness across the supply chain. The three most significant areas of supply chain tightness that we see are rail, trucking and labor. I\u2019ll address how we\u2019re handling each of these next. The first quarter was a tough quarter for sand delivery. I learned more about train logistics than I ever dreamed I would; proof that getting to the future first is not always fun. We were the first to recognize the rail issue and describe it for the market. I appreciate the hard work by our sand desk to minimize the disruptions to our customers while a significant volume of our sand supply was impacted by the rail stoppages. As I stated before, this issue is temporary and is behind us. Looking forward, the U.S. rail system is experiencing high demand driven by strong economic activity. This increased overall demand is adding stress to the rail system, while at the same time our industry is attempting to move more and more sand every quarter. This stress is making the timing of deliveries less predictable. Our sophisticated sand supply desk and logistics system is working to mitigate this problem. I believe the ultimate solution is the increased use of local sand. We intend to utilize those resources to provide services for our customers as increased supply comes online in the latter half of the year. After rail, the next logistics bottleneck is trucking. The issue today is not in tractors and trailers, it\u2019s finding qualified drivers and dealing with congested infrastructure. Containerized sand is an effective tool to reduce demurrage and truck demand per well site. We continue to roll out our containerized sand solution currently deployed across about a third of our fleet to reduce cost, increase efficiency and improve our service quality. The labor market is tight. U.S. unemployment is at an all-time low and in some basins it\u2019s just above 2%. That is tight. We have the advantage of being able to recruit nationally to find qualified field personnel. However, given the level of activity today, there will likely be wage inflation and additional pricing will be necessary for cost recovery. I view these supply chain constraints as a welcome sign of a growing market and expect to execute through these challenges on our path to normalized margins in North America this year. We remain on the path to normalized margins and our March performance was a strong step in the right direction. To get to these margins, we will pull the three levers that I\u2019ve discussed several times over the last year. Price is clearly important and we push price every day; first to recover costs and then to gain net pricing. Our customers understand that we have to get both cost recovery as well as return to a price that is healthy for our business. Just as important as price is utilization which we continue to optimize as the market grows. Our scale makes us even more valuable to Halliburton. And finally playing into both pricing and utilization is technology. Technology creates value for our customers, and at the same time reduces cost for Halliburton. As the market grows, North America\u2019s role in the global supply equation is changing. This fundamental shift means that North America\u2019s shale oil has moved from swing producer to base-load supplier to meet growing global demand. Nothing is more evident of this change than our customers actively redirecting spending from international non-OPEC opportunities towards North America. This shift in CapEx allocation is largely driven by the shorter cycle return and lower risk profile North America shale provides. This change didn\u2019t happen overnight. In fact, it\u2019s been occurring over the last several years. In this paradigm, we see sustainable growth over a longer period of time rather than the boom and bust, which has characterized past cycles in North America. This sustained activity is good for Halliburton. It allows us to leverage our supply chain logistics infrastructure, capture efficiencies around repair and maintenance programs and implement technologies at scale to reduce cost and increase production. Therefore, we can optimize our systems and be more efficient with our investments. This is important because in this environment Halliburton will generate strong free cash flow. Turning to the international markets, Halliburton has never been better positioned for recovery than it is today. Halliburton is in every meaningful market competing for work, winning work and executing work with outstanding service quality. This is not something I could have said ahead of the prior cycle. I\u2019ve always said you have to be present to win and Halliburton is more than present. We are winning. In Latin America, I see improving activity offset by pricing pressures throughout the year. I am pleased with the footprint and legacy we have in Latin America and our market share today is a testament to our focus on service quality throughout the cycle. In Argentina, there are exciting improvements in unconventional resources. We successfully completed the longest lateral section ever in the Vaca Muerta formation, flawlessly pumping 42 stages, a great job by the team demonstrating their focus on our value proposition in Argentina. In addition, a record number of blocks are scheduled to be auctioned in Mexico and Brazil representing a pipeline of service activity in the coming years. We look forward to working with our customers to maximize the value of their investments. Certainly a lowlight for the quarter is the write-down of our remaining assets in Venezuela. We continue to work at a reduced level as we believe the ultimate path for resolution in Venezuela involves oil and gas. In the Middle East and Asia, we\u2019ve experienced modest increases in activity offset by pricing pressure. We\u2019ve grown our market share in this region throughout the downturn on the strength of our service quality and technology offerings. In the first quarter, we delivered the industry\u2019s first in-situ bubble point measurement using our wireline CoreVault technology. This data is important for reservoir characterization allowing our customers to better understand their gas to oil ratio before flowing the well to surface. By collaborating with customers, we continue to create technology that improves our services and maximizes their asset value. In Europe, Africa, CIS, typical seasonality created a dip in activity for the first quarter but we expect to see modest rig count growth throughout the year. I expect initial activity increases to be in the North Sea, Nigeria and Ghana. One highlight from the region is progress around digital applications. We continue to believe that our approach to digital which focuses on open architecture, solving business problems and working with partners will prove the most effective over time. I remain encouraged by the long-term prospects of the international markets. Green shoots of activity are starting to create areas of localized tightness but this additional activity is not enough to reverse the pricing pressure we are under today. The run rate for 2018 international tendering activity is on a pace to double from 2017 which leads us to believe that there will be improved activity in 2019 to help soak up resources and create and opportunity for pricing inflection. Before I conclude, I want to spend a moment talking about Sperry Drilling because I am really excited about what I see. Sperry developed and launched several exciting technologies in the last year. First is EARTHSTAR, our very deep resistivity service which provides customers greater reservoir insight to create better wells by utilizing improved mapping and real-time geosteering decisions. Next is our ICRUISE intelligent rotary steerable system that reduces drilling time and increases well placement accuracy to optimize asset value for our customers. And finally, our new upgraded fleet of drilling motors are proving effective in U.S. land. These motors are more powerful and have improved reliability maximizing drilling efficiency for our customers. I am really excited about these technologies and the enthusiasm we\u2019re seeing from our customers. We supercharged our R&D spend for this drilling technology and we made terrific progress in a short period of time. The market for these technologies and additional equipment in our development pipeline is growing. For this reason, we will spend a big part of this year\u2019s capital budget on these tools. I expect the investment to generate attractive returns in the years ahead. Overall, I am excited about the market outlook for the remainder of the year. I am confident in Halliburton\u2019s ability to grow revenue and expand margin in North America and the strength and performance of our international business as the international recovery unfolds. Our strategy is executable, it\u2019s working well and resonates with our customers. Our strategy is delivering industry-leading returns and I am confident that it will continue to do so. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chris for a financial update. Chris Weber : Thanks, Jeff. Let\u2019s start with a summary of our first quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2017. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.7 billion and adjusted operating income was $619 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 34% and over 200%, respectively. These results were primarily driven by increased activity in North America. Moving to our division results. In our Completion and Production division, revenue increased by 46% and operating income was in tripled to $500 million. These results were primarily due to improvements in United States land. Additionally, results improved due to increased well completion services in Europe, Africa, CIS and higher stimulation activity in the Middle East. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue increased by 15% while operating income increased 54%. These results were primarily driven by increased drilling activity in North America and the Eastern Hemisphere, particularly in the North Sea. These results were partially offset by activity declines across multiple product service lines in Latin America. In North America, revenue increased 58%. This improvement was led by increased activity throughout the United States land sector in the majority of Halliburton\u2019s product service lines, primarily pressure pumping, as well as higher drilling and artificial lift activity. Latin America revenue decreased by 1% due to activity declines in Venezuela and Mexico. These results were partially offset by increases in drilling and pressure pumping services in Argentina. Turning to Europe, Africa, CIS, we saw revenue improve by 19% mainly due to higher drilling activity and well completion services in the North Sea, coupled with increased activity in Russia and Azerbaijan. These results were partially offset by activity reductions in Angola. In the Middle East, Asia region, revenue increased 7%. This increase is largely the result of increased drilling and stimulation activity in the Middle East and increased drilling activity in Indonesia, offset by lower completion tool sales and project management activity in the Middle East. Regarding Venezuela, as a result of recent changes in its foreign currency exchange system and continued devaluation of the local currency, combined with U.S. sanctions and ongoing political and economic challenges, we wrote down all of our remaining investment in the country. This resulted in a $312 million, net of tax charge during the first quarter. We continue to work in Venezuela and carefully manage our go-forward exposure. In the first quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $69 million and net interest expense was $140 million in line with our previous guidance. We expect these items to continue at this run rate in the second quarter. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter, excluding Venezuela-related charges, came in at approximately 21% as a result of U.S. tax reform and our geographic earnings mix. Going forward, we expect our 2018 full year and second quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 22%. Cash flow from operations during the first quarter was $572 million with capital expenditures of $501 million ending the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $2.3 billion. For the full year 2018, we now anticipate our CapEx spend to be about $2 billion. We like what the market is showing us for 2018 and beyond and while spending slightly more than our D&A, customer demand supports this investment and we expect it to generate attractive returns. We ended the quarter with 2.3 billion in cash and expect to generate strong free cash flow in 2018. Consistent with prior years, we expect our cash balance to grow in the second half of the year. Now, turning to our thoughts on the second quarter. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect our revenue and margin to be similar to the first quarter, primarily due to continued pricing pressure in the international market offsetting activity increases. In our Completion and Production division, we expect strong revenue and margin growth driven by the strengthening North America market. Based on what we see today we believe current second quarter consensus EPS provides a good target for our performance. Let me turn it back to Jeff for a few closing comments. Jeff Miller : Thanks, Chris. Let me sum it up. First, I want to thank all of our employees for what they do to deliver our value proposition every day. It really matters and we saw it this quarter. In North America, I am pleased with the way Halliburton executed through the quarter given the challenges we faced. We managed through the supply chain issues and exited the quarter on the path to normalized margins. Looking ahead, I am excited about the way the North America market is shaping up for the remainder of the year and the role it is playing in the global supply. My view on the international market remains intact. I\u2019m encouraged by the activity outlook that should ultimately lead to price inflection in 2019. We are the execution company. We are focused on service quality, capital discipline, generating superior financial performance and delivering industry-leading shareholder returns. Now, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. James West : Good morning, guys. Jeff Miller : Good morning, James. James West : Jeff, I want to dig in a little more on the pressure pumping market. I think you gave some good color there on what you guys are seeing, and there\u2019s been some commentary suggesting different factors at play here and perhaps that\u2019s because you\u2019re sold out and demand\u2019s coming in and others are trying to put equipment to work. But I wonder if you could talk to some of the dynamics you\u2019re seeing both the supply and the demand side? How much demand is running above supply these days, how long this could stay tight and then how that\u2019s going to factor in into pricing for Halliburton in particular? Jeff Miller : Thanks, James. It is different. Our customers are asking us for equipment. We\u2019re not trying to put older equipment into the market. And because of that it makes for a totally different conversation. But I think backing up and looking at overall supply and demand, it looks like the market\u2019s undersupplied probably 1 million, 1.5 million horsepower today, and I expect that it stays that way certainly for this year and likely beyond, and a lot of that is because of the attrition that I talk about that is very real, and we look at horsepower announcements versus actual fleet adds. And all that does is it affected about half of the horsepower announced is going back into existing fleets tells me that that market stays tight. And so for that reason from our perspective anyway, we see solid pricing. We push it every day. We\u2019re not going to get into the strategy around how we do that, but certainly see cost to cover \u2013 pricing to cover inflation out there as well as pushing on the net pricing side of that as well. James West : Okay. So we should think that the net pricing gains will continue for that time period as well? Jeff Miller : Yes. James West : Okay, perfect. Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons. Your line is now open. Bill Herbert : Good morning, Jeff. With regard to international, as you went through all three different geo markets, it struck me that the continued refrain is activity going to offset \u2013 not partially offset by pricing, and yet your international top line was up 8.5% year-over-year. So do we expect international top line for the year to be up for Halliburton or does \u2013 as the year unfold, the year-over-year gain is compressed to the point where topline is flat? Jeff Miller : No, we should see some \u2013 I think we outgrow the expected spend internationally. So I see the top line is up for the full year 2018. Bill Herbert : Okay. And then with regard to \u2013 it seems that pricing remains pretty corrosive. I\u2019m just curious, is pricing continuing to go down or has it stabilized at really oppressive levels? Jeff Miller : No, I would say pricing continues to go down. I mean, we look at pricing internationally. We\u2019re excited about the volume of activity and we like to see more tenders. But I can tell you our customers know that we\u2019re at the bottom as well. And so from our perspective price is actually continuing to move down not up internationally as we start to see the large projects come through. So I expect that we see inflection in 2019, expect that we gain share as we work through the cycle and that\u2019s why we see revenues up for the full year. But clearly that is going to offset the benefit from higher activity. Bill Herbert : Okay. Chris Weber : As we do see, like we said on D&E which is largely international, flattish second quarter to first, but we would expect as we move into the second half of the year that we\u2019ll see it \u2013 start to see some improvement in our international results and thus our D&E results. Not a lot, but some incremental improvement as we get closer to that inflection point that we\u2019re seeing in 2019 that Jeff talked about. Bill Herbert : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Jeff Miller : Good morning, Sean. Sean Meakim : Good morning. So, Jeff, maybe if we could talk about where your contract position sits for frac, just thinking about your existing fleet versus leading edge pricing, how much that roll forward do you think will support incremental margins through the year even if net pricing were more on the flatter side, just to give us a sense of how much that impact could be? Jeff Miller : Thanks, Sean. Let\u2019s go back and talk about the three levers. So price is always important. So when I look at margin progression, clearly price is important. But at the same time utilization is an important lever and allows us to move on the margin front as does technology help us do the same thing, and technology in effect helps our customers generate more value but at the same time reduces our cost, and that\u2019s the important piece of that in terms of supporting our margin expansion outlook for the balance of the year. Our business development guys are in the market every single day, and because of our efficiency and technology and science, I mean that\u2019s the price support for what we do. But at the same time, those other two levers are very important. Sean Meakim : So in terms of looking through the year, fair to say that there\u2019s still some pull forward as your backlog of contracts roll into current pricing, so that\u2019s a net tailwind for you? Jeff Miller : Yes, I would say if we look back a year now and talk about the contracts that we had there, a large part of that has rolled over. And so what we look at now is improving the margins on the contracts that we have. And a lot of this does get to efficiency and this is one of the reasons why our business development team is so focused on where are the customers where we can get the best efficiency and utilization. That\u2019s a key part of how we expand margins. And so that opportunity is clearly still there. Customers remain urgent and that customer urgency is critical because even spending within cash flow, for example, urgency around effectiveness of every dollar spent matters a lot and that may not have been the case two years ago at the absolute bottom of the downturn but today that is a critical factor for our customers. And again where we spend a lot of our energy is making sure that we are able to execute that way. Sean Meakim : Got it, understood. And then just thinking about the other service lines in North America, curious how pricing progressed end of quarter when thinking about drilling services, cementing, wireline, coiled tubing? You touched on it a little bit in prepared comments but just what are your expectations for those other lines as we move through the year and the impact on C&P as well as C&E? Jeff Miller : Well, I think none of those service lines declined as much as pressure pumping did through the downturn, so they don\u2019t have as far to move up. Though that said, I do expect a growing market and as the rig count rise up I suspect we\u2019ll see more tightness around those things and the ability to move price up modestly. Sean Meakim : Okay, fair enough. Thank you. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita with UBS. Your line is now open. Jeff Miller : Angie? Angie Sedita : Good morning, guys. Sorry about that. Jeff, so I agree. There\u2019s certainly a big difference between incremental horsepower and replacement horsepower. Can you give us your thoughts on how much horsepower incrementally do you think is coming into the market? And then you touched on also a very fair point on the ability to deploy new versus older equipment and maybe talk about the pricing differential on the newer equipment versus the older equipment? Jeff Miller : Sure, Angie. We look at sort of headline horsepower in the marketplace. We think it\u2019s probably 18 million horsepower, somewhere in that range. We look at what\u2019s been announced in terms of new build and reactivations that comes to maybe 4.5 million horsepower. Of that, we expect roughly half of that is going to get plowed back into existing fleets. In Halliburton, we\u2019ve maintained our fleets at 36,000 horsepower on average which tells me that we\u2019re getting differential performance around that equipment. And so that clearly in my view with the kind of rig count that we have today and the outlook for growth this year keeps that tight. And so I think that\u2019s how we see it unfolding for the balance of the year. Now your question around horsepower age, so much of that has to do \u2013 we think about our horsepower in terms of how effective is it on location and clearly we\u2019ve got proprietary technology around our pumping and in other things we do around maintenance, et cetera. And I think because of that, we\u2019re differentially positioned in the market and of course that has an impact on where we can work, how effective we are, what kind of margins we can earn. Angie Sedita : All right, okay, fair enough. And then I don\u2019t know if you can talk about it at a high level as far as the pricing mechanism of your contracts. Is it fair to think that the majority of your contracts are re-priced at the beginning of the year or is it daggered, number one? And then midyear as pricing continues potentially to move higher, do you have an opportunity to revisit it or is it normally done once a year, twice a year? Or just at a high level, how do those contracts work? Jeff Miller : Angie, that\u2019s really maybe the way it was several years ago. But I\u2019d say today it\u2019s staggered. It\u2019s all over the place as we work through the downturn and back out of the downturn, a lot of variability in what contracts look like. So I certainly wouldn\u2019t frame it that way. Really it\u2019s a matter of execution every day and demonstrating the value so that we can have a value discussion. Angie Sedita : All right, thanks, Jeff. I\u2019ll turn it over. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Jud Bailey : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about or circle back on getting back to normalized margins this year and all the discussion around pricing. Jeff, just to be clear, do you think you could hit normalized margins this year if leading-edge frac pricing does not increase from here or we\u2019re trying to get an understanding of what can be efficiency driven, what\u2019s just simply new contracts rolling up to kind of leading edge if you could help us think through that please? Jeff Miller : Yes, the short answer is price is always important but I talk about the three levers because I believe we get there on the back of improving utilization and technology. And I\u2019ve said that for a long time. Pricing\u2019s certainly helpful but not a requirement. Jud Bailey : Okay, all right. Thanks for that. And my follow up is on the higher CapEx. Could you maybe give us a little bit of insight as to maybe where that incremental capital is going to go? You mentioned Sperry and ramping up there. How much of it maybe replacement and how do you think about the return on that incremental capital you\u2019re going to be spending this year? Chris Weber : Jud, this is Chris. Like we said, we bumped our CapEx budget. Now I think so full year will be about $2 billion, a little bit higher than we were guiding before. And I think it\u2019s important to note that we\u2019re pretty thoughtful about our capital investment decisions always looking at it through the returns lens and is it going to be value accretive, is it going to generate attractive returns. And that\u2019s what we saw with the opportunity with regards to the CapEx rate. And the majority of the increase is going into Sperry. And so we\u2019re excited about it. As Jeff talked about, this is a product line that we underinvested in for a number of years. This is a strategic priority for the organization. We\u2019re seeing great demand both for existing technology and the new technology and it\u2019s actually positioning equipment for work in 2019. And we think we\u2019ll generate attractive returns over the long term. So we\u2019re excited about the opportunity. But this CapEx raise in terms of guidance doesn\u2019t change our outlook or expectation for generating strong free cash flow this year nor our focus on capital discipline. Jud Bailey : Okay, got it. I appreciate it. I\u2019ll turn it back. Thank you. Chris Weber : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is now open. David Anderson : Thanks. Good morning. Jeff, just kind of a general question around the normalized margin target. Now you\u2019re reiterating that margin target. Can you just help us understand how you define normalized? It seems like everybody has a different view on what that means. Just curious what that means to you in terms of activity utilization and pricing? Jeff Miller : Yes, Dave, I\u2019ve defined normalized margins as 20%. That\u2019s been something we\u2019ve talked about it over some period of time and that\u2019s where I think the business settles. And if we go \u2013 we were getting to that place, we were at that place in 2014 realistically. What we had was demand go away but it wasn\u2019t necessarily an oversupplied market. What we had was a downturn where demand went away. But I fully expect that we\u2019ll work back into that range and that\u2019s just what we\u2019re doing with the levers I described. Clearly price is important but the kind of utilization that we\u2019re able to get today because of our process or technology that\u2019s always a key component of any kind of margin outperformance. David Anderson : So in other words this is sort of a steady-state level that you think you can achieve for a couple of years here at these levels based on what you mean by normalized? Jeff Miller : Yes, that\u2019s why I used the word normalized because really we\u2019d always describe that as a normal range for this business was in that range and the work that we\u2019re doing is build around having this business operate at those levels. David Anderson : And then if we think about kind of the fourth quarter, we often see some seasonal weakness here in North America. Do you think you can \u2013 so does that imply that you should be able to hit this target by third quarter if we assume sort of a downtick in fourth quarter like we usually see? Jeff Miller : Yes, I would say the behavior of the market probably looks somewhat consistent with what it does sort of every year and I\u2019ll just leave it at that. And in terms of timing, Q4 always have some spotty weather and Q1 this year had cold weather \u2013 had the rail issues that we had. So as we work through the year I suspect it\u2019s over the next couple of quarters. David Anderson : And then a separate question on the sand side. You had talked about increasing use of local sand to mitigate some of these issues that you\u2019re seeing in the first quarter here. Can you give us a sense of how you see that the magnitude of that shift you think is going to happen over the next 12 months? Just kind of curious, sand\u2019s a big portion \u2013 a crucial element of your pressure pumping operations you always want to have for your customers. So like roughly how much of that \u2013 I\u2019m just trying to get in big picture numbers, so like what percentage of your Permian is sourced from rail and where do you think that could potentially lower to in 12 months? Jeff Miller : Well, that\u2019s a moving target as we speak. So if we go back six months ago, it was zero and I suspect as we get into some time next year, there is a \u2013 for the market anyway there\u2019s a path to oversupply that market from the Permian. And that\u2019s sort of the projects that we see or at least are in process of getting built. So it\u2019s probably never a 100% but it could be a substantial portion of the sand demand in the Permian will come from buy-ins in the Permian. It\u2019s a dynamic we\u2019re starting to see in other basins as well. What it ultimately does is it serves to relieve pressure on rail and then certainly provides for more availability of Northern White to the markets that will probably continue to demand that. David Anderson : Great. Thank you, Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of James Wicklund with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. James Wicklund : Good morning, guys. Jeff Miller : Good morning, James. James Wicklund : Having worked international for 15 years, the contingency always needed the contingency both on price and time and I understand your comment that the bidding activity is up but we really won\u2019t see the impact until '19. But there\u2019s been a great deal of talk about lump sum turnkey contracts in the Middle East especially and I know that we\u2019ve done those for a while but the level or the percentage of total business appears to have picked up. Can you talk a little bit about where that is today, where that is versus a couple of years ago? Do you do it with the same people or different people? And more importantly, we\u2019re all concerned that lump sum turnkey increases the risk to a company that bids that. Not all of them are executed well. And so the concern is or the hope is that you execute well and boost those margins and maybe surprise us for the upside by the end of the year on results. But can you talk about how that plays into lump sum turnkey contacts play into your view of international? Jeff Miller : Thanks, Jim. As you say, LSTK has been around for a long time. It\u2019s gone by a lot of different names over the years; integrated solutions, IPM, as I say a number of names. I think the key again is execution risk and how well we manage that. We\u2019re not afraid of execution risk and that\u2019s really the basis for the contract is that execution risk. What I do like about them is that they aren\u2019t the kind of investments in oil and gas that take long time in commodity exposure. So from a cash return standpoint, it certainly work. I\u2019d say the key components of executing those well around project management and understanding that risk. We\u2019ve got terrific experience during this. That share for Halliburton grew dramatically through the last two or three years and we\u2019ve done it for a long time. And so the skill sets are different and it takes time to develop those and I\u2019m pleased that we have those skills today at Halliburton and compete very effectively. But I would wrap up with though is that they do get progressively more competitive over time. James Wicklund : Okay. So the same pricing pressures have to exist in those that exist from the overall market. Okay. And my follow up, if I could, you recorded record stages in the quarter which is good. You talk about the three levers that you can pull. Some people think because you have all this equipment, 100 \u2013 spreads out in the field that if they\u2019re out in the field, they\u2019re 100% utilized. Can you talk about \u2013 we can all guess what pricing might do but can you talk about the upside to utilization that exists over time in pressure pumping? Jeff Miller : Yes, thanks, Jim. That\u2019s a really meaningful lever for Halliburton. And having spreads spoken for is radically different from utilization in terms of pumping hours per day. And so we spend a lot of time and apply big data and apply algorithms and have a lot of effort put into how do we drive better utilization of our equipment every minute of every day. And there is a lot of room to run there. And that also is why I spend so much time talking about customers and where we are most effective and customers that better utilize our value proposition because that is truly a win-win. But again to go back to the idea is there\u2019s plenty of room for us to run in that regard. James Wicklund : Okay. Gentlemen, thank you very much. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Scott Gruber : Good morning. Jeff Miller : Good morning, Scott. Scott Gruber : Jeff, as we think about potential inflection in international pricing in 2019, what level of market growth do you think about that\u2019s required to drive that inflection? Is it a mid-single digit growth rate, again, so the market\u2019s efficient? Do we need to get the high-single digits, low-double digits? How do you think about what\u2019s required to drive some pricing next year? Jeff Miller : Thanks, Scott. It\u2019s probably less than overall market number though mid upper single digits is a good place to think. But it\u2019s more around specific markets where we see tightness. And part of what we see right now is a sort of thinly spread addition of sort of activity is not sufficient in any particular market to create the tightness that would allow for pricing inflection. And so I think it\u2019s better to look at particular markets as we go through this process and it is maybe the overall. Clearly there\u2019s a place where overall growth is enough to create overall tightness. But I think the early innings of this will look more like specific markets or technologies that are tight. Scott Gruber : Got it. And how do we think about what should be a normalized margin in D&E just given the shift towards more onshore work as we start this next up cycle and what appears to be more bundling, more turnkey contracts, how do we think about what normal on the D&E side of the business which is more international? And when can we get there given the contract roll schedule? Jeff Miller : Look, I\u2019m not going to call that right now. I\u2019m really excited about where we\u2019re going in that space in terms of differentiated equipment and I talked about Sperry but I\u2019d also talk about our other service lines in D&E, excited about all of those. We\u2019ve made a lot of gains over the last several years in terms of open hole and deepwater technology around drilling fluids is fantastic and growing. And so I feel like those margins will continue to expand as we see sort of tightness appear around the world internationally. Those tend to be more heavily weighted internationally just because that\u2019s where more of the drilling activity is on a relative basis in North America. The actual drilling of a well is a smaller part of the overall ticket than the completion. Scott Gruber : Got it. I appreciate it. Jeff Miller : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Waqar Syed with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Waqar Syed : Thank you. Jeff, in early February you had guided down to like $0.10 impact to the quarter from sand-related issues. In hindsight, do you still feel that the impact was $0.10 during the quarter or was it less or more? Chris Weber : Waqar, this is Chris. It was generally in line with what we thought it was going to be and we felt good with regards to the outlook that we provided and delivering on that. When you step back \u2013 we were the first to actually see this problem and get our arms around it. We\u2019re able to provide an update to the market and more importantly be able to start executing on the solution as it relates to working through the logistics constraints and minimizing disruption for our customers. And then when you think about our expectations for exiting the first quarter in a strong position and delivering on that, this all for the most part played out like we thought it was going to. Waqar Syed : So that would be somewhere around \u2013 if I estimate it, around $600 million, $700 million of revenue impact, is that fair? Chris Weber : From a revenue impact, I wouldn\u2019t want to comment. We talked about from $0.10 perspective. I think we were generally in that range. And so I think \u2013 and that\u2019s what I focus on. Jeff Miller : It\u2019s not just the days that we were slowed down but in addition to that it\u2019s the response to those things which involves spot buying of very expensive sand, trucking things that ought to be railed. It\u2019s a long \u2013 number of things that play into that response that served to impact margins. Waqar Syed : Okay. So it\u2019s more \u2013 a lot more cost issue and then some revenue impact, okay, that\u2019s fair. And that\u2019s probably my question but on the international side your revenue growth year-over-year was much better than what you\u2019ve seen for the competitors. Now you\u2019re guiding to kind of more flattish kind of international revenues in the second quarter. So was this just like an anomaly in 1Q or you think there was some market share gains underneath that? Jeff Miller : No. I think that we\u2019re well positioned to continue to grow. Q1 is always down relative to Q4. Q2, it\u2019s following the same trajectory or curve that we\u2019ve seen sort of year-upon-year-upon-year. So I don\u2019t expect to see any changes there and expect to see continued outperformance or market share performance as we move into the next cycle. What\u2019s important is how well we\u2019re positioned internationally and I think that\u2019s the change then until now. We made a lot of investment back in '12, '13 to be better positioned internationally. I love where we are competing in every market. So I expect we\u2019ll perform very well into the next cycle. Waqar Syed : And just one final question in terms of sand intensity per well, what are you seeing from your customers in the U.S.? Jeff Miller : Yes, I would say that we are continuing to see sort of that flattish kind of activity. It\u2019s not wildly up, wildly down. Again, as I\u2019ve said before, sands one of those things we clearly want to optimize over time. It\u2019s certainly a cost but at the same time as companies figure out how to best complete wells, better design completions, sand can move up for a time. And then they sort of define the limits of up and down \u2013 of high and low. They tend to find some places most effective in the middle. Waqar Syed : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Boyd with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Dan Boyd : Thanks. Jeff, you mentioned internationally there are a number of markets or pockets that are stronger than others. So is the organization right-sized for that recovery or are you still spending to reallocate resources and is there an opportunity to maybe reallocate resources to those pockets of strength? Jeff Miller : We\u2019re going to manage our cost structure pretty tightly as we go into the next cycle. Our value proposition is that we collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. Our planning is in place to execute that strategy. And if we deploy resources, they\u2019ll be more focused on executing the work but the key is to maintain the efficiencies that we develop through the downturn and make sure that\u2019s part of whatever that ramp looks like going into the second half of this year and '19. Chris Weber : And we take a global view of our equipment and tools and where they are, so we\u2019re going to allocate where we think we see the demand assuming it\u2019s cost effective to move in there. So definitely take a global perspective as it relates to our equipment allocation. Dan Boyd : Okay. And then the follow up there is just on pricing. On the last call you said that international pricing was possible later in '18 and it sounds like now you\u2019re more definitively pushing that into 2019, a lot of that sort of driven based on these pockets of strength. But what\u2019s changed that is giving you less confidence in pricing this year? Jeff Miller : Look, nothing\u2019s changed. I think it\u2019s more about when you see that in the P&L, the reality is pricing in pockets as market tightens towards the end of this year, I suspect that we see the ability to move on price. But overall we\u2019re going to still see working off of contracts that were either light last year or this year. And so when I talked about inflection, I don\u2019t suspect you actually see much of that until we get into 2019. Dan Boyd : Okay. But from a leading-edge perspective you think pricing could happen still this year? Jeff Miller : It could happen later this year. Dan Boyd : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Kurt Hallead : Thank you. Hi, good morning. Jeff Miller : Good morning, Kurt. Kurt Hallead : Jeff, just wanted to follow up on the comments you made about the challenges on the rail side and how that\u2019s opening up opportunities to source for your customers and base in, let\u2019s say, in the Permian and other places. It kind of seems like it\u2019s kind of trading one logistical challenge for another logistical challenge, rails versus trucks. As you guys are going to think through the process and prepare for that shift, do you expect the truck dynamic to be less of an intensive challenge than the rails as you move into using this local sand? Jeff Miller : Look, I think to start with, our logistics investment and our logistics team is terrific. And so we will work through whatever those challenges are as they appear. But I think some of the key building blocks are in place particularly around how we move sand on a local basis. I think the box technology gives us a lot of options around how to move sand in ways to be more effective with that. We\u2019ve got a lot of different ideas that I won\u2019t layout on this call for all the reasons you might imagine. But I\u2019m really excited about that shift and I don\u2019t think Northern White gets more focused on other parts of the country which again we\u2019ve got terrific logistics infrastructure to deal with that. And I think it actually creates just new opportunities. Will there be congestion? Yes, there probably will. But at the same time it feels \u2013 I can see a path to how we manage that that\u2019s exciting. Kurt Hallead : Great. That\u2019s good color. And maybe on a quick follow up on that, how are things progressing in context of contracts for E&Ps relating to the local sand? And I don\u2019t know about the best way, maybe you can provide us some color without getting too specific for competitive reasons, but how much adoption have you started to see and how much do you have already kind of committed to go to customers for local sand going into late '18 and '19? Jeff Miller : Look, Kurt, we\u2019re going to participate in that market. I think that our value proposition \u2013 when we view that market, things that bring the structural costs down are good for our business, all of our business including our customers, including Halliburton. And so we look at that as an opportunity to reduce the cost of this which actually allows our customers to do more work and do more of the work that I think is differential for Halliburton which is how to design and place fracs in a way that makes better well and does it more efficiently. So real excited about that. It\u2019s going to probably be more adopted as it becomes more available and clearly everything would indicate that there will be a lot of availability of that sand as we work through the balance of 2018, certainly into '19. Kurt Hallead : Got it. Thanks. And then just one more follow up just on the international front. You guys referenced pickup in activity, the prospect for better pricing into '19. So it seems to me that some of these contracts that had been I guess awarded here recently, it looks like they contrast sharply to other market periods where they were maybe two or three-year contracts and kind of were a drag on margins for an extended period of time. So am I understanding the dynamics, so you had much more shorter duration contracts in your international market and therefore you\u2019ll start to get better margins in '19 and '20, is that how things are progressing? Jeff Miller : Well, I would say it\u2019s certainly smaller and shorter as we worked into the downturn, and at least at this point in time feel somewhat shorter. Clearly we prefer that just so that we got the ability to flex around equipment as time moves on. Obviously there will be a mixed bag of contract both duration and prices. We worked through this. But I think the short answer is certainly up until this point we\u2019ve tended to see shorter duration contracts. Kurt Hallead : That\u2019s great. Thanks, Jeff. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Mr. Miller for any closing remarks. Jeff Miller : Thanks, Liz. Before we close, I\u2019d like to just highlight a couple of key takeaways. First, I\u2019m excited about the outlook for North America and our March exit margins clearly demonstrate our path to normalized margins. And secondly, I\u2019m pleased to see the recovery trajectory in the international markets demonstrated by the increase in tender activity and believe that this will lead to pricing inflection in 2019. So I look forward to speaking with you all next quarter. Liz, you may now close out the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

And unless otherwise noted, in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of the first quarter charges related to Venezuela. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our second quarter press release and can be found in the Investor Downloads section of our website. Finally, after our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period, in order to allow more time for others who may be in the queue. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you, Lance, and good morning, everyone. This was an excellent quarter. Thanks to all the Halliburton employees for their hard work and dedication to superior service quality. Activity improved in all geographic markets in the second quarter. And I\u2019m happy with how Halliburton continues to outperform our major competitors. I believe that our strategy to collaborate in engineered solutions to maximize asset value for our customers will continue to generate industry-leading returns for the remainder of 2018 and beyond. Now, before we dive into the details, here are a few highlights for the quarter. Total Company revenue was $6.1 billion, representing a 7% increase; and operating income was $789 million, a 27% increase, compared to the first quarter of 2018. Our Completion & Production division grew operating income by 34% sequentially, primarily driven by the strength of U.S. land. North America had a strong performance this quarter, once again outgrowing the rig count; and U.S. land margins are closing in on the 2014 peak. During the quarter, we launched our new Sperry ICRUISE rotary steerable in U.S. land, and it looks like a big success. We acquired Athlon Solutions, providing expertise and a manufacturing footprint to develop our reactive chemistry capabilities. And finally, we generated approximately $1 billion in operating cash flow. This is a great step towards generating solid cash flow for the year. And no doubt about it, this was an excellent quarter. We executed on our plan and delivered strong results. Our overall strategy continues to work and we plan to stay the course. We remain focused on consistent execution, generating superior financial performance, and providing industry-leading shareholder returns. As I said in the highlights, U.S. land achieved margins in the second quarter that are closing in on our peak margins from 2014. I want to talk about what that means. Despite pricing levels that had yet to fully rebound from the recent down cycle, we\u2019re achieving outstanding margins. Halliburton executes. We are resilient, adaptive and creative. We\u2019ve been able to outperform by keeping our core competencies strong and delivering superior service quality. I\u2019m very proud of our North America business. We\u2019re the leading service provider. This is the fastest growing and most dynamic energy market in the world. We have the best people, equipment and technology as well as the closest customer relationships in the North America market. We\u2019ve grown 47% year-over-year in North America, while the rig count has increased 16%, a significant outperformance. At the same time, we believe we\u2019ve achieved close to double the margin of most of our competitors. I believe the strong fundamentals and supportive commodity prices will encourage continued growth in North America. Fast-growing markets present tremendous opportunities and often temporary challenges. Halliburton is best positioned to take advantage of these opportunities and execute in the face of any challenge. Let\u2019s talk about the challenges of cost inflation, basin dynamics, and pricing, and how we\u2019re addressing it. With the expected activity in the second half of this year, we are mindful of the impact of cost inflation from trucking and increased maintenance expense. The use of trucking for sand, water and crude oil is generating intense demand for trucks and truck drivers, thus creating cost inflation. We manage trucking costs through the use of containerized sand and integrated logistics helping offset inflation. Our equipment has never worked harder than it\u2019s working today. Increased pumping time and sand loading continues to cause more wear and tear. Halliburton focuses on reliability and service quality, which requires well-maintained equipment that works as many hours as possible. We have kept our average crew size well below the market average by doing continued maintenance, and that comes with a cost. In this environment of record sand usage, we believe as a result of our predictive diagnostic tools, we are more efficient than our competitors in maintaining our fleet. Now, with respect to basin dynamics. There is much talk in the industry about off-take capacity. But during the last few weeks, I visited with customers in the Permian and they don\u2019t look like a group that\u2019s backing down. I can see it in their eyes. They feel good about where they are and how they are positioned for the long run. Don\u2019t underestimate this group. They are competitive, will figure out how to deal with constraints and will adapt. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I am not na\u00efve to the math around that off-take issue. But as we\u2019ve seen so far, our customers will not all react in the same manner. There are customers that have moved their focus from one basin to another, and we\u2019re there pursuing that work. Other customers plan to reduce activity over the short term or adding fewer rigs than expected, and we will find new work to replace them. Let me put the off-take constraint in the context of what I\u2019ve seen in the past. Tightness is an indicator of a great resource, and what is occurring in the Permian today is not new. We managed similar challenges in the Williston in the last cycle and in the DJ Basin today. The DJ suffered constraints on gas takeaway all year but our customers have managed their businesses and remained productive as have we. This work may not be as efficient as it could have been, but we\u2019ve taken action to maximize our revenue and control our cost. The constraints in this basin should begin to alleviate in early 2019 as additional off-take capacity comes on line. The same will be true in the Permian, which is best suited to handle this type of challenge, and will do so as quickly as possible. In the interim, we are going to keep equipment working, control our costs and outperform our competitors. The Marcellus is beginning to see some softening in activity as our customers hit their production targets earlier than planned. In some ways, we are a victim of our own success as we develop longer laterals with better production. As a result, we expect this area to have temporary softness in the back half of 2018, but it\u2019s poised to regain activity as the calendar turns to 2019 and additional pipeline capacity is available. We will manage through the year-end and be ready for the increased activity next year. I expect that these temporary efficiency drags will create headwinds for additional upward pricing in the third quarter. Our competitors\u2019 new and uncontracted equipment is also creating pricing pressure in some areas. We will continue our efforts to optimize pricing and utilization, pursue continued technology implementation and control cost to maintain our industry-leading returns. For example, the continued implementation of our ExpressKinect system, containerized sand, and new Sperry tools will help improve our efficiency and returns. Look, I could take some actions that would allow us to achieve our margin goals today. But I believe that would sacrifice our market position and impair our long-term value. We do not manage the business to achieve short-term expectations. We manage the business around long-term strategic goals. We will stay focused on our strategy, maintain our market share, and not sacrifice either to achieve our margin goals in the near term. We\u2019ve built market share during the downturn on our strong belief in the long-term potential of the North America market. We are returns focused Company. To deliver returns, market share and scale matter. We intent to maintain this expanded market position as our scale delivers outsized operating income, cash flow and returns. I\u2019m excited about the growth and activity we expect next year, and we are best positioned to maximize our growth and returns. We have the largest revenue base, among the highest margins in North America, the best customers, the best technology, and the best people. Why risk our position when we are working towards a stronger market in 2019? In the meantime, we plan to protect our market share, maximize our cash flow, and achieve the best margins in the industry. Shifting to technology. Part of what keeps Halliburton outperforming is our implementation of improved technology. This quarter, we introduced our ICRUISE rotary steerable technology in the U.S. land market, and our customer feedback has been extremely positive. We deployed ICRUISE in two major U.S. basins, proving its drilling speeds and complex geosteering capabilities. The wells were successfully drilled while remaining entirely in the payzone of the reservoir. We will continue to deploy this technology globally over the coming months. And I want to thank our design, manufacturing and operations teams for their hard work and dedication to this rollout. We\u2019ve been clear about our desire to grow our artificial lift and production chemicals capabilities to better position us for the future. Now, this month marks a year since we brought Summit. In that time, we\u2019d expanded our market share and started delivering this product offering into the international markets. We\u2019d experienced exceptional growth, growing at 3 times the rate of the U.S. land rig count, while executing our integration plan, we remain optimistic about the opportunities ahead. The customer feedback is positive and we are well-positioned to grow this business into a global market leader. In the second quarter, we entered the reactive chemistry space through the acquisition of Athlon Solutions. Athlon is a manufacturer of chemicals for the upstream oil and gas industry, and is a leading provider of specialty water and process treatment chemicals. This acquisition provides expertise in reactive chemistries and facilities. We expect Athlon will enhance growth and profitability in our Multi-Chem product service line and across our chemistry portfolio. This acquisition is the first step in developing our reactive chemistry capability in North America and complements our ongoing efforts to manufacture chemicals in international markets. We had a plan to grow artificial lift in production chemicals, and we\u2019re executing our plan. However, this will have a short-term impact on our C&P margins. I want to thank all of the employees that are making this happen and welcome the new Athlon employees to our team. Without our employees\u2019 hard work and dedication, these acquisitions would not be successful. I\u2019m excited about these added capabilities and look forward to their future growth and contribution. Now, turning to the international markets. I believe that the international markets will continue to steadily improve over the coming quarters. Halliburton doesn\u2019t always get the credit it should for our international business, but it is strong. And we consistently execute to manage the changing market dynamics. I\u2019m excited about where we are in the international markets. Halliburton is better positioned than ever, and we are ready to make the most of it. We\u2019re in every market. We made the investment last cycle. We have the technology. We grew the breadth and depth of our portfolio. As an example, in the last cycle, we only competed in part of the wireline market. Today, we offer technology that goes head-to-head with the competition, in every geography. We\u2019ve strengthened relationships. We\u2019re collaborating with customers to maximize their asset value. Our value proposition is resonating. We are present, and we we\u2019re winning. You must be present to win in the international business. There is no doubt, the pricing environment and the international markets has been challenging. We saw a large number of tenders in the first half of the year. These tenders were competitively bid as service companies buy for market share, and our customers sought to capture pricing at the bottom of the cycle. In many countries, large tenders set a baseline for activity for the industry, which will cover basic in-country overhead and should allow any incremental activity to be bid with healthier pricing. As we look ahead, we see emerging conditions that should enable leading-edge pricing to improve next year. Growth in geographies like the North Sea and volume increases in the Middle East should create an inflection point, at least to improve overall pricing in 2019. How much improvement and how quickly it comes, will depend in large part upon commodity prices and equipment absorption. Two great examples of our success in the international markets are recent contract wins in unconventionals in Saudi Arabia and offshore Norway. Both of these locations present technical challenges and we\u2019re meeting those channels. We\u2019re bringing our industry-leading technology to help develop unconventional plays in the Kingdom. I believe this work represents the largest unconventional completion contract ever awarded in the Middle East. This is a great opportunity to provide a customized application of Halliburton\u2019s technology, logistics management, and operational excellence to maximize asset value and deliver optimal recovery. This opportunity places Halliburton at the forefront for expansion in unconventional activity in the Middle East. In Norway, we improved our market share through collaborating in engineering solutions with our customers. The North Sea is in the midst of recovery, and additional activity is starting to reduce excess capacity. The contract wins we\u2019ve seen in this region are due to our technology development, service quality, and willingness to collaborate with our customers. This is a market where our improved wireline and Sperry technology have been most effective. Acceptance of our new technology is positive. And we plan to build on this activity to improve price and efficiency, thus improving margins. I recently returned from a trip to Latin America. This region is continuing to fight to reduced activity levels and pricing pressure. Our employees remain focused on winning work and delivering superior service quality. Our bright spot in the region is Argentina. I am pleased with the progress we\u2019re making in unconventionals in that country. Basin infrastructure is slowly improving and we have a strong customer base that is collaborating, investing and doing what is required to make the market work. Working with our customers, we see the opportunities that will help us reach the efficiencies necessary to make unconventional plays even more successful. We believe in our customers in this region and will implement our industry-leading technology to reduce cost per barrel of oil equivalent. Moving to our long-term view of the international markets. We will continue to increase our business in the industry\u2019s highest growth markets, including mature fields and unconventional resources, and optimize our Company\u2019s growth and returns. We expect an improvement in our international operations in 2019 as new contracts start up, leading-edge pricing improves, and new technologies are introduced. Looking to the third quarter, I expect our earnings will be similar to what we delivered in the second quarter due to the temporary issues facing North America. That\u2019s a great outcome. I like where we are and it will serve as an excellent bridge to a strong 2019. The temporary challenges will soon abate. And I believe global supply and demand dynamics will support continued industry growth, which I expect will accelerate in 2019. Halliburton is best positioned to outperform in the short term and to capitalize on a period of prolonged future growth for the industry. Now, I will turn the call over to Chris for a financial update. Chris Weber : Thanks, Jeff. I will start with a summary of our second quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2018. Total Company revenue for the quarter was $6.1 billion and operating income was $789 million, representing increases of 7% and 27%, respectively. These results were primarily driven by increased activity in U.S. land. Looking at our division results. In our Completion and Production division, revenue increased by 9% while operating income increased 34%, and operating margin increased by nearly 300 basis points. These results were primarily driven by increased pressure pumping and artificial lift activity in the United States land sector as well as increased pressure pumping services in Europe, Africa and CIS. These increases were partially offset by reduced completion tool sales in Europe, Africa and CIS, and reduced pressure pumping services in the Middle East. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue increased by 3% while operating income increased 2% and operating margin was roughly flat. These results were primarily due to increased drilling activity in United States land sector, as well as increased drilling services and project management activity in the Middle East and India. These increases were partially offset by reduced drilling fluid activity in the Gulf of Mexico. In North America, revenue increased by 9%. This improvement was led by increased activity throughout the United States land sector within the majority of Halliburton\u2019s product service lines, primarily pressure pumping, as well as higher drilling and artificial lift activity. Partially offsetting these increases were lower pressure pumping activity in Canada and reduced drilling fluid activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Latin America Revenue grew by 5%, resulting primarily from increases in software sales and project management activity in Mexico as well as stimulation activity in Argentina. Turning to Europe, Africa and CIS, revenue was slightly improved. These results were primarily driven by higher pressure pumping and pipeline services throughout the region, offset by lower completion tool sales, primarily in the North Sea and Angola along with reduced drilling activity in Azerbaijan. In the Middle East, Asia region, revenue increased 6%. This increase was largely the result of increased drilling services, project management activity, and completion tool sales in the Middle East as well as increased project management activity in India. In the second quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $71 million, in line with our guidance. Next quarter, we expect to see a slight increase to about $75 million, primarily due to the implementation of cost saving projects. Net interest expense was $137 million, which is in line with our previous guidance. We expect to continue around this run-rate in the third quarter. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter came in at approximately 20%, which was lower than anticipated due to discrete tax benefits. Looking ahead, we expect our third quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 20%. Turning to cash flow. We ended the quarter with a total cash position of $2.5 billion, inclusive of marketable securities. Cash from operations during the quarter was approximately $1 billion, driven by higher business activity and working capital improvement. Capital expenditures were $565 million and our full year 2018 CapEx remained unchanged. Going forward, we expect to generate strong free cash flow and still plan to retire the $400 million note that matures in August. In addition, in the second half of this year, we are targeting to both retire our $500 million 2021 debt maturity as well as initiate share repurchases under our existing authorized program. Let me turn it back to Jeff for a few closing comments. Jeff Miller : Thanks, Chris. To summarize, despite the temporary challenges affecting North America, I believe we are in the beginning of a prolonged cycle to continue to expand our revenues and improve our margins. The international markets continue to see pricing pressure, but we are seeing signs that pricing is stabilizing. We\u2019re experiencing the positive impact of incremental activity on margins. We believe that the second half of 2018 will be better for our international markets. And contract wins in key segments are providing us the foundation to expand international margins in 2019. We will generate strong free cash flow through the balance of the year and look forward to reducing debt levels and initiating buybacks. Halliburton is the best positioned for this market. Our value proposition resonates with our customers. And we will continue to maximize their asset value while providing industry-leading returns for our shareholders. Now, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from James West of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. James West : Hey. Good morning, guys. Jeff Miller : Good morning, James. James West : So, Jeff, I want to make sure I get your guidance correct here, specifically with regards to North America. So, clearly, it\u2019s temporary, but we\u2019re going to see some weakness. The Marcellus, I think, is one that\u2019s a little bit new to at least myself. We obviously understand the issues in the Permian. But, I guess, are you suggesting that revenue comes down in the second half and there\u2019s a commensurate impact on the margin profile in North America, in the second half? And then at some point, in -- obviously, in \u201819, we\u2019re going to see again a short squeeze and a pick-up in activity pretty significant. But, is that kind of the profile you\u2019re thinking about over the next several quarters? Jeff Miller : Yes, James. Look, when I talk about flat earnings that does not mean flat revenues. We see revenues up in North America and quite frankly internationally, and expect to outgrow the rig count in both. From an earnings perspective, let me say this, internationally, we face the same issues as our competitors. In North America, quite frankly, no one knows it better than we do. And I\u2019ve already mentioned a lot of those challenges in my remarks. So, the bottom line is, I think that headwinds and the tailwinds are about the same, but very positive in terms of outlook as we look at 2019. James West : Okay. Fair enough. And then, on the international side, there is a little bit of pricing starting to at least tighten as we go into 2019. Are you already having these discussions with the customer base at this point, and do you see your utilization of equipment, basically getting to that trigger point where you have to raise pricing in order to justify CapEx investments before year-end? Jeff Miller : Well, James, clearly having those discussions with clients, we are seeing the ramp up in activity internationally, and seeing some tightness in certain product lines. For example, we bumped up CapEx last quarter at Sperry and anticipate rolling out technology, and what we see is that runway. But, we\u2019re coming off of a tough bottom here. So discussions don\u2019t necessarily mean price increases, certainly not immediate. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Jud Bailey of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Jud Bailey : Jeff, I wanted to narrow that down on the North America margin kind of topic. You cited several things that\u2019ll probably impact things in the back half of the year. Pricing in some areas little bit of risk, new mix chemical is now in there, uncertainty in a couple of basins. How should we think about -- you can frame it as C&P or just North America margins, do margins flat to down in the third quarter or up? And then, how do we think about them in the back half of the year? And what are going to be the main moving pieces that will impact profitability in North America over the next couple of quarters in your mind? Jeff Miller : Well, I think, look, maybe I\u2019ll just take a minute on the second half or this quarter and look ahead. I mean this was a fantastic quarter and delivered the highest revenue, highest margins and best returns. But, I did talk about customer dislocation in the northeast to a degree as they\u2019ve met their production goals, and at least likely moderation or perception of moderation in the Permian Basin. But, I do know with certainty that 2019 is going to be humming. I mean, we\u2019re looking at demand that\u2019s already on the books. And I know this business. And so, whenever equipment moves around or we see any kind of slack in the system at all, I know the maintenance goes up, cost. And I\u2019ve told our people to take advantage of that and spend more but be ready for 2019, which realistically translates into about $0.04 incremental impact on Q3. And that additional $0.04 is already baked into the guidance that I gave you. So, I don\u2019t know, if that gives you a little more color. I mean, this is great market and great business. Jud Bailey : Okay. So, should -- I mean to just to circle back on that, do we think margins can hold firm or they deteriorate a little bit due to all -- some of these issues we\u2019re talking about in the third quarter? Jeff Miller : Look, I think in the third quarter, because of the things I\u2019ve talked about, there may be some softening, but we\u2019re going to be still at or well above kind of where the rest of market is. Jud Bailey : Okay. I appreciate that. And then, maybe if you could talk a little bit more detail perhaps about Athlon, the acquisition during the quarter, you touched on in your prepared comments. Maybe you could give us a little bit more detail on how you view that business and how it\u2019s going to impact North America business moving forward? Jeff Miller : Look, really excited about the Athlon acquisition. And it\u2019s part of a strategy that we\u2019ve had in place to grow our chemicals business. It\u2019s a small acquisition, but it\u2019s the kind of thing that I\u2019d like to do because it gives us all of the platform to grow at organically from here, and it complements some things we\u2019re doing internationally. Over time, it\u2019s going to deliver terrific returns. We are early in that cycle having just closed. But, the approach that we take on these kind of acquisitions, really works. This is an example where we buy a plant that\u2019s sort of moderately utilized. We\u2019ve got internal utilization that will actually ramp it up to a high rate of efficiency and lower our costs. So over time, that\u2019s going to be a very good acquisition and part of our strategy around chemicals. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is now open. Angie Sedita : So, Jeff, just to dig into a little bit further, the comments on the Permian and the customer behavior, some are moving forward and very active and then some you\u2019re saying are reducing activity or adding fewer than expected rigs. And then, maybe you could give a little bit more color on the mix as far as the number of customers that are starting to see some slowing of activity? And then, also your comments on the pricing pressure in some areas, just a little more color there would be great. Jeff Miller : Okay. Thanks, Angie. But look, Permian off-take has nominal impact today. But, as I described, it\u2019s not na\u00efve to the math. I mean, clearly, this is the world class resource. And the entrepreneurs in that market will get it solved, I mean never bet against them. But in the near term, I think perception has as much impact as anything. And by that, I mean weighs on customer urgency, which ultimately has an impact on our utilization and efficiency. But look, no doubt this is world class resource. As far as more color, not much more to give other than a couple of very small but leading, and I would say, nominal factors at this point with respect to off-take. Angie Sedita : Okay. So, as I think about 2019 and obviously you\u2019re positive on the outlook for 2019, but if we put in the context of pricing is flattish, I think you\u2019ve done a very good job in the past. And correct me if I am wrong that the biggest driver of your margins are efficiency gains, not pricing. So, thoughts on the ability to drive margins in 2019 and maybe potentially a flat market environment for pricing? Jeff Miller : Look, Angie, we\u2019re very confident in the levers that we have and excited about how those continued to get rolled out, and I described some of them in the call. But I think what\u2019s important is along the way as we get the \u201819 and beyond, I want to deliver the highest North American revenues and the best returns in North America. So, we\u2019re going to take whatever the market gives us and get an outsized share of that. Also along the way, we delivered terrific free cash flow. And so, I believe Halliburton is where you want to be. And I think those other levers, in fact I know those other levers well in place, moving to \u201819. Chris Weber : Yes. I mean, you look at \u201819, and Jeff talked about demand on the books starting in early next year. We would expect that to positively impact utilization and positively impact pricing. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Sean Meakim of JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Sean Meakim : So, Jeff, maybe just to clarify little further on frac. Leading edge in the Permian, can you give us a sense of where your folks in the field see pricing heading and how you think that could eventually flow through into your fleets over the next couple of quarters? Jeff Miller : Look, Sean, I\u2019ll be crazy to talk about pricing strategy on this call. I mean, this is not a place where we\u2019ll discuss that. I know that our competitors, all of our competitors, probably most of our customers are listening. But, what we\u2019re committed to do is what\u2019s best for both our customers and our shareholders. Sean Meakim : Okay. Fair enough. So, internationally, it sounds like you\u2019re going to feel some impact of the startup cost in some of these projects, similar to what you\u2019ve heard from your peers. Is that a fair characterization? And as we look towards 2019, would you say that there is going to be opportunities for increased growth capital, internationally? Jeff Miller : Yes, I think there will be in 2019. I\u2019m very, very excited about what we\u2019re seeing unfold internationally. And we\u2019ll see some of that in the second half of 2018 with respect to increase in activity. There will be some mobilization around that. But, as we look out to 2019 and really beyond, yes. I mean, I see a solid demand set coming together in front of us. And I\u2019ve been I think pretty clear on international outlook over this last cycle and believe we\u2019re right now. And as we see that grow into 2019, we\u2019ll need some capital, but it\u2019s probably, as we get into the year. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons. Your line is now open. Bill Herbert : Hey. Good morning, guys. So, I just want to discuss a little bit with regards to the timing of the proceeds, kind of recovery if that\u2019s the right word for the Permian with regard to the resolution, these takeaway capacity issues. Totally agree that these are transient, but most of the incremental capacity comes on second half of \u201819. We\u2019ve got an exceptionally tight labor market in the Permian, the whole value chain is super tight. This could actually get pushed out by a little bit. So, I\u2019m just curious, in light of the fact that this could be a multi-quarter stagnation, if you will, with regard to Permian, call it four quarters, maybe a bit more, who in the heck knows, yet we\u2019re maintaining the capital spending budget, Chris at $2 billion for this year. Walk us through that. Chris Weber : From that capital budget perspective, we planned or set, and we\u2019ve got a good view with regards to what we\u2019re putting into Sperry and what we\u2019re doing. So, it\u2019s allowed us about positioning for \u201819 but and a lot of that capital is focused towards international, not necessarily just North America. So, we feel like it\u2019s still in the right place. Jeff Miller : I guess, I\u2019ll follow that up as well, Bill. I\u2019ll go back to the ability to react very quickly, to capital requirements in North America. So, unlike our competitors, there are no orders that we placed a year ago that are being delivered today. We can move as quickly as 30 days, if required to move in 30 days. So, we continue to look for leading edge, pricing returns, and we have a really great business development organization. So, we know how to get things placed quickly and don\u2019t pull the capital lever until all of those conditions are right. Bill Herbert : Okay. So, in the event that this is a little bit slower for longer than anticipated, and the deployment of incremental horsepower slows down? Jeff Miller : Yes. Bill Herbert : Okay. Got it. And then, the second question for me is switching gears to international. At this stage, it just seems like rest of the world oil prices ex-Permian, if you will, look to be pretty constructive with regard to supply and demand fundamentals, based upon a myriad of different factors that we all know about. So, in light of the visibility improving for international, do you think at this juncture, the expectation for a double-digit increase in revenues for 2019 is realistic, and ditto for D&E, as a result of that formulation? Jeff Miller : Realistic is the short answer. I mean, all of the things that we sort of thought would unfold around supply are unfolding. And declines because of underinvestment are starting to manifest. And that sets us for a terrific sort of long-term ramp internationally. And feel like, even in the Permian, as we described that that\u2019s a moderation in growth as opposed to a pullback. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Jim Wicklund : Good morning, guys. Jeff, you have laid out the long-term -- the longer term issues very well. There is no question that that the Permian is a world class asset and will -- supposed to be 60% of global oil growth for the next three to five years. But, what this does do is it -- is sets it back a couple of quarters. Investors often care more about the short-term than the longer term and your sock is down 7% on the open on this morning. And so, the real question is, how long does it take you to get back to where we expected Q3 to be in your internal planning? And I\u2019m not going to -- I don\u2019t want to belabor earnings or anything, but you just got it down $0.10 for Q3, and that obviously means we\u2019re going to have some got down in Q4. In your planning, when do we get back on track to where Q3 was expected to be? Is this a two-quarter event, a three-quarter event, or fourth-quarter event? And while I -- I know we don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just talking about your expectation of the market today. When do we get back on track? The market\u2019s at discounting mechanism, we\u2019re now discounting different -- six months ahead. So, it\u2019s kind of like when do we get back on track? I have no question of long-term trajectory but how long does this garden leave this pause actually last? Jeff Miller : Well, Jim, I think we see -- I will go back to the perspective on what we saw the Williston recover; we\u2019ve seen the DJ Basin is in the midst of takeaway capacity, and that\u2019s being resolved. And I would bet on the sooner rather than later in terms of West Texas. But, I expect that we do in the meantime is make a lot of free cash flow between now and when that\u2019s resolved and expect that it happens -- while I say sooner rather than later, there are probably lots of things that can be done to improve that as they work through 2019, but it\u2019s certainly within the confines of 2019. Jim Wicklund : Okay, within the confines of 2019 helps a lot. And you\u2019ve had a higher debt-to-cap ratio following the paycheck to Baker, running about 50%. You talked about how you\u2019re going to pay off your $500 million and your $400 million this year, and then look at buying back stock. What\u2019s the current goal or objective on a debt-to-cap ratio or an EBITDA ratio, however you want to do it? Where do you need to get the balance sheet to go before you start getting more aggressive in stock buybacks with all the free cash flow generation? Chris Weber : So, we\u2019ve talked about target credit metrics, debt-to-EBITDA under 2.5 times and comfortable on that. Debt-to-cap, as you mentioned is still low 50s. We want that to be down in the 30. So, some work to do there. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress on debt repayment, $1.5 billion in 2017, targeting about another $1 billion in second half of this year. That\u2019s 2.5 billion in total over two years, and that\u2019s put a meaningful impact on credit metrics. But, we still have some work to do. And we\u2019ll be thoughtful about looking for opportunities to do that going forward, as we think about how to deploy excess cash. But, consistent with what we said before, we\u2019re not going to look to pay big premiums to retire debt. We will be thoughtful and efficient about how we do it, but again, balancing that with growth, things like the Athlon acquisition and return of cash to shareholders. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from David Anderson of Barclays. Your line is now open. David Anderson : You talked about having seeing some of these efficiency drags in the past, not the first you\u2019ve seen some of efficiencies creep up. I was hoping you could talk about kind of how this cycle compares to last cycle, particularly with E&P trends. So, we\u2019ve been hearing a lot of about these four-well pads being the preferred size, some of them being drilled simultaneously here in bigger pads. So, I am just curious, as the operations start to scale up, I would think this really increases your visibility into customer activity quite a bit more, particularly with DUC inventories. Can you talk about how that potentially can help you during issues like this and whether or not that can actually ultimately lift your margins going forward, this increased visibility you have? Because I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever had visibility like this in the past on your customers. Jeff Miller : No. I mean, these -- thank you, David. These are bigger capital expenditures than what you typically see in unconventionals but it also increases utilization and your better utilization throughout the day. It also allows us to better organize work. And because of the size of these, yes, there is more visibility of them sort of as the say manifest out in front of us. I also think though, it\u2019s a demonstration of just the market moving towards better returns, in general. So, it\u2019s as our customers look for ways to produce more and more quickly and try to give returns sooner in the cycle on the types of capital investments required for these larger pads. David Anderson : On the completely different subject. On your international commentary, you\u2019ve talked about competitors aggressively taking up some of these lower price tenders out there. You talked somewhat positively about pricing going forward. I got this sense in your commentary that capacity is tightened up now to the point internationally that you feel better about the pricings on contract going forward or is there something with the mix of the contracts that are coming out that suggest the pricing or margins for bidders could be better. Jeff Miller : Couple of things there. So, first, we are seeing some tightening in certain markets. And I think, it\u2019s got going to be -- sort of international is a really big place. We can\u2019t paint it with only one brush. As I described North Sea, seeing some tightness there, we\u2019ll see some tightness in markets as we move around. And as a baseline of work is tendered, the follow-on work after that quite frankly is where there is more opportunity from a pricing standpoint or bidding, tendering standpoint to do things around price. And I expect that will unfold as we work into \u201819. But the base level of business is always very competitive, and that\u2019s where a lot of efficiencies and work is done to improve those. But, so, my comment around tightness is, I think I\u2019m seeing some tightness in certain service lines, as I described billing tools, which I think will drive some tightness. But, it\u2019s more -- it will come in sort of geographies. Now, unfortunately, we\u2019re seeing this across a number of geographies in terms of an uptick. But as far as that tightness goes, that will be sort of one at a time, I expect. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Your line is now open. Scott Gruber : Jeff, I want to circle back to Bill\u2019s line of inquiry and international growth potential, double-digit potential next year, which is great to hear. What\u2019s your view on how the international cycle evolves, not just over the next 12 months, but let\u2019s look out over the next three years. What I\u2019m curious about are, are we going to see a genuine deepwater recovery, are we going to see a genuine exploration cycle? And what I mean by genuine is not just a bounce off the bottom, which given the decline we\u2019ve seen, 10% would really be just that, just the bounce off the bottom. Are we setting the stage here for multiple years of double-digit growth on international side and within deepwater? Jeff Miller : Yes. Deepwater, as I\u2019ve always said is sort of the last to come back into the frame. And I think deepwater still is push to the right as far as widespread recovery. But, the macro that we see shaping up is certainly encouraging, but the kind of deepwater, new AFE type activity I expect is going to require confidence in what is the long term outlook on the forward-look on oil, which I think is improving and is reaching a point that it\u2019s supportive. So, as we look out a couple of years, I think that\u2019s where we see inside of that three-year window, as you described it, as we see deepwater pick up, probably in a more meaningful way. And exploration, again, the exploration that we\u2019re seeing so far has been certainly more focused around sort of step outs and things that are near to existing infrastructure, generally speaking. And I think more confidence, a, in cash flows and by our clients. And again, speculating here, but I would expect that as confidence builds, so will that. Scott Gruber : Got it. And an unrelated follow-up here. What\u2019s your view on the market penetration potential of electric frac fleets? Is this a technology that can move beyond a niche application? And where do you stand on the development of a fully electric frac offering? Jeff Miller : Well, we look at everything through the lens of returns, and that hasn\u2019t changed. So, we\u2019ve certainly done some work around electric frac fleets and have tested that process and how -- and what we think about it. Not convinced today that -- well, I shouldn\u2019t say that, but we need to see that unfold and see what are the real return capabilities of that, mean the physics say, it still has to generate energy. We have to move big things around. So, I\u2019m not as convinced that we see the type of return around the cost of that, it\u2019s probably a 2X cost of getting into that electric sort of power generation versus what we\u2019re able to accomplish today. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Kurt Hallead of RBC. Your line is now open. Kurt Hallead : So, hey, Jeff, great color, commentary so far. So, something to maybe explore a little bit more on the fact that you talked about, you have demand on the books going out into 2019. It sounds like that is very much geared toward the international market. I just want to get some clarity that is it mostly international or does it also include some Permian. And in your mind is this tend to be a little bit earlier than usual and all your customers, especially on the international front getting some sense of urgency to get moving? Jeff Miller : No. That\u2019s more -- I mean, that comment is a North America comment in terms of activity that we see in 2019. Certainly, in markets where -- really across the piece, there is demand. We still have inbound demand in a market like this. So, I\u2019m describing efficiency, the challenges to utilization efficiency through the second half of the year. But, that\u2019s not to say we don\u2019t see inbound demand today. And we also see very strong demand as we go into 2019. That\u2019s the North America comment. As I talked about international, again, we see a contract set that we won today. And we also have visibility of, sort of, as I described last quarter, the doubling of tender activity. That\u2019s all going to manifest over the second half of this year. And so, I\u2019d make the same comment internationally. I mean, just like I say, this is a great outlook and a great market. Kurt Hallead : Okay. And then, you referenced the fact that U.S. land margins were approaching that peak level in 2014. I know that in prior comments target\u2019s been put out there, about 20% -- reaching 20% by the end of 2018. Given your most recent comments about some elements of slowdown or increased maintenance CapEx, do you still think it\u2019s feasible to get to the 20% margin by the end of the year? Jeff Miller : Look, what we are doing is making decisions around longer term. And it\u2019s critical that we deliver leading returns and most free cash flow that we can deliver, we\u2019re going to lead the market in doing those things. And so, the kind of decision we could have made -- getting to the target could have happened last quarter, this quarter or next quarter. But, those decisions would be shortsighted, in my view, not right for the business. So, as I said, what hasn\u2019t changed is Halliburton does have largest revenues, highest margins, best returns. And so, we\u2019re going to do those things to capture as much of 2019 as you expect and probably more. All of these things, as I\u2019ve said solve themselves as we go into 2019, and I\u2019m really excited about next year. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Waqar Syed : Good morning. My question relates to pressure pumping capacity. I think, in the past you\u2019ve said that the market may still be undersupplied by about 0.5 million hydraulic horsepower. What\u2019s your current thinking and where do you think in the second half, based on what capacity additions are coming in, what the supply demand balance looks like? Jeff Miller : Yes. Thanks, Waqar. I mean, because of the things I\u2019ve described this morning, I mean, I think the total market is temporarily balanced. And I know our equipment is sold out and we could sell more. And that\u2019s because of there\u2019s a lot of demand for what Halliburton does from a service quality standpoint, reliability, efficiency and technology. And the demand or the pressure, the work rolled on the equipment hasn\u2019t changed, and that\u2019s the -- so, it means that the attrition story hasn\u2019t changed either. And we still see probably half of the incremental horsepower that comes into the market being ploughed back into existing fleets, and that\u2019s reason I spend so much time and we spend so much time managing fleet size. And we have fleet sizes that are well below the industry average and that\u2019s how we -- one of the ways that we deliver leading returns. Waqar Syed : Okay. And just a follow-up on that. We had about decoupling pumping services from fracs and supply. Are you seeing the same trends and how would that impact margins for you guys and then are you going to change any strategy as a result of that changing trend? Jeff Miller : I mean, with respect sand, the de-bundling, that\u2019s a mixed bag. Ultimately, customers hire Halliburton to pump sand downhole, that\u2019s what we get paid for. And we make money off a range of business models today and will continue to make margins off of making better wells. So, I don\u2019t see a change in our strategy there. But, obviously, we look at everything through a returns lens and whatever that best returning model is, is how we view that. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Miller for any closing remarks. Jeff Miller : Thank you, Candice. Before we close, I would like to wrap up with a few key points. First, I believe we are in the beginning of a prolonged upcycle in both North America and the international markets, and Halliburton is best positioned to grow and expand margins. Second, we expect to generate strong free cash flow and plan to reduce our outstanding debt levels, and are targeting to initiate share repurchases. Finally, our value proposition resonates with our customers and delivers industry-leading returns to our shareholders. So, I\u2019ll look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Candice, please close out the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. And you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only-mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator instructions] As a reminder this conference call may be recorded. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference now over to Lance Loeffler. You may begin. Lance Loeffler : Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton Third Quarter 2018 Conference Call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton\u2019s website for seven days. Joining me this morning are Jeff Miller, President and CEO and Chris Weber, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton\u2019s views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton\u2019s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, recent current reports on Form 8-K, and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period, in order to allow more time for others who may be in the queue. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you, Lance, and good morning, everyone. As it played out, it was a challenging quarter for the services industry in North America. We didn\u2019t see the typical growth we expect in pressure pumping activity in the third quarter. This negatively impacted pricing and the efficient use of our equipment as customers responded to budget limitations and off-take capacity bottlenecks. As said, I am pleased with our overall financial results for the third quarter. Our team optimized our performance in North America in the face of short term market challenges and the recovery of our international operations continue. Let me cover some of the key headlines. Total company revenue was $6.2 billion essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, while operating income was $716 million a 9% decrease compared to the second quarter of 2018, largely due to the softening North American market. We converted nearly a 110% of operating income into operating cash flow, generating approximately $780 million during the third quarter with over $2.3 billion generated on a year-to-date basis. We continue to deliver the highest returns in the industry this quarter. Now I\u2019m pleased with our international business, which is showing signs of a steady recovery. Our international revenue increased 5% quarter-over-quarter with growth in every international region. As expected, North America revenue declined as a result of market softness, but we believe we still have the highest margins. Relative to the overall market, I am pleased with our performance, while our completions related activity remained relatively flat sequentially; we believe we outperformed the market based on available market data. This demonstrates the customer\u2019s flight to quality and positions us well as the market dynamics improve. And finally, we continue our long term focus on delivering shareholder returns. During the third quarter, we returned over $350 million to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. Despite the near term temporary challenges, which I will address in a minute the macro outlook for the oil and gas industry is the strongest it has been in four years. The combination of economic growth, affordable fuel prices and demand for petro chemicals sets the stage for continued positive trends. The focal point of the discussion during this current recovery has mostly been the supply side of the equation. The fact is we have more clarity today regarding the sources of supply and their limitation. Temporary issues affecting North America production, the spare capacity limitations in the Middle East and Russia and significant under investment in non-OPEC, non-U.S. supply are reflected in today\u2019s strong commodity prices. Simply put, current commodity prices incentivize our global customer base to start unlocking more of their assets, and that\u2019s a good thing for Halliburton. We see it in the increased number of final investment decisions announced by our customers and the projected rig count growth. Now turning to near term operations, in North America the market for completion services softened during the third quarter, impacting service company activity and pricing and Halliburton was not an exception. The combination off-take capacity constraints and our customers exhausting their budgets led to less demand for completion services than expected. Halliburton\u2019s response was to retain our customers who demonstrate the best efficiency to manage cost, to move equipment to more active operators, to retain our people, to perform additional maintenance and to continue investing in technology. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, current feedback from our customers indicates that budget exhaustion and seasonal issues will predictably impact activity. We think operators will take extended breaks. Some even starting before thanksgiving. Therefore we expect customer activity levels to decrease in the last six weeks of the year. We will do what a rational business would do in this situation. We will work to keep our equipment utilized in the short term when it makes business sense to do so, and we will take steps to position ourselves for a better 2019. You know me and you know our management team. We understand the North America market better than anyone. We were the first to call out these challenges as we came out of the second quarter. I believe that these headwinds are temporary, and I\u2019ll draw on the arsenal of measures available to me to manage through this brief dislocation in the North America market. Moving on from the fourth quarter, I\u2019m excited about 2019. The catalysts are there for a strong activity rebound. These catalysts are, customer budget should reload with higher-priced decks and stronger hedge positions improving operator\u2019s free cash flow and creating additional spending power. The rising DUC count will provide a substantial completions backlog ready to be worked down in 2019. Off-take capacity will expand. Our industry is adaptive and creative. This manifests itself yet again and the announced conversion of pipelines in the Permian basin and new processing capacity in the Marcellus. We believe that the market will get better in the first quarter of 2019 and sets up for continued momentum throughout the year. We believe that the fourth quarter of 2018 will be the bottom in North America land. I believe this, because I see it. I\u2019m already seeing demand from our customers for 2019. They\u2019re eager to get back to work. I hear it. I\u2019m hearing this from our business development organization who are busy responding to inbound 2019 demand. I feel it. I\u2019m feeling customer urgency come back as operators want reassurance. Our crews will be back out working for them when budgets reset and they restart their full completions programs. Increased activity leads to higher pricing. Once the catalysts I just described materialize, customer urgency will increase and that will help improve pricing. The quality of our technology and services allows us to play at the higher end of the price range, meaning we\u2019re the first to benefit from price recovery. There are obviously a number of moving parts in North America and the slope of the ramp up in activity will be different in every basin. I continue to believe that all the temporary challenges we face are signs of a great resource, a resource that shifted the world supply and demand dynamics in the last five years. Our customers are resilient and creative. They are addressing these challenges head-on with the grit and determination we\u2019ve come to expect from North America operators. So let me walk you around the various basins in the U.S. In the Northeast, our customers have already met their 2018 production targets. They slowed down activity and they\u2019re now expanding their processing facilities. Natural gas prices have recently surpassed $3 per MCF and are forecasted to stay there throughout the winter. Pipelines are coming online and starting to move gas out of the Northeast and into more premium priced markets that will lower differentials and improve economics, allowing our customers in the Northeast to do more with their budgets next year. Similarly in the DJ basin, operators are waiting for additional pipeline capacity, primarily the DCP pipeline to help with differentials, while our DJ customers have significantly slowed down completions activity at the moment we believe that new pipelines arriving in 2019 will spur them into action again. The story of the ongoing effort to increase Permian off-take capacity has been well covered. Our customers there have responded differently to take away constraints, some still have firm take away capacity, and we continue completing wells for them. Others have options in other basins and have shifted focus elsewhere, and then there are those who don\u2019t have take away capacity and don\u2019t have options in other basins and they are deferring completions. In the Eagle Ford, we\u2019re seeing operators who been highly efficient throughout the year, cutting back activity as a result of deflated budgets. In the Midcon and Rockies, operators are staying within their cash flow obligations for the year, however, our customers in all these basins are preparing to start 2019 afresh on a higher note. Halliburton works in every unconventional basin in the U.S. and were the best positioned to understand the market dynamics and take advantage of the expected activity improvement in 2019, wherever it may come first. In the meantime, we are watching the same external data points that you do. Commodity pricing will remain an important factor; with WTI around $70 the appetite to grow production will be much higher. The DUC count in North America is the highest it\u2019s ever been, if our customer start working DUC down as early as mid-January, Halliburton will be a great beneficiary. Our customers are entering budgeting season. Their 2019 spending plans will greatly depend on where commodity prices are at the end of the year, what hedges are available for purchase, and when their current hedges roll-off, the combination of positive outcomes for all of the above would bode well for substantial increases in 2019 budgets. We know how to manage your business and will keep adjusting our cost structure to market conditions, but it does not make sense for us to dramatically reduce costs or infrastructure for what we see is a temporary slowdown in activity levels. We are using this time to improve the health of our fleet, to position our North America land business for future success and outperformance as the market improves. Internationally, I believe the markets are in the early stages of recovery. Modest improvement in activity continues, but competitive pressures remain. Nevertheless, I\u2019m pleased with where our international business is today and think that Halliburton has a strong foundation for international growth in this cycle. We collaborate with our customers to improve their project economics and our profitability through advanced technology and increased operating efficiency. This international recovery as I see it has two distinct attributes; first, it starts with mature fields. In today\u2019s environment, customers broadly favor shorter cycle returns and lower risk projects. That manifests itself in the form of development focused, production oriented strategies, both onshore and offshore. The active markets in the North Sea in the Middle East attested that. Second, this recovery will see national oil companies take the lead; many of them have government mandates to grow production and work hard to revitalize your mature asset base, develop unconventional resources for internal consumption and search for partners to fund offshore exploration. I believe both of these attributes play in Halliburton\u2019s favor. We\u2019re traditionally strong in completion and production technologies that are key to mature fields development. National oil companies look for a collaborative approach to tackling their various challenges, and collaboration is in our DNA. We go to work every day to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. Our international business is a more valuable asset to Halliburton shareholders today than it was even three years ago. We\u2019ve had an international presence since 1926 and we currently operate in over 80 countries. During the last cycle, we made significant investments in our international footprint, including increasing our product service line footprint in various geographies, expanding our manufacturing capacity in Singapore and opening technology centers in Saudi Arabia, India and Brazil. The recovery in international markets is underway and we have the right footprint and the right technology portfolio to take advantage of it. We believe, we\u2019ve demonstrated this by outgrowing our largest competitor internationally for six of the last eight quarters. Importantly, we are in the returns business, not the market share of business. We plan to balance both, to outgrow and make returns in the international market. The outlook for global commodity supply and demand is constructed. I\u2019m confident that Halliburton has the right strategy, technology and services to compete and deliver leading returns in this market. We remain the leader in North America, which I believe is poised for a better 2019. Halliburton is also positioned better than it\u2019s ever been for the international recovery. So now let me turn the call over to Chris to provide a few more details on our financial results. Then I\u2019ll return to discuss how we are strategically positioned to differentiate ourselves in the market and deliver returns for our shareholders. Chris? Chris Weber : Thanks Jeff. I\u2019m going to start with a summary of our third quarter results compared to the second quarter of 2018. Total Company revenue for the quarter was $6.2 billion which was relatively flat. Total operating income for the quarter was $716 million, representing a 9% sequential decline. Moving to our division results. In our completion and production division, revenue was relatively flat, while operating income decreased 8%. Revenue was flat, primarily due to lower pricing in our U.S. pressure pumping business, offset by increased incompletion tool sales and well intervention services in the Eastern Hemisphere. Operating income was down primarily due to the lower pricing and higher maintenance expense in our U.S. pressure pumping business. As previously discussed, the higher maintenance expense was expected as we performed incremental maintenance in anticipation of 2019 activity. In our drilling and evaluation division, revenue was also relatively flat while operating income decreased 5%. These results were primarily due to drilling fluids activity declines in North America partially offset by increased drilling related services in Latin America. In North America, revenue decreased by 2%, primarily driven by lower pricing and stimulation services in the United States land sector and reduced drilling fluids activity in North America, partially offset by increased activity in our production chemicals and artificial lift product service lines in the United States land sector. Latin America revenue grew by 9% resulting primarily from increased demand for stimulation services in Mexico and drilling related services throughout the region, particularly in Argentina Brazil and Ecuador. These increases were partially offset by decrease software sales in Mexico. Turning to Europe, Africa, CIS revenue increased 4% primarily driven by higher pipeline services across the region, coupled with increased completion tool sales in the North Sea. In the Middle East Asia region, revenue increased 4% largely resulting from increased completion tool sales and well intervention services throughout the region, partially offset by lower pricing and stimulation services in the Middle East. In the third quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $78 million up $7 million compared to the second quarter, primarily due to the implementation of cost savings projects. For the fourth quarter, we expect our corporate and other expense to be approximately $75 million. Net interest expense for the quarter was $140 million and we expect it to remain approximately the same in the fourth quarter. We reported $42 million of other expense for the quarter, up from $19 million in the second quarter. The increase is primarily due to foreign exchange losses that were driven by the strong U.S. dollar and the devaluation of certain emerging market currencies some of which we have limited ability to hedge. For the fourth quarter, we think $40 million is a good estimate for other expense. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter came in at approximately 19%, which was lower than anticipated due to discrete tax benefits. Looking ahead, we expect our fourth quarter effective tax rate to range between 20% and 21%. Turning to cash flow, we ended the quarter with a total cash balance of $2.1 billion. We generated approximately $780 million of cash from operations during this quarter. Capital expenditures during the quarter were approximately $410 million, and our full-year 2018 CapEx guidance remains unchanged at approximately $2 billion. Before I turn to the fourth quarter guidance, I want to take a minute to discuss capital allocation, which we view like everything else at Halliburton through our returns focused wind. We had three uses for our excess cash. Return of cash to shareholders, debt retirement and growth. Regarding return of cash to shareholders, we pay a solid dividend and we initiated share repurchases during the quarter buying back $200 million in shares. Going forward, we will continue to consider share repurchases when we have excess cash. Regarding debt retirement, this quarter, we repaid our $400 million note that matured in August. With this payment complete, we have now paid that $2 billion in debt over the last two years, which is a great accomplishment. We have previously discussed repaying our $500 million 2021 maturity; however, we have decided not to do that this year. As we evaluate current potential opportunities, including share repurchases, we believe that there are more attractive opportunities for using this cash. Regarding growth, we will continue to pursue value accretive growth opportunities, be it both on M&A or stepped out organic growth. Investing in the business increases the value of our company and Halliburton has a great track record of making smart investment decisions that generate industry leading returns, and we plan to continue to do so. Now, turning to the guidance for the fourth quarter. As is typical, a combination of weather, holidays, budget constraints and year-end sales make forecasting a challenge, but this is how we currently see it playing out. In our C&P division, we expect the results to be down in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the North America land market, where we expect the activity level of our pressure pumping customers to decrease by a low double-digit percentage in the fourth quarter. This will mean lower utilization for our equipment, less efficient operations and continued pricing pressure. Also, as Jeff mentioned earlier, we will continue performing incremental maintenance in the fourth quarter to prepare for a busy 2019. In our D&E division, we expect our results to improve slightly primarily due to typical year-end sales. As a result, we expect earnings per share in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.40. And with that, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thanks Chris. As I see it, this cycle is shaping up to be a marathon, not a sprint. The key to successfully running a marathon as I can tell you from personal experience is being physically and mentally prepared for the long run. Now I\u2019d like to highlight what Halliburton is doing today to be ready for this sustained cycle. I talked to you a lot about technology. Let me remind you why it\u2019s important. We expand our technology portfolio to gain scale, grow market share, create competitive advantage and win both internationally and in North America. We are deliberately investing in technologies and capabilities that we believe will do three things; drive growth, create meaningful differentiation and deliver returns. In our drilling and evaluation division, we recently launched the new iCruise Rotary Steerable System. It\u2019s the most intelligent drilling tool in the market. It combines smart technology with advanced electronics, sophisticated algorithms, multiple sensors and high-speed processors with some of the highest mechanical specifications on the market. Tools already been deployed for customers and three U.S. unconventional basins as well as internationally. We are excited about the iCruise System, not only because it delivers fast drilling, accurate well placement and reliable repeatable performance for our customers, but also because the simple, modular design of this tool and its self diagnostics capabilities mean that it\u2019s maintenance takes a lot less time, which increases asset velocity, reduces repair and maintenance costs and improves returns for Halliburton. Our EarthStar, ultra-deep resistivity service, another innovation from the Sperry Drilling product line played a large part in helping us win several important contracts in the North Sea. This new logging haul drilling center delivers the unique ability to map reservoir and fluid boundaries more than 200 feet from the well board, over twice the depth of current industry offerings. It gives operators a much clearer view of the reservoir helping to precisely geosteer [ph] their wells and to achieve higher production, lowering cost per BOE. Adoption of this new well placement technology is occurring not only in the North Sea and other offshore markets, but even in North American unconventional. We plan to build on this momentum to grow our business in these markets to drive differentiation and deliver returns for Halliburton. As I\u2019ve said, Halliburton makes technology investments to deliver growth, differentiation and returns. So what does this look like in our completions business? Halliburton is the market leader in completions and hydraulic fracturing and we continue to innovate. Our technology and operations teams are constantly working on new opportunities for advancement, for creating meaningful differentiation from our competitors and for saving cost for us and our customers. For the last several years, we\u2019ve made significant investments in our surface efficiency strategy. We\u2019ve introduced technologies, like ExpressKinect, Wellhead Connection unit, ExpressSand system and IntelliScan equipment monitoring software. They have helped us achieve a 50% reduction in rig up, rig down time cut cycle time between stages in half and reduced our maintenance cost per horsepower hour. These investments drive returns for Halliburton. They allow us to charge a premium for our equipment. They improve our asset velocity and they have reduced the required capital on the well site. While the industry has been focused on implementing surface efficiencies to squeeze costs out of the system, I believe that the next step forward in efficiency will come from higher wealth productivity achieved through better subsurface understanding. In our quest to provide the lowest cost per barrel of oil equivalent, refocusing on increasing the number of barrels for our customers through subsurface insight. To this end, in addition to service efficiency, we\u2019re investing in the technology to help our customers improve well productivity. This is our intelligent frac strategy. I\u2019m pleased to see the growing customer interest and willingness to pay a premium for better well placement and better fracturing efficiency, which leads to more barrels and lower cost. During the third quarter, we launched our Prodigi AB intelligent fracturing service, and by the end of 2018 it will be deployed in every unconventional basin in the U.S. If the inaugural element of our Intelligent frac strategy and the first commercial solution on the Prodigi platform. When we hydraulically fracture a well, we force fluid and sand into the rock thousands of feet below the surface. Prodigi AB Service utilizes algorithms to fine-tune the pump rate based on reservoir response without human intervention. It allows for real-time adjustments to treating pressure during initial pumping conditions which leads to consistently higher breakdown efficiency and improves proppant placement. Prodigi AB has been deployed on over 500 stages across multiple customers and basins. In a recent trial, Prodigi AB demonstrated our ability to achieve consistent breakdown across the entire stage which leads to better well productivity for our customers. Additionally, Prodigi AB lowers treating pressure by nearly 10% and cuts pumping times by 10 to 15 minutes per stage. This means reduced wear and tear on our equipment and lower maintenance costs. Well productivity is not only dependent on job execution, but it's also greatly affected by job design. Our Prodigi AB assist with consistent job execution, the newest addition to the Halliburton Intelligent frac portfolio, GOHFER, Fracture Modeling Software ensures that we have the right designs to execute. We\u2019ve recently acquired this industry-leading fracture simulator which is used globally for conventional and unconventional well completion designs, analysis and optimization. This acquisition enhances our frac business and I'm excited to welcome GOHFER into the Halliburton family. And as I said earlier, this will be a mature fields led recovery. Halliburton is investing in our portfolio of production capabilities that will allow us to grow share, differentiation and returns in this market. Our production group grew revenues 36% year-over-yea as we\u2019ve made significant strides expanding our position in artificial lift and production chemicals, all key capabilities in the mature fields domain. It's been over a year since we bought Summit. In that time, we\u2019ve expanded our market share in the U.S. and started delivering this product offering into the international markets. We've experienced exceptional growth. And I can tell you there are still significant growth opportunities ahead. We\u2019re bringing the full power of the Halliburton global footprint to bear and taking our ESP offering to the Middle East and Latin America. The customer feedback is positive and we intend to grow this business into a global market leader. As you may remember, in the second quarter we entered into the reactive chemistry space through the acquisition of Athlon Solutions. We expect Athlon will enhance growth and profitability in our Multi-Chem product service line and across our chemistry portfolio. This acquisition is the first step in developing our reactive chemistry capability in North America and complements our ongoing efforts to manufacture chemicals in the international markets. I'm excited about these additional capabilities and look forward to their future growth and contribution. Athlon and Summit are two great examples of how we use targeted M&A to enhance our portfolio and drive returns. Halliburton maximizes returns our technology investment by being the most effective in the market at lowering our customers cost per BOE. This is what gives us significant market share in North America and internationally, and this is why Halliburton is well-positioned to compete win and deliver industry-leading returns in both of these markets. In summary, we know the North American market and will manage through the temporary challenges. The catalysts for 2019 rebound are clear and Halliburton is best positioned to take advantage of what we expect to be a sustained up-cycle  We believe that the international markets are in the early stages of recovery. Despite competitive pressures Halliburton is well-positioned internationally to win and make returns. And finally, we are a returns-focused company. Everything my team and I do is aimed at continuously delivering industry-leading returns. Now, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of James West of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. James West : Hey, good morning guys. Jeff Miller : Good morning, James. James West : Jeff, I was wondering if you could expand a bit on your \u2013 on the catalysts you see for 2019, being a much better year for the industry both North America and International. I mean, we agree with that, but I\u2019m curious as \u2013 since you\u2019re closer, obviously, to your customers than perhaps we are. Could you maybe talk through some of those major key catalysts that you see driving significant growth next year? Jeff Miller : Yes. Thanks, James. Yes. The outlook or the catalysts are clearer than probably they\u2019ve ever been which is a bit of a rarity in our business, but as we now look at the budget resets we know that has to happen, we know that will happen, our customers have done a good job of working sort of within their budget this year. But as we look at 2019 and a higher commodity price that really sets up well for adding to budgets in the next year. And at the same time if we look at DUCs, DUCs are at historical high. Those are the kind of things that get worked off. We get back to the higher global oil price, that has an impact on hedging as hedges roll off, new hedges get put on. So again, all of these are things that we can see and certainly leaves me to a view that Q1 is better than Q4, and that momentum would then build on the back of all of those catalysts. As far as the timing of those catalysts, look like they happen next year. I\u2019m not going to try to call it timing, but confidence it they happen. The -- internationally, similarly the underspend that\u2019s happened for the last three years pretty extraordinary, and I think that just the requirement to reinvest in a lot of these places is driving what I see as the recovery. James West : Got you. And maybe just to follow up on international side, Jeff, it seems to me like the portfolio strategy that was put in place by you and your largest competitor, perhaps starting year, year and a half ago to make sure you\u2019re setup in the right market for the right contracts. It should be mostly over at this point and it should be time to get going on pricing. Is that a fair statement? Chris Weber : Well, it stays fairly competitive internationally. And so I can point to anecdotes where we are able to get pricing, but the bigger projects remain very competitive. When I look at those kind of projects certainly the \u2013 we have a bias for returns. But I think we\u2019ve demonstrated, we can grow in that market, not growing that market, but at the same time I think the competitive pressure is probably more than we think. Those contracts will get worked off, will get work through and optimized, but I do think that will take a little bit of time. James West : Okay. Got it. Thanks Jeff. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Your line is now open. Scott Gruber : Yes. Good morning. So, Jeff, I just want to clarify the earnings bottom comment, is that just a comment on North America or is that a global comment? Basically, I\u2019m curious if North American recovery in 1Q can more than offset the seasonal weakness abroad that we think we\u2019ll se in 1Q? Chris Weber : Yes. Well, it\u2019s a \u2013 that\u2019s not a global comment. We look at North America; I'm pretty excited about what we see. The Q4 looks like a bottom. The recovery -- rather than call it the timing and pace of it, we\u2019ve talked about the catalysts that happened next year. When I think about the technology that we\u2019re investing in around surface efficiency and maybe more importantly subsurface efficiency, I think all of those things frame up where I\u2019m pretty excited about 2019. Internationally, there\u2019ll still be some seasonality that we always see in international, Q1 to Q2 to Q3 which has sort of a fairly predictable cycle. So internationally excited about the recovery, it continues. But it's a little bit different than the North America that we think about. Scott Gruber : Got it. And then just -- an unrelated follow-up on the new Rotary system, the iCruise system, do you think that system closes the technology gap with Schlumberger and Baker? Jeff Miller : Yes. Look, I'm super excited about this technology. I mean it's doing what I thought it would do. Its performance is terrific and it\u2019s equally important its performance is terrific in my view, at a lower cost and that makes returns for us both of those do. And so, I think as I said in my comments its in three markets; North America, we\u2019ve got it international today. It\u2019s doing what I thought it was capable of doing. And really we\u2019re -- like everything it\u2019s a journey and so there\u2019ll be more to come. Scott Gruber : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean Meakim of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Sean Meakim : Thanks. Hey, good morning. Jeff Miller : Good morning, Sean. Sean Meakim : So it seems to me the key for investors here is going to be getting confidence that 4Q is in fact the bottom and I think many folks will remember the challenges the industry had to start last \u2013 this most recent year. So how do you characterize the interplay between C&P volumes and pricing in 3Q? And we had topline flat margin off 140 bps. And just what\u2019s the read-through to 2019 to give you confidence that frac pricing gets back on track? Chris Weber : I\u2019ll take that sort of a third quarter piece. I mean when you look at within our C&P division specific to the North America land, really pricing is the biggest driver activity roughly flat quarter-on-quarter. There\u2019s really, you know when we think about activity coming down is really in relation to the expectation what we would typically see in the third quarter, but on a sequential walk, roughly flat, so really pricing story in the third quarter. Moving into the fourth quarter, it\u2019s going to be more activity, as we see pullback from our customers, budget exhaustion and your seasonality taking effect. Jeff Miller : Yes. So, when we look ahead I\u2019ve described the catalyst. I\u2019ve been less prescriptive on the timing of those catalysts but they start to happen in 2019. And I think that \u2013 I\u2019ve talked to customers. They\u2019re eager to get to work. Obviously there\u2019s seasonality that happens in the fourth quarter and into Q1, but we get on the road to a better market as those things that do happen, happen. So for example, by that I mean budgets they do reset, companies get back to work. And I think generally there's bias to do more next year not less particularly with where the price is. So without being as prescriptive those things start to happen in 2019. Sean Meakim : Okay. Fair enough. Chris, maybe could we get little bit more granularity on the decision-making around the debt repayment, maybe kind of stepping back from that as opposed to some other choices for allocating cash as we go into 2019. Just curious kind of how you should set investor expectation towards the long-term goals on dept-to-cap versus the other priorities that you are obviously also focused on? Chris Weber : We\u2019re focused on a strong balance sheet. I mean this doesn\u2019t change our perspective on our target debt metrics. We\u2019ve talked debt-to-EBITDA being underneath two and half times which definitely, line of sight on that, debt-to-cap being in the mid 30s. And that will take time to work towards. Maybe we have a strong balance sheet today. I think it continues to get stronger over time. But when we look at just opportunities for using that cash right now and we take into account the progress that we've made repaying debt $2 billion over the last two years, 400 million of that in the third quarter. And again in relation to opportunities that we see now including share repurchases we just feel like there's better uses for that cash right now. Sean Meakim : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert of Simmons. Your line is now open. Bill Herbert : Good morning. Jeff, can you discuss with regard to Q1, which basins do you think will be strongest earliest and which ones will lag relative to Q4, in terms of activity? Jeff Miller : Yes. Bill, all behave differently I suppose. I would say, probably Eagle Ford response probably more quickly with budget resets. I think probably we\u2019d expect some response in the Northern Region as we -- or say Northern Region, DJ, Eagle Ford, -- DJ and sort of Bakken as things reset up there. But the -- it will happen in as it happens. Certainly the weather can be in that mix, but I actually -- getting back to work broadly I think is certainly the most impactful piece of that and customers really want to. I think that budget discipline, our capital discipline that we saw this year to a degree, the reaction in Q2 is sort of had a carry on effect and so I feel like as things reset there\u2019ll be lot more appetite to do more. Bill. Bill Herbert : Okay. So, I just want to -- I\u2019m trying to get at, with regard to your discussions that you're having with customers who are Permian focused, even -- I\u2019m trying to understand, are they also telling you that Q1 given the budget reload, strong commodity prices, better hedging opportunities, they\u2019re going to be off to the races too? Or do you expect them to lag a little bit waiting for incremental pipeline capacity as that unfolds over the course of 2019? Jeff Miller : Yes. The trouble, Bill, every customer is different and each has their own strategy and response to what out there. So I\u2019m careful when I make blanket statements. So, if you just step back and look at the kind of consolidation that\u2019s happen in that market, that certainly doesn't happen to do less, the kind of activity that we see out there. So the timing and pace, so I think will be an individual decision by different customers, but clearly they\u2019ll be a reloading that goes into next year. Bill Herbert : Okay. That's fair. And then Chris with regard your guidance, I\u2019m sorry, I think, I understood C&P down double digits for reasons you expressed. I think I heard you say D&E up in the fourth quarter. Would margins for D&E would be flat to up in Q4 or how would you expect that to unfold? Chris Weber : I think we\u2019ll see slight improvement in both revenue and margins in D&E. Like I said, largely driven by year-end product sales or I should say software sales from Landmark which should be difficult. Bill Herbert : Okay. Which is the last one -- which leads into that last one from me. So that implies kind of the C&P margin, I think at the low-end of about 12.5%. Would you expect that to be the trough margin for C&P? Chris Weber : Right now, Jeff, talked about the North America land reaching a bottom in the fourth quarter. Don't want call bottom on anything else at this point, but we do think from an activity perspective North America land in the fourth quarter feels like a bottom. Bill Herbert : Okay. Jeff Miller : I mean the cyclicality will occur internationally, Bill, there are other things in there that \u2013 there\u2019s Latin America, there is North Sea. We do quite a bit of C&P work in a lot of different markets. So, just don't want to call that right now. Bill Herbert : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jud Bailey of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Jud Bailey : Thanks. Good morning. Jeff, question for you as we sit back and kind of look at the industry, one question I think lot of people are asking is, as we go to year end there\u2019s a lot of excess frac capacity sitting on the fence, efficiency gained across the industry have been very solid. As things start to improve in 2019 how do we think about the industry regaining in pricing leverage and frac? Do you believe if we will get any -- I\u2019d appreciate any comments on how you think about pricing leverage kind of swinging back on any kind of activity increase in 2019? Jeff Miller : Yes. Thanks. I mean there's a couple of things. It starts with customer urgency. And what we're seeing with budgets right now is sort of the opposite of customer urgency. When we see that creep back in around higher commodity prices more activity to do, I expect we'll see opportunities for pricing leverage swing back to service providers. We saw that early this year. We saw a quite a bit at the year before. I don\u2019t expect it to be different. I think the equipment today, I\u2019ve said it many times, it is working harder than it\u2019s ever worked and that means equipment is wearing out at a pace that it's not as abundant as one might think. I think the second piece though that over time is \u2013 and I don\u2019t want to talk about technology of over time being around the subsurface, which I spent time talking about Prodigi which is beginning piece of that and also go for this quarter, but many other things we\u2019re doing around modeling that really ask how do we make more barrels or how do customers make more barrels per well and I think that's going to be very important over time. Jud Bailey : Okay. All right and thank you. And my follow-up is in the past you\u2019ve referenced the ability to get to 20% margins. Do you feel like with the way the industry is kind of situated today, and not putting a timeframe on it, but is that still an expectation or a goal for Halliburton over the intermediate term? I guess, is that achievable in your mind given the technology initiatives, efficiency initiatives and kind of how you see pricing playing out? Jeff Miller : Yes. Thanks. When I step back and look at it, right now, we're on and I think the best business in the big service market today. And under the right conditions can we get there? Yes. I believe we can. But that doesn't change what we're doing today in terms of addressing the market, making the best returns in the market and truly investing in this market for the long-term. Jud Bailey : Okay. Thanks. I\u2019ll turn it back. Jeff Miller : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Jim Wicklund : Good morning, guys. What we really like is the exact day and the hours if you can provide it, of the inflection when things are going to start getting better? And whether it would be a weekday or weekend? Jud questions were most critical I think because investors aren\u2019t sure where margins bottom or will be when activity starts to recover or at least pricing starts to recover? And you already noted that the pricing is being more impactful right now than utilization, and you talked a little bit about efficiency. One thing we're hearing is that you guys and your peers are getting so efficient in terms of fracking that maybe we don't need as many frac spreads out there as we did before. And we\u2019ve seen this happen with drilling rigs as they went through a significant period of efficiency. Is the same thing going to happen to pressure pumping over the next couple of years guys? Jeff Miller : Well, I don't think so. I mean I think there's a lot of demand for what we do, and I think the equipment gets worked harder and it will -- the technology of better pumps and those kind of things will prevail over time from an efficiency standpoint, but I think the bigger piece of efficiency that I was talking about earlier is around productivity and the investment and that I think will drive a lot more demand for what we\u2019re doing. I mean, the core of the core is only \u2013 is a finite resource. So I think as we look out what we\u2019re doing around our intelligent frac strategy and what customers will have to do in order to be successful, will continue to consume more, not less, I guess, for lack of a better word. Jim Wicklund : How much more and you talk some about your technologies that you\u2019re developing, and all that\u2019s exceptionally impressive, for an old simulation engineer anyway. How much more efficiency, however you want to manage -- describe it, how much more efficiency can we wring out and hydraulically fracturing unconventional wells. Where can we go if we've taken Permian wells from 257 IPs to 2000, where does this all in? Where do we get to the point where we\u2019re so much steady state and how efficient are we at that point? Jeff Miller : Well, I think the efficiency lever is progressively harder to pull in terms of amount of time. I mean, literally more sand, bigger stages, takes longer to pump. I mean, you start to reach, generally, limits around what faster looks like. And there's a lot of debate at the minutia level around A versus B but realistically, overall, how much more does that move? When I think about making better wells over time, I think that will be more and more significant, just because the complexity of how this gets done will increase. And, typically, it involves working equipment harder, even if not necessarily faster, which I think keeps us all very busy over a much longer period of time, over the long-term. And so for that, I mean, I just continue to see the demand certainly for what we do and I think that technology component will become progressively more important. Jim Wicklund : And my follow-up, if I could. We listened to one company the other day talk about the benefits of being vertically integrated in sand. You\u2019re noticeably not. Can you tell us what the benefit of not being vertically integrated in sand is? Jeff Miller : Well, yes, I look at everything through a returns lens. And back up. When we allocate capital and we think about what we do, I look first at what do we do that\u2019s unique? What can we do that is unique and drive differentiation? And with respect to sand, we do more around moving it and pumping it and that\u2019s really our uniqueness. So you see us spend our capital on either equipment or technology around that equipment that don't add much technically to a grain of sand. And we\u2019ve got great partners that we work with and I think we have always found that there's plenty of sand in the marketplace and the best thing to do is make the best returns. And I don\u2019t see that for us with sand. Jim Wicklund : Okay. Thanks guys and good guide down for Q4. Reset the bar. Good job. Thank you. Jeff Miller : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Anderson of Barclays. Your line is now open. David Anderson : Hey, good morning, Jeff. I just want to talk a little international here for a change of pace. You had some really nice growth you showed here sequentially. I was just wondering if you could talk about which parts of your international business you think have the most potential for 2019. And do you think a double-digit international revenue growth for the full year is achievable? Jeff Miller : Yes. Look, I\u2019m real excited about our drilling activity. I talked about technology but what we\u2019re doing with Sperry and how that has an impact on all of our business, I think that's important. I think I\u2019m also excited about C&P internationally. We\u2019ve got a pretty big book of that out to go do and I think there\u2019s a lot of demand in markets to address, either unconventional or tight formations, in an effort to make more production. But I also think, if we look out at 2019, it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag in the sense that there are going to be markets like Asia Pacific and Europe, Africa, Eurasia that, in my view, recover more so, pretty strongly, on a percentage basis, just given where they started. But there are other parts of the market, Middle East, that have been fairly resilient throughout the downturn. And so that, while fantastic business and market, may mute to a degree that absolute amount of growth. But to be seen, if I look at next year, we're looking on the plan now. But are we high single digits? Are we double digits? That feels like about the range. David Anderson : Then you had mentioned spare capacity issues internationally. You just referred to your C&P side, your drilling side. Is that where you see the tightness? Are you suggesting that there\u2019s an improving pricing outlook out there? Can you just kind of touch on that a little bit for a few minutes? Jeff Miller : Yes. I think the drilling equipment is probably the tightest thing in the marketplace today. And as it gets -- as we work into 2019; that will drive, I suspect, a better view of pricing, better pricing. Again, on anecdotally, we have discussions every day with customers. But at the same time, big projects continue to be competitive. So that\u2019s why that\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag. I think we've got the ability to optimize those things as we work through 2019 and I suspect it's a better year, certainly, than last year as it recovers.. David Anderson : And then just last thing. On the offshore side, do you think offshore contributes much to next year's number or is that more of a 2020 event, based on your conversations with your IOC customers? Jeff Miller : Yes. I mean, IOC -- well, let's back up. Take offshore as far as deep water versus shelf, then deep water, it'll be -- I think it plays a role. It certainly does. North Sea, we've talked about North Sea and as that sort of gains momentum into next year. But generally speaking, it's going be mature fields. So if I slice it by mature fields versus offshore or onshore, it feels, certainly, like that\u2019s a better part of the business. And, again, from Halliburton\u2019s standpoint, it lines up perfectly well with what we do, in terms of completions and I talked about what we\u2019re doing around wireline and case fill wireline and some of those kind of things. So I think it shapes up really well for us. David Anderson : Thanks, Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead of RBC. Your line is now open. Kurt Hallead : Hey and good morning. Thanks for fitting me in here. So, I just want to follow on the recent line of questioning here in the context of international growing high single digit, low double digit, without really kind of holding to you until you get your budgets done. Do you think North America, on a year-on-year basis, will outpace international? Jeff Miller : Well, they are such different size and sort of pace, it\u2019s hard to say. I mean, I think the international will grow for different reasons, partly being more NOC-led, and that\u2019s really around mandates by governments to produce more. North America is such a dynamic sort of capital market driven growth that if we see -- where we see oil price shape up I think North America has the ability to move faster than we\u2019ve seen that in the past. And I try to describe the catalyst that are out there that would allow that to happen, so I think that let\u2019s get through the planning but from a growth standpoint, it feels stronger in North America but to be seen. Kurt Hallead : Thanks, Jeff. And from a maintenance standpoint is this the intensity, the maintenance do you think been greater, is it going to be greater during this kind of pause than what\u2019s it\u2019s been over the last couple of years and do you think that could ultimately do additional industry wide fleet attrition? Jeff Miller : Well I would think for Halliburton and I think we\u2019ll do more maintenance as we go through the Q4 as I described just to be ready for 2019. I think broadly, the size of stages, pressure and rate all conspire to work the equipment harder than it\u2019s ever worked. And so I think we put a lot of effort into managing maintenance how we manage maintenance, the technology of maintenance. We got a tech group that looks at maintenance and so I think all of those things are important to our performance in North America more specifically around doing maintenance, we know it\u2019s important and plan to do it as we get through Q4. Kurt Hallead : Right. And then if maybe finish up. What\u2019s your take, Jeff on electric frac fleets in the potential adoption by the market place? Jeff Miller : Look, I\u2019m going to say it\u2019s too early to call only \u2013 we\u2019re looking at all types of technology all of the time, but what underpins all of that is returns and uptake and sustainability. And so that\u2019s again I think it\u2019s earlier to call out one, but we are certainly looking at it among other things. Kurt Hallead : All right. Always appreciate the color. Thank you. Jeff Miller : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that is all the time we have for questions. I would like to hand the call over to Jeff Miller for any closing remarks. Jeff Miller : Yes, thanks Nicole. Look before we close out the call, just like to make a couple of final points. First, I believe Q4 represents the bottom of the temporary North America dislocation. We can see the NAM recovery catalyst and expect Halliburton to benefit as they manifest. Second, I\u2019m excited about the early stage international recovery and believe Halliburton is better positioned than ever for success. And then finally, our strategy and focus on capital allocation positions Halliburton to continue delivering industry leading returns. So I look forward to talking with you next quarter and Nicole, please close out the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. That does conclude today\u2019s program. You all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you, Abu, and good morning, everyone. Happy New Year. When we rang in 2019, we started a celebration of Halliburton's 100 Year Anniversary, reaching our centennial as a milestone few companies achieved and it's a testament to the hard work of our employees, who deliver on our core values of integrity, safety, creativity and reliability. From the humble beginnings of our founder, Erle P. Halliburton, our company has innovated, collaborated and executed through economic and industry cycles to become a global leader in oilfield services and technology. We look forward to our next century and continuing to deliver superior service to our customers and industry-leading returns to our shareholders. Now, I would like to give you some highlights for the full year and the fourth quarter of 2018. In this past year, we maintained our market share, generated industry-leading returns and outgrew our primary competitor. We accomplished this by effectively competing in key markets, by collaborating with our customers to engineer solutions that maximize their asset value and by continuing to make investments in strategic growth areas. Total company revenue grew 16% compared to 2017, and adjusted operating income increased 35%, finishing 2018 with total company revenue of just under $24 billion and adjusted operating income of $2.7 billion. In our Completion and Production division, we capitalized on the market recovery in North America, delivering total year revenue growth of 22% and operating income growth of 40% year-over-year. Our Drilling and Evaluation division delivered 6% revenue and 3% operating income improvement year-over-year, reflecting the beginning of a recovery in the international markets. We generated approximately $3.1 billion in operating cash flow and retired over $400 million in debt. Finally, we continued our focus on returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, which totaled over $1 billion in 2018. And now, a few points about the fourth quarter. We finished the quarter with total company revenue of $5.9 billion and operating income of $608 million, representing a sequential decrease of 4% and 15% respectively. Our Completion and Production division revenue declined 8% sequentially and operating income was down 19%, driven by lower activity in pricing for stimulation services in North America. Our Drilling and Evaluation division delivered a strong quarter, growing revenue 5% and operating income 2% sequentially. While our business in North America declined this quarter as the completions market softened, internationally, we delivered 7% revenue growth, which underscores the versatility and global reach of our business portfolio. The trajectory of this cycle has been far from smooth. The end of last year saw a large swing in commodity prices with both Brent and WTI retrenching over 40%, the levels not seen since June of 2017. The oil price has been gradually climbing since then and that's a welcome development. But increased price volatility creates near-term headwinds as we enter 2019. I'm convinced however, that the supply and demand fundamentals for multi-year industry growth are still intact. While short-term oil and gas demand changes are hard to call with precision, we know that the need for energy is consistently growing, and the oil and gas industry in general and the oil services in particular are instrumental to satisfying that need. As for supply, I believe that a maturing OPEC plus asset base, years of significant underinvestment in non-OPEC, non-U.S. production and natural decline curves in U.S. Shale will ensure demand for our services for years to come. Today, our industry is going through a transformation brought on by the Shale Revolution and the recent down-cycle. Because of that transformation, we're entering 2019 with a very different landscape, one that I think plays to Halliburton's strengths. First, North America is now the world's top oil producer and exerts considerable influence on commodity pricing. Second, the industry has cut a lot of cost out of the system and introduced significant efficiencies. And last, but certainly not least, 2018 was a year of transition to a more disciplined free cash flow approach by many customers in the North American E&P industry. As you know, many of our customers have shifted their strategy from production growth to operating within cash flow and generating returns. I believe this is good for the long-term prospects of our industry. This should make the industry investment cycle more rational and the commodity price volatility more range bound. Halliburton is well prepared for this market environment in order to deliver leading returns for our shareholders. As we have proven over the years and demonstrated in 2018, our technology, our people, our customer alignment and our financial discipline position us well to thrive in any market condition. In 2016, I led the implementation of structural cost initiatives that cut more than a $1 billion in cost out of our business. These included eliminating a layer of management, rationalizing our real estate infrastructure and streamlining our manufacturing footprint among other things. We remain vigilant, not to let these costs creep back in. Since then, we've also eliminated additional cost through our continuous improvement initiatives such as implementing product design changes to increase throughput and reduce cost in our manufactured products. We will continue to drive cost and capital efficiency throughout our company. Another strategic element that positions us for success today is our consistent focus on returns. I believe Halliburton's success is driven by a coherent asset base, meaning, assets that fit together and can earn appropriate returns. Greater asset velocity and superior job-site execution, all geared to deliver superior returns. This is exactly what we have done and what we plan to continue doing. For example, maintaining our own frac equipment manufacturing center allows us flexibility and lowers our total cost of equipment ownership. We do not invest in assets that burden our balance sheet to limit our capital flexibility without providing any significant differentiation, and they don't generate significant returns. That's why I am so excited about Halliburton, our strategy and our future performance. Turning to near-term operations in North America, as we expected the market for completion services experienced an activity decline during the fourth quarter as our customers responded the budget exhaustion and off-take capacity bottlenecks. This created excess equipment capacity in the market and had a detrimental effect on services pricing. Looking ahead to 2019 in North America, the drop in oil prices at the end of last year has impacted our customers' budgets for the year. As I talk to customers I hear three distinct approaches : First, the majors, They largely stay the course on their budget plan, and as many of them recently shifted their investment priorities from offshore and deepwater to shore recycle North America shale plays that is good news for Halliburton. Second, large independence, most of them already budgeted for $50 oil last year, so their spending should be mostly flat in 2019. And finally, small E&Ps who have limited access to capital, they're likely to cut budgets most aggressively if the commodity pricing doesn't improve, but they are also the most flexible on budget expansion if the market is supported later in the year. As our customer budgets reload in the first quarter, they are going back to work. And as a result, we expect modest improvement in completion activity levels. We anticipate, however, that the pressure on service pricing will continue in the first quarter. As the year unfolds, the catalysts for a broad completions activity rebound in North America are the following : first, a supportive commodity price environment; second, the DUC count in North America today is the highest it's ever been, although inventory wells exacerbated the short-term activity declines for completions in the last two quarters, they're essentially a future revenue opportunity. And finally, takeaway capacity constraints in the Permian Basin are expected to alleviate in the second half of the year that means many customers should go back to work during the second quarter to get production ready for the new pipelines. As the catalysts I just described materialize, they will have a direct impact on increasing customer urgency. This in turn should drive higher pricing in the second half of the year. As we traditionally play at the higher end of the price range based on our service quality, technological advantage and presence in all U.S. basins. I expect Halliburton to be the first benefit from price recovery. No matter of what as we have in the past, Halliburton will make more than anyone else out of every dollar spent in North America. Halliburton has also proven over the years that it's able to adjust as the market environment changes. We do not expect to rely on rising service pricing alone to earn returns. We intend to invest effectively and remain flexible in our cost structure, specifically we intend to reduce our 2019 capital spend compared to 2018. We are also prepared to stack equipment if it does not meet our returns' thresholds. We intend to dynamically respond to the changing market, maintain the right level of capital spending to support our business and continue to deliver strong cash flow and leading returns. Internationally, the recovery continues at a modest pace, this quarter we grew revenue from international operations 7%. On a full-year basis, our international business delivered top line growth for the first time since 2014, which confirms that the downturn inactivity is now behind us. As I discussed on the third quarter call, the international recovery is led by the national oil companies and focused on mature fields. NOCs generally do not alter their budgets in response to short-term oil price volatility and do not base their spending plans on the crude oil features strip. This makes me believe that the recovery in the international markets will continue. Over the course of 2019, activity should improve across all international regions although of a low base in some geographies like Asia Pacific and Africa. The existing contract backlog and the pipeline of projects are stronger coming into 2019. This should lead to healthy single-digit international growth for the whole year. In the first quarter, we expect international revenue to decline similar to last year due to normal seasonality and the elimination of year-end software and product sales. Last year, we won several major foothold contracts in different geographies. This work was priced very competitively and it will take us time to optimize contract performance and improved profitability. With the international recovery continuing and all regions pulling their way, we should start seeing equipment availability tighten in key markets. This should lead the better services pricing. With the activity pipeline improving internationally, we will selectively balance growth and returns in the international markets. Despite a slow start, 2019 will be another year where we continue to build the foundation for a longer term recovery. As North America oil production reaches a historic high and operators are focusing on returns over growth Halliburton is well prepared for this market environment. We've always believed and practice responsible capital stewardship, prioritizing capital efficiency, investing in the technologies that deliver differentiation in returns and generating strong cash flow. We have the right leadership team and bench strength to ensure the continued success of our global franchise. Just last week we announced the consistent with our succession management plan Mark Richard, who is currently Senior Vice President of the Northern U.S. Region has been promoted to succeed Jim Brown as President of the Western Hemisphere. I've worked alongside Mark for many years all over the world and I am excited for him to lead our Western Hemisphere business. I'm grateful to Jim for his more than 20 years of outstanding service to Halliburton. His leadership was instrumental in helping Halliburton execute and deliver industry-leading returns in North America and throughout the Western Hemisphere. Now, I would also like to welcome Lance Loeffler as our new CFO. You all know Lance well from his time as the Head of Investor Relations. He's worked closely with our management team and the investment community over the last few years, and I am confident that he will do a great job leading the company's finance organization. I will now turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our financial results. Then I will return to discuss how we are strategically positioned to differentiate ourselves in the current market and deliver returns for our shareholders. Lance? Lance Loeffler : Thank you, Jeff. I'll start with the summary of our fourth quarter results compared to the third quarter of 2018. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.9 billion and operating income was $608 million representing a sequential decrease of 4% and 15% respectively. In our Completion and Production division revenue was $3.8 billion, a decrease of 8%, while operating income was $496 million, a decrease of 19%. These declines were primarily driven by lower activity and pricing for stimulation services in North America, partially offset by stimulation activity increases in Argentina and year-end completion tool sales internationally. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $2.1 billion, an increase of 5%, while operating income was $185 million, an increase of 2%. These increases were primarily due to year-end software sales, increased fluids activity in the Gulf of Mexico, and improved project management activity in Latin America. These improvements were partially offset by reduced activity for drilling services in the Western Hemisphere. In North America, revenue decrease by 11%, primarily driven by lower activity and pricing in stimulation services, partially offset by higher fluids activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Latin America revenue grew 16%, driven primarily by year-end software and completion tool sales and higher stimulation activity across the region, coupled with improved activity across multiple product service lines in Mexico. Europe/Africa/CIS revenue remained relatively flat, primarily driven by seasonal declines in pipeline services across the region, coupled with decreased activity across multiple product service lines in the North Sea. These results were partially offset by year-end completion tool sales in Ghana and Nigeria. Middle East/Asia revenue increased 8%, largely resulting from year-end completion tool sales in the Middle East, coupled with higher project management activity throughout the region. In the fourth quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $73 million, which is in line with our previous guidance. We expect corporate expense in the first quarter of 2019 to be approximately $65 million. Net interest expense for the quarter was $137 million and we expect it to remain approximately the same for the first quarter of 2019. During the fourth quarter, we recognized the impact of a strategic change in the company's corporate structure, which resulted in a net tax benefit of $306 million, or $0.35 per diluted share. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 21%, excluding the tax benefit I just discussed. We estimate our 2019 full year and first quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 24%, based on the market environment and our expected geographic earnings mix. We generated approximately $850 million of cash from operations during the quarter, ending the year with a total cash balance of $2 billion. Capital expenditures during the quarter were approximately $550 million, with our 2018 full year CapEx totaling approximately $2 billion. For 2019, we intend to reduce our capital expenditures by around 20% to $1.6 billion. This spend will be focused on key technologies and capabilities that deliver differentiation and drive returns, such as our new directional drilling platform and our production business expansion. We remain committed to generating strong cash flow by using cost levers, managing working capital and remaining flexible in our CapEx spend, focusing on strong return generating opportunities. And we will use excess cash prudently for strategic investments that meet our returns thresholds for reducing debt and for returning cash to our shareholders. Turning now to our near-term operational outlook, market dynamics continue to make forecasting a challenge. But let me provide you with some comments on how we believe the first quarter is shaping up. As is typical, our international results will be subject to weather-related seasonality and the roll-off of higher margin year-end software and product sales. North American results will be impacted by near-term headwinds that Jeff described earlier. We will continue to pull the levers that enable us to keep generating positive cash flow for our businesses. As such, in our Completion and Production division, we expect sequential revenue to decline mid- to high-single-digits, with margins decreasing 300 to 400 basis points. For our drilling and evaluation division, we anticipate sequential revenue will experience a decline in the mid- to high-single-digits, largely in line with prior year declines, with our margins declining by 100 to 150 basis points. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thanks, Lance. I'm excited about Halliburton, both this year and into the future. We have the right team, the right strategy and the right technology to meet our customers' evolving needs and deliver industry-leading returns. Our value proposition is working and I hear it from our customers every day. Unconventionals are unique and valuable asset and our customers have developed this asset to revolutionize the industry. We at Halliburton saw this development early and have been investing in and innovating ever since. As a result, we are the dominant service provider in this space. Our innovative technology to quality of our service offering, our customer alignment and our market presence in all the U.S. unconventional basins position us to continue helping our customers lead the shale revolution into the future. I discussed earlier that the international recovery is led by mature fields, I am equally excited about Halliburton's mature fields' technology portfolio and we intend to continue building our mature fields capabilities in 2019 and beyond. Technology plays a critical role in our business. It drives the progress in unconventional, revise mature fields around the world and makes offshore economic again. You know that we are the leaders in returns. What you may not realize is that Halliburton is a clear leader when it comes to technology development. In 2018, we've received nearly 900 patents, a 10% increase year-over-year. IFI Claims, a data-based provider of U.S. patent data, ranked Halliburton as the 39th largest grantee of U.S. patents last year. More importantly, we are the only oil and gas sector company in the Top 50 list. It is critical to understand how we prioritize technology investment. We spent money on developing or acquiring technologies that help our customers solve their asset challenges, drive better productivity and reliability, minimize downtime and improve asset velocity. This helps create meaningful differentiation and deliver returns on our technology investment. We are developing new completions technology that solidifies our leadership position in unconventionals, differentiates Halliburton from the rest of the market and delivers on the next level of efficiencies to both the customer and Halliburton. Over the last few years, technology is driven substantial, operational and surface efficiencies in North American shale. I believe the future of unconventional technology will be more heavily weighted towards enabling higher well productivity. As part of our intelligent frac strategy, in 2018, we introduced our Prodigi AB intelligent fracturing service that brings automation to hydraulic fracturing. Prodigi AB automates the breakdown process of a fracturing treatment, this helps achieve consistent cluster performance, increased production from our customers' assets and reduced wear and tear on our equipment. I'm pleased to report that by the end of 2018, we have successfully deployed Prodigi AB service across all U.S. shale basins. It's been used on more than 1,450 stages for 20 different customers across the country from the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas to the Bakken formation in North Dakota. Strong customer interest and willingness to pay a premium for the services support my point about the growing importance of technology that improves well productivity in unconventionals. Another technology that we have heavily invested in last year and we'll continue to spend capital on 2019 is our directional drilling offering. As the wells in the U.S. unconventional basins beat lateral length records. We are excited to introduce the next generation of rotary steerables to help our customers build better wells. We designed the new iCruise rotary steerable system from scratch using the latest material science and digital innovations with the focus on decreasing operating costs, improving reliability and reducing maintenance time and expense. As part of the system development, we've also delivered a host of innovated ancillary technologies such as smart diagnostic systems for the ease of repair and maintenance and a drilling advisory package for automated drilling. Since launching the tool in September of last year, we've already deployed it in all major U.S. shale basins. In 2019, we will focus on rolling out the iCruise system in the international markets. In fact, we already had test runs for several customers in the Middle East and deliver the longest lateral and longest well in Argentina's Vaca Muerta Shale in our first deployment. Today, we estimate that 40% of the wells around the world are either shut-in or producing below their potential due to well integrity issues, costing our customers, billions of dollars in lost production. Halliburton's cased hole wireline tools for well integrity assessment enable operators to accurately understand the conditions and treat the problems of mature wells. Our Electromagnetic Pipe Xaminer technology is the only service in the market that can quantify corrosion and metal loss through five strings of pipe. And our Acoustic Conformance Xaminer Service uses advanced hydrophone sensors and proprietary analysis software to pinpoint leaks that can occur in the well structure. These differentiating technologies help our customers optimize their asset performance and help Halliburton solidify our position in mature fields markets such as the Middle East, Asia, the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. Artificial lift is the critical capability for both unconventionals and mature fields, and that is why Halliburton has expanded our artificial lift portfolio. Boosted by our acquisition of Summit ESP, our artificial lift business showed 43% revenue growth year-over-year and delivered outstanding margins. This is what I call a good return on a technology investment. In the fourth quarter, we started Summit's international expansion opening a testing and disassembly facility in the Middle East and making our first ESP deliveries in Latin America and the Middle East countries. We will continue investing in our production business in 2019, mainly in our artificial lift and specialty chemicals product lines. We are the execution company, we provide cutting-edge technology and exceptional service quality for our customers, and we believe these differentiators will result in industry-leading returns and positive cash flow for our shareholders. In summary, in 2019 we will continue to build the foundation for a longer-term recovery. In North America, we expect completions activity to moderately improve in the first quarter. I believe the catalyst for North America market improvement exists. And as they materialize, I believe Halliburton is best positioned to benefit from those improved market dynamics. The recovery will continue in the international markets. Halliburton has the project backlog and the line-of-sight tender pipeline to continue our international growth. Halliburton celebrates 100 Years of Service in 2019. I'd like to thank all of our current and past employees who made Halliburton what it is today. It's a big deal to be a century old. It's an even bigger deal to reach this monumental milestone and remain leaders in our field. As we enter the next century, I can assure you that we will remain focused on collaborating with our customers and engineering solutions to maximize their asset value and on delivering strong cash flow and industry-leading returns for our shareholders. And now, let's open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of James West of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. James West : Hey, good morning, guys. Jeff Miller : Good morning, James. Lance Loeffler : Good morning, James. James West : So, I guess, do you guys focus on returns? Jeff Miller : Yes, we do. James West : I think that was loud and clear. I guess the real question I have in my mind is, as an industry, the service industry return peaks have gotten lower, the valleys have gotten lower as well, where as an industry, if not Halliburton specifically, but as an industry, we're still negative, even though we're 3 years into a recovery. So there is a major problem across the industry and you're going up against people that don't have that same strategy. Now, I think there is a dichotomy I think internationally. I think your main competitor does have a returns-focused strategy. But I think in North America there is just too much capital that's not returns focused. Is that a fair statement? And how do you guys think about going up in a market like that? I mean, do you really need to start showing a lot - more discipline in stacking equipment? Jeff Miller : Yeah, thanks, James, broad question, but an important one. And we manage our business. And that's one of the things that's informing our view of capital and capital returns, I talked about returns. Just don't discount the technology involved in our business, in what we do, which differentiates Halliburton. But I think that the - our focus on returns, so that means managing capital spend and also the willingness to stack equipment that is not making a return, it is critical. So that way we do that actually, we do make those returns. And it allows us to flex both down to the market where we see it. But also the differentiation is we take a very long view of this business. We're - we will differentiate. And we're all around the business of how to make more barrels with existing wells. So I think all of that plays together over time. But we're going to make returns along the way. James West : Okay, okay. And then, how do you think about cash conversion, this cycle relative to, perhaps, other cycles? I mean, it seems like if we - we now have international go-ins, North America is a little bit up and down, but you seemed to invest. I think there's been enough investment in North America that it really should be only at sustaining levels now. So should we start to see cash conversion rates improve? And do you have a target there? Jeff Miller : Yeah, I mean, rather than a target, I mean, our view is we're going to generate solid free cash flow in any market. And I think the market that we see shaping up is one where we can generate solid, quite a bit of free cash flow. Lance Loeffler : Yeah, I would just add, James, that just to remind everybody, this is the first time ever I think that we generated over $1 billion of free cash flow in back to back years. And our expectation is that that will continue, right? That will be with the focus on managing cost, improving our working capital and being disciplined around our CapEx spend. Jeff Miller : Yeah. James West : Okay, all right. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jud Bailey of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Judson Bailey : Thank you. Good morning. Jeff Miller : Good morning. Lance Loeffler : Hey, Jud. Judson Bailey : Hey. A question on your comment, Jeff, on completion activity being, I think you said, slightly higher or slightly improved. What kind of visibility do you have at this point for the first quarter in terms of your agreements with customers? Given the rig counts declining or seems to be declining, I'd be curious to get your thoughts on how you see the interplay between completions and maybe kind of drilling related services in the first quarter as well? Jeff Miller : Yeah, Jud, look, I think those two are separating more and more in terms of what activity is being done. We've got pretty good visibility through the quarter and that's why I'm able to see why I do see modest increase in the amount of completion activity over that period of time. The drilling services may slow a bit. And I think that the pivot would be more to completions. But I also - we look ahead or beyond that, and we see those catalysts unfolding out into the future. But that's why I describe it as modestly up. When we look at our calendar, it looks modestly up through the first quarter, certainly relative to Q4. So we said it would be bottom in Q4 and we see an activity pick up here. Judson Bailey : Okay, all right. I appreciate the color there. My next question is on D&E margins. It came in a bit lighter than what we thought for the fourth quarter especially when you factor in year-end product sales. And then, you're guiding down for those to drop again in the first quarter. Can you give us a little bit of color on what's going on within D&E that has margins I think coming in below what we would have thought? And then, how do we think about the rest of the year? Is there a catalyst to see those margins start to move a bit higher over the course of 2019? Jeff Miller : Yeah, so, I mean, what you're seeing there reflected is the - we won a number of contracts around the world, particularly in D&E, that's where some of that growth comes from. And as I've described, sort of throughout all of 2018, a fairly tough pricing environment out there. And our view is that we optimize those contracts over time and we will. We'll get to work on them and we'll mobilize on to rigs. But there will be some work to do to get through that. Now, overall, our business improves as we work through the year as we progress. But there is just optimization that needs to happen around the world. Judson Bailey : Okay, all right. Thank you. I'll turn it back. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert of Simmons. Your line is now open. William Andrew Herbert : Good morning. Jeff and Lance, C&P incremental in Q4 were pretty benign at 35%, yet the guidance for Q1 implies 60%. Can you explain what's likely to unfold there? I assume it's mostly pricing. And then in a similar vein, your year-over-year incrementals for C&P in the low 20% 2018, how should we expect incremental margins for C&P to unfold beyond the trough of Q1? Jeff Miller : Well, the Q1 [is - I think we] [ph] described it well, I mean, and as I described Q4, we saw activity down, but when we saw the pressure on the commodity price along with budget time that created quite a bit of price pressure that manifests itself through Q1. Now I also described what I see as the catalyst later in the year that I think create more customer urgency and from a price standpoint start to resolve that. And I would be surprised, if you didn't expect we can see those things unfolding feel pretty good about them as we work through the balance of the year. Now that said, I think, I was clear in terms of what our behavior would be if we don't see that, which is equipment that to the extent it is not making a return, it would get stacked. William Andrew Herbert : Okay. And then Lance, when we think about the capital intensity of the business, on the one hand there's a commendable contraction in capital spending for 2019 down 20%. On our numbers, you're still coming at 6% to 7% of revenues. And I'm just - you were kind of oscillating between 7% and 9% last year, I think you bottomed over the past couple of years at 5%. In light of the competitive structure or in light of the more labored peak margin profile associated with the business, how should we think about fundamental capital intensity of the business on the full cycle basis? Lance Loeffler : Well, I think, I'm focused on sort of CapEx for this year, I think, really the overweight spend in our CapEx going forward is clearly focused on Sperry business line as we continue to retool and re-kit with a new technology. I think as you might expect, some of the spend in our pressure pumping business would be more in line with DD&A. So I think, as we look out for the reminder of the year, we believe the range of $1.6 billion is the appropriate level of CapEx given the strategic investment that we're making in the level of activity that we expect at this point. William Andrew Herbert : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean Meakim of J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Sean Meakim : Thanks. Hey, good morning. Jeff Miller : Good morning, Sean. Sean Meakim : So Jeff, you talked the difficulty of forecasting the cycles, so I'm just curious about you kind of where you put some of the bigger flex points within C&P for 2019, and you're going to trade some pricing exchange for volumes? What's your confidence level in terms of C&P top line being able to grow year-on-year and your confidence level in margins bottoming in the first quarter and the first half of the year? Jeff Miller : Yeah. So we typically will see margins bottom the quarter after we see activity bottom, and that's not unusual that's kind of what we're seeing happened in Q1 right now. What I see on the - as I look through the balance of the year, if we think about the DUC count that's out there and that it needs to get converted into cash flow by customers. Pipes alleviate as we work through the year in the Permian Basin. No question about that. Supportive price environment, commodity price environment, which we do see shaping up at this point, and so that will be very helpful. And so that combination of things gives me a lot of confidence that as we work through the year, we should see better performance both from activity standpoint and also a customer urgency standpoint. Sean Meakim : Okay. Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. And then so - just maybe explain a little bit more on the CapEx budget. Lance, could you maybe just - is there a range that we can talk about around that $1.6 billion? You give some detail on where you expect to see some of the growth areas, maybe within North America depending on how things shake out as you go through the year, could we quantify a bit of how that could flex from that $1.6 billion? Lance Loeffler : Well, yeah, I mean, I hesitate, to - I mean, I think, what we described around 20% in my commentary, again we believe that based on our outlook right now for the year $1.6 billion is appropriate. But I think it's pretty obvious from the rest of our commentary that we are willing to flex down, if need be, if it doesn't play out the way that we think it will with the catalysts that Jeff described. So I think there is flexibility in the CapEx budget just as needed. Sean Meakim : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Your line is now open. Scott Gruber : Yes. Good morning. Jeff Miller : Good morning, Scott. Lance Loeffler : Good morning, Scott. Scott Gruber : I want to come back to the U.S. competition question a bit, just because there is a debate in the investment community as to the degree to which you're seeing rising competition, especially for the top-tier E&Ps and the major in the U.S. Just as U.S. E&Ps look, they can source more functions and some of the smaller service companies to expand geographically into more product lines? Do you hold this opinion? Do you - are you seeing rising competitions, especially amongst the top-tier E&Ps, and if so, how are you adjusting the strategy in response? Jeff Miller : Well, this business is always competitive. So that's nothing new for us when we look at the marketplace. And when I think about our business that's why we focus very much so on our value proposition which delivers great service quality, obviously, we've got a fantastic business development organization. So we see things and we are engaging with our customers and solving their problems. And then finally, technology. In the technology piece, there is a chunk of that, that happens around surface efficiency, which we talk a lot about, and then more and more we talk about how we make more barrels out of each well. And clearly, we're differentiated along all of those continuums, and I think as we look that 2019, 2020 and beyond at this fantastic resource that shale, our contribution and what we do around not just modeling, but frac treatment and all that we can do to make more barrels will be progressively more important and differentiating. Scott Gruber : Got it. And maybe if you can just touch on how you view the structural margins in North America, you've got a greater detail about the investments in directional, in lift and technology, which is great. Does that mean that overall you think about the structural margins in North America the same as you have in the past that around 20%? Jeff Miller : Look, I think there is a lot of run in North America and there's a lot of earnings power in North America. It's a huge resource, and I'm not going to try to put a date on 20%, but what I will describe is, we sort of look at points in time, 2014, we are right around there; 2018 in 3Q, we've got around there - 2Q, and then as we - those conditions are there certainly to have better earnings power. I expect the things that we're doing now around technology and discipline and execution drive that. Then I also - I mean, I pivot back to the technology and the value of that resource and how many ways there are to make a lot of earnings. So if we're investing in drilling and we're investing in production today, those are important areas of growth, but that our R&D spend is very much focused on making more barrels in unconventionals. Scott Gruber : Got it. I appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. James Wicklund : Good morning, guys. Jeff Miller : Good morning. James Wicklund : Just so you know the background behind the call is coming up with an earnings estimate for Q1 in the low 20s, just so. A question about the international business, that higher project management activity throughout the Middle East, you talk about winning two contracts in Iraq, you're going to mobilize four to six rigs. Can you tell me a little bit - this is obviously becoming a bigger piece of everybody's business? Are you going to use Trinidad's rigs? Is this a fixed-price deal? Is there opportunity for upside? Can you tell us how these types of contracts are different from the typical HAL contracts or are they different from other international IDS projects? Jeff Miller : Yeah. These aren't different from other IDS contracts. And in terms of which rigs we'll use, we'll use the rigs that are best positioned in most competitive to do the work. So but the contracts I'm describing are fairly consistent with lump sum turnkey type activity where obviously there are exceptions around risks and other things that we manage. But they are not widely different. They are an important part of our business and I'm described that's a muscle that's well developed for Halliburton. But at the same time, there are many points along the continuum between lump sum turnkey and discrete services, and we're participating in all of those today in a number of different markets. James Wicklund : Okay. And my second question, if I could from a general point of view, it's been mentioned a little bit a couple of times this morning, but in the last 10 years, your returns have declined, in the last 10 years your market cap is right back where it was 10 years ago today. The industry as a whole doesn't seem to be creating any value. Your customers' market caps are up 3X. The service industry, you guys, which are most of it, you are flat to where you were 10 years ago. How does the business change going forward, so that you actually get to capture some of the value you create, rather than looking at your ROIC for last 10 years, see that value decline? Jeff Miller : Yeah. Well, Jim, I think we talked about some of that this morning, but it's free cash flow and\u2026 James Wicklund : Yeah. But the company has been generating free cash flow up and down the cycle. Then I'm talking about return on invested capital as opposed to just cash flow generation. You guys talk about, you have your thresholds for returns, but basically you're saying you won't work anything below cash breakeven. Is the threshold for returns to you guys, cash flow breakeven? Jeff Miller : No. And - I think the - when I look at - we step back and look at the kinds of investments that we're making and what we are able to do for clients to generate value, it generates value for us, I would say there's a lot more focus today on technology that generates value for us. When I talk about technology that's the kind of thing we're investing in, it either lowers our cost or makes us more productive and generates a better return. And\u2026 James Wicklund : Is this the change over the strategy of the last 10 years? Jeff Miller : No, it's not a change. But I think it is probably more prescriptive in terms of how we're doing that. And look, I think that the contribution of what we do is just that important to making this work and I think that we will generate better and better returns as we work forward. James Wicklund : Okay, gentlemen. Thanks much. Good quarter. Jeff Miller : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chase Mulvehill of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Chase Mulvehill : Hey, good morning, fellows. Jeff Miller : Hey, Chase. Chase Mulvehill : I guess first question - hey, so if we think about U.S. onshore completions business, just given U.S. shale, there seems to be more scaling up and scaling down of this business. What's your strategy to kind of manage the cost around that as there is a much more inherent kind of scaling costs for this business? Jeff Miller : Yeah, when I think - I look to our business development organization to be way out in front of that in terms of our ability to respond, I think we do respond quickly to that. I think our response in Q4 was pretty quick to that. And as I look ahead, that alignment is critical. And I also think the types of investments that we make that allow us to be more flexible around scaling up and scaling down, and more variable around that make us even more effective at that. Chase Mulvehill : Okay, I mean, in the fourth quarter did you stack any frac fleets? Jeff Miller : Look, if we look at Q4, we had a lot of equipment moving around in Q4, some sidelined for a variety of reasons. But, in fact, that is a response. We had customers that we wanted to finish out the work with for the year. And as we go into 2019, I think we've got that same ability. As I said, we're prepared to stack equipment when it doesn't meet economic thresholds. Chase Mulvehill : Okay. And then turning to the first quarter, when we think about North America, what kind of revenue decline do you expect or included kind of in your - or implied in your guidance? And then, you gave C&P margin decline of 300 to 400 bps. If you were to just kind of isolate North America overall, what kind of margin decline should we expect in North America? Lance Loeffler : Yeah. I mean, I think, largely the guidance that we gave was a focus on the North America impact of the pricing that Jeff discussed, right, on the top-line and on the bottom-line in terms of margins. Chase Mulvehill : Okay. I mean, so when we think about North America, C&P was down mid- to high-single-digits on revenues and margins were down 300 to 400 bps. Is that a good proxy for kind of North America for 1Q? Lance Loeffler : Yeah. And we've said that in the past, right. I mean, I think C&P has been a pretty good proxy for North America. Chase Mulvehill : Okay, just wanted to make sure. All right, thanks Lance. Thanks, Jeff. Lance Loeffler : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Anderson of Barclays. Your line is now open. David Anderson : Thanks. Good morning. Jeff, I was just - or Jeff or Lance, I was just kind of wondering if you could just talk a little bit about capital deployment internationally. You talked about the new IDC contract in Iraq and it's been a big business for you over there. I'm just kind of curious, you had mentioned that D&E margins are been held back a bit by mobilization cost. So how should we be thinking about kind of where you are in the overall cycle, as LSTK's kind of ramped up over the last few years? Are you in a place where it's really harvest mode or do you think there is going to be more of these contracts that keep coming in here that might kind of keep it in this place here for a little while? If you could just kind of help us understand how that capital deployment and how kind of that impacts D&E as you think about maybe the next kind of 12, 18 months please? Jeff Miller : Yeah, and I think a lot of that startup around, a lot of contracts that were won in 2018 as I talked about, we were winning things at the bottom of the cycle. We know we can optimize those. But that's - it starts with price and optimization. Some of those were mobilizing too. We're winning - we won - we don't talk about all of them, but we won contracts in almost every geography of substantive size throughout the last year. What's probably more encouraging to me as I look around the marketplace and we see anecdotes, they're anecdotes today, but where we see acute tightness and we're able to move quite a bit on price. Now, that doesn't resolve over a quarter or a couple of quarters. But it is indicative of the kind of tightness that we would expect to see as a recovery unfolds and we start to see growth into 2019 and beyond. David Anderson : So, Lance, now, that you have the purse strings and you're kind of looking at capital deployment internationally for projects like this, can you just help me understand is that capital deployment for kind of international, is that higher or lower than what has been in the last - say, 2018? Would you expect that to tail off here? Or is there just - and you're going to keep it open if the opportunities present themselves? Lance Loeffler : Yeah, I mean, right now, the capital deployment going forward is really focused on Sperry, right? David Anderson : Yeah. Lance Loeffler : And it's a lot - that's D&E related as it relates to our international business and the technology overhaul that we're making there and making sure that once that technology is really invested in, in terms of the inventory of tools and the fleet that we have for our directional drilling business. So it's overweight with the focus on Sperry today. David Anderson : And maybe one last quick question to Lance. Just on that CapEx budget, can you just give us a sense of kind of what maintenance is? I know it's a really difficult term, but any kind of sense as to kind of where of that $1.6 billion what you would consider to be maintenance? Lance Loeffler : Yeah, I don't - we tend to stay away from the term maintenance, when it comes to our CapEx. It's really all growth related. But I would say that from a financial perspective, sort of in relation to our depreciation and amortization for the year, it's sort of - $1.6 billion is sort in the sustaining level, meaning it's matching what's rolling off. David Anderson : It makes sense. Thank you very much, Lance. Jeff, thanks. Lance Loeffler : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead of RBC. Your line is now open. Kurt Hallead : Good morning. Lance Loeffler : Good morning, Kurt. Jeff Miller : Good morning, Kurt. Kurt Hallead : Guys, hey, I just wanted to get a general sense from you, to the extent possible, right, say, if we're looking at a $50 WTI oil price environment, $60 Brent environment. And that really doesn't change a heck of a whole lot throughout the course of the year. When you think about the total company revenue dynamic for 2019, do you think you'd be able to squeak out revenue growth or given some of the first quarter challenges and the potential dynamics around the progression in North America for the rest of the year, do you think it's going to be too challenging to get revenue growth? What's your take - best take right now? Jeff Miller : Look, it's $50; $50, $55 in my view is a supportive commodity price for activity, both internationally and in the U.S. And so, I'm encouraged as I see the catalysts come together throughout the year, I think that will have a solid upward direction on our entire business. And then, also at the same time, I expect we'll outperform whatever that is. Kurt Hallead : Okay. So not going so far to suggest up or down, but outperform whatever happens to the marketplace? Okay, that's fair, that's fair commentary. And, Jeff, I was wondering, as you look at the international dynamics, right, you have some regions that you are going to grow off a very low base, and you have other areas where you talked about taking some big projects at lower margins. And how long do you think it takes for those larger projects to start to see that margin improvement? And do you think you'll be able to start to demonstrate that in the second half of 2019 or do you think it'll take all of 2019 and into 2020 before you before you get to that point? Jeff Miller : Yeah, look, I think the - there is a lot of moving parts. At this point in time, I'm excited about those countries that are recovering and those geographies that are recovering. It will take some time to work through kind of the wall of new contracts that were picked up through 2018 and that will unfold in 2019. I'm not going to give you a date on when we think that works out. I just know that we're working that all the time and I'm really encouraged. And again, that's part of what drives the investment in drilling tools that I'm talking about and then also the opportunities that we see to drive better returns and better margins on some of these contracts won. But that does take time. Kurt Hallead : Okay. And then last one to follow up, just use of cash, you obviously identified a reduction in capital expenditures. As you look at the prospect for share repurchase vis-\u00e0-vis M&A, which looks more attractive to you at this point? Jeff Miller : Yeah, look, I mean, Kurt, our approach to excess cash deployment hasn't changed, right? We're focused on returning capital to shareholders. We also noted that we want to work, continue to reduce our debt levels. And then, obviously, if there are opportunities out there from an M&A perspective that meet our returns thresholds, we will do that. But it's all going to still be through the lens of returns. And so, we may be opportunistic when it comes to share buybacks that we're - we've got a track record at least over the course of last year where we were able to do all three and we expect to continue to do that moving forward. Kurt Hallead : Got you. Hey, I appreciate the color. Thank you. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that is all the time we have for questions. I'd like to hand the call back over to management for any closing remarks. A - Jeff Miller : Yeah. Thank you, Nicole. So before I close out the call, I'd like to reemphasize a couple of points. First, I believe Halliburton is best positioned to take advantage of the North American catalysts that will drive completion activity and customer urgency as the year unfolds. Second, I'm confident of Halliburton's position internationally and how we will take advantage of the recovery that I see unfolding. And finally, we will continue our focus on capital discipline, delivering strong cash flows and maximizing returns for our shareholders. Look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Nicole, please close out the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. That does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Abu Zeya. Please go ahead. Abu Zeya : Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton first quarter 2019 conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO; and Lance Loeffler, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, recent current reports on Form 8-K, and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of impairments and other charges. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our first quarter press release and can be found in the Investor Downloads section of our website. After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow time for others who may be in the queue. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you, Abu, and good morning, everyone. What a difference 90 days make in this market. Commodity prices have rebounded, customer budgets are refreshed and we're back to work. Our results for the first quarter played out as we expected and I'm pleased with how our organization executed both in North America and internationally. Here are the first quarter highlights. Total company revenue of $5.7 billion was essentially flat compared to the first quarter of 2018 and adjusted operating income was $426 million. International revenue increased 11% year-over-year, which was a great first step towards our expectation of high single-digit international growth for all of 2019. Our Drilling and Evaluation division had a strong year-over-year revenue growth of 7% with activity improvements across all geographic regions. Finally, as expected, hydraulic fracturing activity ramped up in U.S land as customers refreshed their budgets. And despite pricing headwinds, our execution resulted in delivering better than expected margins in our Completion and Production division. From a macro perspective, 2019 is off to a strong start. Commodity prices have been rising since the beginning of the year due to tightening oil supplies and stable demand. OPEC plus production cuts and supply disruptions from Venezuela, Iran and Libya have supported market rebalancing. Oil demand trends, particularly in China and India, have also been constructive. Overall, the macro environment remains favorable for our industry. Against this backdrop and with winter behind us, customer activity in both hemispheres has picked up off December lows and continues to trend higher. Although we often discuss the hydraulic fracturing business in North America, it's important to remember that Halliburton has a portfolio of 14 product service lines operating in North America. For example, our artificial lift and cementing businesses showed excellent results in the first quarter, growing both revenue and margin year-over-year. Our artificial lift product line grew top line revenues 55% year-over-year in the first quarter driven by strong demand for ESPs that are now installed much sooner in the life of the well and sometimes right after the wells put on production. Halliburton is the number one cementing provider in U.S. land. Demand for our cementing services continue to be strong in the first quarter. Congratulations to our artificial lift and cementing teams for an outstanding performance. Now let's turn to our North America land hydraulic fracturing business. We experienced an increase in the stages pumped every month this quarter with March finishing on a high note. Overall, the first quarter activity level was modestly higher compared to the first quarter of 2018. As expected, we had pricing headwinds throughout the quarter. However, we believe the worst in the pricing deterioration is now behind us. And as we\u2019ve discussed in the past, the success of our hydraulic fracturing business is not dependent on pricing alone. Given our presence in all basins and exposure to all customer groups, we have the ability to pull other levers such as utilization, cost savings and operational efficiency to drive a better outcome for our business. Let me describe what I believe will happen with hydraulic fracturing supply and demand throughout 2019. On the demand side, it's evolving as we had anticipated. Our customers have announced their 2019 budgets and we expect that overall spend will be down 6% to 10% in North America. Here is how I see the impact of our customers' 2019 budgets on the North America land stimulation services business. I expect that customers will operate within their budgets largely by achieving savings through sand cost deflation and by reducing drilling activity. On the other hand, I believe that net completions activity will remain essentially flat year-on-year as our customer seek to achieve their publicized production targets. In the near-term, our view on North American customer activity heading into the second quarter is shaped by the momentum that we saw building at the end of March. As for the next couple of quarters, I see demand for our services progressing modestly. The cadence of spend across basins for various companies will look different throughout the year, but Halliburton has the scale, range of services and customer relationships that capture more than anyone else out of every dollar spent in North America land this year. Now let's talk about the supply side. Given the demand landscape, the service industry is adjusted accordingly and cut capital spend. Currently, new horse power is not being added to the market. At the same time, the existing equipment is working a lot harder today, leading to equipment attrition. The key driver of this is service intensity, which quickly translates into shorter equipment lives and higher maintenance costs. Let me give you some data points to put this in perspective. Halliburton is currently pushing 30% more sand volume through equipment than in 2016. The shift to local sand that is finer and more abrasive also leads to more equipment wear. Customers are drilling longer laterals and fracking more stages per well. Last year we fracked 20% more stages per horsepower than we did in 2016. And with increased efficiency, we've improved utilization, achieving more pumping hours per day. Again, more wear and tear. Industry sources estimate that about 7.5 million hydraulic horsepower will need to be rebuilt in 2019 to maintain a flat horsepower supply. This equates to $1.7 billion in equipment spend that I do not see forthcoming as the service companies have cut capital spending plans. As a result of these factors, I believe the capacity attrition will occur naturally throughout the year and that there will be less horsepower available in the market at the end of the year than there is today. Halliburton will significantly reduce North America hydraulic fracturing CapEx this year. We have sufficient size and scale in the market today and see no reason to invest in growth when it comes at the expense of returns. The capital that we do spend will be mostly directed towards improving efficiency, reducing emissions and refurbishing equipment. I'm frequently asked when will we add hydraulic fracturing capacity again? Let me tell you, I don't see that happening until the market has better supply and demand balance and substantially better pricing. And despite the ongoing market rebalancing I just described, the market conditions are not conducive to adding capacity. In this market we are focused on maintaining the right level of capital spending to support our business. But most importantly, on continuing to deliver strong cash flow and [technical difficulty] returns. As the North America land market rebalances over the next few quarters, we will continue to control what we can control. We're positioning ourselves to outperform the market even if demand is substantially different from what we currently expect. I already mentioned our CapEx reduction. That was the first step. Second, we're reorganizing our structure in North America land to be more nimble and operate more efficiently. This will make us more effective in any market. Third, I often talk about continuous improvement. I want to make it clear that this is not a temporary initiative at Halliburton. It's part of who we are as a company. We are constantly looking for ways to eliminate waste and improve productivity in all parts of our organization, from technology to training, from supply chain to field operations. And we will continue to drive cost and capital efficiency throughout our company. Finally, and most importantly, we are a returns driven organization and where pricing concessions would've pushed returns below an acceptable threshold, we've instead elected to stack equipment, including frac fleets. Emerging from the industry's focus on cash flow and returns, we see stable growth over a longer period of time. This sustained growth will be good for Halliburton. It will allow us to leverage our supply chain and logistics infrastructure, drive asset velocity, capture efficiencies around our repair and maintenance programs, and implement technologies at scale to reduce costs and increase production. Therefore, we can be more efficient with our investments. Halliburton is well positioned to navigate the near-term and thrive in the long run. Our company is 100 years old and we got here by evolving with our market and our customers. We will continue to do so in the future. Turning to international markets, I'm excited by what I see. The international recovery continues to build momentum. Halliburton has gained share in key international markets over the last several years. This gives us a strong base to capitalize on the recovery and we expect high single-digit international revenue growth this year. The international recovery was initially led by the national oil companies and focused on mature fields. Now the offshore markets are also entering recovery mode as project economics become more attractive. International offshore spending is projected to be up 14% in 2019 and the average offshore international rig count increased 29% year-on-year in the first quarter. A great example of an emerging offshore rebound is our recent win with Shell in Brazil. In the first quarter we started work on Shell's three-year integrated well construction campaign in the Santos and Campos basins offshore Brazil. These are some of the most complex, but also most prolific basins in the world. Halliburton is excited to collaborate with Shell on the first green shoots of long-term activity recovery in this critical deepwater market. Middle East activity is increasing, driven by rig additions in Iraq and Saudi Arabia. However, we expect pricing pressures in the Middle East to continue in the near-term. A steady volume of activity and excess equipment capacity in the region continue to drive competitiveness. Going forward, a call on production and tightening spare capacity should lead to positive pricing movements. The North Sea is showing pricing improvement with available drilling equipment capacity essentially absorbed. However, we expect margin pressure to remain for the first half of the year as we optimize performance on our competitively priced long-term contracts and continue to incur mobilization cost. Activity ramp-up continues across Asia Pacific and Africa with the rig counts in both regions now the highest level since the first quarter of 2015. We are starting to see pockets of pricing improvement in these areas as they come back from the downturn low. Latin America activity will improve this year driven by Mexico and Argentina. I'm excited about the near-term growth and long-term potential in that region. As we see more capacity tightness internationally and the pipeline of projects progressively expands, we expect to continue demonstrating rational returns driven growth in the international markets. The pricing discussions with our customers in some markets have become more constructive and we expect this momentum to build going into 2020. As the rationalization of the U.S shale industry unfolds and the international markets ramp-up, Halliburton is best positioned to capitalize on the future opportunities. We make thousands of decisions every day and our global presence, our diversified products and service portfolio, our culture, our processes and our depth of leadership will allow us to win. We will win through responsible capital stewardship, prioritizing capital efficiency, investing in the technologies that deliver differentiation and generating strong cash flow and returns. I will now turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our financial results. Then I will return to discuss how we are strategically positioned to differentiate ourselves in the current market and deliver returns for our shareholders. Lance? Lance Loeffler : Thanks, Jeff. Let's begin with an overview of our first quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2018. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.7 billion, essentially flat year-over-year, while adjusted operating income was $426 million, a 31% decrease. Now let me take a moment to discuss our divisional results. In our Completion and Production division, revenue was $3.7 billion, a decrease of 4% and operating income was $368 million, a decrease of 26%. These results were primarily driven by increased stimulation activity in North America, which was offset by lower pricing. The Completion and Production division also benefited from higher artificial lift and cementing activity in U.S land, increased stimulation activity in Latin America and higher completion tool sales in the Middle East/Asia and Latin America regions. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue increased 7% to $2.1 billion, driven by activity improvement across all regions. Operating income was $123 million, a decrease of 35%. These results were primarily driven by mobilization cost that we incurred on multiple international drilling projects, coupled with reduced project management activity and lower pricing in the Middle East. Moving to our geographical results. In North America, revenue decreased 7%, primarily driven by lower pricing in stimulation services, partially offset by higher artificial lift, cementing and stimulation services activity. Latin America revenue increased 28%. This increase was driven by higher activity for the majority of our product service lines in Mexico, increased stimulation work in Argentina and improved fluids activity throughout the region, partially offset by reduced drilling and testing activity in Brazil. Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue grew 4% driven by higher activity across multiple product service lines in Ghana and the United Kingdom. These results were partially offset by lower drilling activity in Azerbaijan. In Middle East/Asia revenue increased 7% year-over-year, largely resulting from higher completion tool sales across the region, coupled with increased project management activity in India and improved drilling activity in the Middle East. These improvements were offset by reduced fluids activity and lower pricing in the Middle East. In the first quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $65 million, which is in line with our previous guidance. We expect corporate expense in the second quarter to remain approximately the same. During the quarter, we recognized a pre-tax charge of $61 million, primarily related to a non-cash impairment of legacy sand delivery equipment as we've adopted a more efficient sand logistic solution. Net interest expense for the quarter was $143 million and we expect it to remain approximately the same for the next reporting period. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 21%. Going forward, we expect our second quarter and 2019 full-year effective tax rate to be approximately 23%. Our first quarter cash flow from operations was a use of cash of $44 million, primarily driven by short-term working capital movements. We experienced some customer payment delays that should get resolved as the second quarter progresses. We've also built up inventory primarily for the international rollout of our strategic investments, and we plan to work this inventory down throughout the year. Historically, it's not unusual for our cash flow to the backend loaded and we expect to generate strong operating cash flow for the remainder of 2019. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $437 million with our 2019 full-year CapEx firm at $1.6 billion. On a full-year basis, we expect to generate higher free cash flow than last year by engaging the appropriate levers in different markets. Optimizing capacity and structure in North America, driving pricing improvements and contract optimization internationally and managing working capital and CapEx. Now turning to our near-term operational outlook, let me provide you with some comments on how we believe the second quarter is shaping up. For our Drilling and Evaluation division, we are anticipating a second quarter rebound from typical seasonal disruptions in drilling activity, offset by ongoing mobilizations. Therefore, we expect sequential revenue to be up low single digits with margins increasing 50 to 150 basis points. In our Completion and Production division, with North America land activity improving and the worst in pricing deterioration behind us, we believe that revenues will increase mid single digits, while margin should be up 50 to150 basis points. Now I will turn the call back over to Jeff to highlight some of our ongoing strategic initiatives and make a few closing comments. Jeff? Jeff Miller : Thanks, Lance. More than ever we're focused on exercising prudent capital allocation to the right priorities. We have solid long-term strategies aligned with value generation for our shareholders. We will continue to expand in the product service lines and penetrate the markets where we see opportunities to generate growth and returns. As we implement these strategies, we expect to generate economic and technical differentiation that will lead to higher returns and free cash flow. There are three main areas where we're investing this year and I will walk you through each one of them. First, we will continue to enhance the competitiveness of our Sperry drilling product line. I\u2019ve talked to you a lot about iCruise, the new rotary steerable platform we introduced last year. The global rollout of this advanced drilling technology is on track with the tool already working in Argentina, the Middle East and across the U.S shale basins. We are currently building out the tool inventory and by the end of 2019, iCruise will constitute over a third of our rotary steerable fleet. Growth in the higher margin rotary steerable market is extremely encouraging, but conventional motors remain the workhorse of directional drilling, especially on land. Another initiative we undertook at Sperry to increase our competitiveness and differentiation was to launch our Motors Center of Excellence. It is a new approach to drilling motor development that combines specialized engineering and manufacturing capabilities to customize motor designs for specific basin challenges. The center deploys the latest mechanical engineering expertise to build more durable motors that drill faster and allow for longer runs with a higher rate of penetration. We have assembled a dedicated team of scientists in bearing and power section design, polymer chemistry and materials that is focused on accelerating research and development activities to deliver differentiated drilling motors to the industry. As part of our Motors Center of Excellence, last quarter we opened two new reline facilities equipped with state-of-the-art technology and strategically located in Houston and Saudi Arabia to serve our customers in the Western and Eastern Hemispheres. Next we will continue investing in our production businesses, artificial lift and specialty chemicals. They\u2019re critical to both unconventionals and mature fields that fit well within our existing product portfolio and they have a lot of growth potential for Halliburton going forward. This year will be all about international expansion for these businesses. It is already well underway for artificial lift offering. We opened a testing and disassembly facility in the Middle East and are making ESP deliveries in several countries in Latin America and in the Middle East. Plans for international manufacturing of ESPs are in the works as well. I recently went to Saudi Arabia to attend a groundbreaking ceremony for Halliburton's first chemical manufacturing plant in the Eastern Hemisphere. Leveraging the expertise added through the Athlon acquisition last year, we are building a plant that will provide an advantage location for Halliburton to deliver superior service and chemical applications expertise to our Eastern Hemisphere customers. Upon completion in 2020, the plant will have capabilities to manufacture a broad slate of chemicals for stimulation, production, midstream and downstream engineered treatment programs. We will not only supply our customers with next generation specialty chemical solutions, but will also be able to manufacture chemicals for our own drilling fluids, cementing and stimulation businesses. Finally, the third focus area for this year. We will continue to differentiate in a very important, but highly competitive space in hydraulic fracturing. The intense exploration of top-tier acreage, fueled by rapid trial-and-error technology cycles led to the explosive increase in production from US unconventionals that we've seen in the past decade. As Shale matures and operators have to step out to second tier acreage, it will become increasingly hard to add enough production capacity to replace a significant legacy decline volumes as well as drive new production higher. Going forward, higher activity and more advanced technology will be needed to maintain flat production levels in unconventionals. In light of this, I firmly believe that the future of unconventional technology will be more heavily weighted towards enabling higher well productivity. .: On a recent application in North Dakota's Williston basin, Prodigi enabled more even distribution of profit and fluid to each cluster, resulting in a 30% increase in cluster efficiency. This is just the beginning of what Prodigi will provide as we continue to work smarter going forward. And Halliburton is best positioned to develop and deploy the advanced technologies that will ultimately improve well performance. With shale maturation, capital discipline on both the operator and the services side and an escalating focus on technology and efficiency, we expect customers to demand both surface execution and subsurface effectiveness. It won't just be about getting the most number of stages fracked today. Improving the quality of those stages and their production output will be just as important. In this environment a strong integrated franchise will matter; size and scale matter will matter, technology depth will matter; superior service quality will matter; customer collaboration will matter; and Halliburton has all of these. In summary, a supply and demand rebalance in North America land over the next few quarters, Halliburton is well positioned to navigate the near-term and thrive in the long run. Second, a broad-based recovery is ongoing internationally and will continue into 2020. Halliburton will keep achieving rational returns driven growth in the international markets. And finally, against this backdrop, Halliburton is focused on the right things. We're investing in the products and services that generate growth and returns, managing our costs and other operating levers and committed to generating strong free cash flow and industry-leading returns. And now, let's open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Angie Sedita of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Angeline Sedita : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Jeff Miller : Good morning, Angie. Welcome back. Angeline Sedita : Thank you. Glad to be back. So, Jeff, maybe we could touch on your commentary on the worst in pricing is behind us. Is that -- give us a little color there. Does that imply that the pricing pressure is not completely gone? And then, also you touched on your levers to drive margins and of course, utilization and operational efficiency does drive margins in a big way. So can you talk about those levers and how much more you have to pull there? Jeff Miller : Thanks, Angie. The -- I\u2019d say the worst is behind us. That doesn\u2019t mean there's nothing, but it also means that when we look at the market and how it's shaping up, that does -- will there be some trickling effects, potentially I'm not going to give precision around our strategy there. But what I will tell you is that we\u2019re saying no where the thresholds aren't met, which gives me confidence. And then aligning that with what we see around activity and tightening capacity, which all of that should progress as the year goes on and I view that as lending of support to pricing being behind us. Angeline Sedita : Okay. And so does that -- with the tightening capacity and you talked about the attrition that\u2019s ongoing, do you -- what\u2019s your thoughts on pricing for the back half of the year or is that more of a 2020 event? Jeff Miller : Yes, again, I'm not going to try to pick the date on where things are. I think broadly though our view is that we will see tightening capacity on the balance throughout the year. I described how hard equipment is working. Also, the capital discipline that our customers see, we see the same and so I think the reduction in CapEx or the actual -- the discipline around CapEx goes a long way to support balancing of the market. Now when does it balance? I think it's more balanced later in the year certainly than it is today. So I think that's all supported. Angeline Sedita : Okay. And then as a -- unrelated comment, but a follow-up. The reorganization in the U.S land can you give us more color there? Is there a cost savings opportunity for the reorganization or is this more operational changes? Jeff Miller : Look there's always cost associated with reorganization, but let me focus on making us more efficient and more nimble. So couple of years ago we took a fair amount of cost out, but most of that cost came in the form of an organization that would operate more efficiently and more quickly and it's really what we're doing here. This is not targeted at frontline by any means. What this is more around how do we brighten the lines and more quickly operate, make decisions and go to market. Now efficiency or lower cost is useful in any market in terms of driving performance, but that's not the intent. Angeline Sedita : Right. Great. Thanks. I'll turn it over. Jeff Miller : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from James West of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. James West : Hey, good morning, guys. Jeff Miller : Good morning, James. Lance Loeffler : Good morning, James. James West : So, Jeff and Lance, on North America real quick, I think this is pretty easy to respond to, but one, are you stacking fleets now, if you can't get the appropriate return? And two, are you starting to see a push towards maybe a rebundling, meaning that as the operators have debundled previously when they were spending as much they could, now that their budgets are -- have shrunk in size, perhaps the rebundling, the reorganization, the better collaboration part of the business should start to unfold. I\u2019m curious on both of those topics. Jeff Miller : Yes. Thanks, James. On the first topic, we did stack equipment in the first quarter and I'm not going to go any further than that, but as we look at the market and look at returns on equipment that causes to make those decisions and we will continue to manage our business around returns. The second question though was around rebundling and look I've always had a view that over time those things that make sense to come back together do. I think we are early days of that, but there is just such an elegance and efficiency around how things fit together. That doesn't mean we're not very competitive with each slice and I think we demonstrated that. But at some point once the pieces and parts have been examined you start to see, wow, it's a lot simpler to put those pieces and parts back together but to come, James, but I feel good about where we are in that process. James West : Okay. Okay, got it. And then on the international side, Jeff it sounds like you\u2019re a bit more bullish now than you were maybe a quarter ago. I guess, one, is that fair to say? And then, the second is kind of top line looks like it's going to be pretty strong this year. It has been strong, you\u2019ve been outperforming. When do you think the bottom line or the incrementals start to outpace normalized incrementals? Jeff Miller : Yes, thanks. The -- look, I think what gives me more confidence is how broad-based this recovery looks today. And so we start to see not just a green shoot here and there, but I think as I described in my commentary nearly every region I talked about in terms of some form of growth we also see are broadening base of offshore sort of activity, not maybe activity and also the tendering activity that leads to more activity as we go into 2020. From a margin standpoint, I will focus those comments on D&E, obviously. We expect stronger decrementals as we -- incrementals, excuse me, stronger incremental to clarify that. What we saw in the first quarter, James, was I mean it really was a mix of different things both mobilizations that generally get done at midyear as we move to the year, the mix of services, there's a real pricing impact from the Middle East that we saw, I mean, a lot of the tender activity that happened in '18, it all started in earnest on January 1 of this year. So we saw some of that. James West : Okay. Jeff Miller : But what\u2019s important, I think is, we expect strong incrementals in the Q2 for that business and clearly Q1 in my view is a bottom for D&E margins. James West : Got it. Okay, great. Thanks, Jeff. Thanks, Lance. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Lance Loeffler : Thanks, James. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jud Bailey of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Judson Bailey : Thank you. Good morning. Jeff Miller : Good morning, Judson. Judson Bailey : Hey, Jeff, you started off your comments by saying what a difference 90 days makes and that\u2019s probably appropriate. Could you maybe talk about how you\u2019ve seen the year progress from -- I'm sticking to North America and how maybe customer tone or conversations have changed, and to the extent visibility over the next couple of quarters, or even the back half of the year has or has not improved as the macro environment has kind of stabilized here? Jeff Miller : Well, I think the macro environment stabilizing is the key point. I mean in 90 days ago, we were coming off what was -- wasn't a clear path for commodity prices, obviously Q4 was pretty hard on everyone. So in the range of 90 days, commodity price set up. What we had thought would happen has happened in terms of customers going back to work. And as I said in my commentary, sort of each month was progressively building and that shapes our view. You know as we talk with customers, we look at the calendar, those things are all constructive as we look out to the next couple of quarters. More specifically around the second half of the year, a couple of ways we think about that, but I think importantly, is the production targets that are out there today, all of that require some level of completion activity to meet that. I also think that some part of the CapEx reduction gets captured in sort of other things, that\u2019s -- whether it's sand or service price deflation and maybe lowering rig count a bit. And I think the last question really be around, what do the smaller operators do going into the back half of the year? And I think they may be the most opportunistic, it's most important to them also just with the smaller asset base investing in completions really matters a lot to the value, not just of the asset, but likely the company. Judson Bailey : Okay. I appreciate the color there. And my follow-up is maybe for Lance. Your guidance on C&P revenues up mid single digits, my impression is that pricing is still on average a bit of a headwind as we head into the second quarter. Can you maybe give us your thoughts on how much the lag effect from the pricing weakness throughout 1Q impacts how C&P revenue growth looks in the second quarter? Just trying to balance what\u2019s the volume and what\u2019s -- what the headwind on pricing is? Lance Loeffler : Yes, I think -- thanks, Jud. I think the -- it kind of goes back to what Jeff was saying maybe an earlier comment, I think you may see some of the trickling effect to continue from the pricing side, but it's more than offset by the level of activity that we see, which is what informs our guidance, so it's really volume related with some modest impact from pricing. Judson Bailey : Okay. All right. I appreciate the color. I will turn it back. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons. Your line is now open. William Herbert : Thanks. Good morning. Jeff Miller : Hi, Bill. William Herbert : Good morning. Jeff, when you speak about the second half, is this -- and your frac calendar specifically, is this based upon specific visibility, which is populating the frac calendar or kind of a plausible expectation that completions needs to move higher even, I mean, for any number of reasons including meeting customer budgets, filling Permian pipes etcetera? So distinguish between optionality and actually tangible visibility that\u2019s unfolding. Jeff Miller : Yes, Bill, the -- we've got visibility in the calendar out a couple of quarters and so we've got a view of that and that's more specific. As we look further in the year, particularly the back half, I think there are some sign posts that we look for in terms of production targets met, not met, also around rig count with smaller operators, what that may look like. And I think that cadence also could be different in different basins, but I think we obviously have discussions with customers and I think there's -- it's quite a mixed bag in terms of outlook and how they plan to manage activity throughout the year, but we are asking those kind of questions certainly earlier than we have in the past and I feel like with our business development organization and ability to be very sharp around the edges in terms of where we\u2019re and how we perform, I feel confident in at least Halliburton's outlook for the balance of the year. William Herbert : Okay. Thank you. And then with regard to international margins, it seems like at least in the ordering the elements conspiring to weaker D&E margins in Q1 that the major issue with this was the mobilization expense associated with several different drilling projects, that\u2019s a transient issue. So I\u2019m curious as to when the mobilization -- well, first of all, how broad was the mobilization headwind in Q1 apart from the North Sea? Secondly, when does that abate? And thirdly, doesn't that represent a nice margin opportunity in the second half of the year? Lance Loeffler : Yes, Bill. This is Lance. Look, I think there's opportunity and we do expect D&E margins to improve throughout the course of the year. I think we've been pretty vocal around that. While the mobilization sure will provide that uplift, it's not to discount the pricing pressure that we continue to see in the Middle East. William Herbert : Okay. Lance Loeffler : Right. I mean -- so, as we get through the first half of this year, we expect D&E margins to be markedly improved in the second half to sort of land at flat year-over-year margins in D&E. William Herbert : Okay. So it's flat year-over-year margins for FY19 or second half versus second half? Lance Loeffler : Flat year -- FY19. William Herbert : Okay. Thank you very much, sir. Lance Loeffler : Yes. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Your line is now open. Scott Gruber : Yes, good morning. Jeff Miller : Good morning, Scott. Lance Loeffler : Good morning, Scott. Scott Gruber : Jeff, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the U.S market is likely settling into one that\u2019s less volatile, which would be good for you. It sounds like mainly a demand comment and obviously there's only so much you can control. Have you thought about ways of further reducing the volatility from your side, and how do you think about customer exposure? Does the growth of the majors presents an opportunity to tender into some contracts, which maybe stickier and longer term? Is there an ability to look at the E&Ps, given that they are settling into a spending cadence that maybe steadier? Is there an ability to go after some longer term deals with them? How do you think about overall reducing the volatility in the business? Jeff Miller : Yes, without going into like specific things that we do, I mean, what you\u2019re saying, obviously, we think about that. We\u2019ve historically -- and look we do a lot of business with IOCs, we do a lot of business with all -- all of the customers in the marketplace along different of those 14 service lines that we have. But we\u2019ve -- historically, we've optimized our frac fleet around what we view as the most efficient customers, we could drive the most margin. But I also think with the industrialization of shale sort of at scale, larger scale today, those types of things become more attractive and so we\u2019ve good relationships, we\u2019ve the ability to scale to those growth plans. And look and we plan -- plan to do so, but we're going to do it always with an eye to what are the best returns for our shareholders. Scott Gruber : Got it. And then you mentioned 20% efficiency gains in frac over the last two years, how should we think about those gains in '19 and '20? Are you seeing efficiency improvement on par is starting to slow, just some color on that trend as well would be great. Jeff Miller : Yes, I think we are seeing that. Through a degree we are reaching some sort of maximum velocity here just in terms of hours a day. If I would think back there have been some big sort of milestones in efficiency when Halliburton has been at the front edge of each of those. So the first was going from 12 to 24-hour a day operations, that was a big step. Next was more around zipper fracs as opposed to single well fracs and then multi-well pads as opposed to single well pads. All of those are sort of structural step changes. We\u2019ve done a lot at the margin around being more efficient and our focus is taking capital off location not putting more capital on location. And so we do some things to drive our capital efficiency, but the big steps, I don\u2019t necessarily see those today. What I really see over the next cycle or the next few years is more emphasis around what\u2019s happening around the well bore as opposed to on surface and you hear a lot of discussion around that. But I say that to include everything from parent child, the spacing, the velocity, the all of these other things that we believe and I believe will have more impact on productivity and efficiency over the next three, five years. Scott Gruber : If you had to put a number on the efficiency improvement this year, what would you peg it at? Jeff Miller : I don't know. Less than it's been. I would just call it 5%, 10% maybe in that range. Scott Gruber : Okay, appreciate it. Thank you. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Sean Meakim of JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Sean Meakim : Thank you. Good morning. Jeff Miller : Good morning, Sean. Lance Loeffler : Sean. Sean Meakim : So you mentioned, you've got a lot of different levers to drive cash flow depending on what the market gives you. I think a lot of your 2019 CapEx budget was committed prior to the reduction that you took end of the year. So, conceptually, if 2020 looks a lot like 2019, in other words, activity in North America is comparable, international's improving modestly, could your CapEx budget take another cut lower as some of the recent growth initiatives in Drilling & Production start to roll off? Lance Loeffler : Yes, thanks Sean. Look, I think in terms of the sort of CapEx to revenue relationship that we sit at today, I believe it was like high 6% is lower than it's been on average over the last 10 years where we've averaged closer to 10%. I think, clearly this year, we've been pretty vocal about what buckets we're out spending as a part of that $1.6 billion of CapEx. I don't know that that -- to me, it feels like in and around 7% today, feels like a good number even for next year. Now the slices of that pie, right, as we go -- as we think about how we invest may change, but I think the rate of CapEx spend as we reinvest in the business feels pretty good. Jeff Miller : Well, maybe just step in there too. I mean when we think about the outlook. I mean, we are focused on what I would call returns focused growth. And so if we think about where we are spending this year, we are continuing to invest in strategic initiatives and we are building out sort of our Sperry iCruise fleet and investing in international growth. So we are doing all of that today, sort of in and round where we and sort of the 7% -- 6%, 7% of revenues today. So it feels sustainable to me and I don't see this as a shift in our approach. I mean in this market, that level of spend is appropriate to generate returns. Sean Meakim : Got it. Thank you for that feedback. And just one point of clarification, when you highlighted pricing pressure in the Middle East, is it -- were you considering this to be incremental pressure from customers, or is this really just a rolling through of contracts that were won last year? Jeff Miller : Well, it's -- principally, what we see in this quarter is the rolling over or the establishment beginning of contracts at lower prices. It doesn't necessarily mean that it's abated. But it is certainly that's what we are seeing now, somewhere in the -- as we look ahead, we will work on how to optimize things and perform more profitably over time. Sean Meakim : And so, would you say that -- would you characterize the magnitude of the decline due to the mobilization and that pricing basically in line with what you would've expected for the quarter? Jeff Miller : Yes, that's -- no that's what we\u2019ve generally thought we'd see and we also saw a number of things that I described in my comments with mobilization, that pricing, also weather in the North Sea was pretty tough this quarter more so than probably we'd have expected. So those sorts of things. Sean Meakim : Very good. Okay, thank you. Lance Loeffler : Thanks, Sean. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Jeff Miller : Chase, are you there? Operator : Please check your mute button. And our next question comes from Kurt Hallead of RBC. Your line is now open. Kurt Hallead : Hey, good morning, everybody. Jeff Miller : Good morning, Kurt. Kurt Hallead : Hey, I just had a follow-up question here. When you guys are talking about the overall spending activity -- spending levels for the U.S being down 6% to 10% and for international kind of be up high single digits, when we look at say Completion and Production and we look at Drilling and Evaluation, would it be safe to assume that in aggregate Completion and Production would be up, like you say completion activity be up, so I would imagine that overall C&P revenues to be up on a year-on-year basis, maybe in that high single-digit range, and think adversely on Drilling and Evaluation with the drilling activity being down in the U.S., that kind of offsetting growth internationally. So I just wanted to try to get a general sense, so C&P up kind of on a year-on-year revenue and D&E maybe kind of flattish. Is that kind of a safe way to think about it right now? Lance Loeffler : The way that I would think about it, Kurt, is that -- I mean and we've mentioned this I think in some of our prepared remarks was that we expect our completions activity to be sort of flat year-over-year, right? Even though spend is down in North America, that takes the form of lower sand pricing or lower drilling expenditures versus the actual completions activity. And then as we think about D&E, particularly driven by the international markets, we see a broad recovery, pockets of pricing improvement, but also weighed down by pretty competitive Middle East today. So it's a balance of all of that. Kurt Hallead : Got it. I appreciate that, Lance. And then, Jeff, maybe follow-up for you. I know you've had a very continuous focus on returns and that being the key mantra, one of the key mantras for the company. I was wondering if you could give us some perspectives on how you think about return thresholds and when you think about it in the context, is it -- when you think about our through cycle, is that a 3-year period, 5-year period, 10-year period, kind of some general insights on that dynamic would be helpful. Jeff Miller : Look, when I think about returns, broadly, I think the -- I think about sustained growth over a period of time and I also believe that the value for growth at any cost is over and so when we will talk about returns focused growth, that\u2019s the right kind of growth. And look, I feel great about Halliburton in this kind of paradigm. I mean, we've always been returns focused, clearly it starts with margins, so improving pricing and managing costs, we are always managing costs in that environment. And then I think disciplined investing, I think that maybe informs more of what you're asking, but we make capital scarce when we need to make capital scarce and we are also and might be investing in the right businesses. So if we think about lift and chemicals and where we've put our CapEx, we will do that very thoughtfully and certainly focused on returns. Kurt Hallead : Okay. That's helpful. And maybe one follow-up just on the attrition comment, Jeff, you referenced earlier that 7.5 million horsepower will need to be rebuilt in '19 and you wouldn't think the spending level required to rebuild that equipment would happen. So in the context of attrition then, how much horsepower do you think could shake out of the market this year? Lance Loeffler : Kurt, this is Lance. I think it's tough to call -- hard to really put a number on it, right? I mean, I think attrition has always been a tough one to try to define in the pressure pumping industry. But one that we know it's happening because we see what it's -- how it's working on our fleet, right and we talked about some of the stats that we had in our prepared remarks, you can't ignore it. And today we know that there's under-investment. We know that there's more pressure than ever on all of the fleet in North America around wear and tear and therefore the repair and maintenance costs associated with it and the burden that a lot of our space has had to shoulder it, I think, look, at the end of the day, there's going to be some that are just going to flat out, be retired. Kurt Hallead : Got it. Right. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much. Lance Loeffler : Thanks, Kurt. Jeff Miller : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Boyd of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Dan Boyd : Hey, thanks, guys. Jeff Miller : Hi, Dan. Dan Boyd : One of the follow-up on the international outlook, you put up a 11% growth in the first quarter, the guide for the second quarter sounds like about 10% first half growth year-on-year and presumably the mobilization costs you are calling out suggests continued growth in the back half. So just wondering what keeps you with a little bit more of a conservative high single-digit revenue number for the year? Jeff Miller : Look, we want to be very realistic about what we see unfolding in the market. I think the -- a lot of the tender activity that we see today is probably not going to begin until 2020 and so we see activity building, but we are also going to be -- I\u2019ve talked about returns focused growth. And that\u2019s part of that discussion is making sure that we are investing and pursuing the right things. And look, we are really encouraged. In fact, I think what we will see is growth as I described in '19 and then certainly building into 2020 as sort of that broad based sort of offshore activity starts as opposed to being tendered and talked about. So encouraged, but again, we are going to manage our business. Dan Boyd : Yes, just being conservative. Lance, I wanted to follow-up on Bill's question on the D&E margins. So, in order to keep them flat year-on-year it sounds like we need to exit the year in the fourth quarter low double digits. And so just wondering as you look past mobilization cost that you are incurring, is that a number that you sort of see without pricing and without big contract wins from here on out, but basically is how de-risked is that low double-digit margin? Lance Loeffler : Well, look, I mean we are going to have to work towards it, no doubt. But I think the tailwind that you get as you begin to put revenues across the costs that we\u2019ve been running and around the actions that we are taking in the North Sea and those mobilizations, I also think that we expect to start to see some benefit as we get more Sperry tools in the market. I think we told you that a third of the Sperry fleet will be iCruise by the end of the year, we are working hard to get those tools out, that\u2019s part of the working capital build that you saw on the inventory side that I mentioned in my commentary around the international strategic investments and so those are the things that give me confidence that we can continue to build on what we need to get to those commitments. Dan Boyd : All right. Thank you. Lance Loeffler : Thanks, Dan. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Marc Bianchi of Cowen. Your line is now open. Marc Bianchi : Hi. Thank you. First question just back to the pricing discussion for North America, Jeff, you noted the 14 product service lines that Halliburton offers. Is there any distinction among those lines in terms of where pricing is bottoming, specifically everybody is focused on frac, but as you mentioned you are a big player in cementing, there's been some concern about cementing competition. Just curious if there's any distinction you could offer on those product lines? Jeff Miller : Yes, I\u2019m going to -- it's a very competitive space in North America so I\u2019m not going to get any more detailed around pricing and where the other service lines are. Clearly, hydraulic fracturing is probably the biggest piece of sort of the North America landscape today and it probably is the most over supplied, so I will leave it at that. Marc Bianchi : Okay. Thanks for that. And then, Lance, in terms of the outlook for free cash flow growth for the year, big working capital consumption here in the first quarter, which is seasonal. Would you anticipate working capital for the year to be a neutral, a positive, or negative? Lance Loeffler : Well, I think we are going to see a lot of benefit as we sort of work through the DSOs that we\u2019ve built up in the first quarter of the year, I think we will continue to work down a lot of the inventory that we built up, I would suspect that -- the working capital does release cash some point throughout the year. Marc Bianchi : Okay, super. Thanks so much. Jeff Miller : Thanks, Marc. Lance Loeffler : Thanks, Marc. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks. Jeff Miller : Yes. Thank you, Candice. Before we wrap up the call, I would just like to highlight a few points. First, I\u2019m excited about the broad-based international recovery that we see unfolding and Halliburton is well positioned to take advantage of this growth. Second, I believe that demand for North America completions will be up modestly over the next few quarters and that capacity will tighten over the balance of the year. Finally, our focus on capital discipline, capacity tightening, and cost management will deliver leading returns and free cash flow in excess of last year. Look, I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Candice, please close out the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Later, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator instructions] And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Abu Zeya, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Abu Zeya : Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton second quarter 2019 conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President, and CEO; and Lance Loeffler, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2018; Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31st, 2019; recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of impairments and other charges. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our second quarter press release and can be found in the Quarterly Results section of our website. After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow time for others who may be in the queue. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you, Abu. Good morning everyone. Commodity markets navigated some choppy waters during the second quarter. On the one hand, there are global oil demand concerns largely attributed to the uncertainties surrounding the outcome of the U.S.-China trade talks. On the other hand, oil prices have recently been buoyed by supply side reaction to the extension of OPEC plus production cuts, ongoing output declines in Venezuela, U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil exports, and political instability in Libya and Sudan. Against this backdrop, Halliburton's execution in the second quarter was outstanding and I am very pleased with our results. We continue to build on the growth momentum internationally and successfully managed the market dynamics in North America. Before we dive into the details, here are a few highlights for the second quarter. Total company revenue was $5.9 billion and adjusted operating income was $550 million, representing increases of 3% and 29% respectively compared to the first quarter of 2019. Our Completion and Production division grew revenue 4% and operating income 28% sequentially. Improved completion activity in North America land and our solid execution globally resulted in delivering better-than-expected margins. Our Drilling and Evaluation division grew operating income 18% quarter-over-quarter with strong improvements coming from our Sperry Drilling and Wireline and Perforating product service lines. Overall, D&E division incremental margin was 44%. North America demonstrated solid performance this quarter, delivering 2% revenue growth despite the dropping rig count. International revenue grew 6% sequentially, led by activity increases in the Eastern Hemisphere. And finally, we generated approximately $450 million in operating cash flow as well as positive free cash flow in the second quarter. Now, I'd like to provide some regional commentary beginning with the international markets. I'm excited by what I see internationally, a continued broad-based recovery across multiple geographies, primarily driven by land and shallow water operations. Our business in the North Sea is extremely busy both in the Norwegian and U.K. sectors. We have significantly increased our market share there by winning large tenders. Currently, we're sold out of drilling and wireline tools in the North Sea. As activity keeps ramping up, especially with independent operators taking over IOC assets in the U.K., supply and demand balances significantly tightened for tools and I expect that incremental work will come with better pricing. We see similar dynamics in the Asia-Pacific markets. Malaysia, Australia, and India are all showing strong activity growth. Increased activity leads to better pricing dynamics and we're already seeing the leading edge of pricing improvement in those markets. For instance, tightness in the supply of open hole wireline tools has allowed us to raise prices in certain markets. As to the broader offshore market, we've seen enough signs to anticipate future growth. In June, the year-over-year change in offshore rig count was up for the 12th consecutive month and appears to be gaining momentum. However, the majority of large offshore projects being sanctioned or awarded today have a 2020 or 2021 start date. For example this month we announced an integrated offshore drilling services contract win with Kuwait Oil Company. This is the first offshore project in Kuwait since the 1980s and it includes six high-pressure, high-temperature exploration wells on two jack-up rigs in the Arabian Gulf. Starting next summer, Halliburton will provide well construction services, well testing, coring, coil tubing, and the majority of offshore logistical services under this three-year contract. Halliburton entered this international recovery a much stronger competitor. Over the last decade, we've taken strategic actions that have increased the market opportunities in which we can compete. To be specific, first, we made substantial investments to grow our international footprint in the years prior to the downturn. We increased our product service line presence in various geographies expanded our manufacturing capacity in Singapore, and opened technology centers in Saudi Arabia, India, and Brazil. I cannot emphasize enough how important physical footprint is in the international markets. You simply must be present to win. Second, we made strategic investments and closed technology gaps in product lines that we believe are critical to our success in the international markets. These product lines are Sperry Drilling. I've talked to you a lot about iCruise our new rotary steerable platform. Rotary steerables are used globally for drilling both onshore and offshore wells. A competitive drilling technology is critical because it's not only a higher-margin business, it's also the cornerstone of integrated well construction services. Because of superior technical specs and the modular design of this tool, we're confident that replacing our legacy platform with iCruise will enhance our competitiveness, save on maintenance costs, and improve asset velocity. We're already running it in the U.S. as well as in Latin America, the North Sea, and the Middle East. In fact, it delivered the longest lateral and longest well in Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale in its first deployment. Another Sperry innovation introduced last year is the EarthStar ultra-deep resistivity sensor that turns on the high beams in the reservoir, so we can now see over 200 feet around the wellbore while drilling, more than double the depth of detection of other industry offerings.  This technology is critically important for offshore exploration and has been instrumental to Halliburton securing deepwater drilling contracts in Norway, Brazil, and Guyana. During the second quarter, a customer in Norway deployed EarthStar on a deepwater exploration well with a very tight drilling window, one of the most complex wells this operator ever planned. Using the data acquired by the tool, we were able to precisely land the well and to identify secondary pay zones directly impacting the well's production potential. Other product lines we've strengthened are openhole wireline and production testing. These are highly technical and differentiated businesses. Today, Halliburton successfully competes for the most advanced openhole wireline and testing projects around the globe, going head-to-head with our key competitors. All of these efforts give us a strong base to capitalize on the international recovery, and we expect to deliver high-single-digit international revenue growth this year. As I highlighted, our Drilling and Evaluation division, driven in large part by our international footprint, performed as expected in the second quarter. The catalysts for the second half D&E margin improvement are all intact, and I have confidence in our team's ability to execute. We expect to see meaningful revenue ramps in Norway and India as mobilization costs wane and execution starts in earnest. I've talked about the iCruise drilling system and the cost savings it provides to Halliburton. This and other D&E technologies that we're deploying will continue their market penetration and further improve our margin performance. Finally, end-of-year product and software sales should provide additional boost to D&E margins. As I look ahead, I'm encouraged by the leading edge pricing discussions in various international markets. Although, we cut overall CapEx we have not done so at the expense of growing our international business. Our CapEx reduction is driving the right capital allocation decisions and the right pricing and return discussions. Once the activity momentum builds internationally, it's hard to slow it down. Given the timing of contract starts and the current awards pipeline, I expect the activity growth to continue into 2020. Now turning to North America. I am pleased with how Halliburton performed in North America during the quarter. Congratulations to our North America team for a solid execution. In the second quarter we saw a modest improvement in hydraulic fracturing activity which manifested in mid single-digit increases in both completed stages and pumping hours during the quarter. While our pricing remained stable, we were able to improve margins by reducing costs and maximizing our equipment utilization. This is what I mean when I tell you that we will control what we can control and manage our business to perform well in any market conditions. It's important to note that second quarter results were not solely based on performance of our hydraulic fracturing business. In fact, other C&P and D&E product service lines made meaningful contributions to both revenue and margins in North America in the second quarter. The increasing contribution from non-hydraulic fracturing product lines is important. It demonstrates our strategy to profitably grow our share of services per well both in North America and internationally and the results are showing. Despite the average quarterly rig count in North America dropping 13% since the first quarter, our cementing product line activity remained stable and margins grew quarter-over-quarter. We're able to achieve this with no additional capital by effectively utilizing assets and increasing the number of jobs per cement unit. As well complexity and lateral lengths increase in U.S. unconventionals, creating dependable well barriers and curing mud losses has become more critical. Built on a century of technical innovation our lost circulation solutions and light cement slurry's delivered results in the most challenging conditions, differentiating Halliburton from the competition. With tailored cement designs Halliburton executed the longest laterals to date in the DJ, Permian and Marcellus basins, with each lateral over three miles long. Our wireline and perforating product line continued to generate profitable growth driven by its diverse and competitive technology portfolio and exceptional service quality. In our North America perforating business, we're quickly gaining share with the proprietary integrated gun system. Halliburton velocity modular guns can be location preassembled and not require any field wiring, which makes them a lot easier faster and safer to deploy than conventional perforating guns. With velocity guns, we're delivering more than 400 runs between misruns, a fourfold improvement in service quality and efficiency compared to conventional guns. Modular guns have seen a very fast uptake with our customers, growing to 40% of the gun shot by Halliburton in just a year from launch. Our Artificial Lift business, which consists primarily of electric submersible pumps, continued to outpace the market. It delivered a record second quarter growing both revenue and profitability. ESPs have proven to be a very valuable asset in our production portfolio, serving both the conventional and unconventional markets. Looking forward, I believe that our customers' activity cadence for the rest of the year will be dictated by their focus on remaining within their announced CapEx budgets and generating free cash flow. Some will slowdown as they've been very efficient and will scale back completion programs for the rest of the year to stay within their CapEx guidance. Others may drop rigs, but will continue working down their docks. Majors will most likely continue executing their growth plans in the U.S. shale to meet their longer term objectives.  As a result of these different customer behaviors, we expect that activity in North America will be slightly down in the third quarter. We anticipate the slowdown to be more pronounced than gassier basins due to persisting lower gas prices. Despite the near-term softness in activity, we expect our margins to remain stable next quarter. We are taking the actions that allow us to protect margins and as evidenced by our second quarter C&P performance these actions are working. As we navigate 2019 and beyond our company is executing a different playbook than in the past. Here's what we are doing to keep delivering returns and cash flows to our investors. First, we recognize the changing behavior of our customers and have changed our own approach to capital spending. In 2019, we decreased CapEx 20% year-on-year and the majority of the reduction came from North America. We have sufficient size and scale in this market and see no reason to invest in growth when it comes at the expense of returns. The capital that we do spend this year in the U.S. is mostly directed towards increasing efficiency and refurbishing equipment, both with line of sight to improving returns and cash flow. Second, we're reducing our operating costs. For example, we recently restructured our North America organization, removing several layers of management. The restructuring has changed our cost profile certainly, but it's also increased our market responsiveness. We are also partnering with our premier supply chain and logistics organization to reduce our input costs. We continue to evaluate cost reduction opportunities across the company and we will manage and right-size our North America operations for the market environment. Finally, we have stacked additional equipment throughout the quarter and will continue to do so where we do not see acceptable returns. The pressure pumping market remains oversupplied and we're not afraid to reduce our fleet size, as it contributes to righting the supply and demand imbalance. This may impact our top line in the near term, but saves labor and maintenance costs and I believe will lead to better margins. We are taking these actions while continuing to drive growth in the product service lines that we expect to most positively contribute to profit and cash flow generation in North America. In my view, as unconventionals enter a maturation phase, represented by the pivot from scarcity to abundance, technology will differentiate Halliburton and I'm excited about our prospects. Customers are required to maximize production for every CapEx dollar they spend and technology that can improve well productivity will be key to their success. These are the challenges that Halliburton solves every day. For example, our automated fracturing service optimizes sand placement per lateral foot and ensures every cluster makes a meaningful contribution to well production. Our open-hole wireline business is growing in unconventionals, as customers spend time and money evaluating their reservoirs prior to fracturing them. We see increased use of fiber optics across various basins as operators aim to evaluate stimulation performance and make changes in realtime. And I am convinced that no one is better at collaborating with customers to engineer solutions that deliver the lowest cost per barrel than Halliburton. With that, I'll turn the call over to Lance for a financial update. Lance? Lance Loeffler : Thank you, Jeff. Let's begin with an overview of our second quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2019. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.9 billion and adjusted operating income was $550 million, representing increases of 3% and 29% respectively. Now let me turn to our divisional results. In our Completion and Production division, revenue was $3.8 billion, representing an increase of $143 million or 4%. Operating income was $470 million, an increase of $102 million or 28%. These improvements were primarily driven by increased Cementing activity and completion tool sales internationally, higher artificial lift activity in North America, increased stimulation activity in North America and the Middle East/Asia and increased pipeline services in Europe/Africa/CIS. These results were offset by reduced stimulation activity in Latin America. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $2.1 billion, an increase of $50 million or 2%. Operating income was $145 million, an increase of $22 million or 18%. These improvements were primarily driven by increased wireline activity globally, improved drilling activity in North America, Latin America and Europe/Africa/CIS and higher project management activity in Middle East/Asia. Partially offsetting these increases were reduced fluids activity in Latin America and North America and lower software revenue globally. Moving on to our geographical results. In North America, revenue in the second quarter of 2019 was $3.3 billion, a 2% increase. Improvements were primarily driven by higher stimulation artificial lift and wireline activity in North America land and higher drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico. These results were partially offset by a lower software revenue across the region and reduced fluids activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Latin America revenue was $571 million, a 3% decrease sequentially, resulting primarily from lower software revenue and reduced fluids activity throughout the region, as well as reduced stimulation activity in Argentina. These reductions were partially offset by increased drilling and wireline in activity in Mexico and higher Cementing activity and completion tool sales in Argentina. Even though activity was slightly lower in Latin America this quarter, we expected to step up in the second half of the year, with a ramp up in Argentina, Guyana and Colombia. Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS. Revenue was $823 million, a 10% increase sequentially, primarily driven by higher activity across multiple product service lines in the North Sea and increased well construction services in Russia, partially offset by reduced software revenue throughout the region. In Middle East/Asia revenue was $1.2 billion, a 7% increase sequentially, largely resulting from higher completion tool sales and increased pressure pumping, wireline and project management activity throughout the region, coupled with improved drilling activity in Asia. These results were partially offset by lower drilling activity in the Middle East. In the second quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $65 million and we expect it to remain at these levels for the third quarter. During the second quarter, we recognized a pre-tax charge of $247 million, consisting primarily of asset impairments and severance costs. As Jeff discussed earlier, we continue to adjust our cost structure and footprint to the current operating environment in North America. Net interest expense for the quarter was $144 million and we expect it to remain approximately the same for the next reporting period. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 23%. Going forward, we anticipate our third quarter and 2019 full year effective tax rate to be 22% based on our expected earnings mix. We generated approximately $450 million of cash from operations during this quarter. We made progress in collecting our receivables while our inventory slightly increased related to our strategic technology deployments. We expect inventory to be consumed through the rest of the year and I see second quarter as a step in the right direction as we generated positive free cash flow. We will continue to target working capital as a key focus for the organization. On a full year basis, we believe, working capital levels will be essentially flat with 2018. And for the full year, we still expect to generate free cash flow at or above 2018 levels. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $408 million and our 2019 full year CapEx guidance remains unchanged. While our CapEx of $1.6 billion this year is similar to our DD&A level, we anticipate capital spend in 2020 to be significantly less than that. This level of spend will still allow us to capitalize on the international growth while being responsive to the market conditions in North America. At Halliburton, CapEx is at the core of our strategy execution. Our capital allocation behavior drives the right returns discussions both internally and with our customers and this is consistent with our focus on generating strong cash flow for our investors regardless of the market environment. Finally, we continue our focus on delivering shareholder returns. During the second quarter we returned approximately $260 million to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. Now, turning to our near-term operational outlook. Let me provide you with some comments on how we believe the third quarter is shaping up. For our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect activity increases in the North Sea and Asia to be offset by lower activity in Africa and North America. All-in, we expect sequential revenue to be up low single digits with margins increasing 125 to 175 basis points as we see the impact of the catalyst for D&E margin improvement that Jeff described earlier. At our Completion and Production division, lower activity in North America will be offset by higher activity internationally and the impact of our cost reduction efforts. As a result, we believe that sequential revenue will be down low single digits with margins expected to remain essentially flat. Now I'll turn the call back over to Jeff for the closing comments. Jeff? Jeff Miller : Thanks, Lance. To summarize our discussion today, momentum is building internationally and activity improvement should continue into 2020. Leading edge pricing is trending upward as equipment supply and demand balance tightens in various geographies. Halliburton has the footprint and the expanded technology portfolio to capitalize on this international growth. We recognize the changing behavior of our North American customers and are executing a new playbook to keep generating returns and free cash flow. Halliburton is taking the right actions to be successful in this market. We have cut overall CapEx in 2019 and plan to do so in 2020 as well. This is driving the right capital allocation decisions and pricing and returns discussions. We are reducing our operating costs. We have restructured our North American organization and are also partnering with our premier supply chain and logistics organization to reduce our input costs. We have stacked additional equipment throughout the quarter and will continue to do so with a focus on returns. We are strategically growing our share of services per well by increasing the competitiveness of our non-hydraulic fracturing product service lines. And finally, we're developing technologies that will improve well productivity, a requirement of a mature unconventional market. We remain focused on delivering consistent execution, generating superior financial performance and providing industry leading shareholder returns. And now let's open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. James, your line is open. Please check your mute button. Jeff Miller : James, you there? Operator : Our next question comes from Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Angie Sedita : Thanks. Good Morning, guys. Jeff Miller : Good morning, Angie. Angie Sedita : So I thought I was interested in your comments. Let's start on the international side for a change and the momentum you're seeing going into even 2020. Maybe you can give us a little incremental color on the degree of momentum we could see next year. Could we see similar growth levels for revenue in the international markets as you did in 2018? And then on the pricing side, do you expect it to continue to be region-specific or could it become more widespread? Jeff Miller : Yeah. Thanks, Angie. International doesn\u2019t move as fast as for example North America. So, when we see a trajectory, it tends to stay on that trajectory. And I'm encouraged by 2020 because of the number of FIDs and types of things that we're seeing today that really don't get started until 2020. So the Kuwait, for example, doesn't really begin until the middle of next year though it was won now. And so, the FIDs that we're seeing now, give me confidence about the trajectory for 2020. You're early to call growth rates for next year. But yeah, I think you meant 2019 when I see a similar kind of growth trajectory 2019 that carried over into 2020. And yeah that seems reasonable to me. Angie Sedita : Okay. Okay, helpful. And then on the North America land market, some -- first kudos for being proactive on stacking equipment in this market versus flighting for share. You commented that you're seeing pricing as stable, and one of your peers said they are seeing some pricing softness. So maybe you could talk a little bit about pricing and then the degree of drop off that we could see in Q3 and even into Q4 as far as activity? Jeff Miller : Yeah, Angie let me start with pricing. I mean from our perspective it was stable for us through Q2. That doesn't mean there isn't occasionally something that we see in terms of pricing behavior by a competitor. But on balance, very stable. As we look at the balance of the year certainly from an activity standpoint, I've said it would be down slightly in Q3. Obviously, Q4 always comes with weather seasonality all of that, I suspect given budgets that we would see more step down as well around that. But I think what's really important here is as you described it the way we're approaching the market, I mean our playbook is different. We're very sharp around taking costs out where we see it needs to come out. We've demonstrated that we do stack equipment, will stack equipment and are just dead focused on returns and margins. And so that's kind of the way we see the second half of the year. Obviously customer spend through Q2, we don't know that yet. But when we do know that, I think that will also be instructive on the second half of the year. We talk to our customers, so we know what they're thinking, but the fact is we need to look at where those budgets come out in Q2. And I guess just one follow-up on international pricing you'd ask that question Angie. We're seeing international pricing. It is getting traction. It's getting traction around tool shortages and demand in certainly the North Sea. We've seen it in a few other markets as well. And I think that's part of what we see from our standpoint anyway that the capital discipline that we're driving is driving the right conversations with customers, and quite frankly the right choices by us. Angie Sedita : Great. Thanks. I'll turn it over. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Sean Meakim : Thanks. Hi, good morning. Jeff Miller : Good morning, Sean. Sean Meakim : So Jeff, you mentioned that you're working from a different playbook, given this is a different cycle and I certainly agree with that approach. And it seems like your thinking is evolving in terms of how you're looking at CapEx next year. Could you maybe just walk us through a little bit of flex points? I know it's still a bit early in the year, but how you're thinking about some of the flex around putting that budget together. I think one of the most common questions investors are wrestling with now is, for Halliburton, with the largest legacy frac fleet, how electric frac may or may not factor into those thoughts into next year? Could you help, maybe frame that out for us a little bit? Jeff Miller : Yes. Thanks, Sean. I mean, we're in the early planning around CapEx for 2020. Clearly, we're in the early planning stages. But I wouldn't have highlighted if it wasn't going to be meaningful. So, just to kind of discuss CapEx 2020, we believe firmly that we don't sacrifice growth and opportunities internationally, and we still have room to grow in North America if customer budgets support that, important, the kind of behavior and decisions that capital scarcity is driving, and we will then continue that into 2020. With respect to electric fleets, this is -- this is something we also we know a lot about and we've been testing those and had a fleet in the field for some time now. So, this isn't new to us. But it's also -- we're going to be thoughtful about where and how we deploy capital. So, as we look at that particular space, that's -- the market is over-supplied. And so, when we get to the end of every year, when we think about CapEx, some part of the fleet rolls off every year and we look at that. And at that point, we're presented with choices and this is around replacement. Do we replace that asset with a quiet fleet or a dual fuel fleet or in this case could be an electric fleet? So, I mean, I see that lift from our standpoint as an evolution, but we don't see customers willing to pay more for that today. So that's kind of how we frame electric right now. Sean Meakim : I appreciate that. Thank you for that feedback. And then Lance, I mean, can we talk a little bit more about working capital? You mentioned the inventory build in the first half of the year and your expectation that that will convert to a source of cash in the back half. How would you characterize collections across the different operator types at this stage? Are we in a fairly normalized environment or there's still some challenges here? How would you frame out that impact as we look at the back half of 2019? Lance Loeffler : Yes. Sean thanks for the question. So, look over the last two years, we've generated over $1 billion of free cash flow and I expect that that trend continues in 2019. Now we've got work to do in the second half of the year, but the path to that free cash flow generation first starts with sort of margin improvement in 2H, particularly with our D&E business, right? But it also includes making progress on collection. We saw DSO improvement from Q1 to Q2 and I suspect that that will continue throughout the course of the second half of the year. In terms of inventory that you mentioned, it is true. We've invested a considerable amount in inventory in the first half of the year as we continue to deploy iCruise and our Sperry technology deployment as well as I expect us to burn that down in the second half of the year in addition to the normal traditional completion tool delivery that we expect in the back half of the year. So, I think both of those will be momentum adding to our free cash flow. Now, I'd also point out too, our rate of spend in CapEx was heavier in the first half of the year which is not unusual. We reiterated our guidance around the $1.6 billion of spend in this year. So it will have a slower rate of spend in the second half as well. Sean Meakim : Got it. Thank you for all the details. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. James West : Hey, good morning, guys. Jeff Miller : Hi James. James West : So you can hear me now, right? Jeff Miller : Yes. We can hear you. James West : Okay. Good. All right, good. Sorry about that. That was a phone issue today. So my first question Jeff, international here we're starting to see some acceleration. As you look out into 2020 likely to see volumes at or maybe even above kind of current growth levels, plus you're going to get some offshore, plus you got some pricing. Could we be in a scenario where we start to dip into the kind of double-digit type of growth internationally in 2020? Jeff Miller : Yes. I mean James, I'm not ready to call 2020 at this point, but there's no reason not to believe that's possible. I think, the thing we're going to stay dead focused on though going into 2020 are going to be margins and we want profitable growth. And I think, we demonstrated with where we are we can grow and we've grown quite a bit internationally. But we're going to again keep a sharp eye on margins as that market unfolds. James West : Okay. Good. Fair enough. And pricing obviously is a big part of that margin profile. What's the level -- when you're having these conversations, I know you're on the road a lot in the international markets, what's the level of push back on pricing, or is the market now understanding hey, we're tight. Equipment's tight and you need to generate adequate return? Jeff Miller : Well it's a mixed bag. I mean I would say that our state customers look at that scenario and realize that service pricing isn't adequate and returns aren't adequate and need the work done well and we have a lot more success with those customers and that's a bigger group of customer. It gets to be a bigger group of customer all of the time. It also helps when we say or demonstrate that tools are sold out and we can do that by making choices and so that also helps.  Our service quality that Halliburton has is a level quite frankly I've never seen it before. And so what we have to offer is a fantastic product and so we're very comfortable talking about pricing today. James West : Got it. Thanks Jeff. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citi. Scott Gruber : Yes, good morning. Jeff Miller : Good morning Scott. Scott Gruber : So I wanted to come back to e-frac. I realize it's early days for the technology, but assuming that a strong demand pull does materialize for the technology, would you look at e-frac capacity at a rate that approximates your share in the market relative to the industry build-out? Would you look to invest more slowly to enhance free cash flow even at the risk of seeing your share within e-frac that it's smaller than your current share? How do you think about balancing e-frac share with free cash flow and is that an important factor for you? Jeff Miller : Look returns are first and foremost for us. And so we looked at all of this in terms of returns. From a share perspective, the pace that I'm describing actually is perfectly adequate if we're happy with the returns and the technology deployment to keep up with where we are in the market. That's just sort of a normal replacement schedule that we're already on. It's just how we make those choices around what we replace. From our perspective it's going to have to be a more efficient lower capital endeavor or somehow make better returns than what's out there today or it doesn't proliferate. That's not saying we don't participate, but what I'm saying is I want to make certain that the Halliburton approach around really power and pumps, we love the pumps that we have together are making a return. And at least where we see it today it's not a -- it's more capital for the same or less returns so that's not really where we want to be. Scott Gruber : Got you. And then just turning to D&E. Lance based on the guidance that you provided it does look like a more material ramp in revenue and margin that's required in 4Q to achieve the flattish year-on-year. Something like almost maybe over 100% incrementals. Not sure if that's possible. I'm just trying to play around with some numbers and using mid-single-digit growth. But that rate it looks like the incrementals would have to be quite large. How are you thinking about 4Q shaping up from a revenue and incremental perspective if the elements are still there for flattish margins on the year-over-year basis? Lance Loeffler : Look I think we'll see -- we'll continue to see continued momentum in terms of the activity that we're doing in places like the North Sea and India. We're also going to have in the fourth quarter we've got visibility this year just given the strength of the international recovery more than we've had in prior -- in the last several years around software sales that will also be a tailwind to that. But I think to come back to it, look D&E produced 44% I believe incrementals just 1Q to 2Q. I think that clearly the international recovery helps that business and what we've been talking about. But what we're trying to describe right in terms of the tale of two halves is a business that, while it was weighed down by certain things or from certain timing perspectives as we continue to deploy our new Sperry technology is that you're going to see a market difference in the two halves of the year. And I think that's the message that we're trying to communicate to The Street. Scott Gruber : Got it. Appreciate the color. Lance Loeffler : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons. Your line is open. Bill Herbert : Thanks good morning. Lance just sticking with D&E for a second here. So get the fact. I mean you've been consistently persuasive with regard to the difference between first half and second half in terms of what drives D&E margins. But just trying to get -- is the -- to reiterate the question, is the conviction relatively high and we're going to be in the neighborhood of flat margins year-over-year for D&E second half which implies kind of 13% to 14% margins in Q4? Sorry to beat a dead horse here. Lance Loeffler : Yes. Look I think Bill, I said on the prior call that we'd be sort of flattish or in the ballpark. I think look, there's a lot of stuff that we've got to go out and execute but the tailwinds behind what we have looking forward for D&E for the second half of the year paint a very different picture in terms of margin profile than they did in the first half. Jeff Miller : That means, Bill the mobilizations we clearly see those and those are finishing, finishing now. Sperry technology implementation certainly helps. There are other D&E technologies that we're rolling out. They're equally helpful. I talked about some of them on the call velocity guns other things ramping. And then the visibility around not just software but year-end product sales is better than it's been in the past. And so, I think we're confident around -- the catalysts are intact. We can't prescribe the cadence necessarily, but certainly second half ramps up. Bill Herbert : No, right. Thank you. And again I get the conceptual build influx. I'm just trying to get to a specific number within reason, but I hear you. Second question for me kind of multifaceted, first, if you could rank the C&P margin improvement, contribution quarter-on-quarter. And what I'm trying to get as is to what extent did product sales drive the margin improvement? And then also what percentage of your frac fleet is stacked now? Thank you. Jeff Miller : I'll sort of start with sort of your question around sort of the allocation on C&P margins. But I think look -- Completion Tools had a great, great quarter. But I think the majority of what we're doing in terms of making sure that we're managing costs in North America is reflected in some of the C&P performance as well. I mean, we're being decisive or moving quickly and we're seeing the results and I think that's what's important. Bill Herbert : Okay. And with regard to the percentage of your fleet that's stacked? Jeff Miller : Yeah. Bill, I mean, we're not going into competitive specifics. I think you're in the market so you have a sense of what that is. I think the point is that we are continuing to stack equipment when it doesn't make sense. And I think that will come with slightly lower revenues, but certainly higher margins. Bill Herbert : Okay. Thank you, sir. Jeff Miller : Thanks, Bill. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Chase Mulvehill : Hey, good morning. So, I guess, I wanted to talk a little bit about the preassembled perf gun solution that you mentioned earlier on the call. Could you talk about the solution that you have and maybe compare it to some of the market leaders out there? And then maybe just kind of talk about how this impacts the integrated frac solution that you're trying to push out into the market? Jeff Miller : Yeah. So this is very competitive tool. In fact, we're fortunate, because we've got a solid manufacturing business in Alvarado, Texas where we've been building and making charges for years. So as velocity guns go into the market highly effective. We have the ability to tailor those as required for different configurations, which is a benefit certainly to us. And it's also part of bringing down in my view the overall, I'd just say cost. This is the effectiveness around integrated wireline in North America. So we can change actually the way that we work to get to a lower cost and better performance, which is different than just having two things sitting out there together. It changes the -- not just the number of people, but who is doing what allows us -- the velocity guns allow us to change the certainly the technical content on-location reduces the number of misruns or misfires. And I'm really excited about the volume. I mean, we described it as 40% of the goal gun shot by Halliburton, which is a lot of guns. But we see actually the potential to continue to drive unit cost of those guns down as the volume continues to grow. So that -- it's one of the things that just gets more competitive over time. Chase Mulvehill : Okay. All right. That makes sense. Appreciate the color. And then coming back to Sperry a little bit, I mean, obviously you guys have been investing a lot in Sperry. Could you talk about when we think about Sperry and potentially leveraging and working closer with land rig companies and the opportunity to kind of have a better penetration to some of your kind of leading edge Sperry technology? Jeff Miller : Look, those are all things we look at. I think the really the rotary steerables and motors are very different animals in the marketplace. What we're doing in rotary steerables is really exciting for many. I mean, this is a fantastic piece of kit, and it's very integrated into sort of data and real-time and not just real-time, but automation, so, really excited about that. I've always been clear that we didn't want to be aligned with just one, for example, contractor. I believe that if you look at North America, it's an open architecture market, and there is a lot of choice that can be exercised by customers. So, we've always been really careful to make sure of what we put in the market is functional with lots of providers. And so that's sort of a one thing certainly around the rotary steerables. In the motor, I talked last quarter about our Motors Center of Excellence. And I'm really excited about that, because it allows us now to customize solutions for our clients around motor performance. So there is a lot of variability in terms of the rock and performance of motors. And having that in-house allows us not only to do the customization, but also retain the learning and bake that into a very efficient sort of turnaround in 24-hour type business. So that's something that how we align it with operator is interesting, but the way I think more about it is, how does it from a value proposition standpoint work best for us and I think we've got it there now. Chase Mulvehill : All right. I appreciate the color. Very helpful. Thanks Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC. Your line is open. Kurt Hallead : Hey, good morning. Jeff Miller : Good morning, Kurt. Lance Loeffler : Good morning, Kurt. Kurt Hallead : Hey. So I have first question. I appreciate the color in the context of you guys stacking equipment and being capital disciplined on as it relates to U.S. frac-related businesses. Wondering if you guys can give us some sense on what the attrition dynamics might be, whether that's industry or as you look at your own frac fleet? How are you thinking about stacking equipment versus let's just say retiring equipment? Jeff Miller : Yeah. I think the -- we're always managing the fleet, I guess, is the way I would say that. And there's clearly always -- when we have a big fleet it gives us the ability to retire, replenish, repair, and in my view replace and so we take all of that together. Some equipment that stack is ready to go back. Some equipment that comes out of the system is actually the equipment I was describing that is being retired where we have choice around how we replace that equipment and at what pace. So, I think the -- we're really careful with the fleet that way. There's no question that equipment is working harder and attrition is occurring in the marketplace. We don't see capital spend going up. We just don't see new equipment coming into the market and we know how hard it's working. So, all of that conspires to drive attrition. As I've always said it's hard to see the pace of attrition until there's a call on the equipment. I suspect there will be at some point, but I do know that the physics of pumping fluid and sand through steel is having its effect on broadly the fleet in North America, all fleets in North America. Kurt Hallead : Yeah. That's great color. Appreciate that, Jeff. And then maybe for Lance. You gave some really good additional color on the D&E margin dynamics for the rest of the year. I was wondering if you'd maybe give us some insights as well on Completion and Production. And typically when you see a revenue decline in a certain business segment the margins would decline along with it. You guys have given specific data points here that suggest that even though revenues are going to decline for C&P in the third quarter margins are going to kind of hold flat. Do you think they have that kind of internal business momentum where your cost structure is down, your efficiencies are at such a level that even if C&P were to decline again in the fourth quarter you can -- your margins could be stable? Lance Loeffler : Yeah. I mean that's a good question, Kurt. Look I think, obviously, we've got one quarter out so I'll save any of the specificity for next quarter's call in the fourth quarter. But I mean that's the intent. That's what we're working towards right? I mean that's what we talk about in terms of continuing to manage cost in North America and controlling what we can control. But we'll give a better view when we get to the third quarter call on what fourth quarter looks like for C&P. Kurt Hallead : Okay. That\u2019s great. Nice, really appreciate the color. Thank you. Lance Loeffler : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is open. David Anderson : Hey, Jeff I was just wondering if you could maybe just dig into a little bit on the evolution of this new playbook in North America. I know you have a new head of Western Hemisphere, Mark Richard in there who is I think been putting his view in there as well. But as far as -- as long as I can remember HAL always sought market share during the downturn now you're stacking equipment. It sounds like EBITDA per fleet may be improving as well. I guess -- is that almost early confirmation of the playbook? But probably if you can just give us a little background as to how you arrived at this new playbook? Jeff Miller : Yeah. Just to cut to the chase, yes. The answer is yes. What you're seeing is that new playbook in action. But the -- what we recognize is there's a change in the customer spending patterns. And when that changes it has to -- we want to address the best returns. And so what was the right playbook several years ago when there was a different cadence and pace of customers spend today needs to change and so that's what you're seeing in action. And so we're going to be super sharp around capital into the downturn. I say the downturn but what we see is slowing activity that I described for Q3. What we want to make sure is that we are -- if it's slightly down we want to be slightly there with our CapEx. But most importantly -- not our CapEx our capital equipment. But what's most important to us is that we're not waiting on the spring back. We've demonstrated we know how to add people back to the system and equipment back when it's required, so I'm quite comfortable that reflects down when the prices go below something that is making a return for us and we'll let somebody else do that at below return cost. So I hope that's clear. But that's the way we're thinking about \u2013 that\u2019s not how we're thinking about it that's how we're executing on the new playbook. David Anderson : So in this new playbook, do you view each of your product lines and service lines separately? In other words each one of them have to basically hit certain return hurdles? How are you viewing -- because in the past we've talked about bundled models and integrated model and whatnot, but this sounds like we'll get more defining each one of our product lines has to stand on its own. Is that fair to say? Jeff Miller : Yeah, that's fair. Though I would say we like integrated work and we do a lot of that in the North Sea, we do a lot of that around the world and we're happy doing that when it's available in North America. But at the same time, yes, everything has to make a return. And part of the reorganization in North America was around cost, but equally so was around speed of decision-making and executing each of those service lines. And I'm really pleased to report with the North America spend down in the first half of the year, our non-frac revenue per rig was up 13% year-on-year. So, that's evidence of that sharp focus around all of those service lines. David Anderson : So, one of those service lines you called out is Artificial Lift and you talked about that being a driver of the higher NAM revenue. I was just wondering if you could just talk about that market in general in lift and how that compares -- how other lines product lines are trending. How is the spend and the pace of lift installations? How has that trended this year? We all know about the ESP capital that's -- what it's doing to drilling completions. But what's going on with lift? Is that still kind of holding up pretty well? Do you expect it to hold up well? Could you just provide a little color on how the market is trending. Jeff Miller : Yes. Dave I mean I feel like that's OpEx spend by clients and it's really important that they produce and support production and that means every well needs to work. And that's part of the reason we've talked about growing our production business. And I say growing and building out production because OpEx and production matters a lot to our customers. And I think that's what you're seeing in the ESP business because it's an effective way for clients to prove production. But chemicals in some ways falls along the same lines so excited about those businesses. David Anderson : Okay. Thanks Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thanks, Dave. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks. Jeff Miller : Yes. Thank you, Shannon. Before we close, I'd just like to reemphasize a couple of points. First, I'm excited about the international recovery, the growth for the balance of 2019, and the momentum that's building into 2020. In North America, we plan to execute our new playbook reducing costs, stacking fleets, and reducing CapEx that drives better margins and free cash flows for 2019 and 2020. Our focus on non-frac service lines is a terrific opportunity for Halliburton and our organization is well-positioned to deliver profitable growth. Look forward to talking to you again next quarter and Shannon, please close out the call. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining and have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Abu Zeya, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir. Abu Zeya : Good morning. And welcome to the Halliburton third quarter 2019 conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President, and CEO, and Lance Loeffler, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2018; Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30th, 2019; recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of impairments and other charges taking during the second quarter. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our third quarter press release and can also be found in the Quarterly Results & Presentation section of our website. After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow time for others who may be in the queue. Now, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey Miller : Thank you. Abu, and good morning, everyone. As the second half of 2019 unfolds, US and international markets continue to diverge. International activity growth is gaining momentum across multiple regions. Meanwhile, operators' capital discipline weighs on North American activity levels. That said, our outstanding employees executed effectively in the third quarter. We managed the market dynamics and delivered on our financial results as per expectations.  Let me cover some headlines. Total company revenue was $5.6 billion and operating income was $536 million, representing decreases of 6% and 3% respectively compared to the second quarter of 2019. Our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue was down 4% sequentially, but operating income grew 3% quarter-over-quarter. Our international D&E operating margin increased 180 basis points. Overall, D&E margin performance was negatively impacted by weaker demand for our services in North America. Our Completion and Production division revenue declined 8% sequentially, driven by lower completions activity in North America land. C&P operating margin was essentially flat compared to the second quarter, supported by strong international activity and the execution of our new playbook in North America. International revenue was flat sequentially, but is up 10% year-to-date. Lower project management and stimulation activity in the Middle East and Asia offset healthy growth in Latin America and Europe/Eurasia in the third quarter. North America revenue decreased 11% sequentially, primarily driven by customer activity declines. And finally, we generated approximately $530 million of free cash flow in the third quarter, a significant improvement over the first half of the year. In the third quarter, supply and demand uncertainties continued to impact commodity prices. On the one hand, Iran sanctions, Venezuela production declines, and political instability in Latin America and North Africa are constraining supply. On the other hand, there is near-term uncertainty in demand due to ongoing US-China trade tensions and negative economic data out of Asia and Europe. As the US production growth continues to weigh on supply, OPEC+ extended its agreement until March 2020 to manage production and support oil prices. Even with these crosscurrents, international growth continues at a steady pace. This summer, I spent a month visiting our customers in the Eastern Hemisphere, and I'm excited by what I saw, consistently improving markets across Europe, Asia, and Australia. This confirms my confidence in Halliburton delivering high-single digit international revenue growth this year. It is important to note that both of our divisions are meaningfully contributing to our international growth. Our Drilling and Evaluation division traditionally had the most exposure to international markets, with about 70% of division revenues coming from outside North America. The revenue split has generally been the opposite for our Completion and Production division. We're pleased to see the C&P division increasing its participation in the international markets in this cycle. Year-to-date, international C&P revenue has grown 13%, double the international revenue growth rate of D&E. In today's environment, customers aim to squeeze every available barrel from their existing assets. So, mature fields development is prominent. We also see increased unconventional activity in several international regions. The technology mix required for development-focused, production-oriented, and unconventional project plays to our C&P portfolio strengths. With a focus on the international mature fields market, we're growing our production group, part of the C&P division that comprises artificial lift, specialty chemicals, and well intervention solutions. Historically, Halliburton primarily participated in the drilling and completion stages of a well's lifecycle. With our expansion into production services, we're tapping into a long-term, later cycle market with significant growth potential. Our well intervention business helps operators diagnose field productivity issues and design and deliver immediate impact solutions leveraging our custom chemistries and tools.  This capability is critical for mature fields. With rig-less intervention and well surveillance activity increasing, especially in the Middle East, Europe and Asia, we've already executed multiple contract startups in 13 different countries this year. In Latin America, we've recently deployed our SPECTRUM FUSION hybrid coil tubing service for a customer in Colombia. In a single trip, with the well still producing, we provided real-time visualization of the shape and location of old perforations and performed production logging, while maintaining the ability to circulate fluid to clean the well as needed. The customer gathered valuable downhole insights without having to take the well off-production. In the last couple of years, we've had a significant uptick in unconventional activity in several Middle Eastern countries as well as in Argentina and Australia. Our production enhancement business demonstrated strong international growth year-to-date, benefiting from these developments. Halliburton leveraged our experience in US shales to provide a customized application of technology, logistics management, and operational excellence to maximize asset value for our international customers. In Argentina, Halliburton delivered the highest number of frac stages to date in the third quarter as a result of consistent execution and applying service efficiency best practices in the Vaca Muerta shale play. Our completion tools and cementing businesses also increased international revenue and margins on the back of strong activity recovery in the UK and Norway sectors of the North Sea, IOC activity expansion in Brazil and Mexico, and increased demand from Asia and the Middle East. We grew cementing services as well as installations of casing equipment and intelligent multi-lateral and core completion solutions for customers in all these markets. For example, this summer, we installed a multi-lateral completion to increase reservoir exposure and inflow control in an operator's mature field in Norway. This intelligent completion system allowed the operator to manage production from each of the four laterals without impacting production from the others in the event of a gas influx or water breakthrough. To be clear, our Drilling and Evaluation businesses are also meaningfully contributing to our international growth. As you know, Halliburton entered this international recovery a much stronger competitor due in large part to technology investments we've made in key services like drilling, LWD, open hole wireline, and testing. Recently, an operator recognized Halliburton wireline as a benchmark for service quality and execution in an ultra-deepwater exploration campaign in West Africa. Open hole wireline data collected at water depth over 10,000 feet helped the customer to confirm significant additional reserves and successfully determine fracture enclosure pressure in sand and shale formations. In the Norwegian North Sea, an operator has adopted our latest logging-while-drilling innovation, the EarthStar ultra-deep resistivity service as a standard in their exploration wells. The customer's target formation has exceedingly complex geometry, making it hard to interpret using conventional methods. The unique 3D inversion capability of the EarthStar sensor is the only LWD technology capable of reliably mapping such complex structures. Looking to 2020, I see more international topline and margin growth opportunities for Halliburton coming from mature fields and shallow water markets. Barring a global economic slowdown, a broader offshore recovery should add momentum to the international growth going forward. Offshore rig count increased 19% year-on-year and sanctioned FID volumes are up 20% compared to last year, led by Guyana, Brazil and Azerbaijan project sanctions. Recently, Woodside Energy awarded Halliburton drilling and completion services for its deepwater field development campaign in offshore Senegal. It's due for the final investment decision in December and work is planned to start in late 2020 or early 2021.  The campaign is expected to include 18 wells with up to 8 optional wells over an estimated 3 to 4 year term. Halliburton was awarded the well construction, lower completions, e-line, slick line cold tubing and well testing services. We have also announced several new offshore project wins this year in Latin America and the Middle East. Our pipeline of projects is strong and I expect Halliburton to outperform the growth in international drilling and completion spending next year. Increasing activity and improving pricing across markets, our ability to compete for a larger share of high-margin services and reallocating assets to the markets where we can earn the highest returns, I believe, will improve our international margins going forward. In North America, the market is very different. Customer spending has decreased and is largely concentrated in the first half of the year. The US land rig count declined 11% from the second to the third quarter for the first time in 10 years. And while, historically, the third quarter used to be the busiest in terms of hydraulic fracturing activity in the US, stage counts declined every month this quarter. As a result, the market for both drilling and completion services in North America softened during the third quarter, impacting service company activity, and Halliburton was no exception. Throughout the third quarter, pricing pressures continued as operators tried to lower overall costs in order to meet their cash flow objectives. We are the execution company. So, let's talk about how we are proactively executing our North America playbook with a clear purpose to generate returns and free cash flow.  This is what it looks like. We are stacking equipment. In the third quarter, we stacked more equipment than we did in the first six months of the year. While this impacts our revenues, we would rather err on the side of stacking than work for insufficient margins and wear out our equipment. We're reducing costs. You've seen us do this before. We took out $1 billion in 2016. We reorganized and reduced our fixed costs in North America earlier this year. We continue to evaluate the way we work and we'll keep reducing costs in our North American operations. We're aligning with the right customers. We are and continue to be aligned with the customer groups that are spending and that value our services. We're deploying technology that lowers our cost and accrues value to Halliburton. Take integrated well completions, for example. It is a combination of wireline and fracturing services. It is one thing to have both product lines and another thing to integrate them technically and culturally and achieve lower cost on location. It takes R&D effort to develop a host of new proprietary technologies that enable this integration. Halliburton's integrated well completions offering minimizes non-productive time, improves efficiency, reduces personnel on location and capital costs for Halliburton. This technology integration, which is hard to duplicate, improves customer efficiency, but, more importantly, it improves our margins. These actions allows us to maximize our active fleet utilization and protect our margins. Our third quarter results demonstrate that our new North America playbook is working and is the right approach for this market. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we see more of the same. We expect customer activity to decline across all basins in North America land, impacting both our drilling and completion businesses. Feedback from our customers leads us to believe that the rig count and completions activity may be lower than in the fourth quarter of last year. While holidays and potential weather impacts are the usual culprits, other drivers of this continued activity decline are our customers' free cash flow generation commitments, an oversupplied gas market and concerns about oil demand softness in 2020. Given the reduction and cadence in customer spending that we see, we plan to further change the way we deliver our services in order to improve our margins and maximize returns. In the fourth quarter, consistent with our playbook, we plan to undertake further cost reductions by streamlining our operations and corporate functions. We're still finalizing our estimates, but expect to capture approximately $300 million in annualized cost savings over the next few quarters. Importantly, regardless of the cuts and idling of equipment, the size and scale of our business in North America give us the ability to drive a sustainable model without sacrificing our leadership position. I believe that the actions we are taking will enable Halliburton to evolve and emerge stronger in the future. So, what changes the narrative for North America going forward? While the cadence of activity will likely remain the same over the near term, there are a few other key trends we're watching closely today that should play out over time and alter the market dynamics in US land. First, attrition. Given demand deceleration, the service industry has adjusted accordingly and cut capital spend this year. There were hardly any new equipment additions and maintenance spending has been severely curtailed. All the while, service intensity showed no signs of slowing down. Multiwell pad penetration continued, lateral length kept growing and proppant loading increased further.  The direct result of higher service intensity, especially in terms of hours pumped per day, is the increase in maintenance frequency. This should accelerate the long-awaited equipment attrition from the market, both voluntary through stacking and involuntary. As I said at the beginning of the year, there would be less horsepower available in the market at the end of the year than there was in January. We can now see this happening as service companies are cannibalizing stacked equipment for parts rather than paying for replacement components due to budget constraints. We expect attrition to continue into 2020. At Halliburton, our size and scale allow us to flex down with the market and generate sufficient free cash flow to keep our active fleet healthy. We benefit from in-house manufacturing, digital preventative maintenance protocols, ongoing materials R&D and automation efforts to increase equipment lifespan. These are unique competitive advantages that are hard and expensive to replicate in this market. Second, some of our customers are changing their buying behavior. They have started contracting for services and integrated packages rather than discreetly. This helps tie up multiple services, compresses the learning curve and drives cost savings and efficiencies for both us and our customers. This is similar to how the North Sea has volved over the last few years. We're currently working on integrated projects with customers in the Bakken and the Permian. The collaboration has resulted in better performance and helped secure longer-term customer commitment. Some companies are increasingly centralizing the management of their procurement activities. This should lead to supplier rationalization and concentration of a larger share of the work with a select number of high quality, safe and efficient service companies. We believe that these new customer-buying behaviors uniquely position Halliburton to get an outsized share of their spend. Finally, one more trend we are watching is the deceleration of incremental US production growth brought about by capital discipline. The record-breaking 2018 growth will not be replicated in 2019. In fact, current projections for 2020 indicate a further decline in production from the current-year estimates. To maximize production per every CapEx dollar they spend, operators will require technologies that can improve both efficiencies and well productivity. Instead of counting stages, they will want to make every stage count. For this, I believe, they will turn to Halliburton. We bring to the table technologies like automated fracturing and distributed fiber optic sensing that are tailor-made for addressing production challenges. While customers are mostly focused on price today, early studies confirm our technologies work. They are hard to replicate and will be more valuable to Halliburton over time. Also, with declining US incremental contribution to world production, non-US production will be required to fill the gap. This means more growth in international and offshore markets and more opportunities for Halliburton. As the international recovery continues and the North American market matures, our strategy will allow us to thrive in this dynamic environment. I believe that the actions I have described to you today will ensure that Halliburton continues to improve its earnings power and generate strong free cash flow and industry-leading returns in the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Lance for a financial update. Lance? Lance Loeffler : Thank you, Jeff. And good morning. Let's begin with an overview of our third quarter results compared to the second quarter of 2019.  Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.6 billion and operating income was $536 million, representing decreases of 6% and 3% respectively. North America led the decline as a result of activity and pricing headwinds.  Let me go over the details of our divisional results. In our Completion and Production division, revenue was $3.5 billion, a decrease of $299 million or 8%, while operating income was $446 million, a decrease of $24 million or 5%. These results were primarily driven by lower pressure pumping activity and pricing in North America land, coupled with decreased completion tool sales in Latin America and reduced simulation activity in the Middle East/Asia. Partially offsetting these declines were increased cementing activity in the eastern hemisphere, improved completion tool sales in Europe/Africa/CIS, and higher simulation activity in Latin America. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $2 billion, a decrease of $81 million or 4%, while operating income was $150 million, an increase of $5 million or 3%. These results were driven by reduced drilling and wireline activity in North America and lower project management activity in Middle East/Asia. These declines were partially offset by higher drilling activity in the eastern hemisphere, fluids activity in Latin America and higher testing and software sales globally, resulting in better overall margins. Moving on to our geographical results. In North America, revenue in the third quarter of 2019 was $2.9 billion, an 11% decrease, primarily associated with lower activity and pricing in pressure pumping and well construction services in North America land. In Latin America, revenue was $608 million, a 6% increase, resulting primarily from higher activity in multiple product service lines in Argentina, increased testing activity and artificial lift sales across the region, and improved fluids activity in Mexico. These improvements were partially offset by lower completion tool sales in Brazil.  Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue was $831 million, which was essentially flat with the second quarter. Higher activity across multiple product service lines in Russia, the Caspian and North Sea offset lower activity in West Africa. In the Middle East/Asia, revenue was $1.2 billion, a 4% decrease, largely resulting from reduced project management and simulation activity across the region. These declines were partially offset by increased activity in multiple product service lines in Indonesia. In the third quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $60 million. We estimate that our corporate expenses for the fourth quarter will revert to our average run rate of approximately $65 million. Our net interest expense for the quarter was $141 million and we expect it to remain approximately the same in the fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 20%, coming in slightly lower than anticipated due to certain discrete tax benefits. We expect our fourth quarter tax rate to be 23% based on the market environment and our expected geographic earnings mix. Our full-year effective tax rate should be approximately 22%. We generated $871 million of cash from operations in the third quarter. Our free cash flow generation for the quarter was approximately $530 million and we reached positive free cash flow on a year-to-date basis.  We believe further improvement in receivables and a drawdown and inventory in the fourth quarter will allow us to generate approximately $1 billion of free cash flow for the full year. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $345 million and our 2019 full-year CapEx guidance remains unchanged. We told you last quarter that our capital spend in 2020 would be significantly less than $1.6 billion.  We are carefully monitoring the market dynamics in North America and will exercise prudent judgment to make further adjustments according to the anticipated activity levels in 2020. Finally, let me provide you with some comments on our operations outlook for the fourth quarter. For our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect sequential revenue to be flat to up low single-digits, with margin improvement in the range of 425 basis points to 475 basis points. This is driven by year-end software and product sales combined with activity increases across our international markets, offset by lower demand in North America land. In our Completion and Production division, we believe our sequential revenue will be down low-double digits, with margins expected to decline 125 basis points to 175 basis points. As Jeff stated, in North America, we have continued to stack equipment that does not meet our returns threshold and we will be proactive in reducing costs. We anticipate that higher activity in Asia and the Middle East will be offset by activity declines in North America land, Latin America, and Europe and Eurasia. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff for closing comments. Jeff? Jeffrey Miller : Thanks, Lance. In summary, international growth continues at a steady pace across multiple regions, benefiting both our D&E and C&P divisions. Increased activity, pricing improvements, our ability to compete for a larger share of high-margin services and reallocation of our assets should lead to higher international margins as we look past this year. In North America, we expect activity reductions to continue into the fourth quarter. Halliburton is successfully executing our new North America playbook to maximize returns and free cash flow. We stacked additional equipment throughout the quarter and will continue managing utilization with a focus on returns. We're aligning with the right customers. We're introducing new technologies to improve margins. And we will continue to take actions that lower the overall service delivery cost. I want to close by thanking our employees for their outstanding focus and dedication to our company and our customers. Your resiliency and hard work are the foundation of our company's strength and why together we can continue delivering on our promise to our shareholders. And now, let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. James West : Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Lance. Jeffrey Miller : Good morning, James. Lance Loeffler : Good morning, James. James West : So, Jeff, obviously, [technical difficulty] third quarter. Fourth quarter, as Lance described is just going to be fairly tough. What does this mean for the exit rate and how are we going to 2020 and how the outlook there starts to shape up? Jeffrey Miller : Yeah. Thanks, James. You're a little crackly there at the beginning, but as we look at the Q4 activity, obviously, we think budget exhaustion, et cetera, starts to bring that down. I expect we'll see an uptick as we go into Q1 of 2020, and I think that's a little bit getting to that cadence of spend. So, I think that we'll be increasing activity certainly in the first half \u2013 first quarter and then really first half of 2020, and our playbook will have us ready to take advantage of that. James West : Okay, great. That's very helpful. And then, as we talk about the playbook or think about the playbook, what are you seeing from your competition? Clearly, some of these guys can't actually perform at the same levels or will not perform at the same levels, but also some may follow you on your returns-focused strategy. What have you seen so far from you showing leadership here with your willingness to walk away from the underperforming contracts or low return [ph] contracts versus your peers? Jeffrey Miller : James, we're early in that process now. And, I guess, my view is we know we are extremely competitive. We have very good margins and returns in that business relative to anyone in that marketplace. And so, when we see an opportunity where it transacts well below cost, we're pretty comfortable stepping back from that just because we don't want to burn up our equipment without making the kind of returns and cash flow that we want to make. So, to be seen, I fully expect we'll see the \u2013 we see it actually some today, the flight to quality. Our service delivery is very, very good; our safety performance is very, very good. And so, I think this unfolds as equipment just gets tighter. And I think we're well-positioned in this market. James West : Got it. Thanks, guys. Jeffrey Miller : Thank you. Lance Loeffler : Thanks, James. Operator : Our next question comes from Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Angeline Sedita : Good morning, guys. Jeffrey Miller : Good morning, Angie. Lance Loeffler : Good morning, Angie. Angeline Sedita : Good morning. So, Jeff, maybe a little bit more color on the international markets and the visibility there, I think there's some debate about the pace of growth for 2020. So, I'd love to hear what you're seeing out there and the prospects for having similar growth rates in 2020 as you did in 2019, and maybe you could also touch on the growth you saw in C&P versus D&E? Jeffrey Miller : Yeah. Thanks, Angie. Less clear on \u2013 we just don't have the visibility on 2020 at this point because it's still early. That said, I believe Halliburton outgrows the increase in drilling and completion spend, whatever that is internationally. And as I described, I think we've got a good set of contracts set up for 2020. And, technically, we're very well-positioned for 2020. And so, without trying to put a number on that today, I feel Halliburton will be very competitive in that space, anyway. Yeah. Angeline Sedita : Okay. Okay. So, maybe on your remarks on the attrition, it'd be great to hear any additional color on attrition and retirements for Halliburton and what you're hearing for the industry as a whole for even this year and next year, and how much supply you think could be pulled out of the market? Jeffrey Miller : Yeah. As I've always said, it's hard to see attrition until there's a call on the equipment, but it's pretty clear there's less equipment in the market today than there was at the beginning of the year, and that amount varies in terms of how people call it. We think it's 15% to 20% easily in the marketplace. But then, we watch equipment adds, of which there really aren't any, and we know how hard equipment is working. And so, I really believe we will continue to see that as we go into even 2020 in terms of the attrition happening. And our view of the market is we want to be super careful with our equipment. We want to work it for returns and when we don't see those returns, we want to set it to the side. Angeline Sedita : Great. Thanks. I'll turn it over. Jeffrey Miller : Thanks, Angie. Operator : Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Sean Meakim : Thank you. Good morning. Jeffrey Miller : Good morning, Sean. Sean Meakim : So, on free cash flow, I was hoping we could get a little bit more granular on the quarter and the guide. So, collections improved, I think, as we expected, but payables also fell a good amount. Inventory is still growing. CapEx is unchanged for the year. Sounds like earnings power is going to be challenged in the fourth quarter. So the $900 million of free cash that you're effectively guiding for this quarter is dependent upon working capital to a large degree. Could you maybe just walk us through those pieces? Lance Loeffler : Yeah, Sean. Let me take a stab at that. So, look, we did make considerable improvements in 3Q. I think that that momentum clearly has to continue into 4Q, and it's really done \u2013 as you talk about the working capital movements, we continue to believe that we're going to progress on the way that we're collecting our receivables expect inventory will draw down as we deliver on our completion tools orders for the fourth quarter. And my belief is that working capital on a year-on-year basis is still relatively flat in 2019. Sean Meakim : Okay. Lance Loeffler : I'd also say, in addition to the working capital goals that we have in the fourth quarter, we're also going to be down on CapEx as well. The rate of spend of CapEx that will contribute to that free cash flow number. Sean Meakim : Got it. Thank you for that. Jeffrey Miller : And then, maybe just on the D&E margin ramp, some moving pieces there too. In the third quarter, top line fell, but margins expanded. So, you had got North America. It's challenging on the top line, but you're getting some progress where you're trying to go on the international side. For the fourth quarter, it seems like similar dynamics, but a little bit different. The international is helping you more given the year-end product sales, et cetera. Are we getting those moving parts correctly and then, can we just get a little bit more of an update on how iCruise is fitting into that relatively? What your expectations would have been, say, 9, 12 months ago? Jeffrey Miller : Yeah. thanks, Sean. I'll start with the second part of that question. The iCruise is really delivering what we had expected though it is obviously \u2013 some of the contracts we were targeting or have been won, but are moving a bit to the right. That said, the performance of the tool, very good, very excited about what it can do, and coupled with EarthStar, for example, really is delivering on the technical promise that we had hoped. So, I expect, as I look through Q4 and into 2020 and beyond that the value of this suite of technology is going to be very impactful. In fact, I'll just comment here, at the World Oil Awards this week, actually the best drilling technology was the EarthStar 3D Inversion which is fantastic technology. So, to get back to progression, we kind of see a longer ramp on the recovery of that business, but all of the building blocks are in place and the technical approach is working, and I see us winning the kind of contracts that I think are required to earn higher margins. Sean Meakim : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is open. Scott Gruber : Yes. Good morning. Jeffrey Miller : Good morning. Scott Gruber : Good morning. Staying on D&E margins, I know you guys typically forecast just one quarter ahead, but I was curious about a bit of color on 1Q. How should we think about margins going into next year? You have a bit more North Sea exposure at this point. Has that changed the seasonality? Are we going to see a little more seasonal impact on D&E margins or is there still sufficient underlying profit improvement that you can offset and have more normal seasonal margin performance in 1Q? Lance Loeffler : Scott, this is Lance. Appreciate the question. I think looking ahead, I think there's still going to be some seasonality in 1Q. We're still dealing with weather in the Northern Hemisphere as we traditionally see it. But I think, overall, as you think about where international margins can go, based on some of the comments Jeff made prior, I think not only are you seeing the investment in technology come to fruition and what we expect, but also just generally more activity in the international markets help improve \u2013 also seeing better pricing in certain regions around the world. That comes because of the tightness of tools, et cetera, that will drive that. So, I think that there is, obviously, continued progression on where we see international margins going, not just in the fourth quarter, but into next year. Scott Gruber : Got it. And then, on the $300 million of cost savings, obviously, you'll get a bit in 4Q. Can you just provide a bit more color on how that phases in over the next few quarters and whether there's any offset in terms of severance or facility closure cost and how large those could be? Lance Loeffler : Yeah. Scott, I'm not going get into the details today on that. I think the point is is that we're focused on lowering our service delivery costs. And I think probably the most important point is is that we're being decisive, right? We're looking to move quickly around cost reductions in North America. We've seen some of those actions \u2013 seen some of the benefit of those actions that we took in 2Q. I'd just say stay tuned over the course of the next couple of quarters. Jeffrey Miller : I think just to add to that, when we think about our North America playbook which is driving specifically towards utilization and efficiency and cost, I think this playbook is right squarely in the middle of the types of decisive actions we're taking around taking out costs. Scott Gruber : Got it. Appreciate it. Thank you. Jeffrey Miller : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Chase Mulvehill : Hey. Good morning, fellas. I guess I just want to follow-up on Scott's question here. So, maybe on 4Q for D&E, I don't know if you can maybe help us kind of understand how much of the improvement in margin on the revenue side is attributed to kind of the software sales that you typically get in the fourth quarter? And then, along those lines, how much of the $300 million of cost savings are included in your 4Q guide? Lance Loeffler : Yeah. Appreciate the question, Chase. Look, I think in terms of the impact on software and product sales for the fourth quarter, it's relatively the same as we saw last year. So, not above or below what we experienced last year. On the cost-cutting side, look, again, I'm not going to get into the details today on the call on how that transforms over the next couple of quarters, but we will keep you posted as that continues to develop. Chase Mulvehill : Okay, all right. Follow-up. Listening to the prepared remarks, Jeff, you talked about your more integrated packages that you're seeing in US onshore. Maybe could you expand a little bit, what kind of customers you're seeing kind of push more towards integrated packages? And is this more on the drilling side, the completion side or both? Jeffrey Miller : I'd really say it's both. And it's customers of all sizes quite frankly, but probably more to the \u2013 larger into that. And I think some of that's just reflect \u2013 look, this is the early days, but it's encouraging because I know the type of safety and service quality performance that we have in the market and the ability to put more things together, I think, drives better performance over time. It's really a collective investment and a learning curve that drives that kind of efficiency. And we've seen that actually evolve in the North Sea. So, while early days North America, very early days, I think there's an analog which was the North Sea, which was obviously a very disintermediated market probably just five or six years ago and we've seen roughly 90% of our work today in the North Sea is in some form or fashion of integrated or bundled or in some form or fashion a more stable set of work that is more outcome-based that then allows us to, over time, demonstrate really some of the things that make Halliburton so reliable and so efficient over the long term. Chase Mulvehill : Okay, all right. That's helpful. Thanks, Jeff. I'll turn it back over. Jeffrey Miller : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC. Your line is open. Kurt Hallead : Hey, good morning. Jeffrey Miller : Good morning. Lance Loeffler : Good morning, Kurt. Kurt Hallead : Appreciate all that color so far. Good stuff. The question I had for you initially here is on the US/North American frac, Completion and Production side of the business, right? You guys talked about a cost reduction effort that's underway, focus on the right players, et cetera. However, it looks like the market is still going to be kind of devoid of pricing, right? So, when we think about the \u2013 or when you guys think about your business in US, and US frac, in particular, beyond your cost reductions and pricing, do you think there is other ways you can drive margin improvement, Jeff? Jeffrey Miller : Yes, I do. I think, strategically \u2013 technology is always an important part of this business and we continue to invest in technology. And some of that technology allows us to lower our cost. And we don't necessarily spend a lot of time talking about that simply because it's not for sale. I want to keep it and have that benefit accrue to Halliburton. I talked about one just this quarter on the call with integrated completions, but that's more complicated to do than meets the eye and it actually drives a lot of cost savings for Halliburton. When we direct our efforts that way, that is part of the sustainable competitive advantage we have around not just cost cutting \u2013 actually, I don't see it as cost cutting. I see the playbook actually is strategically driving better efficiency and better margins sort of in the face of where the market is today.  And I say all of that \u2013 and I want to pivot to what I really think the future looks like, which, over the next few years, the dialogue I believe will be more around recovery factors in unconventionals and less about just pure speed. And I think, in that market, some of the things we're doing with Prodigi and a host of things that I think will be quite impactful in that future scenario, which the future \u2013 what, a couple years out, but I'm really excited about that also. And nothing we're doing today gets in the way of delivering on that future set of technologies. Kurt Hallead : Okay. That's great color. Then you indicated \u2013 you gave us some sense on attrition. Say, on a general basis, it runs maybe 15% to 20% per year. And then, given the dynamics at play in the marketplace with companies not generating enough free cash to put into the maintenance, what would be your assessment above and beyond that 15% to 20%? I know you didn't really \u2013 maybe not want to comment on it, but maybe pressing a little bit here, kind of give us your best guess as to what you think it could be given the underinvestment in the business? Jeffrey Miller : Look, I think this is something that accelerates, particularly as we get into 2020. We'll see an uptick in the first half of the year, first quarter, and I think there will be stress in the system at that point. The extent to which there isn't new investment in this business, that just continues to wear on equipment. So, it has to accelerate over time. Kurt Hallead : All right. Jeff, I'll leave it there. Thanks, guys. Jeffrey Miller : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Boyd with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Dan Boyd : Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys. Jeffrey Miller : Good morning, Dan. Lance Loeffler : Good morning, Dan. Dan Boyd : So, thinking about the 300 million in cost savings over the next three quarters, can you give us an idea on how much that is fixed versus variable? Jeffrey Miller : I think most of that would be more in the fixed category, not the variable. The variable costs, we're managing all of the time. And, in fact, our ability to flex up and down on variable cost allows us to be, I think, hyper responsive to moves in the marketplace. But when we attack \u2013 the type of fixed cost things are the parts that \u2013 that's the removal of the waste that is permanent when we think about continuous improvement and driving there. And that's what you saw in the second quarter as well. It was a move around taking out waste. And so, that tends to come in steps as we sort of evaluate how best to get that efficiency and then we're able to move on the cost. Dan Boyd : Okay, great. And then, Lance, just going back to the D&E margins, I think what we're all trying to figure out is just what the go-forward run rate is, exit any kind of 4Q seasonality. So, earlier this year, we talked about flat margins year-on-year. Looks like they're maybe going to come in a little bit below, closer to 8%. But should we be thinking about the new run rate being in the double-digit range on an annual basis or is it just too early to say? Lance Loeffler : I think to try to call 2020, it's probably a little early, but we firmly believe that margins in D&E and the international markets are higher than where they are today. Obviously, we've got room to run. I think as the markets continue to improve and for the things that I sort of talked about maybe on an earlier question around activity, leads to tool tightness, more constructive pricing discussions and further implementation of our technology, particularly on the drilling side, we're encouraged by what we see. So, yes, the goal is to be higher than where we are today, clearly, but little too early to call on what would be our expectations for a 2020 market. Jeffrey Miller : Maybe just to add to that if I could. The other important part of this is, as we manage capital, we are reallocating assets where we believe we need to in order to drive those margins up. So, we see tool tightness in the marketplace broadly. And, clearly, we're going to move those assets to where they make the best returns. And so, I think that, in and of itself, drives better margins over time. And at the same time, we do have the ability to meet and exceed growth rates, I believe, internationally. Dan Boyd : Maybe just kind of sneak one more in on that. When you look at the margin improvement then in D&E, Lance, how much of it would you just \u2013 if you had to put it in two buckets of \u2013 one self-help and then the other one just being external market growth and pricing. How should we think about that? Lance Loeffler : I would weight that to the latter\u2026 Dan Boyd : Okay. Lance Loeffler : \u2026in terms of activity and pricing. Dan Boyd : Okay. Thanks, guys. Jeffrey Miller : Thanks, Dan. Operator : Our next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is open. David Anderson : Hey. Good morning, gentlemen. So, aside from the pressure pumping aspect, I was wondering about what other parts of your North American business have been impacted by the new playbook? I know part of this is you're looking at every business in terms of its returns. I was just kind of curious, how many of those product lines are kind of underwater in terms of returns? I just wonder if you can just kind of help us understand how this new playbook is impacting the other parts of your business. Jeffrey Miller : I think it has an impact on all parts of our business. I think our view to, obviously, improving returns will get to other parts of the business. And I think that anything we do, in some cases, to take out fixed costs also have an impact on other parts of the business. So, can't do one really without the other. We like all of our businesses in North America. And I think they all benefit a degree from the approach we're taking with frac. So, it's probably more pronounced with frac. David Anderson : Okay. I was just curious, there's been a lot of talk about the digital space over the past quarter. You announced 10 new applications on your DecisionSpace 365 digital platform. But as we kind of look out there and we see a lot of promise out there. I was just curious how you're thinking about the investment required. A bit of an arms race going on it seems like out there. But can you give us a sense as to how much your R&D spending is today dedicated towards digital and how are you thinking about spending kind of going forward over the next few years in that space? Jeffrey Miller : Yeah. I think the capital and R&D spend around that is included in sort of our run rate. So, I don't think it's going to be outsized to what you've seen us do in the past. I think the \u2013 we really like our landmark business. We are a leading software provider in the industry. We hosted an important event in Houston. We had 1,300 customers at our event in Houston to look at sort of the future of digital and had thought leaders who are also our clients present at that event. But I think the key focus and where we will spend more time talking to you, it will be around how it's monetized because I think that's really the important component of all things digital, which is \u2013 in my view, it's internal efficiency, enhanced tools that we charge more for and then software sales and consulting that we sell directly to clients. And you hear me talk about those at different times. I'll try to frame them better, but if I think our enhanced tools, 3D inversion is a good example of that with EarthStar, that has a lot of digital involved in making it work. Internal efficiencies look like things like our maintenance, it's automated, and digital planning and manufacturing. And then, 365 being one of the products that we actually sell, both in the cloud and the subscription model. So, I'm comfortable with where we are. In fact, I really like where we are digitally and I think the digital principles that we laid out early around being open architecture, evolving with partners, and then clearly making returns for Halliburton are the right \u2013 that is absolutely the right strategy. David Anderson : Great. Thanks, Jeff. Jeffrey Miller : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Your line is open. Marc Bianchi : Thank you. I wanted to ask \u2013 first on CapEx, I suspect you guys aren't looking to get into what you expect to spend in 2020. But just looking where the run rate is here in third quarter and then saying it's going to be again lower in fourth, is that the right way to think about the CapEx that you think the business needs on a go-forward basis? Jeffrey Miller : Yeah. I think the timing of the spend is more weighted, obviously, towards the first part of the year just because that's when tools are actually going to work and a lot of the planning goes on as we look to next year. We have a view of where we want things to be and when we want them to be there. Marc Bianchi : Okay. Thanks for that, Jeff. And back on the $300 million of cost save, is that the right amount of cost save for this level of revenue or how are you thinking about what level of revenue the business will be sized for once you complete that program? Jeffrey Miller : Look, I think that we continuously take waste out of the business and look for ways to operate it at a lower cost point. So, that's kind of the step that we see right now that is effective. But at the same time, we're always looking for ways to make the business more and more efficient and we'll continue to do that almost irrespective of what we think the revenues are or will be. Marc Bianchi : Okay. Thanks for that. I'll turn it back. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks. Jeffrey Miller : Yeah. Thank you, Shannon. Look in closing, I'm excited about the international outlook and how Halliburton is positioned to benefit from these improving conditions. The combination of increased activity, pricing improvements, ability to compete for a larger share of high-margin services and reallocation of our assets should lead to higher international margins as I look towards the future.  Our North America playbook is working. We're driving lower costs, better asset utilization and market-leading returns in the near term, while concurrently developing technology that lowers our cost or is essential to our customers over the longer-term, principally unconventional resource recovery, drilling and digital and all technologies where Halliburton is uniquely positioned to win. So, thank you. I look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Shannon, you can close out the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Now, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you, Abu, and good morning, everyone. 2019 solidified the pivot from growth to capital discipline in North America and marked another step on the road to recovery in the international markets. I\u2019m pleased with the way the Halliburton team executed our value proposition, delivered exceptional safety and service quality and stayed focused on generating healthy returns and strong free cash flow. I thank our outstanding Halliburton employees for their hard work and execution the entire year. 2020 opens a new decade and a new century for Halliburton. It brings new opportunities that I will address in a few minutes. But first, some headlines for the full-year and fourth quarter of 2019. We finished 2019 with total Company revenue of $22 billion and adjusted operating income of $2.1 billion. I'm pleased with the continued recovery in our international business. We increased revenue 10%, outgrowing the international rig count for the second year in a row. North America revenue declined 18% as a result of customer activity and pricing reductions and our decision to focus on those customers that provide the best returns. Systematically improving our service delivery, immediate cost reductions and the growth in non-frac product lines allowed us to stem the margin erosion. We delivered over $900 million of free cash flow for the full year, demonstrating our ability to generate consistent free cash flow, throughout different business environments. Finally, 2019 was an exceptional year for our safety and service quality performance. Our total recordable incident rate and nonproductive time, both improved by over 20%, historical bests across our business. This is a result of our employees\u2019 continued commitment to safety and process execution. And now, a few points about the fourth quarter. We finished the quarter with total Company revenue of $5.2 billion, a 6% sequential decrease and adjusted operating income of $546 million, an increase of 2% quarter-over-quarter. Our Completion and Production division revenue declined 13% sequentially and operating margin remained essentially flat. Our Drilling and Evaluation division delivered a strong quarter. We grew revenue 4% and improved operating margin 300 basis points sequentially. D&E international margins grew significantly, offset by margin decline in North America. While our North America business declined due to the significantly lower activity in U.S. land, internationally, we delivered 10% revenue growth this quarter. This underscores the versatility and global reach of our business. In the fourth quarter, we took a $2.2 billion, largely non-cash impairment charge and made strategic decisions to market for sale our pipeline services and well control product lines. As I mentioned, 2020 brings plenty of opportunities. The oil price is more constructive as we enter the year. The imminent global recession fears have abated with the help of economic easing from the leading central banks. U.S. production growth is slowing because of constricted capital flows. The increase in non-U.S. non-OPEC supply coming into the market is limited. The geopolitical instability in the key oil-producing regions of the world should add an incremental risk premium to the commodity prices in the near term. That said, oil prices are still supported by the OPEC plus cuts and will fluctuate based on the group\u2019s resolve to continue limiting production. Gas prices in the U.S. are below breakeven levels. U.S. drilling and completions activity may be biased lower due to the consolidation and restricted access to capital. Halliburton is no stranger to navigating choppy waters. We entered 2020 and our next century with a clear sense of purpose. We will continue to do what we do best, collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize our customers\u2019 asset value while generating industry-leading returns and sustainable cash flow for our shareholders. We will do this with attention to the sustainability of our business, minimizing environmental impacts and acting as a responsible corporate citizen. The international markets presented plenty of growth opportunities in 2019. We grew revenue 10% year-over-year, closing stronger than anticipated. All regions increased revenue, led by Asia Pacific, Latin America and Europe. Both our divisions meaningfully contributed to the international growth, Completion and Production led the charge with 13% expansion due to higher activity in mature fields in Europe and unconventionals in Argentina, the UAE and Australia. Drilling and Evaluation grew international revenues 8% as we increased activity levels in all markets, specifically in Norway, Mexico, China, and Nigeria. In 2020, we expect the international spend by our customers to increase by mid single digits, making it the third consecutive year of spending growth. We have the right footprint and an enhanced technology portfolio to compete and win across the international markets. We expect to grow at or above the market rate this year, consistently focusing on profitable growth and improving our international margins. Continued gas activity expansion in the Middle East, resolution of political issues in Latin America, and several pending project awards may enable us to outgrow the market again in 2020. Our Drilling and Evaluation division is poised to grow faster as we get the benefit of the full year in our Norway integrated contracts, the iCruise directional drilling platform rollout continues, and new offshore drilling activity starts up around the world. The international revenue growth should follow the historical cyclicality. In the first quarter, we expect international revenue to decline due to normal seasonality and the elimination of yearend sales. Thereafter, we should see steady growth that would peak in the fourth quarter. This year, we expect to increase our international margins. We anticipate higher utilization for our existing equipment in busy markets like the North Sea and Asia Pacific. Our project pipeline is strong, and the incremental activity will help tighten tool availability and absorb the existing cost structure. We intend to be prudent with capital allocation, driving our organization to have the right pricing discussions with customers. Given the tool tightness in some product lines and geographies, we're strategically reallocating assets to the best returning opportunities. Pricing in certain international regions is improving and we expect this momentum to continue throughout 2020. About one-third of our book of business is awarded every year. The remaining two thirds are existing contracts and contract extensions. We are gaining pricing traction on new work and contract renewals, and we're making strategic choices about the work we pursue. I believe the capital and pricing discipline across all geographies will allow Halliburton to deliver rational returns-driven growth in the international markets. Turning to North America. The U.S. shale industry is facing its biggest test since the 2015 downturn with both capital discipline and slowing leading edge efficiency gains weighing down activity and production. As expected in the fourth quarter, customer activity declined across all basins in North America land, affecting both, our drilling and completions businesses. The rig count in U.S. land contracted 11% sequentially and completed stages had the largest drop we have seen in recent history. While holidays and weather were the usual factors, other reasons for this air pocket in activity included our customers\u2019 free cash flow generation commitments and an oversupply of gas market. With this backdrop, Halliburton followed our playbook and continued to proactively manage our fleet count. As announced last quarter, we also proactively cut costs and started the implementation of the strategy to sustainably improve our service delivery. Those actions allowed us to curb margin declines in North America and deliver lower decrementals year-on-year, even though the industry\u2019s sequential activity drop was much more severe than in the fourth quarter of 2018. In the fourth quarter, the market saw clear public evidence of the long-awaited equipment attrition. This is just the beginning. We believe a lot more equipment will exit the market as lower demand, increasing service intensity and insufficient returns take their toll. As service companies cannibalize idle equipment for parts and new sideline pumps to beef up working fleets, the available horsepower supply in the market may be smaller than something. Halliburton has continued doing what we said we were doing, stacking equipment to improve our returns. We exited 2019 with 22% less available fracturing horsepower. We have rationalized our equipment supply to the anticipated level of demand in 2020. The size and scale of our business in North America gave us the ability to right size without sacrificing our market leadership position and the value that comes with it. In the fourth quarter, we started the implementation of our $300 million annualized cost savings and service delivery improvement strategy. We moved quickly to execute the initial personnel reductions and real estate rationalization all with an eye to improving our near-term financial performance. We\u2019ve achieved about $200 million in savings on a run rate basis in the fourth quarter. While this impacts our business globally, the majority of the savings are geared towards North America. We're looking at 2020 with pragmatism. Early indications are that are U.S. land customers will reduce capital spending approximately 10% from 2019 levels. I believe that the current level of ducks in the market will allow operators to spend less money on new well construction and direct more of it to completions. Depressed gas pricing is negatively affecting the activity outlook in the gassy basins, which will likely bear brunt of the activity reductions in 2020. In the first quarter operators will reload their budgets, and we expect modest improvement in completions activity as a result. That said, the calendar cadence where some operators are biased to spend more-earlier in the year, will likely remain. Halliburton will continue to be proactive in taking actions to generate industry-leading returns and strong free cash flow in this environment. Here are the more significant actions. After systematically rationalizing equipment in 2019 to adjust to changing activity levels, in 2020, we plan to provide the capacity that maximizes the returns on our overall fleet. This should also allow us to be efficient about our workforce and maintenance planning and to achieve higher utilization of existing fleets throughout the year. Pricing pressure was considerable during the year-end tendering season. Consistent with our capital discipline approach, we've taken on contracts that are expected to allow our portfolio to earn acceptable returns and declined those that are not. I like the slice of the market that we\u2019re choosing to participate in this year. Our high-graded customer portfolio gives us confidence in a more sustainable demand level and the mix of pricing and volume that generates returns for Halliburton. Make no mistake, we will continue developing technologies whose value accrues to Halliburton and not just to our customers. Our integrated completions offering and the iCruise rotary steerable system are prime examples of such technologies. They should allow us to reduce our capital outlay and deliver better margins, all with the purpose of generating strong returns. We plan to continue strategically growing our share of services per well, by increasing the competitiveness of our non-hydraulic fracturing businesses in North America. Our wireline and perforating, artificial lift and specialty chemical product lines, all posted strong double-digit revenue growth in 2019, despite the overall market softness in U.S. land. We intend to keep this momentum and spread it to other services. Finally, we will continue the implementation of our service delivery improvement strategy. Halliburton is redesigning the way we deliver our fracturing services in order to lower our unit costs and improve margins and returns in the long run. 2019 closed the decade of the shale revolution that transformed the United States into the world's top hydrocarbon producer. Halliburton was an early participant in this development and has been investing in it and innovating ever since hand-in-hand with our customers. As unconventionals enter maturation phase, Halliburton is committed to the North American market and taking appropriate actions to thrive in the new environment. I will now turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our financial results. Then, I will return to discuss digitalization, a topic that will define the next decade for our industry. Lance? Lance Loeffler : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let's begin with an overview of our fourth quarter results, compared to the third quarter of 2019. Total Company revenue for the quarter was $5.2 billion, a decrease of 6% and adjusted operating income was $546 million, an increase of 2%. During the fourth quarter, we recognized $2.2 billion of pretax impairments and other charges to further adjust our cost structure to current market conditions. These charges consisted largely of non-cash asset impairments, mostly associated with pressure pumping and legacy drilling equipment. They also included approximately a $100 million of cash costs, primarily related to severance. As a result of the charge, in the fourth quarter, we recognized a benefit of approximately $35 million from a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense, which reflects two months of DD&A impact. The after-tax impact of this reduction in the fourth quarter is approximately $0.03 of EPS, of which $0.02 is included in our Completion and Production results and the remainder in Drilling and Evaluation numbers. As Jeff mentioned, we've also accomplished a significant portion of our intended annualized cost reductions with the remainder to come in the first quarter. Let me take a moment to discuss our divisional results in more detail. In our Completion and Production division, revenue was $3.1 billion, while operating income was $387 million, both decreased 13%. Reduced activity and pricing in multiple product service lines, primarily associated with stimulation services in North America land, coupled with lower activity for stimulation services in Latin America and well intervention services in the Middle East drove our results. These declines were partially offset by higher pressure pumping activity in the Eastern hemisphere, coupled with year-end completion tool sales globally. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $2.1 billion, an increase of 4%, while operating income was $224 million, an increase of 49%. These results were primarily driven by increased activity in all product service lines in the Middle East/Asia, coupled with higher drilling activity in Europe/Africa/CIS, and yearend software sales globally. These improvements were partially offset by lower drilling activity in North America and reduced testing activity in Latin America. Moving on to our geographical results. In North America, revenue was $2.3 billion, a 21% decrease. This decline was mainly due to lower activity and pricing in North America land, primarily associated with pressure pumping and well construction. This decline was partially offset by higher yearend completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico. In Latin America, revenue was $598 million, a 2% decrease, resulting primarily from lower activity in multiple product service lines in Argentina coupled with decreased testing activity across the region. These results were partially offset by higher activity for all product service lines in Colombia, increased project management activity and cloud infrastructure installations in Mexico and higher yearend completion tool sales across the region. Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS. Revenue was $883 million, a 6% increase, resulting primarily from increased well construction activity in the North Sea, coupled with increased activity in multiple product service lines in Algeria. These improvements were partially offset by lower pipeline services across the region. In Middle East/Asia, revenue was $1.4 billion, a 19% increase sequentially, largely resulting from increased activity in multiple product service lines across the Middle East, India and China, higher pressure pumping activity in Australasia and higher year-end incompletion tool sales across the region. These results were partially offset by lower well intervention services in the Middle East. In the fourth quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $65 million, and we expect it to be the same in the first quarter of 2020. Net interest expense for the quarter was $141 million and should remain approximately the same for the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 22%. Based on the market environment and our expected geographic earnings mix, we expect our 2020 first quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 21% with a projected full-year tax rate of approximately 23%. We earned approximately $1.2 billion of cash from operations during the fourth quarter. As expected, we improved our working capital and generated strong free cash flow of approximately $827 million for the quarter, delivering approximately $1 billion of free cash flow for the full year, excluding the cash impact of the restructuring charges I discussed earlier. As a result, we ended the year with $2.3 billion in cash. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $340 million with our 2019 full year CapEx ending just above $1.5 billion. As we look ahead to this year, we intend to reduce our capital expenditures by approximately 20% to $1.2 billion. We believe this level of spend will still allow us to invest in our anticipated international growth while continuing to rationalize our business to the current market conditions in North America. Within this reduced CapEx budget, we will continue investing in and growing our production group businesses, namely constructing a chemical manufacturing plant in Saudi Arabia and expanding our artificial lift footprint. We will also move forward with the iCruise system global rollout, but at a more normalized pace than what we accomplished over the last couple of years. Our digital efforts and new technologies aimed at improving our efficiency and reducing our operating costs will also get an appropriate share of spend. We believe our capital allocation decisions are consistent with our focus on generating strong cash flow for our investors, regardless of the market environment. Finally, let me provide you with some comments on how we see the first quarter playing out. As is typical, our results will be subject to weather-related seasonality and the roll-off of year-end sales, which will mostly impact our international business. North America will see a modest increase in completions activity, as Jeff described earlier. We will continue to pull the levers that allow us to mitigate margin declines across the business this quarter. As such, in our Completion and Production division, we expect sequential revenue to increase 2% to 4% with margins declining 125 to 150 basis points. For our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate sequential revenue will decline 4% to 6% with margins decreasing 200 to 250 basis points. I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff? Jeff Miller : Thanks, Lance. One of the key trends that will define the new decade in our industry is digitalization. The next 10 years will see digital technologies and artificial intelligence going mainstream, just like the smartphones did in the last second. In the oil and gas industry, digitalization unlocks the potential to structurally lower cost, shorten the time to first oil, increase optionality in exploration and production, and enhance performance across the entire value chain. Digital is not a separate strategy at Halliburton, rather it is an integral part of our value proposition. Our ability to collaborate engineered solutions and maximize customers\u2019 asset value is evolving through the seamless integration of digital technologies into our operations. Digital permeates everything we do and has the same goal as our business strategy, deliver value for our customers and returns for our shareholders. At Halliburton, we are hard at work on the next frontier solutions that will shift the balance in the people, process, technology triad by replacing labor and reducing capital investments through automation and self learning processes. We believe this will allow us to harness the transformative power of digitalization and make a quantum leap in productivity, similar to going from horses to horsepower. It takes time to build the scalable software and hardware infrastructure required to fully capitalize on digital solutions. We're well along that path and have been building up our digital capabilities for a number of years with the long-term view of how digitalization will evolve. I'm pleased with the internal and customer adoption we\u2019re seeing. Halliburton is in a unique position to reap the benefits of the industry's move towards digitalization. Our Landmark product line is an established leader in petrotechnical software with the powerful cloud-enabled DecisionSpace 365 software platform. In 2019, the cloud-native software was our fastest growing business within Landmark, increasing revenues 50% year-over-year. Landmark provides us with solid foundation, established through decades of investment in software development, people, domain expertise and processes to create and scale digital solutions. This benefits all of our product lines. In addition, we have strategic partnerships with Accenture, Microsoft, AWS and Schneider Electric, all of which validate and expand both our vision and our capabilities. We now have over 100 customers with thousands of users across the globe, leveraging our iEnergy digital ecosystem to integrated software and workflows across their organizations, regardless if they're Halliburton's, third-party or internally developed. This open architecture platform is unique in the industry and in our view is a necessary condition for the successful adoption and scaling of digital solutions. True to our D&A, we are also bringing to market practical, smart and interconnected products and services that help unlock value for us and our customers. We are pioneering new approaches to subsurface understanding, well construction and reservoir recovery. Let me spend a few minutes on each. First, we transformed subsurface understanding using big data, digital frameworks and evergreen models. We've created a unique geological model of the entire earth to provide insights into the origin and productivity of reservoir. Once drilling starts, we deliver improved field measurements with next-generation wireline and logging-while-drilling tools, fiber and sensors. We then translate these measurements into faster and more informed decision-making using a new class of models made possible by digital technologies. For example, our EarthStar ultra-deep resistivity sensor automatically feeds into our industry first, scalable earth model that updates in real time. Customers can now make faster decisions about their development programs and reduce cycle times by a factor of 10. Second, we improve well construction through collaborative well engineering and drilling automation. Landmark\u2019s digital well program enables seamless collaboration between operators and service companies across a multitude of software platforms. The iCruise drilling system increases the number of built-in sensors by a factor of 5 and offers self guiding capabilities. Working with our rig partners, our digital twin technology delivers better collaboration and faster decision-making. All of these solutions boost efficiencies and lower costs, while demanning the process of well construction. Last but not least, we improved recovery and production by using our digitally enabled tools to connect customers\u2019 assets and leveraging this to monitor and enhance performance outcomes. In completions, we use our intelligent completions for monitoring production trends and connecting them to broader reservoir management studies. In artificial lift, we leveraged digital to monitor ESP health and extend run life. In simulation, we use our industry-leading fracture modeling software and full-scale asset simulator to model fracture propagation and frac hits. These are examples of how we deliver digital innovation today, with a focus on specific domains and aligned with the customers\u2019 buying behavior. They provide immediate value to customers, increased customer loyalty and generate returns for Halliburton. Over time, we believe digitalization will seamlessly connect subsurface, drilling and production, enabling customers to make asset-level decisions at the speed of execution. We have a solid foundation, the tools, the open architecture and the domain expertise to successfully deliver this vision. Let me summarize what we\u2019ve talked about today. In 2020, Halliburton is focused on delivering margin expansion, industry-leading returns and strong free cash flow. In our view, international growth will continue. Increased activity, disciplined capital allocation, pricing improvements and our ability to compete for a larger share of high-margin services we believe will lead to international margin expansion in 2020. As North America customer spending declines again this year, Halliburton will continue to execute our playbook to maximize returns and free cash flow. We plan to provide the service capacity that we believe will maximize the returns on our overall fleet, continue to invest in technologies that improve margins, keep strategically growing our non-hydraulic fracturing product service line and continue the implementation of our service delivery improvement strategy. We believe digitalization will define this decade in our industry. Halliburton continues to move full steam ahead on the digital journey and is uniquely positioned to reap its benefits. And now, let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. James West : So, Jeff, towards the end of your prepared comments, you've talked a lot about international and international margin progression. I wonder, if we could dig into a little more detail there with mid single digit it sounds like growth, you may be able to outpace that a touch here as well, plus you're seeing some pockets of pricing strength. How should we think about the margin expansion as we go through the year, what type of incremental should we be expecting? Jeff Miller : Yes. Thanks, James. Look, I think I spent a fair amount of time on the catalysts themselves, obviously activity improving, rational project choices and technologies. I think, the key is, it's going to be shaped -- we're starting at a higher point going into Q1 than we certainly did last year. And then, I would expect the shape of that to look similar where we start and it moves up a little, just that shape of the international margins should stay consistent, but obviously starting from a higher point. James West : And then, maybe for Lance here on the free cash flow next year, looks like it's going to be pretty significant based on some growth but also lower CapEx here. How should we think about when we're going to see the free cash flow start to show up, will it be similar to this year, or it should be backend loaded, or would it be more even throughout the year? Lance Loeffler : Yes. Look, I think you're right in terms of the expectations to grow free cash flow this year. You're right around the -- I don't think that the -- our ability to drive sort of the working capital consumption is going to remain in the first half of the year like it has historically for us. I expect some of the extreme volatility that we saw last year to not repeat this year, but there still is a consumption of cash from a working capital perspective. But overall with the reduction in CapEx, the improvement around margins and some stability around our working capital, we expect free cash flow to grow in 2020. Operator : Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Sean Meakim : So, you touched on the margin progression internationally. Can you maybe just talk about how that translates into D&E in 2020? So, we had the margin ramp in 4Q, maybe 70 basis points or so comes from the D&E benefit that will help year-on-year in \u201820. But, can we see 2020 margins on a full-year basis get back to 2017, 2018 levels? Do we think we can get back to a double digit type of outcome for the year? I\u2019m just curious how you think investors will get comfortable with the trajectory like that, just given it\u2019s been a difficult business to forecast last couple of years? Jeff Miller : Yes. Sean, it has been difficult to forecast, but we've done a lot of things during that time. So, the platform around iCruise technology and EarthStar has been rolling out at the same time. We're seeing a lot of international choppiness that we see some recovery sort of happening, which obviously lends itself towards D&E. And so, I think these are multi-year efforts that we -- and we view them that way. I\u2019d say digital as well will contribute to probably early days to D&E. For all of those reasons, I don't think it's unreasonable also to expect that we get back to I think 2018 looking kind of number or beyond. Sean Meakim : Got it, okay. Thank you for that. And then, so on the digital strategy, competitors made a lot more noise about their strategy maybe than you have so far. But the [indiscernible] contracts sound pretty similar in terms of the offering. Could you maybe just expand a little bit in terms of the scalability that you see for those types of avenues maybe across a broader set of customers and where you see the most opportunity? Jeff Miller : Yes. I think I tried to describe today our vision around digital and then the mechanics for realizing that vision, which then quickly becomes in today's market what are the things we actually do. So, I used an example of some of the tools that are in the market. As we integrate those, obviously the moat expands around those. So, I think, it will take many forms over time. Again, it will be big projects, which we\u2019ve talked about a few of those where it's either a cloud infrastructure and the cloud environment that we either install or operate and we\u2019ve got examples of each of those. But equally important will be the day in, day out march around how this work really gets done, which is around drilling, production and reservoir filling in those spaces with tools, they all contribute to that vision. And so, I think that there is a lot of scalability here. And I think what's most important is really the production capital that Halliburton has invested in Landmark that really makes it scalable. In fact, to do these things at scale, there's a lot of discipline and practice and agile DevOps that are required at scale to reliably develop software and then operate, maintain and then ultimately continue to advance. And we have that. So, and I\u2019m really confident in how that rolled out over the longer term. And I think the thing to focus on is, what are those tools that we\u2019re doing now that deliver returns. Obviously, they contribute to the vision. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Angie Sedita : So, just on C&P specific to North America, could you talk a little bit about the cost cutting that's unwinding here? You said you have a $100 million left. Is there more that could be done beyond that $100 million? It\u2019s for Jeff or Lance. And then, maybe you could talk also about the pricing. Have you seen the market starting to stabilize on the frac side for pricing, are you still seeing pressure in frac and across the other product lines? Jeff Miller : Yes. Thanks, Angie. Look, the $300 million in savings, and we've moved quickly on that. And I think, the $200 million that we've taken out on an annualized basis already, expect to get the rest of that done in Q1. And I think that really speaks to how that team in North America executes. And we execute very quickly and with a lot of purpose. And so, obviously that contributes. Beyond that, we've talked about our playbook and how we expect to execute our strategy in North America. And I think over time that continues to drive improvement in margins, less concentrated in a moment, but obviously a set of activities that yield value over time. From a pricing standpoint, it\u2019s still very -- it\u2019s competitive information. Obviously, Q4 was quite competitive. And so, I think the market in spite of attrition is still oversupplied. What's important though is that we make our own choices around how to maximize fleet profitability. And by virtue of doing that, I view it as more stable in that respect. Lance Loeffler : Angie, I might add a comment too on the $300 million in cost savings. Just to be clear too to add to Jeff, that's sort of cash structural savings. Jeff Miller : Yes. Angie Sedita : Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then, maybe staying along the themes on pricing. It's obviously the reverse internationally. Maybe you could talk a little bit or give more color on the pricing power or momentum you\u2019re seeing in the international markets. Is it fairly widespread, is it by specific regions or product lines, and do you think there could be a little bit of momentum going into 2020, or is it slow and steady? Jeff Miller : Look, I'd more describe it as slow and steady, Angie. I think, what the key is that the setup is constructive. And so, managing capital in a more prudent way, focusing on profitable growth as opposed to growth, all of those things conspire to create an environment, where we're able to get better pricing. Is it widespread, I'd say it\u2019s generally widespread, but there is probably pockets who are more concentrated than others, sometimes driven by availability and complexity of work and things that would normally and rationally drive our pricing. And so, I think that's what we're seeing in the market. And yes, it is getting traction. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons. Your line is now open. Bill Herbert : Thank you. Good morning. Lance, you talked about it conceptually, but I'd like to kind of refine it, if you will, with regard to the discussion of the evolution of working capital for this year, less pronounced seasonal trends, you were a huge consumer, cash, working capital was in the first half of 2019 a nice contributor to cash in the second half. I'm trying to kind of peg the order of magnitude of the reduction in cash consumption during the first half of this year versus the first half of last year. Lance Loeffler : Yes. I think, what you see, Bill is sort of a year-over-year comparison as we don't have -- I mean, last year we were carrying a lot of inventory associated with the boost in the iCruise rollout and in some of our C&P product lines that I don't think that you see that consumption taking place again this year, as we consume more of that inventory, as opposed to build it. The collection cycle is still going to be very similar. Albeit as the international business becomes a bigger part of our business that typically has longer DSOs, so we may see some impact there. But still a view where we build receivables early in the year and then unwind those as we get into the later part of the year. Bill Herbert : Okay. And so, just to take a stab at it, would you expect that your cash consumption from working capital in the first half of this year would run it like half of what it did in 2019? I mean, is that a reasonable starting point? Lance Loeffler : I think that's probably a reasonable starting point. Bill Herbert : Okay. And then, secondly, again a lot of moving parts, but it's kind of a 20% reduction in CapEx, you should have better working capital improvement for this year. Net income should be up as well. So, at least from my numbers, I'm getting to kind of a free cash flow yield, assuming a $24 stock price of kind of 7% to 8%, which is getting pretty sporty. And I'm just curious with regards to priorities of the deployment of that surplus cash flow. Is it still a reduction of net debt first and foremost? Lance Loeffler : Yes, I think it is. I think with the excess cash, I think we do have a near-term priority on reducing debt. The reality is Bill is while we're focused on that debt reduction in the near term, what it does and what it offers us as we continue to chip away at it, is give us more flexibility to return cash to shareholders in the future. And I think today, our business, we need to address the $3.8 billion of debt that we have coming due over the next six years. So, I think we'll do that -- do some of that in the near-term, but also with an eye on ultimately returning cash to shareholders. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Scott Gruber : Kind of staying on a similar line of questioning. Lance, you mentioned the $1.2 billion of CapEx in 2020, which is good to see. Could you just provide some color on how you think about the sustainability of CapEx around that level? There is a few moving pieces year-on-year in '20 and there will be a few more in '21 in particular with the Saudi chem. supplying investment now recurring. But, just how should we think about kind of broad strokes on that level of CapEx and feel free to frame it as a percent of sales, if it\u2019s easy? Jeff Miller : Yes. Scott, this is Jeff. I think, the key is around prioritization. And we are focused on the best returning opportunities. But, we were able to fund international growth in 2019 and expect with that level of CapEx can continue to fund the growth that we see in 2020. So, it isn't that we are starving anything. The reality is we're feeding things appropriately and around our return expectations. We think about spending this year, it's probably two thirds international, a third U.S. but in our view very sustainable. And so, we're comfortable with that level of CapEx and also what it means to making better returns. Lance Loeffler : Yes. I would add, in an environment, an increasing pricing environment that generates the appropriate returns, we may spend more, but it will be commensurate with the focus on returns and overall driving better free cash flow. Scott Gruber : Got it. And then, just a question, circling back on the domestic frac market. With pricing hopefully stabilizing here in early 2020, and Jeff you had mentioned a focus on maximizing returns on the frac fleet. But, broad strokes, does that strategy likely mean that your frac business trends with the market in 2020 or they had lagged the market to a degree in 2020, would be focused on returns? How should we think about it? Jeff Miller : Yes. I think that it will -- yes, I would expect we stay consistent with the market, but we don't feel like we have to just because we mostly focus on the returns and free cash flow out of that business. But, I wouldn't think we would be out of the market at any point in time. But that said, we\u2019re focused on the slice of customers that make the best returns for us, which gets to a number of factors, efficiency, but also calendar cadence piece of spend. This year going into Q1 for example, we\u2019re 95% committed on the fleet, which is the best we've been since the downturn. Operator : Our next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is now open. David Anderson : Hi. Good morning. Jeff, going back to your comments on the digital side, as we move beyond the proof of concept and it becomes more broadly accepted, you kind of talked about sort of two different types of customers out there, I guess as sort of maybe on the E&P side as those who have kind of realized, they can do themselves and you provide certain discrete operations, different applications like you just mentioned on some of your tools. On the other side, you have other bigger broader customers which you can implement your ecosystem across the organization kind of the announcements you made today. How do you see those two sets of customers evolving over the next let say, next several years? Is it fair to assume just kind of the former and then the former is the majority of that business and then hopefully it kind of evolves more into more the broader implementation? Can you just talk about how you see the customers\u2019 acceptance? Jeff Miller : Yes. Look, I think customers do this at the pace at which they can digest it realistically. And that is the reason why I think you see that bifurcation today, it's more apparent just because customers that can actually operate and execute at that level of integration are fewer and far between today. And I kind of view it that way. It gets implemented at the pace it could be absorbed. That\u2019s why I tend to talk about the vision and then bring it down to -- okay, here are the more digestible groupings being drilling, production and reservoir, and then even down into the tools. Because the reality is number of these tool don\u2019t have to be integrated but they can be and they are more effective when integrated. And so, if I use a fairly simple example, like in EarthStar tool, it\u2019s a tool, it\u2019s metal, it runs in the well, it\u2019s fantastic tool, but what's most important about it is the answer product, which is the 3D inversion. And now, that 3D inversion becomes even more valuable when integrated in an Earth model and likely yet again more valuable when integrated into the entire ecosphere. But that\u2019s difficult for everyone to do that at one time and it's very hard to do that given sort of the proliferation of different systems. So, the key in my view is we continue to advance the platform, the ecosystem as you described it, while at the same time, driving immediate returns around these tools. And they're available to be integrated into that ecosystem. I hope that's helpful. David Anderson : That makes, a lot of sense, Jeff. Thanks. Now, the other side of digital here is that it appears to be deflationary to traditional oilfield services going forward. Your customers can do more with less. Would you agree with that? And do you think that future digital revenue to Halliburton, presumably it comes at higher margins, it\u2019s more sustainable, can that more than offset this deflation over the next several years? Jeff Miller : I think it can, because I think what's missing in this deflation discussion is the moat that comes in around our equipment, that allows so much cost savings on the client side part of the business that we\u2019ll be able to reap better margins and better returns on those assets to deliver those solution. And obviously, at the same time, we\u2019ll likely be reducing our own costs as we work through this. So, I think it will be deflationary in some ways but I think the value and the returns on the not just the componentry but how that componentry is part of that ecosphere really winds the moat that may be isn't there, is prevalent today, but I think we will see that widen and that ultimately drives better returns for us, in spite of what might be deflationary in a number of other areas of the business. Operator : Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Chase Mulvehill : Hey. Good morning. I guess, I want to come back to the CapEx question and ask it maybe a different way. If we think about that $1.2 billion of CapEx, what's the split between D&E and C&P? Lance Loeffler : Yes. Chase, this is Lance. I would say that, it\u2019s very similar to the 60-40 split that we talked about between NAM and international is a good proxy. Chase Mulvehill : Okay. So, 60% C&P, is that what you're saying? Lance Loeffler : No, no, no. 60% D&E. Chase Mulvehill : Got it. Okay. All right. If you\u2019re 40%, I think that puts you sub 4% of C&P revenues if we think about CapEx as a percentage of revenues. Obviously, lower than kind of what you did in 2016 as a percentage of revenues. If we look over the next couple of years and kind of call it a sluggish, modest growth North America environment, how should we think about C&P CapEx over the next couple years and maybe frame it on a percentage of revenues? Lance Loeffler : Yes. Look, I think structurally lower, as we described it, based more on the market and the opportunity set that we see. But, we are really careful not to -- we don't peg this to percents of revenues and others things because then when get sort of odd answers when we see markets growing, and I don't think growth is geared that way to our CapEx necessarily. And so, we will continue to focus on the best returning opportunities where we see those. But, the idea that it's going to have to move -- the CapEx is going to move as percentage with revenues is really not -- that's not how we approach that. Chase Mulvehill : Okay. That makes sense. And then, coming back to frac, you talked about 22% less frac horsepower. Is that the amount that you've actually retired? Is that the amount that you've actually taken out of the market from an active fleet reduction? And then, a quick one follow-up to that. You talked about improvement in frac utilization in 2020 for your active fleets. Do you care to kind of quantify that? How much improvement in utilization across your active fleets you think you can get in 2020? Jeff Miller : Look, I'll start with the first question. The 22% that we described is out of the market sold by the pound retired. But that\u2019s done some good things for us. I mean, the reality is that we're 90% Q10s at this point, our costs are lower, our service quality is the best it's ever been. So, that's how we view that. The activity, I guess, is -- as we look out at the balance of the year or in terms of utilization, part of maximizing profitability of that fleet and the returns on that fleet is keeping it busy. And as I described earlier we started the year 95% committed, which is the best we\u2019ve been in sometimes. So I'm encouraged by that outlook based on the fleet that we have. Operator : Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Kurt Hallead : I was kind of curious first and foremost on the international front, when we look at 2020. Where do you think the best relative growth prospects are for Halliburton? You mentioned that Asia Pac was a major contributor here in \u201819. So just kind of curious on how you see the regional dynamics play out for 2020? Jeff Miller : Look, I think it's again led by Asia Pac. In 2020 Europe/CIS continues to be strong as we get into a full year of activity on a number of the contracts we talked about in the past. Africa grows but it will be a bit more-choppy, as it works through exploration and regulatory sort of resetting in that market. Middle East remains robust, but obviously starts at a fairly high point as the market itself, and LatAm likely brings up the rear. Kurt Hallead : Okay. I appreciate that dynamic. And then, I just want to get a little bit better understanding here on just the guidance you provided for first quarter on the margin progressions for C&P and D&E. And I want to try to get in this context. For C&P, when you look at the margin degradation on a quarter-on-quarter basis, could you give us some general sense of how much is that related to the absence of the tool sales versus market dynamics? Lance Loeffler : Yes. Kurt, this is Lance. Yes. It\u2019s definitely impacted by just a non-recurring nature of year-end product sales in the C&P division, which were probably up 10% to 15% versus what we saw in 2018. So, we had a good fourth quarter at our C&P division in terms of year-end equipment sales. Kurt Hallead : Okay. And then, can the same be said for D&E? Lance Loeffler : I'm sorry? Kurt Hallead : I'll let you continue, Lance. Sorry. Lance Loeffler : No. And then -- and that is obviously, those margins are accretive. So, what we see replacing that in the first quarter in terms of activity, largely in the resumption of our pressure pumping business in North America is coming at lower margins. And so, you see offset of that. Kurt Hallead : Okay. Can the same be said for D&E? Lance Loeffler : Yes, same can be said for D&E, probably more comparative, flattish year-over-year in terms of year-end product sales in our D&E division. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Your line is now open. Marc Bianchi : Jeff, you were talking about oversupply still in the frac market, and with your retirements and what we've heard from the others, there has been pretty significant reduction so far. What do you think is needed from here to kind of balance the market and what do you think the timeline is for that? Jeff Miller : Yes. Look, I think, what's most important is that that attrition is real. I get this question a lot. And I think a quarter ago, I said -- I thought it was 20%, which was viewed as high, turns out that's right in the fairway. So, that attrition is in fact occurring. And the market forces or the forces that drove that attrition haven't changed at all in terms of amount of sand pumps, number of stages per day. All of those things that drive that attrition haven't changed. And so, I suspect we continue on a pace that\u2019s at least consistent with that. As far as the timeline of when we see it, it happens at some point. It doesn't change the way we go to the market today. And so, we are so focused on delivering our strategy around cost reduction and our service delivery improvement that when that happens it will be terrific and we will see a great boost from that. I think in the meantime, we\u2019ve got a plan to deliver solid free cash flows and return sort of in any market. Marc Bianchi : Okay. Thanks for that. Maybe someone related, we\u2019ve got the guidance here for first quarter for C&P margins, which includes the full benefit of all the cost cutting you are doing. Where do you think those margins can get absent any kind of pricing recovery for the frac side of business? Is there -- just through the self-help I think you\u2019re talking about a bogey that you would point to, over the next number of quarters? Jeff Miller : Look, no, I mean, I think we\u2019ve provided guidance on Q1. I view strategy as something that we executed and we continue to see the value and benefit from. And so, we\u2019re taking a very long view of this business and the actions that we\u2019re taking beyond Q1 to continue to contribute and improve the business. And I think that we will continue to outperform, like we have the highest margins today in North America and we will continue to add to that. Operator : And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Mr. Miller for closing remarks. Jeff Miller : Thank you, Liz. Before we wrap up, I\u2019d like to close with a few points. First, I expect that Halliburton\u2019s international growth will continue in 2020, and that the combination of capital discipline, pricing improvements and technology will lead to margin expansion. Second, Halliburton will continue executing our North America playbook to maximize returns and free cash flow. And finally, I believe digitalization will define the next decade, and Halliburton is uniquely positioned to reap the benefits. Look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Liz, please close out the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  I'd now like to hand the conference over to Abu Zeya, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Abu Zeya : Thank you, Gigi. Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton first quarter 2020 conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton\u2019s website for seven days. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President, and CEO; and Lance Loeffler, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019; recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of impairments and other charges as well as expenses related to the early extinguishment of debt. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our first quarter press release and can also be found in the Quarterly Results & Presentation section of our website. After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow time for others who may be in the queue. Now, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Well. Thank you, Abu, and good morning, everyone. We're speaking with you today as billions of people are under some form of quarantine in their homes. Businesses and schools are disrupted and worldwide travel has generally come to a halt. The human and economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic is being felt globally. At the same time, our industry is facing the dual shock of a massive drop in global oil demand, coupled with a resulting oversupply.  As the world is battling the pandemic, I thank our employees for their continued focus during these difficult times. We are a critical part of the global energy infrastructure and an essential service to satisfy both immediate and long-term energy needs. On our customers' work sites and within our facilities, Halliburton people are getting the job done, while taking the appropriate steps to protect themselves and others. Our tiered crisis response model has been road tested in the past through hurricanes and other catastrophic events and it is working well in the current circumstances. Globally, our corporate crisis team monitors the evolving situation across all of our core functions from health and safety to IT infrastructure to supply chain, and provides guidance to support our local response plans. Locally, every country has reviewed their emergency response plans, assessed them for business continuity and activated them in alignment with local authorities. To ensure the safety for all, who must go to a work location, we've provided specific direction about how to work in a COVID-19 world and elevated cleaning protocols for our facilities and equipment.  We've adjusted shifts and rotations to maximize social distancing, as well as implemented varying levels of medical screenings as appropriate. We are maximizing remote work where possible and are encouraging our employees and customers to collaborate virtually using information sharing tools.  Now, let me cover some headlines for what was a solid first quarter of 2020. We finished the quarter with total company revenue of $5.0 billion, a 12% decrease year-over-year; and adjusted operating income of $502 million, an increase of 18% from the first quarter of 2019. Our Completion and Production division revenue declined 19% compared to the first quarter of 2019 and operating margin expanded 170 basis points.  Our Drilling and Evaluation division delivered a strong quarter. Revenue was flat year-over-year and operating margin grew 450 basis points. Our North America revenue declined 25% due to lower activity and pricing in U.S. land. Internationally, we delivered 5% growth this quarter. This marked the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue increases for our international business. Finally, free cash flow was effectively neutral for the quarter, which is a significant improvement compared to the first quarter of 2019 and reflects our focus on driving more working capital efficiencies. The first quarter seems like a long time ago, but it is an important demonstration of some key facts. Here's what it tells me.  We make commitments and execute on them quickly. We completed the previously announced $300 million in cost savings. We demonstrated the ability to improve our margins and lower our costs of service delivery. And the Halliburton team is well prepared to adjust and deliver under any market conditions.  Although we came into 2020 with improving expectations for our financial performance in the North America and international markets, the dislocations resulting from the pandemic and the precipitous decline in oil prices have significantly altered those expectations. Let me describe to you what I see ahead of us, recognizing that the market is still in motion.  Activity is in free fall in North America and is slowing down internationally. We cannot predict the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic impact on demand or the pace of any subsequent recovery. At a minimum, we expect the decline in activity to continue through year end. Though we have not experienced anything like the impact of COVID-19 pandemic before, under adverse market conditions, we know what buttons to push and what levers to pull. And we are doing so with swiftness and resolve. Today's market calls for deeper immediate actions. We're significantly reducing costs, cutting CapEx and managing working capital. I will give more detail on each of these actions in a few minutes.  We are unwavering on our commitment to safety and service quality for our customers and our focus on cash flow generation and industry leading returns for our shareholders. And we believe our near term actions will not only temper the impact of activity declines on our financial performance, but also ensure that we are in a strong position financially and structurally to take advantage of the market\u2019s eventual recovery. Before we get into the operational discussion, let me address a few topics I deem critically important in the near term. First, I believe Halliburton has sufficient liquidity, approximately $5 billion including cash on hand and our undrawn credit facility. Second, in the first quarter, we successfully executed both a tender offer for some of our bonds and a debt offering. As a result, we retired $500 million in total debt and extended the maturity for our $1 billion of senior notes out to 2030. We have focused on debt reduction over the last few years, and we enter this downturn with $2.6 billion less debt than in 2016. We also have a very manageable debt maturity profile with only $1.3 billion coming due through 2024. De-leveraging remains a key priority. We believe our free cash flow generation will be sufficient to pay down upcoming debt maturities in the normal course of business.  Finally, our dividend is a lever we can pull, based on our market outlook and valuations. Our Board and management review the dividend quarterly, and will act prudently to make adjustments for the long-term success of our business. Let me be clear. We have no intentions to increase leverage to maintain the dividend. We also do not intend to allow the dividend to prevent us from being structurally and financially positioned to take advantage of the eventual market recovery.  Now let me describe in more detail what I see unfolding in the markets globally; how we are prepared today compared to the most recent downturn and the actions we are taking to adjust our business to today's market.  The market in North America is experiencing the most dramatic and rapid activity decline in recent history. Our customers continue to revise their capital budgets downwards as they swiftly adjust spending levels in response to the lower commodity price. Right now, North American E&P CapEx is trending towards a 50% reduction year-on-year in 2020.  Since mid-March U.S. land rig count has fallen 34% and is expected to continue declining from here. With prices at the wellhead near cash breakeven levels, we expect activity in North America land to further deteriorate during the second quarter and remain depressed through year-end impacting all basins.  Our outlook for the international markets has also changed. In addition to the collapse of oil prices, the industry is dealing with activity interruptions due to the coronavirus pandemic. COVID-19 had minimal impact on our international operations in the first quarter, but the second quarter will be different. We're seeing restricted movements within countries, quarantine requirements for rotational staff, logistics delay due to third-party personnel reductions, and in some cases, entire country closures. Different markets are impacted differently and this will lead to significant operational disruptions at least through the second quarter.  Beyond these near-term headwinds, certain international customers are also fundamentally reducing capital spending, deferring exploration and appraisal activity and looking to cut costs on their major ongoing projects. We expect international spending to be down in the range of 10% on a full year basis.  OPEC+ production decisions and the duration of the pandemic related demand and activity disruptions will ultimately determine how much the international spending declines this year. International projects and contract structures tend to be longer term oriented. However, in the face of these unprecedented circumstances, our customers, IOCs, NOCs and independents alike, are all reassessing their priorities, with some reacting more swiftly than others. We believe the activity changes internationally will not be uniform across all markets. We anticipate that the least effected markets will be the OPEC countries in the Middle East, while offshore Africa and Latin America may see double-digit declines this year.  As operators in North America and international markets look for ways to cut spending, pricing is a lever they're seeking to pull. We continue to make pricing decisions based on our overall returns expectations for the business. Given the oversupply of fracturing equipment in North America, pricing levels in this market were already at historical lows coming into 2020. Internationally, the pricing increases we were starting to see will take a pause. We will work to improve efficiencies as a means to optimize costs for both our customers and Halliburton. It is important to remember, we were coming into this downturn from a very different place than in 2014, and we believe these differences prepare us better for what lies ahead. Spending in the North America market was down in 2019. In response, we introduced a new playbook to prioritize returns over market share. We restructured our North America organization, rationalized our real estate footprint, completed a cost out program and started addressing our fixed costs through the service delivery improvement strategy. We clearly had momentum from these efforts coming into 2020. Our more efficient Q10 pumps now represent 100% of our fracturing fleet. We also have the largest number of dual fuel and Tier 4 diesel fuel engines in the market. This fleet composition delivers differentiated service quality and efficiency and will ultimately drive the flight to quality when the market stabilizes in North America. We closed key technology gaps in drilling and openhole wireline, added new artificial lift and specialty chemicals capabilities to our portfolio, and continue to lower our costs across various product offerings. This has taken significant technology spend, which is now largely behind us. Our CapEx in 2019 was down year-over-year and we further reduced CapEx coming into 2020 to drive capital discipline across all of our business segments. As a result, we do not have the significant oversupply of tools and equipment in the international markets. We have built an operating machine to be effective and successful across cycles. Unfortunately, as we enter this downturn, we will need to make some painful decisions, and I am aware that this will cause great difficulty for our impacted employees. We are implementing the following set of measures that will further reduce our costs and improve our cash generation ability as our customers continue to reduce their spending levels.  We were reducing our capital expenditures for 2020 to about $800 million, roughly 50% from 2019 levels. We believe this level of spend will allow us to invest in our key strategic areas, while continuing to support our business in the active markets. We will take out about $1 billion of annualized overhead and other costs across our entire business, with most of it happening in the next two quarters. To accomplish this, we are streamlining our global and regional headcount, consolidating multiple facilities, and removing another layer of operations management in North America. We're accelerating our service delivery improvement strategy in North America, redesigning the way we deliver our fracturing services to lower our unit cost and improved margins and returns in the long run. We are cutting our technology budget by 25%. We have stopped discretionary spend across the business and we have eliminated salary increases for all personnel this year, and I and other members of the executive committee have taken pay cuts.  Additionally, we will make variable headcount adjustments and rationalize our assets to be in line with the activity reductions we anticipate. As we look to reduce our own input costs, we're also renegotiating prices and terms with our suppliers. Finally, we will continue our efforts on working capital improvements across all three of its components. We believe these actions are necessary given the current environment and will help protect our balance sheet and drive cash flow and returns for our shareholders. As we steer the company through this downturn, we remain focused on the underlying drivers of success and our long-term strategic objectives. We will continue to execute our value proposition, deliver value and efficiency across our product offerings and remain focused on safety and service quality.  We remain committed to being leaders in North America by delivering on our low-cost service improvement strategy. We continue to closely collaborate with our customers and partners on leveraging digital solutions to reduce non-productive time and improve labor and asset efficiency. As I've stated on prior calls, we are in the early innings of our artificial lift and specialty chemicals growth internationally and we plan to continue down this path. We believe these businesses give us exposure to a later cycle market with long-term growth potential. We will continue to spend on technology that reduces our operating costs. We believe this is necessary for the future success of our business. We've been through downturns before. As the market unfolds from here, we believe we have the people, the technology and the depth of experience to outperform our competitors. If required, we will take further actions to adjust to the evolving market.  If I've learned something from all of the downturns I've been through in my career, it is that the industry always bounces back. This downturn, although the most severe we have seen in a generation, will be no different. I believe it will reshape our industry and position it better for the next cycle. At some point, returning global economic and oil demand growth, market balancing supply actions by key producing countries and declining non-OPEC production, will likely lead to a new reinvestment cycle. And I believe Halliburton will emerge stronger on the other side like we always have. Now, I will turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our first quarter financial results. Lance? Lance Loeffler : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let's begin with an overview of our first quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2019. Today, our total company revenue for the quarter was $5 billion, a decrease of 12% year-over-year, while adjusted operating income was $502 million, an 18% increase. As Jeff mentioned, during the quarter, we accomplished the remaining $100 million of the announced $300 million in annualized cost reductions. In the first quarter, we recognized approximately $1.1 billion of pre-tax impairments and other charges to further adjust our cost structure to current market conditions. These charges consisted primarily of non-cash asset impairments, mostly associated with pressure pumping equipment, as well as severance and other costs. In addition, based on the current market environment and its expected impact on our business outlook, we recognized a $310 million non-cash tax adjustment to our deferred tax assets.  Now let me take a moment to discuss our divisional results in more detail. In our Completion and Production division, revenue was $3 billion, a decrease of $700 million or 19% when compared to the first quarter of 2019. Operating income was $345 million, a decrease of $23 million or 6%. These results were primarily due to the lower pressure pumping activity and pricing and reduced completion tool sales in North America partially offset by increased cementing activity and completion tool sales in the Eastern Hemisphere. In our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue was $2.1 billion which was flat from the first quarter of 2019, while operating income was $217 million, an increase of $94 million or 76%. Higher activity for drilling related services in the North Sea and Asia more than offset reduced activity and pricing for multiple product service lines in North America land and lower fluids activity in Latin America.  Moving on to our geographical results : In North America, revenue was $2.5 billion, a 25% decrease when compared to the first quarter of 2019. This decline was mainly due to reduced activity and pricing in North America land, primarily associated with pressure pumping, well construction and completion tool sales. This decline was partially offset by increased artificial lift activity and specialty chemical sales in North America land and stimulation activity in the Gulf of Mexico. In Latin America, revenue was $516 million, a 12% decrease year-over-year, resulting primarily from reduced fluids activity and stimulation services across the region, particularly in Argentina. This was coupled with decreased activity in multiple product service lines in Brazil, Ecuador, and Colombia. These declines were partially offset by increased activity across multiple product service lines in Mexico and Guyana.  Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue was $831 million, an 11% increase year-over-year resulting primarily from increased drilling related activity in the North Sea, improved well construction activity in Russia and increased completions activity in Algeria, partially offset by reduced activity in multiple product service lines in Ghana.  In Middle East/Asia, revenue was $1.2 billion, a 9% increase year-over-year, largely resulting from increased activity in the majority of product service lines in the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia and Malaysia, which was partially offset by lower project management activity in India. In the first quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $60 million and net interest expense was $134 million. Our normalized effective tax rate for the quarter was 21%.  We generated $225 million of cash from operations during the quarter. As anticipated, working capital was seasonally a use of cash but significantly lower than the draw we experienced in the first quarter of 2019. As activity declines globally, working capital has historically been a strong source of cash and I expect a similar pattern this year. We have a heightened focus on improving working capital metrics and are working hard to prudently manage customer credit risk in light of the current market conditions.  Capital expenditures during the quarter were $213 million. As Jeff mentioned, we have reduced our full year CapEx budget to approximately $800 million. These cuts are geared towards both our North America business and uncommitted projects internationally. We believe our capital allocation decisions are consistent with our focus on generating cash flow regardless of the market environment. Our free cash flow generation for the quarter was $12 million. A significant improvement compared to the first quarter of 2019. During the quarter, we took actions to manage our debt and maturity profile. We executed two transactions, a debt issuance and a subsequent tender, which lowered our total debt by $500 million. But more importantly, it also reduced our 2023 and 2025 maturities by $1.5 billion. As a result of these transactions, we incurred a net cost of $168 million related to early debt extinguishment. Our total outstanding debt was $9.8 billion as of March 31st. We have no current borrowings under our revolver and no financial covenants in our borrowing facilities for our debt agreements. Now, looking forward, our second quarter results will be impacted by the severity of the continuing activity declines in North America, customer project suspensions and delays internationally, and the uncertain duration of the pandemic-related disruptions, as well as actions related to the OPEC+ production cuts. These uncertainties and the exact timing of our cost reductions impacting our division results preclude us from providing specific guidance for the second quarter. We will continue to execute the measures that Jeff outlined. In addition to the activity-related variable cost adjustments, we plan to reduce annualized overhead and other costs by about $1 billion. To achieve that, we will have an associated cash cost of approximately $200 million. These reductions will target all of our business lines and support functions globally, and we expect to complete most of these actions within the next few quarters. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff for closing comments. Jeff? Jeff Miller : Thanks, Lance. Before we close, there are two important themes that I see accelerating in the depths of this downturn. Both will be helpful today, but more importantly, they will create strong competitive advantages for us in the future. First, we are fast-tracking the implementation of our service delivery improvement strategy in North America, as we restructure our overall North America business. We launched the strategy to lower the cost -- the overall cost of service delivery in the U.S. last year, and we will accelerate these efforts in the current market. Next, this downturn accelerates the adoption of digital technologies by our customers and by Halliburton internally. We are far along the road to delivering the next frontier of digital solutions that will help drive efficiencies in our workforce and reduce capital investments through automation and self-learning processes. In this environment, digitalization will unlock the potential to structurally lower costs and enhance performance across the entire value chain. I have never been more convinced that digital is the future and Halliburton is leading the way. With that, let me summarize our discussion today. To the Halliburton team, the path ahead will be challenging, but I have the utmost confidence in our ability to maintain focus and execute on our value proposition in this extremely difficult environment. Our balance sheet and liquidity positions are solid, and we plan to continue taking actions to strengthen them. We know what buttons to push and what levers to pull, and we will do so quickly around cost, CapEx and working capital, and we will continue to proactively adjust our business to current market conditions. We know that the industry will recover. It may look different when it does, but we believe the actions we are taking will ensure that we are in a strong position, financially and structurally, to take advantage of the market\u2019s eventual recovery. And now, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Sean Meakim from JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Sean Meakim : So, Jeff, I hope we could start with capital allocation and the dividend. Given the forward outlook, the uncertainties, $600 million a year staying on the balance sheet seems pretty useful. I appreciate you have no intention to take on leverage to fund the dividend. You probably have pretty decent free cash this year to cover the dividend, I think especially with working capital benefit. But on a run rate basis, maybe that looks a lot harder exiting 2020. Just I appreciate any additional comments you have about the Board\u2019s decision making on the dividend. And with respect to timing, how to think about that? Jeff Miller : Well, look -- thank you, Sean. Yes, I've described how we think about the dividend in the prepared remarks. And so, look, we will review the dividend with our Board, we do that quarterly. We have a Board meeting coming up in May and we'll update you on any decisions, when we get to that point. Sean Meakim : Okay. Fair enough. And then on the $1 billion cost out plan, maybe could you just compare and contrast this initiative relative to the prior $300 million program? I'm just thinking about variable versus fixed costs that you referenced that I think largely this is an overhead cost reduction so perhaps that's more fixed -- maybe the split between North America and international. It would be great to get any more detail you can offer us on that program please? Jeff Miller : Yes. Look, quite -- it's fixed costs that are coming out. I guess to compare and contrast, we took out $300 million in the fourth quarter of last year. That was largely -- that was fixed cost as we approached the business. I described this cost reduction similarly, because it is not the variable item. So I guess it's overhead and it\u2019s things that are fixed, it\u2019s things that take big steps down when you take them out, you don't necessarily add them back, in contrast to crews and the equipment on location and the supplies and all of the things that go with that. So a lot of that -- a lot of our strategy around North America really had been to accelerate our ability to make those decisions and take costs out quickly. These types of fixed costs, again, it's a layer of management, it's a lot of the discretionary things that we take out that we don't -- that aren't required to add back at any point. Lance Loeffler : And I would add, Sean, that these costs, as you asked about the split between sort of North America and international, I think these are predominantly aimed at North America, but they also include international cost-cutting as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James West from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. James West : Hey, Jeff, I wanted to touch on more of a bigger picture question and it relates to something you said right at the end of your prepared comments. And I certainly agree with you that the industry is going to look a whole lot different as you get through this downturn in the next couple of quarters. While that\u2019ll be interesting to watch, are going to cause a major shakeout, which will be a net winner of. I think there are two things and maybe we touched on a little bit in prepared comments but I would like to explore a little more is your deceleration of your delivery strategy in North America and the digital transformation of the industry. Because those things I think are the most important for Halliburton and for the industry quite frankly going forward on what the industry looks like, whether it's a couple quarters or more from today's levels and then? Jeff Miller : Thanks, James. A fantastic question. And the current environment really accelerates or allows us to really test the art of the possible with respect to how we work and digital is front and center. And I can see, when we embrace that wholeheartedly as opposed to incrementally, we're able to do things quite differently in terms of less people, less footprint, actually working more effectively in my view. But it really does require divorcing the mind of what a lot of us grew up doing to make that step to, wow, this is all possible without you fill in the blank. All of the things we thought were required to actually execute this work. And so, look, this whole period is awful on a lot of different fronts. But I am an optimist and I think we take advantage of an -- time like this and say \u201cOkay, forget everything you thought you knew.\u201d First and foremost, service quality and safety. Everything else, let's go relook at given the robust set of tools that we have. And a lot of these are tools that we've invented at Halliburton or they're built off of our own native cloud platforms. And so from that respect, that makes it very, very sticky as it -- we come out of this. James West : And Jeff, are you seeing a embrace from the -- I mean I know it\u2019s early days in the downturn but are inbounds from customers around the digital offerings you have, have they already started to show an increase as they look to lower their costs or embrace this new paradigm? Or is it happening yet? Jeff Miller : Actually it is. We've seen a meaningful uptick just in the last 30 days in demand for native cloud services and apps and things that would allow not just working remotely but take the same kind of cost removal that I'm describing, our customers do that when they adopt cloud technology, a lot of what Landmark and our digital organization has been building and has on the shelf. And so it's really -- it's accelerated the demand for that. And obviously necessity is the mother of demand creation in that regard. But quite encouraging to me and actually as I said in my remarks, I'm actually more convinced today than ever that digitalization and the Landmark and then the broader digital platform we have will just serve us better in the future. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons. Your line is now open. Bill Herbert : Hey Lance, with regard to working capital, if I looked at the last couple of downturns or actually the last downturn, 2015, a huge source of cash with regard to working capital, harvest about a $1 billion, it was front and loaded. 2016 was another $1.2 billion backend loaded. Question is, is that order of magnitude expected to be this time around in 2020? And when does -- and walk us through in terms of the sort of evolution of the working capital harvest this year. Is it second half weighted or does it start to inflect in the second quarter? Lance Loeffler : Yes, Bill. Thanks for the question. You're right. Historically we have generated cash from working capital during the last three downturns. I would say on the absolute amounts probably a little bit different profile than particularly the 2015 comparison that you were referencing, just given the fact that on an absolute basis our receivables and inventory are at levels that they were coming off of 2014 record level of revenue. So that's a little bit different, but I still expect the relative behavior to be the same. We should continue to see as the business shrinks over the next three quarters that we continue to generate a cash from working capital in the unwind. Bill Herbert : And then Jeff with regard to pulling forward the art of the possible in terms of digital automation, remote operations, what percentage reduction do you think that would result in with regard to your average crew size? Jeff Miller : Well, I think it could be in the range of half. I mean it is meaningful. But it's not the crews, it's partly crew size, but it's really all of the things that are in between the crew and sort of the overhead of the company. There are a lot of steps that involve designing work and how work gets actually prepared for delivery, the delivery of products and materials. The ability to embrace the automation of all of that is pretty meaningful. I think crew size can come down as well because there are a few things around the crew that are required to deliver all of that input. But I think the more impactful part will be all of the sort of transaction friction between sort of the top of the organization in there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Angie Sedita : So Lance, maybe I'll start with you. I -- it\u2019s impressive the debt reduction and I know it's a focus of both you and Jeff, so maybe you could talk a little bit further about the steps that you're taking around showing up your balance sheet? Obviously you've reduced the $500 million, you pushed out maturities. I think you have another $685 million due in '21. So maybe you can talk about tendering maturities and just talk about free cash flow? Lance Loeffler : Yes, Angie. As we said sort of on the prepared remarks, our expectation is that we retire the $685 million that comes due next year through the free cash flow generation that we would expect to achieve this year, but roughly a $200 million coming due in February of next year and the remainder in November. And so we think that we've got ample capacity to pay debt down. And the focus philosophically for Jeff and I is to continue to reduce debt at this company and that's what we're going to continue to chase. Angie Sedita : And then maybe Jeff, I mean you made a remark in your prepared comments around flight to quality and clearly we've seen this bifurcation in the market. So maybe you could talk a little bit about the flight to quality in North America and what you're seeing so far? Are you seeing that actually playing out in Q2 or is that a bigger factor there when you see a recovery? And just incremental color around C&P and D&E with regard to Q2 and Q3 in the case of the downturn as we go through the rest of the year? Jeff Miller : Yes, Angie, look, I fully expect we see a flight to quality, but at this very moment there's just not a lot of thought going into anything other than reducing capital spend right now. And so in that kind of environment, there isn't much flight because there's not a lot of new things being added. I\u2019m fully confident and our operating capability and the quality of the service we deliver and we maintain that front and center and fully expect the sort of after the industry is able to take a collective breath, we will be extremely well positioned and see the same flight to quality that we've always seen. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber from Citi. Your line is now open. Scott Gruber : How should we think about your strategic initiatives in expanding international share in lifts, chemicals, directional and information evaluation in light of the CapEx cuts and market conditions? Jeff Miller : Well, we -- look, we think that's an important avenue of growth about those businesses to do that. The early work around trials in a number of countries continues on. It doesn't take much capital to get that going and continue that strategic push into those markets albeit I don't think we'll see the same growth that we had anticipated. It's more a matter of pushing those services or delivering those services through the existing infrastructure that we have. So, to continue that strategic initiative is one that we bought those businesses in order to do that. Obviously, we'd like to see better market for those services as we do this. But it doesn't change the fundamental interest and actually opportunity to continue to do the things required to grow those businesses. It takes many steps to grow those businesses internationally and we don't have to stop those. Scott Gruber : And just circling back to Angie's question, I know the outlook internationally is very opaque, but could you see the vast majority of that annual activity hit in 2Q, and then the second half maybe be more flattish just given a fading impact from COVID offset by the growing impact from the customer CapEx reductions where we\u2019re likely to see activity continue to step down in the second half of the year? Jeff Miller : Yes. I mean, I think we will see most of the U.S. impact in Q2. I mean that's just -- it's moving so quickly that our view on the U.S. is that we see dramatic reduction in Q2, though not able to call a precise number or timing and then likely kind of works off the rest of the year, the -- flattish. The international market reacts a little differently and I just say that because taking a frac holiday is a lot different than taking a deepwater rig holiday. They just happen at different paces. And so, we've got a view of slowing activity internationally. It doesn't necessarily slow at the same pace that we see it, just because they pick a day, it's like we're going to stop on X date, but it's not today. It's at a point in time. And so, I think that unwind is over more than just Q2, albeit the COVID-19 disruption part should get behind us quickly. It's the same operators that are conserving capital in the U.S., in many cases are the operators that will look to conserve capital internationally. NOCs, if we had a grade level of how effective or impactful, NOCs would be less impacted, probably IOCs more so internationally over the balance of the year. But all of that, we'll have better visibility of that as we go through Q2. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chase Mulvehill from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Chase Mulvehill : So, I guess if we can kind of come back to the U.S. a little bit, obviously 2Q is -- you\u2019re going to take a significant step down. But if we think about your overall strategy for U.S. onshore during this downturn, do you think that you may be focused a little bit more or a little bit less on market share this downturn relative to kind of how you were thinking a couple of months ago? Jeff Miller : Look, our playbook doesn't change going into this current environment. By that I mean, returns are front and center, albeit challenged, but we're not chasing market share, don't intend to. I don't think that the dynamics have changed. The things that form our view on our strategy for North America haven't changed, the bigger full cycle type things. And so therefore, we're going to manage our costs. We're going to look at the returns on equipment, the best utilization of equipment, whether that's to stack it or work at. But we don't believe that anyone working below EBIT or EBITDA is not going to be successful in the long-term and we plan to be very successful in the long-term. And so, we haven't changed our view there. Flight to quality may result in more market share at some point, but trust me that is not -- and we don't go-to-market thinking about that. Chase Mulvehill : If I can kind of a switch over to international a little bit, and this has kind of been touched on throughout the Q&A session. But you talked about international CapEx, E&P CapEx being down about 10% year-over-year. OPEC+ members are talking about actually holding 6 million barrels a day of production offline through basically April 2022. So, if they end up doing this, can you talk about the medium term activity outlook for international? Last cycle we were down kind of 40%, it seemed like on international Drilling and Completion spending. Do you think that it will be better or worse, all set and done if OPEC+ does hold this amount of production offline through 2022? Jeff Miller : Chase, look, I think that's the kind of clarity we will likely get as we work through Q2. But we just don't -- with respect to OPEC+, I think overall they will be more resilient than the rest of the market, almost independent of what impact the recent agreements have or don't have on activity. The market never really recovered from \u201816 other than nominally. So if it would be hard to follow the same distance. Though, like I said, I think we'll get that clarity as we work through Q1, I said in the range of 10% simply because it can be plus or minus something around that band.  I think we've got -- we'll have a better sense in North America as we get through Q2. I think we'll have visibility, but without all of the certainty as we get through Q2. Again, just because those are slower developing, the decisions are slower developing internationally to a degree just because they have to and there's too many partners, nations, governments, things involved to move at the same pace that a North America nimble independent operator can move. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Anderson from Barclays. Your line is now open. David Anderson : A question on sort of -- I certainly appreciate the lack of visibility in North America. I don't think that's a surprise to anybody. But your customers are all in various states of health as well, if I think about the majors versus E&Ps versus these privates that are out there. Can you just talk about how those discussions are going and maybe the differences that you see in how those customers are behaving now? I know it just seems like to us on the other side it's all sort of coming at as fast and furious, but if you could maybe segregate how those different customers are behaving and what they're talking to you about that'd be very helpful? Jeff Miller : Look, I think, they're all behaving in the very near term quite similarly. I think they all have a view and I'm not going to just differentiate between the financial position of the market or the different parts of the market. So I would say that's an incredibly aggressive group of competitors. My clients I'm talking about in North America and they're going to each aggressively act independently. The dialogue with them at least with me has been disappointment over the near term, but all, they bit firmly in their teeth looking ahead to what it looks like on the other side. And the dialogue is always that we're going to need to be super competitive and work with Halliburton when we get to the other side. We've had many discussions about what does a recovery or how do we implement the things we're talking about on the other side. So that's generally been a consistent conversation with all customers. David Anderson : And a separate question on the international side. You said in your remarks, it sounds like the direct impact from the pandemic is mostly to international operations, supply chain, kind of quarantine, having trouble moving people around. Are you seeing the same thing in the U.S.? I haven't really heard that much about that or is it just the fact that the equip activity is falling so fast that you're not really seeing it, it\u2019s somewhat irrelevant? Can you just talk about kind of the more direct impacts of this pandemic to your operations on the U.S. side? Jeff Miller : Yes, we\u2019re seeing less of the direct impact just because the workforce is all U.S. Most of the travel can be done in a car, not on a plane. So most of the supply chain is North America based.  It's a very little that we actually source outside the U.S. and so I think that's the reason more than any other that we don't see the disruption in the U.S. and obviously we see the commodity price impact in the U.S. But internationally, even if it's not a U.S.-based workforce, we have a very globally based workforce with 140 nations that work for Halliburton and most of those international. So that's where we get into some of that supply chain.  Well, people interruption though, let me compliment our international folks and operations. I mean they ramped up very quickly. The interruptions to this point have been very limited and it\u2019s because that group has literally sprung to action to manage. I just can't tell you how many people moves and supply chain moves that they've overcome. David Anderson : So does that give you a little bit of comfort in the second part of the year for international that if you are more impacted today from the pandemic, but as that eases, maybe that gives you a little bit of help in the back part of the year? Jeff Miller : Well I think the COVID interruption part, it gives me a lot of confidence around our ability to find an operating rhythm which our team typically does and does quite well. But I would say that, that does -- the commodity price impact is what we will see as I\u2019ve described earlier, Dave, working through Q2 and what it might mean. Again, I think in the range of 10% which our initial thoughts had been up and now we're talking about down 10% or so in that range. But I think that clarity -- we really don't get that clarity until it settles in. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC. Your line is now open. Kurt Hallead : So, Jeff, you spent quite a bit of time on the last conference call talking about the digital dynamic, obviously a reference again and emphasized it today. I think last time we had a discussion, you indicated maybe the digital dynamic might not have a very near-term -- big near-term impact on revenue generation. So just wanted to kind a touch base again and given all the disruption that's happened in the industry, given the commentary you\u2019ve made about a number of different discussions now being had and rethinking and reshaping the industry going forward, any updates or any thoughts on how much revenue digital could potentially push, whether it's this year or whether you think it's going to get accelerated as you go into next year as well? Jeff Miller : Well, look, I think it accelerates as I have described. I don't think any revenue is accelerating at this very moment, albeit we are seeing a meaningful uptick in new users just over the last 30 days. As I said, in our iEnergy cloud, which has been meaningful, but overall hard to describe revenues up in a meaningful way at least right now. That said, though, the ability to reduce cost by implementing these things is in the here and the now. I mean that is like here and the now this week having an impact. And so I think the ability, for example, on our integrated projects as we -- this accelerates the acceptance by customers and the demand even by our own people to implement those tools that de-man rigs, work remotely, all of those are tools that we've been building over the last several years. We've implemented them or we've talked about them, in the North Sea, with Aker BP and some others who've been quite vocal but we've done it with many others. So it's hard to look at that set of tools today and not ask yourself, \u201cWhy am I not using those tools today?\u201d And so I'm really encouraged about the pace we will see.  I think we'll actually see -- its impact will be still over the next few years as that continues to grow, but the existing tools get adopted quite quickly I think in this market. Kurt Hallead : Great. Thanks for that color Jeff. And maybe a follow-up here for Lance. In prior cycle downturns, typically the decremental margin associated with this down cycle could be anywhere in, let's just call it 40% or so. I know you guys aren\u2019t giving any specific guidance and I appreciate that dynamic. But just trying to think through this element of, if we're coming through this down cycle at kind of lower price points for U.S. frac, didn't really kind of get the same pricing on the international dynamic through this last upturn. Should we still be thinking about maybe baseline to 40% decrementals or should it be lower? And then in that same context, once we come up with that decremental dynamic, I'm assuming we add back $1 billion of that cost savings to whatever we calculate. Is that -- Lance, is that a fair way to think about it? Lance Loeffler : Yes, I think it is a fair way to think about it. And I won't try to pick an exact number in terms of decrementals in this cycle. But what I will tell you is, is that we're taking out cost now to buoy those decrementals, to soften those decrementals throughout the full cycle of this downturn. I mean, that's the purpose, that's what we're aiming toward. That comes in the form of lowering our unit costs and ultimately doing everything that we can to improve our operating leverage. So, yes, I mean I think that the way that you're thinking about it, if you had an assumption around decrementals, the fit -- the overhead and other costs that we announced, the $1 billion, which is an addition to the $300 million that we've already taken out in the fourth quarter and first quarter of this year-- fourth quarter of last year, first quarter of this year --we expect those to be impactful and to soften the decrementals in this downturn. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks. Jeff Miller : Yes. Thank you, Gigi. Before we wrap up the call, I'd like to leave you with a few closing comments. First, I thank the Halliburton employees for their dedication to safe, reliable service through these difficult times. I have the utmost confidence in their ability to deliver our value proposition, under any conditions. Second, our balance sheet and liquidity position are solid, and we plan to continue taking actions to strengthen them. We are taking swift actions to address cost, CapEx and working capital, and we'll continue to proactively adjust our business to current market conditions. Finally, we know the industry will recover and believe the actions we are taking will ensure that we are in a strong position, financially and structurally, to take advantage of the markets eventual recovery. Look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Gigi, please close out the call. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining, and have a wonderful day.",

Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Abu Zeya, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Abu Zeya : Thank you Liz. Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton second quarter 2020 conference call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton\u2019s website for seven days. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO, and Lance Loeffler, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton\u2019s views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual result to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton\u2019s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of impairments and other charges. Additional details and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our second quarter press release and can also be found in the quarterly results and presentation section of our website.  After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow time for others who may be in the queue. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you Abu, and good morning everyone. The second quarter of 2020 is now behind us. It was a tough one for many industries, including the oil and gas sector. A global pandemic and the resulting collapse in demand have upended many businesses, and as economies around the world emerge from lockdowns, the path forward remains uneven and uncertain. I am grateful for our employees\u2019 focus, dedication and perseverance during these difficult times. Employee safety is our top priority and we continue our efforts to take the appropriate measures to provide a safe working environment for everyone. COVID-19 is altering our everyday live and business operations, and it is important that we do not let our guard down. Despite this distraction, our safety performance is the best it has ever been with our total recordable incident rate improving more than 20% since the end of last year.  There are three key areas I will address on the call today : first, our solid second quarter performance, demonstrating a significant reset that improves the earnings power of our business despite the severity of the activity collapse; second, the market and business outlook for the second half and full year of 2020; and finally, what we are doing today to make sure that Halliburton powers into and wins the eventual recovery. The global activity collapse in the second quarter was swift and severe, much worse than anticipated. U.S. average rig count for the quarter declined 50% sequentially while international rigs dropped 22% with absolute global rig count sinking to the lowest level in recent history. Halliburton\u2019s response to the market disruption was equally swift and aggressive. As I\u2019ll discuss in a few minutes, our organization responded with a tremendous sense of urgency. Let me cover a few headlines related to our financial performance. Total company revenue was $3.2 billion and adjusted operating income was $236 million. Our completion and production division revenue of $1.7 billion was impacted by a drop in market activity in the low teens in international markets and about 70% in U.S. land completions. Despite these headwinds, C&P delivered a solid operating margin of 9.5% in the second quarter. Our drilling and evaluation division revenue of $1.5 billion was down largely in line with lower rig count activity globally, delivering operating margin of 8.3% in the second quarter. The speed and effectiveness of the cost actions that we have executed helped minimize the sequential decremental margins to 14% in C&P and 16% in D&E.  Revenue for North America declined 57% sequentially with our C&P and D&E divisions outperforming the completions and drilling activity declines respectively. International revenue was down 17% sequentially, outperforming the rig count decline. Finally, we generated over $450 million in positive free cash flow in the second quarter. As reflected in these results, our aggressive cost actions are an important part of our earnings power reset. As you recall, we removed $300 million in costs over the prior two quarters. In April, we announced an additional $1 billion in annualized cost reductions. I\u2019m pleased to report today that these actions, which are largely permanent changes to our business, are 75% done. I expect the remaining cost reductions, which are mostly aimed at our international business and real estate rationalization, to be completed by the end of the third quarter. Let\u2019s now discuss our expectations for the second half of 2020. Internationally, we anticipate drilling activity to continue to decline modestly while completions stay resilient into year end. The activity changes have not been and will not be uniform across all international markets. On a full year basis, we expect activity in the OPEC countries in the Middle East and the Norwegian sector of the North Sea to be more resilient while Latin America and Africa decline sharply. Some customers are deferring new projects, most notably in the offshore exploration markets. Due to the deeper and longer pull back in Latin America, we now anticipate a mid-teens decline in international customer activity and spend for the full year.  In North America land, some green shoots of completion activity are emerging, but I would not characterize this as the start of a meaningful recovery. After customers bring back shut-in production and as WTI remains range bound around $40, we expect to see a modest uptick in completions activity during the third quarter followed by the usual seasonal deceleration at the end of the year. Drilling activity declines have slowed and we believe the rig count should find a bottom sometime in the third quarter, but a meaningful inflection point in drilling seems further out. Our full year customer spend outlook for North America remains unchanged at approximately 50% down compared to 2019, with gassier basins outperforming the oilier ones. Further demand weakness from a slower economic recovery or multiple waves of COVID-19 related activity shutdowns present downside risks to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Though we believe we\u2019re positioning our company to ride out those events should they occur, it is not possible to predict the impact that they may have. Regardless, as demonstrated this quarter, I expect Halliburton to outperform the market under any conditions. As we look into the future, I believe the international and North America markets will present opportunities for Halliburton. Although the timing of commodity price recovery remains uncertain, we are taking the necessary actions to thrive in the current market and to prepare Halliburton to win the eventual recovery. International producers have the opportunity to regain market share as a result of declining U.S. production. This should translate into healthy activity levels internationally as oil demand recovers. International shorter cycle barrels will likely fill a higher proportion of future incremental demand requirements. As economic growth returns, we expect the key producing regions to maintain productive spare capacity so they can quickly meet demand. Offshore, longer cycle barrels and new exploration activity will likely be the farthest out in terms of incremental contribution to the supply stack.  Today, we have an excellent international business both in terms of geographic footprint and technology portfolio. Pre-coronavirus, our international business grew revenue every quarter for almost three years, outperforming our largest competitor, and was on the road to meaningful margin improvement. International regions contributed nearly half of our revenue in 2019. They are also historically more resilient on margins, demonstrating the strength of our diverse business. Here\u2019s how we are preparing to win the recovery internationally. We\u2019re driving adoption and expansion of our latest technologies in the international markets. Our EarthStar logging-while-drilling tool has seen a 2.5 times increase in its adoption over the last year, even though it is one of our premium offerings. Our Cerebro in-bit sensor package provides a high speed look at data captured directly from the bit. Its international adoption has doubled this year compared to the first half of 2019. We\u2019ve successfully completed customer qualifications and are currently deploying the latest wire line tractors and ESP pumps in the Middle East.  We are growing and monetizing our digital offerings. They improve performance and efficiency and allow us to introduce new commercial models where all parties share in the benefits of our digital technologies. The Aker BP project in Norway is a demonstration of a customer successfully adopting digital technology to achieve best-in-class performance. We have collaborated with our alliance partners to deploy digitally enabled new technologies and innovative ways of working. Our contract structure, where all alliance partners benefit from these successes, fosters a collaborative culture and drives further performance improvement. We increased rate of penetration by 88% over the course of the well campaign and a third of the wells we drilled on a specific prospect were in the top decile of the industry benchmark for drilling speed. We made great strides in the digital transformation of the well planning cycle, rapidly working towards the goal of planning a well in a day. We applied digital 3D inversion, helping the customer improve their reservoir understanding. This led to re-planning of a whole reservoir section and potential incremental reserves for the customer. We are also advancing alliances with key industry players both within and outside of the oil and gas sector. We recently announced Halliburton and TechnipFMC collaborated to create Odyssey, the world\u2019s first distributed acoustic sensing solution for subsea wells. This collaboration strengthens our digital capabilities in subsea reservoir monitoring and production optimization. We recently signed a five-year strategic agreement with Microsoft and Accenture to advance Halliburton\u2019s digital capabilities in Microsoft Azure. This is an important step in our adoption of new technology and applications to enhance our digital capabilities and customer offerings, drive additional business agility, and reduce capital expenditures. We are also taking actions not only to thrive in the current market but to best position our business in the future. Streamlining our cost structure is part of a continuing effort to reduce our fixed costs and improving components of our working capital through a strong focus on managing collections, deploying digital inventory planning solutions, and extending vendor payment terms.  As oil demand recovers, I expect the international business will continue to be a more meaningful contributor to our revenue going forward. I believe that the actions we are taking provide the basis for margin expansion and higher free cash flow conversion internationally in the next up cycle. Turning to North America, we believe that North America production is likely to remain structurally lower in the foreseeable future and have slower growth going forward. With shrinking demand for shale oil and limited access to capital markets, the inevitable rationalization will continue and we expect to see a more disciplined market with stronger operators and service companies. The activity declines and intra-year cyclicality over the last two years led us to change our approach to this market, but what has not changed is our commitment to the single largest oilfield services market and to our leadership position in it. While the North America market will be structurally smaller, we believe that it will be more profitable for us. Our service delivery improvement strategy lowers our fixed and services costs and will drive higher contribution margin with the goal to make Halliburton the most competitive from a cost structure perspective. This strategy has resulted in sustainable changes to how we organize and execute every day in the business and positions us to deliver higher profitability and free cash flow in North America. Our playbook is clear - returns in cash generation matter more than ever, and growth for the sake of market share is a thing of the past. We believe that our size and scale combined with our ability to quickly respond to changing market conditions are strong advantages for us, helping to drive the unit costs down and enabling us to capture work across multiple basins and resource types. The $1.3 billion in cost cuts, a combination of the $300 million in prior cuts and the $1 billion in further reductions, are largely aimed at North America. Let me remind you what we have done to reset the earnings power in this key market. We are changing the fundamentals of how we deliver our services and I expect this will drive a higher contribution margin and lower our fixed costs. We reduced our maintenance cost per horsepower hour by over a third compared to the 2019 run rate by redesigning our maintenance and value engineering processes. This has been scale tested as a permanent change in how we execute our operations and is independent of the market activity levels.  We\u2019ve also made permanent reductions to our workforce. We have flattened our North America organization, removing layers of management. We are using digital and remote operations to reduce the number of frack engineers required to monitor jobs by establishing real-time operations centers and using cloud-based solutions to modernize data flow between the rig site and the back office. We are reducing our real estate footprint by over 100 facilities, which not only removes costs but fits with our digital and remote operations strategy.  In addition to these strategic changes, we will continue to take advantage of our unique competitive strengths. We offer a full suite of oilfield services through 13 product service lines in North America, and we will continue to emphasize our non-frack revenue streams, resulting in a more balanced business portfolio. We continue to deliver differentiated technologies across our product lines, many of them using advances in automation and digitalization. These technologies either lower our costs or improve production results for our customers. Finally and critically, none of the improvements internationally and in North America happen without our fantastic competitive and committed team focused on achieving all of these objectives and protecting the gains we make over time.  Turning to capital spending, 2020 will be the second year in a row that we have significantly reduced our capex, which will largely be directed towards our international business. Because we size our capital budget based on a committed project pipeline and anticipate returns, we believe that this year, just like in 2019, this capex reduction will not hamper our ability to outperform the market. We will continue to exercise thoughtful capital allocation to the best returning opportunities. The capital intensity of our business has come down and as we think about the future, we project that capex spend as a percentage of revenue will be closer to 5 to 6% versus the historical norms of 10 to 11%. There are several reasons why we were able to drive this change and positively impact our free cash flow going forward. We now build our equipment cheaper and it lasts longer. Advances in sensing technologies and material sciences are lowering the total cost of ownership for our tools. Design improvements such as component modularity make asset velocity better than ever. This means we need to build fewer tools to support the same level of business. For example, the iCruise drilling system has modular components and standardized electronic inserts for all tool sizes, allowing for 20% better asset velocity.  Digitalization reduces our capital footprint. We\u2019re removing equipment from location and replacing costly hardware with software solutions. We do not anticipate large technology recapitalization programs similar to the build-out of our leading Q10 pumps and the iCruise drilling systems. Finally, the North America business now has structurally lower capital requirements. It is a mature market and frack job intensity is plateauing.  The Halliburton I have just described to you is charting a fundamentally different course. The growth in digital technologies, the position of strength in the international markets, the sharper approach to North America, and a lower capex profile, all of that comes from the hard work that we have been doing over the last few years. We are not waiting for an up cycle to drive significant free cash flow and returns for our shareholders. We believe that the strategic actions we are taking today will further boost our earnings power and free cash flow generation ability as we power into and win the eventual recovery. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our second quarter financial results. Lance? Lance Loeffler : Thank you Jeff, and good morning. Let\u2019s start with a summary of our second quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2020. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.2 billion and adjusted operating income was $236 million, representing decreases of 37% and 53% respectively. In the second quarter, we recognized $2.1 billion of pre-tax impairments and other charges to further adjust our cost structure to current market conditions. These charges consisted primarily of non-cash asset impairments mainly associated with pressure pumping equipment and real estate, as well as inventory write-offs, severance, and other costs.  As a result of this charge, we realized a $49 million reduction in depreciation and amortization expense in the second quarter. This impact is reflected in our division results with approximately two-thirds associated with our C&P division and the remainder related to our D&E division. We expect our third quarter depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $225 million, reflecting one month of additional impact. As Jeff mentioned, by the end of the second quarter we also accomplished approximately 75% of the annualized $1 billion in cost reductions, and we intend to complete most of the remaining actions by the end of the third quarter. The cash cost associated with the various cost actions in the second quarter was approximately $180 million. We anticipate that we will incur an additional cash cost of approximately $60 million in the third quarter as we continue to make further structural adjustments.  Moving to our division results, our completion and production revenue was $1.7 billion, a decrease of 44%, while operating income was $159 million, a decrease of 54%. These declines were largely a result of a decrease in pressure pumping activity globally primarily driven by U.S. land and Latin America, coupled with lower artificial lift activity in U.S. land. These were partially offset by improved completion tool sales internationally. Our drilling and evaluation revenue was $1.5 billion, a decrease of 27%, while operating income was $127 million, a decrease of 41%. These declines were primarily due to a global reduction in drilling-related services and lower software sales internationally.  In North America, revenue was $1 billion, a 57% decrease. This decline was driven by reduced activity in U.S. land primarily associated with pressure pumping, well construction, artificial lift, and wire line activity coupled with reduced activity across multiple product service lines in the Gulf of Mexico. Latin America revenue was $346 million, a 33% decrease resulting primarily from decreased activity across multiple product service lines in Argentina, Colombia and Brazil, and lower software sales in Mexico.  Turning to Europe-Africa-CIS, revenue was $691 million, a 17% decrease resulting primarily from reduced well construction and pressure pumping activity and lower software sales across the region. This was partially offset by increased fluids activity and completion tool sales in Norway and improved cementing activity and completion tool sales in Russia. In the Middle East-Asia region, revenue was $1.1 billion, a 10% decrease largely resulting from reduced activity across the majority of product service lines in the Middle East, Malaysia and India, partially offset by improved drilling activity and completion tool sales in China and Kuwait.  In the second quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $50 million, and this amount should serve as the new quarterly run rate for the rest of the year.  Our interest expense for the quarter was $124 million. For the third quarter, we expect it will be closer to $130 million.  Other expense for the quarter was $48 million, primarily driven by our foreign exchange exposure and currency weakness in Argentina. Looking ahead, we expect it will be approximately $30 million for the third quarter.  Our normalized effective tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 25%, driven by certain discrete tax items and a lower earnings base. For the third quarter and full year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 24% and 20% respectively.  Capital expenditures for the quarter were $142 million and our full year 2020 capex estimate of $800 million remains unchanged.  Turning to cash flow, we generated $598 million of cash from operations during the second quarter. As anticipated, working capital was a source of cash. As activity declines globally, working capital has historically been a strong source of cash and we expect to see continued benefits from working capital for the rest of this year.  Free cash flow generation for the quarter was $456 million. Our year-to-date and expected earnings performance for the remainder of the year combined with working capital benefits and lower capex should result in full year free cash flow of over $1 billion. Finally, while we remain cautious about the forecasted pace of economic recovery and the potential for additional COVID-related shutdowns, let me provide you with some comments on how we see the third quarter playing out based on our outlook. Sequentially, we expect overall company revenue to decline low single digits in the third quarter. Lower average rig activity across most regions will impact our D&E division while modest completions activity improvements should drive C&P division revenue to be flat to slightly up. The full quarter benefit and continued execution of our cost reductions should offset the impact of lower activity on our profitability. As a result, we expect to deliver higher sequential operating income and modestly higher margin.  Let me now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thanks Lance. To sum up our discussion today, our second quarter performance in a touch market demonstrates our organization\u2019s ability to execute swiftly and aggressively, and we expect to complete our remaining cost actions in the third quarter. We have an excellent international business and it is ready to deliver margin expansion and higher free cash flow conversion in the next up cycle. The actions we have taken in North America, including our service delivery improvement strategy, we believe will enable us to have higher profitability and free cash flow even in a structurally lower environment.  We are moving full steam ahead with the deployment of digital technologies for our customers and internally, and finally Halliburton is charting a fundamentally different course. I believe the strategic actions we are taking today will further boost our earnings power and free cash flow generation ability as we power into and win the eventual recovery. Now let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. James West : Hey, good morning guys. Jeff Miller : Morning James. James West : Congrats on the execution in a really [indiscernible] quarter here. Jeff, you talk about this--you\u2019re charting a fundamentally different course, and I think it\u2019s definitely appropriate. We have a vision of the oilfield that I think aligns with your vision for the future of the oilfield - of course digital, lower capital intensity, higher returns are all part of that strategy. Could you maybe talk about where you are in the various parts of that journey, both the digital side, obviously the cost structure in North America - you\u2019re pretty far along in that and you talked about that, maybe the international and the technology delivery? Jeff Miller : Yes, thanks James, and again when I look through the noise of the COVID disruption and industry consolidation and rationalization, clearly we do focus on what is that new course, and we are working on those things right now. I talked about a number of them in my commentary, but we are focused on doubling down on the technology that\u2019s important, drilling, iCruise, EarthStar, Cerebro, digital, growing our lift in chemicals businesses, which I described in the commentary, and then feeding that technology into our fantastic international business, finally delivering on North America service delivery improvement strategy while at the same time demonstrating structurally lower capex built on capital efficiency in an organization that executes under any conditions. So yes, we are charting a different course.  Progress along digital, we\u2019d talk about each quarter different things that we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re making terrific progress around Halliburton 4.0, feel very good about the kinds of contracts we\u2019re signing today and the work that\u2019s being done behind the scenes to continue to advance that, and obviously you saw some of our announcements with partners this quarter. James West : Okay, so you feel good about the path you\u2019re charting here. What about on the customer side? It seems to me it\u2019s a fundamentally different mindset from the customers as well. What\u2019s their approach or their adoption of these new technologies, particularly on the digital side, and how is that progressing? Are they impediments to change now, or are they really aligning with your view and others views? Jeff Miller : Look, I\u2019ve always said that digital has to evolve. It\u2019s something that\u2019s built out over time, and it\u2019s done often with partners, so we\u2019ve talked about our partners, but yes, there is appetite for it, absolutely. I think that--when I think about it in terms of reservoir drilling and production, those are the bites that can digested today, and so that\u2019s why when we talk about progress and the things that we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re doing them in those sort of silos not because we view them long term as silos, but because that\u2019s the way that they can be digested right now. James West : I see, okay. Thanks Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Angie Sedita : Thanks, good morning. Really impressive quarter. It\u2019s almost unbelievable, the numbers are so good, so kudos to you guys.  International markets, as you touched on Jeff, really important for growth, and you highlighted some of the initiatives there. But can you talk a little bit about cost cutting opportunities and the opportunity to further improve margins? Obviously D&E margins had a nice move in Q1, but can you talk about additional efforts there on the cost cutting side, and then I know there\u2019s a focus on generating more free cash flow out of the international markets, so maybe--and it is over 50% of your revenue, so maybe talk a little bit further about international. Jeff Miller : Yes, thanks Angie. Look, I think we are positioned in the right markets, the strong markets. We\u2019ve got the technology uptake that\u2019s so important in those markets, and then what we\u2019re doing around lower capital efficiency, or improving capital efficiency, plays straight into that. I expect that we will continue to see progress in those markets, and they will be stronger over time. Angie Sedita : Okay, so maybe you can talk a little bit about the evolution here in your capex profile. I think that\u2019s really shone through here in \u201919 and \u201920 in becoming a lower capital intensive company, and really re-thinking the U.S. land market. Maybe can you talk a little further about that capex profile, how you\u2019re looking at the market differently particularly in the U.S., and the long term ability to generate more cash flow, free cash flow? Jeff Miller : Yes, thank you. When I think about the type of equipment we\u2019re building and actually using equipment more efficiently, lowering the cost of that equipment, those are all the kinds of things that we look at. Obviously we\u2019re focused on improving returns, using our digital capabilities to eliminate costs. We\u2019ve removed roughly 100 facilities, but we only removed 100 facilities by changing the way we work dramatically so that it just takes less capital, and that plays into everything from maintenance to where people work, etc. That\u2019s sort of a North America view. Now, those same skills and capabilities are applicable everywhere in the world, and so I expect us to continue to drive cost out of our business. That\u2019s really--so when I talk about charting a different course, digital international strength and then a leaner organization that drives technology and efficiency, I think leaner and efficiency and the technology applications will be driving cost out all of the time, including internationally. Angie Sedita : Great, thanks Jeff. I\u2019ll turn it over. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons. Your line is now open. Bill Herbert : Good morning, and thank you. Lance, a couple questions for you on cash flow. First of all, do you expect the working capital harvest in the second half of the year to be as substantial as it was in Q2? And then also, difficult to be precise in [indiscernible] with regard to-- Lance Loeffler : Bill, you\u2019re breaking up on me. I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t get all of your question. Bill Herbert : Sorry, can you hear me now? Lance Loeffler : It\u2019s a little muffled. Bill Herbert : Yes, okay. The question was, one, working capital as a source of cash, is it as substantial in the second half of the year as it was in the second quarter? Then with regard to your cash cost saves, difficult to answer, but in the event of a change in regime in November, how do you think about it with regard to your cash costs, as in do you have enough cash--do you have enough tax shield to offset a rise in the corporate tax rate? Thanks. Lance Loeffler : Yes, so let me address the first part of your question, which is, I think, the working capital unwind and the momentum in the second half of the year. Clearly we had a strong cash flow associated with the unwind in working capital in Q2. I suspect that that momentum continues into Q3 and Q4. It may not be as strong just because we had such--you know, with the revenue declines just in the course of Q2 and the unwind around receivables, and then offset by payables, it was good to see. The organization continues to be really efficient on how we continue to wring out the cash flow generated for working capital. It may not be as strong as the third quarter but I still expect momentum to--excuse me, the second quarter, but I still expect momentum from the unwind to continue to occur in Q3 and Q4. Can you repeat the second question? I think you were talking about administrative expenses, but again, Bill, it\u2019s kind of hard to pick you up. Bill Herbert : Yes, sorry about this. [Indiscernible] in the event that we have a change in regime in early November, I guess what Biden\u2019s talking about is a 28% corporate tax rate. I\u2019m just curious as to whether with your tax shield, net operating losses, losses etc., do you expect to be [indiscernible] in 2021? Lance Loeffler : No, we don\u2019t, Bill. We\u2019ve got--certainly we do have the NOLs associated--I mean, look, there\u2019s always other ways that Halliburton continues to pay tax, cash taxes, but at the federal tax level we expect that we\u2019ll have tax shields from NOLs. Bill Herbert : Thank you very much. Lance Loeffler : Thanks Bill. Operator : Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Sean Meakim : Thank you, good morning. Lance Loeffler : Good morning, Sean. Sean Meakim : So the decrementals were very impressive - you know, a huge difference compared to what we saw in 2015 and 2016. I was hoping we could just get a better sense of the run rate for C&P going forward. Impairments helped with lower D&A, I appreciate you quantifying that for 3Q. It looks like a 400 basis point assistance from 1Q to 3Q. Were there margin benefits from the inventory write-downs? I\u2019m just curious if completions activity gets a little better in 3Q, does the margin follow at the EBITDA line, so looking past EBIT to the EBITDA line? Lance Loeffler : Yes, look - I think the changes that we\u2019ve described, and based on the guidance we\u2019ve given, I think this has been a--you know, the margins that we\u2019ve reset today clearly have been helped by some of the accounting changes and the impairments that we\u2019ve taken over the first part of the year. But look, it\u2019s not to say that we haven\u2019t done a significant amount of work around the cost cuts, which we believe are permanent. It goes across everything that we\u2019re doing, whether it\u2019s drilling, digital, production, frack in North America as Jeff has described, and so I think in terms of our margin progression, we\u2019re going to continue to work that as hard as we can. We\u2019ve still got some room to continue to improve on that cost cutting journey, as we described in our remarks, and I think it sets us up ultimately that when activity moves up, all of this is done with the expectation that we ultimately have stronger incrementals with these permanent cost cuts and changes. Jeff Miller : Let me just follow that up with--I mean, the way to look at things in my view is what\u2019s that new course look like, and that new course looks like substantially lower costs, like a reset around costs, where we\u2019re directing our energies towards digital being much sharper in North America around how we invest, what we do, and how we manage that cost structure, internationally continuing to protect and pour technology in that market, and then the structurally lower capex. That all comes from changing things that we\u2019re doing, and so we are changing many businesses processes and just the way we view things, which ultimately drives substantially lower costs and resets margins and cash flow higher. Sean Meakim : Right, got it. I appreciate that. So then just as a follow-up, if we think that EBIT will be higher quarter over quarter, modestly higher margins as a percentage, does that follow same for EBITDA? Do you think EBITDA can grow quarter over quarter? Lance Loeffler : Well, I think the implications with everything that we\u2019ve described, Sean, on our prepared remarks will tell you that EBITDA is relatively flat, even though the top line is coming down. Sean Meakim : Got it. Very helpful, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is now open. David Anderson : Hey, good morning Jeff. Obviously international is a bigger part of your business now going forward. Just wondering, in your outlook as you think about international markets, how they\u2019re trending, how you\u2019ve thought about pricing in that outlook, and in particular in the second half of the year. Hearing some reports about pricing concessions being asked for the NOCs, particularly in the Middle East, so I was just wondering if you could talk about that and whether you think that\u2019s a concern or risk for the industry. I know you have a lot of other contracts, LSTK contracts and whatnot, so maybe you can just talk about both sets, if you wouldn\u2019t mind, please? Jeff Miller : Yes, I think the fact is pricing never recovered internationally, and at this point we haven\u2019t seen many tenders so we don\u2019t have much of a view of that. But bottom line is there\u2019s much less capital internationally - I mean, the excess capital just isn\u2019t there maybe the way that it is in the U.S., so that\u2019s probably getting sorted out in the U.S. as well. Most of the dialog has been more around working on efficiencies, how to drive more efficient operations both for our customers and for us, and less so around pricing. It doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t get asked about, but at the same time the only effective path forward is to drive better efficiency, utilization of technology, and that sort of thing internationally. I\u2019d say that applies to NOCs and IOCs. David Anderson : So you\u2019re not being asked to cut your--I didn\u2019t mean on new tenders, I meant on existing work, you\u2019re not being asked to cut price on existing work? Jeff Miller : Yes, I understand, and I would say that certainly the first response is let\u2019s look for ways to drive better efficiency, not address pricing, because most of these contracts that are in place today were lit arguably at the bottom international cycle, which was in 2016. David Anderson : Fair point. You mentioned digital quite a bit on today\u2019s call. Just curious about something as you\u2019re looking forward. In terms of where you want to be, let\u2019s just think two or three years down the road here, do you think you can pull all the technology out internally; in other words, can you create all this organically, or do you need to look outside? I guess if I look back in the past, looking back in the mid-90s, technology acquisitions were critical obviously to you and some of your biggest competitors - I\u2019m thinking about Landmark, or course. How are you thinking about that going forward? Is that something you\u2019re going to have look outside of Halliburton? Is it a combination? Just your broader views on that, please. Jeff Miller : Yes, broadly I treat that the same as we do most of our M&A, in the sense that when we see opportunities to accelerate R&D or we see things that are important adds, we make them, and we\u2019ve continued to do smaller transactions around our digital offerings, so we\u2019re very thoughtful around the build versus buy approach, and that\u2019s a lot of the valuation. We feel like we can, through partners and others, get into all of the things we need to do and deliver platform solutions, and so there\u2019s not a big transformational thing that\u2019s in our minds. More importantly in my view is continuing to advance the R&D around digital. David Anderson : Thanks Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Chase Mulvehill : Hey, good morning everybody. I guess we\u2019ll kind of stick on this digital and remote operations that you guys have been talking about through the quarter, the past couple quarters. I guess first, how should we think about the structural margin improvement from these cost savings initiatives on the remote operations and automation side, and how much benefit did you see in 2Q? Then the second part of the question is really how easily can competitors replicate this strategy over time? Jeff Miller : Yes, thanks Chase. Q2, I mean, the digital technology and the digital approach that we are taking is what enables the cost reductions that we are--a large part of the cost reductions that we\u2019re seeing in Q2. I wouldn\u2019t describe it as enough activity to actually drive the kind of incremental--I mean, it will drive terrific incrementals as we see any activity grow, but the ability--I\u2019m going to stick with real estate rationalization just as a proxy for the kind of things that can be removed when we use the digital solutions that we have internally. For our customers, I think I described in my remarks at least one example around how digital solutions are driving much better performance, both for our customers and for ourselves, and so I think that we will continue to see that play a role.  Replicating digital at scale is very difficult. I mean, I think that will prove to be--I know what\u2019s involved in it for us, and I know that we\u2019re working with some of the very best partners in the industry, and it\u2019s not--it takes a lot of work on our part and a lot of discipline around platform outcomes that are scalable and reliable all the time, so I think that I\u2019m quite confident about where we\u2019re going. Chase Mulvehill : Okay, great. Appreciate the color. One quick follow-up on the capex side. You mentioned 5 to 6% of revenues being spent on capex. Can you confirm that that\u2019s a long-term capex number and maybe how much of that is maintenance versus growth, and then if this implies that maybe on the international side that the market share gain strategy is less of a focus over the medium to longer term? Jeff Miller : Yes, I think that the 5 to 6% versus the 10 to 11 is a longer term outlook that\u2019s based on capital efficiency, just to how we build things and how we take them to market, how fast we move them around, all of the things that drive lower capital requirements. I believe those changes are largely permanent also.  When I think about how that plays out internationally, I think that same efficiency, a lot of the technology and tools that I described particularly around capital efficiency, whether it\u2019s iCruise or Cerebro or some of those technologies, are inherently lower capital requirements when they\u2019re being used. Obviously we went through a period of building that out over the last year, but operationally they operate at probably 20% less--you know, more efficient, better velocity. I think we have that to reap internationally over time. Chase Mulvehill : Perfect. All right, I\u2019ll turn it back over. Thanks Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Scott Gruber : Yes, good morning. Lance Loeffler : Good morning Scott. Scott Gruber : The big question for you and peers has been how to make a profit in a smaller U.S. market, and you guys obviously took a great stride here in Q2 to proving that\u2019s very possible. Lance, you mentioned strong incrementals during the recovery here, and I realize we\u2019re just starting to poke out heads out of the bunker from one of the worst downturns we\u2019ve ever seen, but if we do get back to 500 or 600 rigs operating in the U.S., which is more or less consensus I think, what\u2019s a reasonable range to think about where C&P margins could rise to? Lance Loeffler : Scott, I\u2019ll talk to that. Look, I think as you look into the future and to what the recovery may look like in North America, and the picture that you painted around activity, I think this is going to continue to be a good business that delivers mid-teens margins and produce a heck of a lot of free cash flow. Given the things that we\u2019ve talked about on this call today operationally and the way that we\u2019re becoming sharper in North America with our service delivery improvement initiatives, on top of just structurally lower capex requirements to achieve that business, drives a really nice free cash flow profile, we believe. Jeff Miller : Yes, and I think in North America--go ahead? Sorry. Scott Gruber : No, go ahead, Jeff. Jeff Miller : I\u2019ll only add one thing to that, because as we look at North America, if we just sort of assumed a flat level of production in \u201921 and then we moved that forward into \u201822, we see all of the attrition and tightening that is happening. I think we were well on this path at the end of last year coming into this year, and we saw solid performance in Q1. We expect we get back to a market that\u2019s probably size and shape, at least from the supply and demand of equipment standpoint, something that looks like Q1 2020 sometime further out, and the approach that we\u2019re taking, I think will work very well for us. Scott Gruber : Got it. Then just given your technology investments on the D&E side and given the cost reset on that side of the business as well, kind of just where you stand in terms of the market share gains internationally, do you think when we\u2019re at mid cycle in the next cycle, is the gap between C&P margin and D&E margins much smaller than what we\u2019ve seen in the last few cycles? Jeff Miller : Yes, I would expect so. I mean, again we have expectations that that business continues to improve also, and we were well on the way to doing that really up until we got into the pandemic situation and where we are today, but none of the fundamentals have changed around what we\u2019re doing other than, I think, a sharper cost structure around these things. Scott Gruber : Appreciate it, thank you. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Your line is now open. Marc Bianchi : Thank you. I wanted to ask first on the third quarter outlook for completions. I think you mentioned up for your North America C&P business. Do you see that outperforming the market; in other words, do you think that the market could be flat to down but Halliburton\u2019s up, or do you also see the market up in the third quarter? Jeff Miller : For completions, I think we\u2019re off the bottom in May and I think you\u2019ll see a little bit of an uptick in Q3 as DUCs get completed. Drilling, we think will be down a little bit, and I think that will be many of our customers managing decline rates into the end of the year. But you know, our view of the market is it stays with making returns and taking on the work that we believe we can execute well, so I think that\u2019s what the overall market will do and I think we\u2019ll be in around that. Marc Bianchi : Great, thanks for that, Jeff. Then you guys had mentioned in the press release and then a few times on this call about winning the recovery. Maybe if you could offer for us a little bit more color on what that means, what are the metrics we should be looking for from you guys in terms of claiming victory on that front? Jeff Miller : I think that\u2019s returns and cash flows. We spent a lot of time talking about free cash flow and returns, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re setting up for today. I think we get well through whatever this period of time is until we see commodity prices tighten. I think we do well through this near term, but then when we start to see tightening, we\u2019re going to have the right cost structure that scales very efficiently with strong incrementals, and it delivers a lot of free cash flow and very, very good returns. That\u2019s what winning the recovery looks like to me. Marc Bianchi : Is there a threshold? Is there a target that we should be looking for, percentage of revenue in terms of free cash-- Jeff Miller : I think we ought to get closer to that point before we start setting targets around that, but my expectations are that it\u2019s a very strong performance by Halliburton. But it\u2019s out there a ways. Marc Bianchi : Great, thank you. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Kurt Hallead : Hey, good morning. Jeff Miller : Morning Kurt. Kurt Hallead : Jeff, I was just kind of curious, when you provided the outlook here for the second half of 2020, you indicated an uptick in completion activity in the third quarter and then a seasonal decline in the fourth quarter. I\u2019m just curious on that, just given how rapid the decline in that overall activity was and how sharp the decline in overall spending has been for 2020, so I guess you\u2019re picking up that dynamic from your discussions with customers, so they\u2019re going to get a little more active in the third quarter and just pull back again in the fourth? It seems a little bit counterintuitive, just given how sharply spend and activity has already been cut. Jeff Miller : Yes, look - I think it\u2019s going to rest more around DUC activity as we go into the second half of the year, so on a relative basis, more pronounced Q3, less pronounced Q4 would be my impression. I think every customer is working their own strategy around what do they need to do as they go into 2021, which will be obviously a time where some stability needs to return to productive capacity and those sorts of things. So is it more modest in Q4? It may be, but my overall outlook is it will be relatively biased even if you just take into account holidays and all the sorts of things that happen in Q4, along with weather. This isn\u2019t the kind of market where you power through terrible weather in an effort to try to get to some point, I don\u2019t think, in Q4. Kurt Hallead : Okay, that\u2019s good color. Just maybe one quick follow-up here. It looks like the run rate on capex will be a little bit higher in the second half than it was in the first half. You indicated that your capex is project pipeline driven, so is it safe to assume here that you\u2019re starting to see an increase in potential project activity going out into 2021? Jeff Miller : No, I think what we see are some long lead time items that we do. We talked about projects being deferred but not necessarily cancelled, so we have to manage all of that together, so precisely where those things fall in the calendar is where they fall. I think what\u2019s most important to think about around capital really is the overall efficiency that we\u2019ve driven into both the tools, the process, the asset velocity which will structurally help us keep that at a much lower point than it has been in the past. Kurt Hallead : Okay, great. Appreciate that follow-up. Thanks. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question and answer session for today. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks. Operator : Jeff Miller : Thank you Liz. Before we wrap up today\u2019s call, I\u2019d like to leave you with a few closing comments. Our second quarter performance demonstrates Halliburton\u2019s ability to execute swiftly and aggressively. The actions we have taken in North America we believe will enable higher profitability and free cash flow, even in a structurally lower environment. We have an excellent international business and are moving full steam ahead with the deployment of digital technologies, both for our customers and internally. Most importantly, Halliburton is charting a fundamentally different course. I believe the strategic actions we are taking today will meaningfully reset our earnings power and free cash flow ability as we power into and win the eventual recovery. I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Liz, please close out the call. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for joining, and have a wonderful day.",

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Abu Zeya, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Abu Zeya : Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton third quarter 2020 conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO, and Lance Loeffler, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of severance and other charges. Additional details and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our third quarter press release and can also be found in the quarterly results and presentation section of our website. After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow time for others who may be in the queue. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you, Abu. And Good morning, everyone. The third quarter saw world economy slowly emerge from lockdowns, oil prices move off their lows and the return of shut in production. Demand recovery is starting to unfold while under investment in global oil production capacity, OPEC+ actions and expectations for effective COVID-19 treatments are providing support to commodity prices. However, the pace and magnitude of recovery going forward will vary greatly by geography and customer type, with resurgence of COVID-19 in certain economies presenting near term risks.  Despite these challenges, we continue to execute on our value proposition both for our customers and our company. Every day, our employees collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers, and they're doing it with the best service quality and safety in our history.  Our third quarter financial performance reflects the results of this execution. Let me share some highlights. Total company revenue was about $3 billion, down 7%, and adjusted operating income was $275 million, an improvement of 17% compared to the second quarter of 2020.  Our Completion and Production division revenue declined 6% sequentially, while operating income improved 33%, delivering an operating margin improvement of 4% compared to the second quarter. These results demonstrate the impact of our structural cost reductions and improved utilization in North America land. Our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue and operating income were down 8% and 17% respectively compared to the second quarter of 2020. D&E's top line outperformed rig count declines both internationally and in the US. International revenue was down 7% sequentially as international rig count trended lower by 12%, highlighting the diversity and strength of our international franchise. North America revenue decreased 6% sequentially. Completions activity increases in North America land were more than offset by lower activity in the Gulf of Mexico and lower overall drilling activity as US rig counts declined 35% sequentially.  I'm pleased to report that our $1 billion in structural cost reductions are complete.  And lastly, we generated approximately $730 million of free cash flow through the first three quarters of this year and are on track to generate over $1 billion in free cash flow for the full year. Before we discuss the details of our third quarter performance, I'd like to say something to our outstanding employees. I appreciate that the last several months have been far from easy. You have experienced disruption and uncertainty both in your personal and work lives. More than ever, you've had to balance taking care of yourselves and your families with your work duties. Through it all, you have performed admirably. You have continued to deliver outstanding products and services to our customers, breaking service quality and safety records along the way.  In April, no one would have predicted the operational and financial success that Halliburton has achieved over the last six months. You should realize these results are your results. They're due to your hard work and perseverance in very challenging times. I'm very proud of you all. Halliburton is charting a fundamentally different course. We will continue to take strategic actions designed to boost our earnings power and free cash flow generation both today and as we power into and when the eventual recovery.  As markets around the world begin to stabilize, our five strategic priorities will drive Halliburton's future success. First, we continue to focus on our strong international business. We're outperforming in the international markets and plan to balance future growth with the objective of improving margins and returns. Second, our strategic priority for a leaner, more profitable North American business is well underway as demonstrated by the last two quarters. We will continue to focus on profit, not share, in this more consolidated market, which will remain a key component of the global supply stack.  Third, digital drives everything we do. Our digital framework, Halliburton 4.0, permeates all aspects of our business and enables the success of our other strategic priorities. As digital deployment and integration across the value chain accelerates, we believe that we'll continue to grow our current business, create new revenue opportunities and drive better returns for Halliburton. Fourth, our capital intensity is structurally lower, with future CapEx expected to be 5% to 6% of revenue. This provides a tailwind to our strong free cash flow generation.  Lastly, Halliburton is committed to a sustainable energy future in which oil and gas continues to play a critical role. On today's call, I will discuss how our third quarter financial performance reflects the impact of these strategic priorities and how our future actions align with them.  Our third quarter demonstrated again that we have a strong international business. It is delivering margin expansion now and we expect it to drive higher returns in the eventual recovery.  For the second quarter in a row, nearly two-thirds of our revenue came from international operations. And both our Drilling and Evaluation and Completion and Production divisions now earn the majority of their revenue in the international markets.  Our business mix and footprint in specific geographies, along with exposure to long-term integrated projects, support our comparative revenue outperformance and more constructive international outlook for 2020. We outperformed the 12% sequential international rig count declines in the third quarter and are trending significantly better than the 20% reported rig count reductions year to date. Despite the well-known activity slowdowns, our international margins improved sequentially, with several key end markets demonstrating margin improvement year-on-year.  As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we see the pace of activity declines in the international markets slowing and believe we are getting closer to an activity bottom. In the meantime, service companies are being prudent with their capital, which results in limited access equipment. This should lead to a tighter market even without an increase in new activity.  While we believe a broader recovery across all regions will still take time, Halliburton is well positioned to outperform the market. Here are a few examples. Over the last few years, we've made significant investments in our directional drilling and open hole wireline technologies that are critical to our success in the international markets. These investments are paying off. For example, this year in the eastern hemisphere, we've drilled 5.5 times more footage with our iCruise tools compared to last year despite the decline in rig activity.  Adding to our existing business lines, another important component of Halliburton's strength in the international markets is the ongoing expansion of our production businesses. Today, we have a small international market share in the service segment, which gives us plenty of room to grow. And we are growing.  I'm pleased to announce that, earlier this month, Halliburton was awarded a seven-year contract for electric submersible pumps by a Middle Eastern NOC. We also completed our first ESB installations in a growing geothermal market in Europe.  Halliburton 4.0 supercharges our already strong international business. We use open architecture and digital technologies that drive connectivity and deliver performance to collaborate with our customers and partners, pioneering new approaches to subsurface understanding, well construction and reservoir and production. Our digital innovation and its adoption by our customers are reframing operator project economics through greater efficiencies and improved decision-making. We believe this creates technological differentiation for us, and we expect it will drive higher returns.  Today, as more customers contract for integrated services packages, we continue to benefit from our strong project management capabilities that deliver efficiencies and reduce total cost of ownership for our customers.  Going forward, Halliburton Well Construction 4.0 will enable our project management business to deliver more efficient wells by reducing planning time, improving drilling performance, and lowering well construction costs and risks. Well Construction 4.0 provides a singular interface for wellsite performance management. Its open architecture environment enables seamless integration and collaboration of our premium technologies, like Cerebro intelligent bits, LOGIX automated drilling software, and BaraLogix real time density and rheology with any third-party service or application. As part of Halliburton Production 4.0, we have formed a new alliance with Honeywell to use our digital technologies to optimize our customers assets like a manufacturing plant, fundamentally changing the way surface and subsurface are simultaneously managed. This helps our customers optimize their production. Halliburton delivers reservoir modeling, well and field surveillance, ESB optimization and well intervention. Honeywell brings its expertise and topside automation, surface equipment performance monitoring and productivity solutions. This is not simply an expectation for tomorrow. This is digital in action today for customers like PTTEP in Thailand.  Our current strengths and new capabilities in the international markets are critical to our future success. The international short cycle producers have an opportunity to regain market share as a result of declining US oil production. As demand starts to improve and outgrow supply, it should encourage international investments in both oil and gas. And our strong international business that now delivers the majority of our revenues is ready to power into the eventual recovery.  The next strategic priority I want to discuss today is driving a leaner, more profitable North America. Last quarter, I described to you in detail the actions we took to reset our earnings power in this key market. To recap, we now have 50% less structural headcount and a 50% smaller real estate footprint in North America compared to last year. These and other changes to how we're organized and how we execute every day are sustainable and independent of market activity levels. I believe our efficient, disciplined execution in the North American market, together with these structural changes, will drive margin improvements and free cash flow.  Halliburton executed exceptionally well in North America this quarter. Our D&E division outperformed the sequential rig count declines and our C&P division grew and drove overall margin improvement for North America, despite the hurricane season negatively impacting Gulf of Mexico activity. This proves that our cost actions and service delivery process improvements are delivering the intended results. As the leading completions provider in North America, Halliburton has exposure to every basin and every customer group. The month-on-month land completions activity improvement in the third quarter was a welcome sign. But September stage counts were still below April activity levels, and overall stages completed in US land showed a modest sequential increase for the full quarter. We intend to stay disciplined in how we deploy our fracturing fleets into the recovering market.  Looking ahead to the fourth quarter. We expect North America land completions activity to increase by double digit percentage as operators deplete their DUC inventory. We expect rig counts to lag completions and not step up materially before year-end.  As we predicted, the North America market structure is improving, with both consolidation and rationalization. We've seen a steady flow of consolidation announcements from operators as well as service companies. As I see it, the US shale industry will continue to slim down and, as a result, emerge healthier in a relatively more sustainable growth environment in the future. And this plays to Halliburton strength and our disciplined strategy.  The supply/demand balance for US fracturing capacity is also improving. We estimate that close to 30% of hydraulic fracturing equipment has been permanently retired this year. We expect more will follow as demand remains structurally lower.  Insufficient returns and a lack of reinvestment by service companies should accelerate the cannibalization of idle equipment for parts and the use of sideline pumps to beef up working fleets. We anticipate a tighter balance between horsepower supply and demand as the US achieves more stable production levels.  As we look ahead, we expect pricing to work its way through a couple of predictable steps. The first step, which we're starting to see now, is a recovering demand for active capacity. The first warm stack fleet reactivations are unlikely to see meaningful pricing improvement, but they will increase utilization and revenue on a lower cost base and make a positive contribution to earnings.  The second step will happen when activity recovers enough to call on cold stacked equipment to return to the market. I expect that higher pricing will be necessary to justify incremental investments.  As with our International business, Halliburton 4.0 is driving innovation in North America. Last week, for example, we announced an industry first, the launch of our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing system. SmartFleet marries our digital capabilities and fracturing expertise to do what was not possible until now, give customers control over frac performance in real time. The decisions our customers make about well spacing and multiple pad development have a big impact on their unconventional asset economics. With service efficiencies plateauing and capital remaining constrained, operators strive to make every stage as productive as possible.  Before SmartFleet, however, they faced a high level of uncertainty related to fracture placement and performance. SmartFleet changes this. Its intelligent automation integrates real time fracture measurements, live 3D visualization, and real time fracture commands to give operators control over fracture outcomes while pumping. It sets us apart from the rest of the hydraulic fracturing market and solidifies our industry leadership in intelligent fracturing. SmartFleet and other Halliburton 4.0 digital offerings will continue to address our customers toughest reservoir challenges and improve the efficiency of our service delivery.  In the near term, I expect the divergence of rig and completions activity will create choppiness as balance sheets are repaired and reinvestment rates continue to adjust. However, we believe that our strategic priority for a leaner and more profitable North America will enable us to successfully navigate through this market contraction and power into the eventual recovery.  Let me now discuss capital efficiency, a key enabler of all our strategic priorities. We believe we can maintain our reduced CapEx at 5% to 6% of revenue, and that it will contribute to sustainable free cash flow generation for our business. We will keep investing in the development of new technologies and strategically fund international growth as the market recovery unfolds. This includes digitalization of our tools and processes that together with material science and design advancements drive down cost and extend the life of our equipment. At the same time, we will continue to exercise thoughtful capital allocation to the best returns opportunities.  The last strategic priority I will discuss today is Halliburton's commitment to a sustainable energy future. We recognize that the energy landscape is evolving, and alternative energy sources are growing. We're executing our strategies to meet these changes.  First, oil and gas will play a key role in providing the world with affordable and reliable energy long into the future. And we will continue to deploy innovative solutions, including our full digital portfolio to meet that demand.  We will also invest in the future directly through innovation and our recently launched Halliburton Labs. Today, our digital and other technologies help our customers decarbonize their legacy production base and reach their emissions reduction goals. For example, our digitally enabled iCruise rotary steerable system allows customers to drill wells faster and reduce the number of days a diesel powered rig is on their location, which helps cut down on emissions.  We also help our customers achieve their carbon neutral goals through carbon capture and storage. We provide a variety of services in this space, from subsurface assessment and characterization to well construction and fiber optics monitoring and verification solutions. Our current technology portfolio support CCS projects all around the world \u2013 in Australia, Europe and North America.  We also have decades of experience in providing geothermal drilling services. Halliburton delivers a full range of innovative technologies to address the ultra-high temperature environments, from directional drilling, cementing, fluids, pumping services, logging and casing inspection and project management led developments of geothermal fields. To date, we have participated in operations in all the key geothermal producing areas of the world.  For our own portfolio of services and equipment, we continue to do what we do best \u2013 innovate, collaborate and invest in lowering the emissions profile of our technologies. We have shown steady improvement over the years reducing our scope one and two emissions. In the coming months, we are committed to establishing and sharing our greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets and reporting on our progress. Finally, I'm excited about the formation of Halliburton Labs, which we announced in the third quarter. It is a collaborative environment where entrepreneurs, academics, investors, and industrial labs come together to advance cleaner, affordable energy. Halliburton receives a minor equity stake in early stage clean energy companies in exchange for their access to our early stage clean energy companies in exchange for their access to our world class facilities, technical expertise, and business network.  But more importantly, Halliburton labs provides us with a wealth of knowledge and an opportunity to play an important role in developing sustainable affordable energy solutions.  Were excited about Halliburton Labs advisory board consisting of leading academics and thought leaders, whose first members include Rice University's Reggie des Roches, Caltech's John Grotzinger and Tulane's Walter Isaacson. I will now turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our financial results. Lance? Lance Loeffler : Thank you, Jeff. Let's begin this morning with an overview of our third quarter results compared to the second quarter of 2020. Total company revenue for the quarter was about $3 billion, representing a 7% decrease, and adjusted operating income was $275 million, or an increase of 17%. These results were primarily driven by continuing rig count declines across multiple regions, partially offset by increased activity in Latin America and higher completions activity in North America land as well as the continued impact of our global cost savings. In the third quarter, we recognized $133 million of pretax severance and other charges to further adjust our cost structure to current market conditions. The cash component of this charge was approximately $80 million.  Let me cover some of the details related to our divisional results. In our Completion and Production division, revenue decreased $98 million or 6%, while operating income increased $53 million or 33%. The revenue decline was driven by reduced completion tool sales across Europe/Africa/CIS, the Gulf of Mexico, and Latin America, coupled with lower cementing activity in the Middle East, Asia and North America land. It was partially offset by higher stimulation activity and artificial lift sales in North America land, higher activity across multiple product service lines in Argentina, as well as increased pipeline services in Europe/Africa/CIS. Improvements related to stimulation activity in North America land and the impact of our cost reductions drove the overall margin increase.  In our Drilling and Evaluation, revenue decreased $123 million or 8%, while operating income decreased $22 million or 17%. These declines were primarily due to reduced drilling related and wireline services activity in North America and eastern hemisphere, coupled with lower project management activity in the Middle East Asia. They were partially offset by improved drilling activity in Latin America. Moving on to our geographical results. In North America, revenue decreased $65 million, or 6%. This decline was primarily driven by decreased well construction activity in US land, coupled with reduced activity across multiple product service lines in the Gulf of Mexico, partially offset by higher stimulation activity and artificial lift sales in US land.  In Latin America, revenue increased $34 million or 10%, resulting primarily from increased activity across multiple product service lines in Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico, partially offset by reduced activity in Ecuador and lower completion tool sales in Guyana.  Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue decreased $42 million or 6%. This decline was primarily driven by lower completion tool sales across the region, reduced drilling related services in Norway, and a decline in fluids and cementing activity in Russia.  These reductions were partially offset by increased activity across multiple product service lines in Azerbaijan and a seasonal increase in pipeline services in Europe. In Middle East/Asia, revenue decreased $148 million or 13%, largely resulting from reduced well construction activity across the region, lower project management and wireline activity in the Middle East and decreased project management activity in India. These declines were partially offset by higher completion tool sales in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.  In the third quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $42 million, which was positively impacted by an insurance reimbursement. For the fourth quarter, we estimate that our corporate expense will return to previously announced run rate of $50 million.  Net interest expense for the quarter was $122 million, which included higher interest income from our international subsidiaries. We expect net interest expense closer to $128 million in the fourth quarter.  Our adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 24%. We expect our fourth quarter tax rate to be approximately 15% based on the market environment and our expected geographic earnings mix. Our full year adjusted effective tax rate should be approximately 21%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $155 million and we now expect full-year 2020 CapEx to be less than $800 million. Turning to cash flow, we generated $265 million in free cash flow during the third quarter, primarily driven by our increased operating income and continued working capital improvements. As a result, we improved our cash position during the third quarter ending the period with $2.1 billion in cash. We expect to continue generating positive cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter and expect to deliver full-year free cash flow of over $1b. Now, turning to our short-term operational outlook, let me provide you with our thoughts on the fourth quarter. For our Completion and Production division, we expect higher North America completions activity and traditional year-end completion tool sales which are more muted than in prior years. With that said, we expect revenue to be up approximately 10% and margins to remain flat sequentially. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate a slight sequential increase in our drilling related activity and expect to see typical year-end software sales. As such, revenue for the division should be up mid-single digits with operating margins moving modestly higher by 25 to 50 basis points. I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff? Jeff Miller : Thanks, Lance. To sum up, we're charting a fundamentally different course. I believe our execution of the five key strategic priorities will deliver success for Halliburton now and into the future.  Our strong international business is already delivering returns and margin expansion and I expect that will continue in the next upcycle. Our leaner North America business will enable us to successfully navigate through the market contraction and will be more profitable as the market recovers. Halliburton 4.0 is part of everything we do and enables the success of the other strategic priorities. It will grow our current business, create new revenue opportunities and drive better returns. Our lower capital intensity is expected to contribute to strong free cash flow in the future. Our commitment to a sustainable energy future in which reliable and affordable oil and gas continues to play a critical role will help us and our customers lower emissions. Our creation of Halliburton Labs will accelerate the sustainable affordable energy future.  Halliburton's strategic actions boost our earnings power reset and free cash flow generation today and as we power into and win the eventual recovery. And now, let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs. Angeline Sedita : Just on the pace of activity, maybe some thoughts around 2021. In the past, for the US markets, you talked about a strong start early 2021. And so, thoughts if that's really driven by the DUC cleanup or do you think we could see a pickup of drilling activity and additional wells? And then along with that, on the international side, you noted that the pace of decline is slowing. Do you think that we've seen the bottom in most of these countries? Is there some reason to believe that we have not even ignoring the seasonality and thoughts around the pace of the international activity in 2021? Jeff Miller : Just broadly, both your questions, 2021 feels better from here. I think the second half of 2020, thinking about that as the bottom, we see progressive improvement in 2021. Separating that a little bit, North America, we're seeing DUC activity now. We'll see DUC activity I suspect into next year. And then, the drilling activity would follow that. But again, if we step back and think about North America, to maintain steady production, whatever the exit rate ends up being, implies the number of wells that need to be drilled. And so, if drilling is below that, then we start to see production drift lower, which then would have a positive impact on commodity price and an impact on \u2013 more so on international activity. From an international perspective, again, we see improvement in 2021 from where we are certainly now and we see that strengthening more so in the back half of 2021 or the second half of 2021 because we do work through seasonality and some other things.  But in either case, we see improving activity. Angeline Sedita : And then if you could talk about operating margins in 2021, giving you all the full year benefit of the $1 billion in structural cost cutting and the activity outlook you just outlined, thoughts around the pace of C&P and D&E margins and even the potential exit rate for 2021? Jeff Miller : Obviously, the earnings reset or the earnings power reset is a critical part of our strategy. So, those cost cuts are permanent. I expect when activity moves up, we'll see margin improvement follow. We'd see D&E margin start moving upwards when we see broader international drilling activity recover. As I've described, how we might see that next year. C&P is going to benefit from stronger completions activity recovery in North America and also internationally. So, I think C&P probably sees recovery more so first. And margins in D&E improves, gets into the double digit range as we see more sustained recovery internationally. So, again, really like where we are strategically. I think our strategy addresses that and would expect to see the margin progression follow along with the activity. Operator : Our next question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. James West : International, Jeff, and I know that \u2013 you spent most of your career working international. The business has contracted, of course, but sounds like you're seeing a bottoming here. What type of or what level of recovery would you expect in 2021 and are there geographies that stand out as more robust than others? Jeff Miller : James, look, I think we went into the first part of this year very active. In fact, we were seeing a lot of good things happening in Q1 and it tailed off in Q2. So, I don't think the full year of 2021 eclipses 2020. But trajectory I think is really important because that leads to the eventual recovery that I believe happens. And so, I think we get on that pace starting in 2021? Does it overcome 2020 immediately? Not necessarily. But it's going to just be slightly below. I think we're on a pace because of the sort of under investment that we're seeing. And we're seeing it in the US today and we'll see it \u2013 we've seen it really internationally. And this is just too important to too many governments, to too many people in the world to see it under invested for that long. James West : And as we think about the US market which is kind of an impaired market, but the structure is getting better with some of the M&A that's happening. Are you guys comfortable that you see a more profitable future as we kind of pull out of this downturn in North America than we've seen for the last almost a decade? Jeff Miller : Yes, I do. I think what we're seeing, service company consolidations is great for Halliburton. It's happening as we expected it would happen. And our approach to this market, which is a different playbook, we wouldn't be doing it if we weren't convinced that it drives better free cash flow and a more profitable market. And so, there are a lot of things that we're doing that are different that will allow us to make more free cash flow in this type of market. And so, I think all of these things are positive. And I would say whether it's consolidation and attrition and rationalization, all of those things are conspiring to create tightness. But even in spite of not having the tightness today, we're seeing the improving margins and returns. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons. William Herbert : Lance, free cash flow, and I'm just looking at the relationship between Street expectations for next year, EBITDA down 5%, 7%, but free cash flow down close to 40%. Does that make sense, given the fact that you're not going to have the restructuring and severance cash expense that you had this year. Maybe working capital is not the tailwind in 2021 that it was in 2020, but if revenues are flat to down, it's hardly a huge consumer of cash in your margins, and so I'm just curious, how do we think how should we think about free cash flow for 2021 at this stage. Your capital intensity, 5% to 6%. It would seem that your free cash flow would be actually up year-over-year. Lance Loeffler : I agree with a lot of the commentary in the questions, meaning that, yes, working capital will be less of a tailwind for our free cash flow next year, but that's replaced by healthier operating profit led by increased activity in the markets that you heard Jeff describe, also a full year benefit of the cost cutting activity that we've been through this year rippling through our operating margins. And so, it'll be much more of an operating-led free cash flow draw and in relationship to the capital intensity that we've talked about, as opposed to working capital unwind next year. William Herbert : In the event that EBITDA is relatively flat, do you think \u2013 flat, flat to down, flat to up, do you think that free cash flow is in the vicinity of this year or higher next year?  Look, I think it's a little early to call, Bill. But I think we've been pretty clear on what the levers are the drive it, and we'll be more prescriptive about it when we get into the course of next year. William Herbert : Jeff, I'm just curious as to your perspective here with regard to the consolidation that we're seeing, first Noble goes to Chevron, WPX goes to Devon, Concho goes to Conoco. And these are basically at stock prices that are 20% to 30% of recent peak. And I'm just curious, in your discussions with your clients and your customers, is the sense that this is a fundamentally disrupted industry and that basically, with regard to the lower 48 market opportunity, it's been fundamentally redefined, and at this juncture, the best alternative is define a relatively safe piece of paper in the form of a consolidator. What are you hearing from your customers? Jeff Miller : I think it's what you see when market efficiency start to come into play, in the sense that these larger operations allow for better application of D&A for all. There's just a lot of costs associated with operating all these different companies. And so, I suspect at some level there's the opportunity to better leverage and make more cash flow by bigger operators. I think the value you're seeing, obviously, the stock price is depressed, but nevertheless the outlook, the long-term outlook and the importance of that production is still very relevant. And so, in the discussions, I think that's more of what I hear, is around how to be more efficient. Obviously, this is one way to be more efficient. Operator : Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Chase Mulvehill : I guess the first question I wanted to ask is about C&P guide. Lance, I think you guided up revenues 10% on a sequential basis. I guess, one, can you tell us how much benefit is coming from kind of year-end completion tool sales? And then number two, I would expect that margins would have been up given the strong sequential improvement in revenues. So, kind of help us connect the dots on why margins will be flat? Lance Loeffler : Well, I think, one, Chase, on your question about completion tools, I think we were clear even in the guidance language that completion tools will be more muted than they have been in recent fourth quarter just given the size of the market and level of activity.  In terms of the guide, I think you have a lots of puts and takes. We have an improving North America structure. But we also have, again, the sort of the muted impact of completion tools that have traditionally led to accretive margins impact in the fourth quarter. Chase Mulvehill : And if I can just talk more specifically about North America, I think Angie kind of asked about E&P CapEx. And obviously, it will be up from here. I don't think it was quite clear if you thought it would be up on a year-over-year basis. But maybe if we can just talk to kind of frac fleets and kind of where you think the active frac fleet count is today and when we'd get to that kind of 200 level that you guys talked about being kind of required to hold production flat. And then, any thoughts on when you think that rig activity will begin to meaningfully recover? Jeff Miller : I think with the activity in Q1, and offset by Q2, I think, overall, 2021 will be slightly down from 2020 in terms of overall. But, again, that's sort of factoring out Q1 and Q2 offsetting. So, let's take the second half of this year and project that forward. I think it feels better from here and we see sequential recovery.  I think it really comes down to where does production exit in 2021 will drive then how much activity in 2021. So, we can see a path to that in 2021 in terms of the 200 fleet sort of level. Again, it's going to depend on what is the appetite for producing barrels in North America inside of that time frame.  I think from an overall \u2013 when I think about the frac fleet, I also think about the health of the frac fleet for all of the market. And I think the pace of attrition is going to weigh on that, which means it could create more tightness sooner, even if we were somewhat below that. Chase Mulvehill : And then, what about rig activity, when do you think that starts to pick up meaningfully? Jeff Miller : Look, I think that follows the frac activity. So, I would expect we would see rig activity picking up middle of next year, probably middle of 2021 just because that sort of will follow probably the most frac intensity. Operator : Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JP Morgan. Sean Meakim : So, Jeff, thinking about normalized margins, you reset the cost base this year. You've indicated you think both segments can generate normalized margins in the mid-teens in the next cycle. So, in 2015 through 2019, normalized margins were maybe 10%, 11%. But you're able to get to that mid-teens level in 2008 to 2014. So, it would be great if you could walk through the building blocks to those normalized expectations, particularly in D&E which I think seems to be a little more of a heavier lift from here. Jeff Miller : I always talked about a lot of what we're doing in D&E in terms of our iCruise cruise technology, what we've done around other service lines in that business, whether it be wireline and even testing. And so, I think that the building blocks are around, A, getting that technology footprint implemented, which we're doing. I've described sort of the uptake that we've seen in that even in the current market. So then, sort of the next step from that is getting any amount of improved activity, which I believe we will see. And then, in the international markets, the capital over supply is much less. In fact, capital was getting tight in Q1 of this year, and it remains tight. And so, I don't think it's \u2013 in fact, I think it's quite realistic to expect to see some pricing improvement, which is another key component of how we step those margins up. Sean Meakim : And that dovetails into \u2013 can you talk a little bit more about the international cycle? So, some of your IOC customers are committing to divert capital away from upstream oil and gas. Your independent customers are being forced by financial markets to commit more cash flow to their balance sheets. Seems like the next international cycle is going to be shorter cycle and more NOC focused. Is that fair, that long cycle maybe falls more out of favor in terms of mix of spend? And just how you think Halliburton is positioned for that type of environment. Jeff Miller : Well, look, I think we're very well positioned for that kind of environment. A, we're in all of the right locations, we've got relationships with all of the customers you're describing. I think that what we're doing with project management and our investment in lift and chemicals, and those sort of things all play to that type of market even more so. And so, I think that's a place where we've been very successful in the past, and I think that that will ultimately be even a more stable market.  I think oil and gas is so important on so many dimensions that I believe that we'll see more investment, even by NOCs as we move forward into certain of these geographies anyway. But from a positioning perspective in the international markets, really like where we are and really like our technology footprint, and particularly for the kind of outlook you describe that informs our strategy actually, key elements of our five strategic pillars. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Scott Gruber : Jeff, a couple of times in the call you highlighted your improving position abroad. Obviously, a number of interesting initiatives there and some good momentum. As we look out into 2021, if we think about things on an exit to exit basis, when the market is hopefully starting to grow again, not asking for your market growth outlook, but how much of a delta do you think you'll be able to deliver versus whatever the underlying market delivers next year, just given your initiatives? Jeff Miller : Look, I think if that's a top line question, I think we've had a history of outgrowing the market over the last several years, so we know how to grow. We're very much focused on driving profitable growth out of that market. And again, that's precisely what our strategy is intended to do. So, I'm certainly comfortable with our ability to outperform the market and from a growth perspective. Equally comfortable with our ability to drive profitable growth. But I think what you'll see us doing is driving those things that drive a capital efficiency. So, whether it's iCruise or it's digital or it's elements of our business that allow us to make more free cash flow out of that growth going forward. Again, like I said, very excited about how that all shapes up and what the team is working on. Scott Gruber : And then, a question on Hal Labs, a very interesting initiative. You highlighted several areas of additional expertise we have exposure to, energy transition theme, and where you have some ability to generate revenues. But as we step back and kind of look at the overall revenue opportunity for both you and peers, it seems somewhat small over the next 5 or 10 years with without a material investment and potentially opening some new revenue channels, how do you think about that potential balance? How do you think about allocating R&D dollars and CapEx dollars and potentially some M&A dollars to the transition theme while also trying to deliver better returns next cycle? And how do you think about when it's potentially time to ramp those investments up a little more aggressively? Jeff Miller : Yeah, I'm going to be really clear. We're an oilfield services company. And we believe the world needs a lot of oil and gas for a very long time. And really, to the extent capital is shifted away by certain customers, more capital will be invested by others. But with that as a backdrop, clearly, Halliburton Labs is exciting for us. Let's be really clear how we're doing that. We are, in effect, exchanging our expertise and access to our labs and business network for an equity investment in early stage companies. So, our intent is not to invest capital dollars into that process today beyond what little support \u2013 in fact, not capital dollars. They're engaging in our \u2013 in effect, taking advantage of invested capital that we already have that we know we can take better advantage of doing this. So, we'll have a front row seat in this space. We'll watch it closely. We have a lot of skills that are applicable to helping companies be successful in this space, and we'll learn a whole lot about this over time.  But I want to be clear, oilfield services is where we're spending our capital today. Operator : Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC. Kurt Hallead : I do want to actually extend the conversation a little bit more on that last topic, Jeff. I think as is painfully aware for everybody on this call, investors are definitely shifting their focus, at least in the very near term, toward more the renewable dynamic and clean energy dynamics. And it's good to see that you're going to have that front row seat through Halliburton Innovation Labs. I think we've also seen a number of the major oil companies that are customers of yours start to pivot their budget, some more so than others, like BP, for example, into more the renewable space. And then, I heard you quite clearly that you're an oil services company, and that's kind of where your capital is going to go. But I'm kind of interested on kind of delving beyond those dynamics and getting into how you may be looking longer term through this process. Do you think the shift on renewable energy is just going to fizzle out, like it has been prior cycles, or do you actually see Halliburton playing a meaningful role in that dynamic and having it be a meaningful piece of the business and maybe having a third business line with Completion and Production and Drilling and Evaluation as part of the Halliburton portfolio in the future? Jeff Miller : I think that there will be the different forms of energy, renewable energy, alternative energy, they will all compete for space. And I believe oil and gas is very affordable and very effective. And it will be for a very long time. But that's not to say there won't be competitors in the space. Nuclear has been in the space a long time. And so, what I think from a Halliburton Labs perspective, it's looking at the disruption that happens, of which there will be much. But oil and gas remains very competitive in that kind of environment. So, I won't try to call, does it fizzle, does it make it. What it will have to do over the long term is compete and feel very good about oil and gas as a competitor. Kurt Hallead : And my follow-up then is just along the lines of more the traditional business dynamics. So, you guys referenced a tighter market for both North America and International going forward, the prospect to get margin improvement on the heels of higher activity, even without pricing. So, I was just wondering if you could help us frame that dynamic. In the context of prior cycles, you typically would get maybe incremental margins anywhere around 35% to maybe 50% with pricing power. Without the pricing power, with the cost savings and higher activity, how are you guys thinking about the prospect for incremental margins as we as we move off the second half of 2020 and go into 2021? Lance Loeffler : Kurt, this is Lance. Look, I think everything that we've done around sort of the structural cost cutting exercise that we've been through this year in major form will also continue on the edges as we move forward. But it was all built to reset our cost structure in order to drive better incrementals going forward.  Now, look, clearly, activity helps on a lower fixed cost base. You'll see improvement, so I expect that just activity alone will help bolster or incrementals. But, clearly, if you add pricing on top of that, they are supercharged. I think a lot of what this management team on is looking to deliver outside incrementals even in this market in a recovery versus a historical. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks. Jeff Miller : Thank you, Shannon. Before we wrap up today's call, I would like to leave you with a few closing comments. Our third quarter performance demonstrates tangible results of Halliburton's execution from our five strategic priorities and the early impact of our earnings power reset. Our strong international business is already delivering returns and margin expansion and I expect it will continue in the next up cycle.  Our leaner North America strategy will enable us to both navigate through the current market conditions and be more profitable as the market recovers.  Finally, our strategic actions boost our earnings power reset and free cash flow generation today and as we power into and win the eventual recovery. I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Shannon, please close out the call. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining and have a wonderful day.",

Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Abu Zeya, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Abu Zeya : Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton fourth quarter 2020 conference call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton\u2019s website for 7 days. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President, and CEO and Lance Loeffler, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton\u2019s views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton\u2019s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019; Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2020; recent current reports on Form 8-K; and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of impairments and other charges. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our fourth quarter earnings release and can also be found in the quarterly results and presentation section of our website. After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow time for others who maybe in the queue. Now, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you, Abu, and good morning everyone. Let me start by looking back at the year that just ended. 2020 was a year like no other. We faced a global pandemic, record oil demand destruction, and an unprecedented downturn in the energy industry. Despite these turbulent times, Halliburton demonstrated resilience and performed consistently with our execution culture. Before we get to our results, I want to address our outstanding employees. I thank you for your hard work and execution throughout the entire year. You answered the call for safety, collaboration, and service quality and delivered for Halliburton\u2019s customers and our shareholders. Now, I want to highlight a few of our 2020 accomplishments. We delivered historic bests in all of our key safety and service quality metrics, recordable injury rate, lost time injury rate, vehicle incident rate, environmental recordable rate, and non-productive time. Each of these key metrics improved by over 20% and most did so for the second year in a row. This was a result of our employees\u2019 continued commitment to safety and process execution despite the year\u2019s distractions. Total company revenue of $14.4 billion outperformed the global rig count decline of 38% demonstrating the strength and diversity of our business. Our swift and decisive cost actions and service delivery improvements reset our earnings power, allowing us to deliver resilient margin performance. Our completion and production division finished the year with close to 16% operating margins, exiting the year higher than where they started. These results highlight the success of our structural cost reductions and process improvements. Our drilling and evaluation division had a strong, full-year margin performance despite the rig count declines experienced in all regions. We delivered over $1.1 billion of free cash flow for the year, demonstrating our ability to generate strong free cash flow throughout different business environments. We increased the breadth and depth of our digital offerings and delivered best-in-class performance across the spectrum of digital technologies, and we successfully launched Halliburton Labs, a collaborative environment where entrepreneurs, academics, investors, and industrial labs come together to advance cleaner, affordable energy. Now, let me share a few points about our fourth quarter performance. We finished the quarter with total company revenue of $3.2 billion, a 9% sequential increase and adjusted operating income of $350 million, an increase of 27% sequentially. This marks the first quarterly revenue increase since the activity declines began last March. Our completion and production division revenue increased 15% sequentially, while operating income improved 33% resulting in an operating margin improvement of 2% over the prior quarter. Our drilling and evaluation division revenue and operating income grew 2% and 11% respectively. Higher rig activity in the Western Hemisphere was offset by rig count declines in the Eastern Hemisphere. International revenue remained flat sequentially. Activity in Latin America improved for the second quarter in a row. Activity declines continued in other regions, but at a slower pace compared to the prior quarters. And lastly, our North America revenue increased 26% sequentially, driven primarily by increases in both drilling and completions activity in U.S. lands. Our overall strong performance was a direct result of our focus on the key strategic priorities that define Halliburton\u2019s path now and into the future. We are focused on profitable growth in our strong international franchise, and we are driving strategic changes in North America and building a leaner and more profitable business. We are accelerating the deployment and integration of digital technologies both internally and with our customers. We are driving capital efficiency by advancing our technologies and making strategic choices that lower our CapEx profile, and we are an active participant in advancing a sustainable energy future. As we start the new year, we believe that the worst is behind us and look to the future with optimism. Oil prices are back to pre-pandemic levels driven by global vaccine distribution and unfolding demand recovery, OPEC+ discipline, and a declining production base. However, some caution is appropriate due to the surge in COVID-19 infections globally and the expected gradual return of spare production capacity. Our five strategic priorities will continue to drive Halliburton\u2019s success as markets around the world stabilize and start to grow. We believe that aligning our actions with these priorities will boost our returns and free cash flow generation both today and as the recovery unfolds. We set these priorities according to our long-term view of the market. As oil demand recovers, we expect to see favorable market dynamics and the beginning of a multiyear energy up-cycle. However, we believe this recovery will look different than prior cycles. International short cycle producers will have an opportunity to gain share. North American E&Ps will increase spending from current levels that will take a more disciplined approach to growing production in the future. We believe that the overall cost and environmental impact of producing oil and gas will continue to decline due to innovation and technology adoption. As a result, oil and gas will remain a critical and significant component of the energy mix. I expect that our gains achieved in 2020, including service delivery improvements, structural cost reductions, and capital efficiency are firmly in place and sustainable. Halliburton is uniquely positioned in all markets and is prepared to deliver on both our customer expectations and our shareholder objectives. Our strong international business outperformed the market. Our full year international revenue declined 17%, while rig counts and customer spending were down more than 20%. All regions except Latin America declined in the fourth quarter, but at a slower pace. In the first quarter, we expect international activity to be impacted by typical weather-related seasonality and the absence of year-end product sales. Activity should bottom during the first quarter and improve as the year unfolds. For the full year, we expect activity recover very widely across regions. Latin America will continue with upward momentum off a very low bottom both onshore and offshore. Asia-Pacific is also showing signs of activity improvement. We believe parts of Europe and West Africa will remain slow, especially in the deepwater areas. As for the Middle East and Russia, we believe they will manage activity based on expectations of the economic and demand recovery. While the pace of recovery depends on the trajectory of demand improvement, we believe the second half of this year could see a low double-digit increase in international activity year-on-year. Halliburton is well positioned to benefit from this increase. Let me be clear, our target is profitable growth. Against a tough activity backdrop in 2020, we remained focused on increasing profitability and our actions resulted in overall international margin improvement. In 2021, we expect that several factors will continue to drive Halliburton\u2019s profitable international growth, Halliburton will benefit from our improved position in the international market cycle. We are stronger, technically, geographically and organizationally. We have exposure to mature fields, completions and interventions work, a deck of resilient integrated contracts around the world, leveraged to unconventional developments in Latin America and the Middle East and a leading position in key active offshore areas. While the international sales cycle tends to be longer, we now have line of sight to activity increases in the coming quarters. Tender activity has picked up recently led by the NOCs in the Middle East and Latin America and new opportunities are emerging with operators in other regions. Our customers have also pulled forward mobilization plans for various contracts awarded to Halliburton that were put on hold due to the pandemic. Our new drilling technologies are penetrating the market and gaining customer confidence. For example, we exited the year with a threefold increase in our EarthStar deep resistivity sensor revenue. As activity recovers, our technology provides us with a tremendous opportunity to profitably grow revenue. We see significant growth potential in the continued international expansion of our production businesses, especially in mature fields around the world. For example, the international artificial lift market tends to be more resilient and as longer cycle. Once an operator puts its field on the specific form of lift, it typically stays on it for many years. We are currently mobilizing for our first multiyear electric submersible pump contract in the Middle East and are excited about the opportunities artificial lift opens for us in the region. The construction of our specialty chemicals plant in Saudi Arabia continues to progress towards final completion. When it is complete, Halliburton will have a differentiated value chain in the region that maximizes local content, delivers customized solutions more quickly and shortens customer lead times. I am excited about these two new additions to our international portfolio that provide us with unique growth opportunities. Finally, adoption of Halliburton\u2019s digital solutions helps our customers to reduce cost per barrel, improve project economics and increase efficiencies. Our Halliburton 4.0 digital offerings in subsurface, well construction and reservoir and production create differentiation and margin growth opportunities for Halliburton. We are pleased that in 2021 several international oil companies are deploying DecisionSpace 365 cloud applications to streamline and automate their well construction activities. I believe that digital and other technology advances, geographic expansion of our products and services, along with continued discipline in cost management and capital efficiency should allow Halliburton to continue delivering profitable returns driven growth in the international markets. Turning to North America, the strategic actions we took last year reset Halliburton\u2019s earnings power in this critical, but structurally smaller market. We are the leader in North America and the only integrated oilfield services companies still active in the hydraulic fracturing market. In the fourth quarter, our North America business took advantage of the recovery in completions and drilling activity and delivered continued margin improvement even without improved pricing. Completion stage counts increased in the oil basins, but declined modestly in the gas plays. While the U.S. land rig count recovered from its August 2020 low of 230 rigs, it is still 60% below the pre-pandemic levels. Private and small operators added the most rigs, while large E&Ps and majors moved more slowly. We expect completions activity in North America to continue improving in the first half of 2021 as commodity prices remained supportive and customers complete their backlog of DUCs. Customer consolidation will likely continue and we expect most operators will remain committed to a disciplined capital program. For the full year, provided that the impact of the pandemic moderates, economic activity continues to increase and oil price remains solid. I am optimistic that our customers will sustain activity in order to hold their production flat to 2020 exit levels with completion spend outpacing drilling. I am excited about Halliburton\u2019s future in North America and here is why. We completed the most aggressive set of structural cost reductions in our history, giving us meaningful operating leverage in a recovering market. We also made significant changes to our processes that drive higher contribution margin, for example, how we perform equipment maintenance and provide engineering support. We believe the benefits of these changes will have a meaningful impact on our margins as activity picks up. The hydraulic fracturing market structure continues to improve. Utilization of our active equipment is higher than it was at the beginning of last year. The market has continued to rationalize and consolidate. We are seeing competitors either cannibalize idle equipment for parts or use it to beef up working fleets thus increasing average horsepower per fleet. This will make equipment reactivation to meet growing demand a lot harder for capital constrained companies and should only accelerate supply and demand balancing. As activity starts to increase, Halliburton has a unique competitive advantage and sufficient capacity to respond without adding incremental capital. Our in-house engineering capabilities to refurbish maintain and continuously improve our fracturing and perforating equipment minimize the cost and time to deliver the necessary equipment to our customers and take advantage of the market recovery. We are also well positioned to profitably grow in our competitive non-hydraulic fracturing businesses in North America. For example, in 2020, our artificial lift business developed and implemented new digital capabilities, increased remote operations jobs, and solidified its strong market position in North America. We also expect our well construction technology investments to best position Halliburton to outperform as drilling rigs return. Using the Halliburton 4.0 digital framework, we continue to collaborate and engineer solutions that maximize our customer\u2019s asset value. Last quarter, we launched our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing system and successfully completed a customer engagement in West Texas. SmartFleet is an industry first, where intelligent automation manages and executes live treatment decisions to optimize subsurface fracture outcomes. By using SmartFleet, the operator was able to consistently visualize and measure fracture propagation and control fracture placement through automation. Importantly, the system provided a level of subsurface control that was previously not possible and enabled the customer to actively drive their completion outcomes in real time. We are building on this success with multiple customer commitments across different basins. I believe this is the biggest step forward in fracturing technology in a long time. Let me give you a few more examples of how we are accelerating Halliburton 4.0 digital adoption. In the North Sea, we have successfully delivered the first fully automated cement job for the offshore cementing unit executed the work without human intervention. This is an important milestone in reaching the vision of fully autonomous offshore well construction that has significant implications for efficiency, safety and operating costs. In 2020, we more than tripled the number of DecisionSpace 365 users on the iEnergy cloud platform. Our customers also increased adoption of the DecisionSpace 365 asset simulator. Operators in Europe, Latin America and Asia ran over 3,000 reservoir simulation scenarios on the iEnergy cloud with speeds of up to 7x faster than with conventional on-premise simulators. Finally, we are teaming up with Accenture to drive the digital transformation of our supply chain. This will result in process efficiencies across large volumes of transactional activities, lower our overall cost, and free up resources to drive strategic decision-making and support of our operational requirements. Next, I want to discuss capital efficiency, a key enabler of our other strategic priorities, leveraging new materials and design approaches as well as digital innovation. We have been able to significantly reduce CapEx requirements and extend the life of our equipment. We are continuing our iCruise drilling system deployment and are reaping the benefits of a reduced CapEx profile and higher asset velocity. Technology advancements in multiple product service lines in both divisions are allowing us to improve design and service configuration to save time and money both for our customers and Halliburton. Finally, I would like to highlight several important actions we took in alignment with our strategic priority to participate in advancing a sustainable energy future. We are working to reduce the carbon footprint and environmental impact of our own operations and have committed to setting targets through the science-based targets initiative to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. With this commitment, Halliburton joins over 1,000 global companies taking science-based climate action. This is important in our journey to align with the latest climate science and contribute to sustainable energy advancement. We are also collaborating with our customers to produce oil and gas more efficiently, while reducing their emissions. We are currently performing the first electric grid powered fracturing operation for Cimarex Energy in the Permian Basin. With over 300 stages on multiple wells already completed, Halliburton\u2019s electric-powered equipment has allowed the customer to achieve pump rates that were 30% to 40% higher than conventional pumps by utilizing the maximum grid power potential. Grid-powered electric spreads require substantially less capital, a smaller footprint and are more efficient compared to turbine power. When demand for emission reduction solutions translates to better pricing, I expect we will replace within our planned capital budget some of our conventional fracturing capacity with electric over the course of a normal equipment replacement cycle. Halliburton is starting the new year with a clear sense of purpose. We believe that our strategic priorities are the right ones and our margins in the fourth quarter demonstrated that. We are confident that the actions we have taken are sustainable and we are well-positioned both internationally and in North America for the unfolding market recovery. I will now turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our financial results. Lance? Lance Loeffler : Thank you, Jeff. Let\u2019s begin this morning with an overview of our fourth quarter results compared to the third quarter of 2020. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.2 billion, an increase of 9% and adjusted operating income was $350 million, an increase of 27%. During the fourth quarter, we recognized approximately $450 million of pre-tax impairments and other charges primarily related to the fair value adjustment of our real estate assets in North America. As part of our 2020 structural cost reduction initiatives, we reduced the amount of real estate required to run our business. In the second quarter, we decreased our real estate use in North America by roughly 50% by closing, selling, consolidating and reducing the size of many facilities. Subsequently, we conducted a detailed analysis on how we own, lease and operate our remaining real estate footprint. As a result, we concluded that a structured transaction is likely to be advantageous in managing the majority of our North American real estate, which led to the fair value adjustment I just discussed. This initiative is consistent with our strategic priority to achieve capital efficiency in our business, while allowing us to retain flexibility and drive future operating benefits. Let me take a moment to discuss our divisional results in more detail. In our completion and production division, revenue increased $236 million or 15%, while operating income increased $70 million, an increase of 33%. These increases were driven by higher activity in multiple product service lines in North America, increased stimulation activity in Argentina and Kuwait, higher completion tool sales in Africa, Southeast Asia and Norway, and increased well intervention services internationally. These increases were partially offset by lower pressure pumping activity in Saudi Arabia and lower completion tool sales in Eurasia and Australia. Our drilling and evaluation revenue increased $26 million or 2%, while operating income grew by $12 million, or an 11% increase. These increases were primarily due to higher drilling related services in North America and Brazil, increased wireline activity in North America and Latin America as well as higher fluid sales in Asia-Pacific and Guyana and increased software sales across all regions. Partially offsetting these increases were lower drilling-related services and project management activity in Europe/Africa/CIS, the Middle East and Mexico as well as reduced wireline activity in Asia-Pacific and Saudi Arabia. Moving on to our geographical results, in North America, revenue increased $254 million, a 26% increase. These results were driven by higher activity in stimulation and artificial lift in U.S. land as well as higher well construction and wireline services activity and year end completion tools and software sales. Latin America revenue grew $46 million or 12%, resulting primarily from increased pressure pumping and wireline activity in Argentina and activity increases in multiple product service lines in Colombia and Ecuador as well as higher fluid sales in Guyana and drilling services in Brazil. These increases were partially offset by reduced activity across multiple product service lines in Mexico. Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue was modestly down by $7 million or a decrease of 1%, resulting primarily from reduced drilling related services and completion tool sales in Eurasia, coupled with lower drilling related activity in Norway. These results were partially offset by higher completion tool sales in Africa, Norway and Continental Europe as well as increased stimulation and well intervention services in Algeria and Continental Europe. Middle East Asia revenue declined $31 million, or 3%, largely attributed to lower activity in multiple product service lines in Saudi Arabia, reduced drilling activity in United Arab Emirates and decreased project management activity in India. These decreases were partially offset by higher drilling-related services in China, Australia and Malaysia, increased stimulation activity in Kuwait, and higher software sales across the region. In the fourth quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $49 million and we expect it to be approximately the same in the first quarter of 2021. Net interest expense for the quarter was $125 million and should remain essentially flat in the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 19%. Based on the market environment and our expected geographic earnings mix, we expect our 2021 first quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. We generated approximately $638 million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter and delivered over $1.1 billion of free cash flow for the full year. As a result, we ended the year with approximately $2.6 billion in cash. We will continue to prioritize reducing leverage in the near-term and intend to pay down $685 million of debt coming due this year with cash on hand. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $218 million with our 2020 full year CapEx totaling approximately $730 million. In 2021, we intend to keep our capital expenditures relatively flat at $750 million. We believe that with this level of spend we will be well-equipped to take advantage of the unfolding recovery. Finally, let me provide you with some comments on how we see the first quarter playing out. As is typical, our results for the first quarter of 2021 will be subject to weather-related seasonality and the roll-off of year-end product sales, which primarily impact our international and Gulf of Mexico businesses. While we anticipate a slower than normal start to the year in some international regions, we also expect activity momentum in North America to continue with completions activity outpacing drilling activity. As such, in our completion and production division, we expect revenue to increase 3% to 5% sequentially and operating margins to decline 150 to 200 basis points largely due to a different business mix. In our drilling and evaluation division, we anticipate a low single-digit revenue increase sequentially, with operating margins expected to increase by 50 to 75 basis points. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff? Jeff Miller : Thanks, Lance. To sum up, Halliburton is focused on executing our key strategic priorities to deliver industry leading returns and solid free cash flow for our shareholders. Our strong international business is expected to continue its profitable growth and market outperformance as the international activity ramps up throughout the year. In the critical North American market, our business is recovering and demonstrating margin improvement. Digital is gaining traction, growing our revenue and helping us and our customers increase operational efficiency and reduce costs. Our capital efficiency enabled by technology and service delivery improvements is expected to contribute to solid free cash flow generation and our commitment to a sustainable energy future will ensure we play a role in advancing cleaner and more affordable energy solutions. I am optimistic about the future. While the 2020 downturn was deeper and more widespread than anything we have seen before, I am encouraged by the changes we implemented to solidify Halliburton\u2019s role in the unfolding economic recovery for oil and gas remains vital. Strong execution on our strategic priorities will allow Halliburton to continue to power into and win this recovery. And now, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. James West : Hey, good morning, Jeff, Lance, Abu. Jeff Miller : Good morning, James. Lance Loeffler : Good morning. James West : And well done in North America in reinventing yourself there and creating a much more valuable asset, and while it\u2019s a structurally lower market or smaller market, you have created a nice cash flow machine there. Is it the \u2013 the question in my mind and you gave some color around this, Jeff, but I wanted to dig in a little further is the outlook for the full year \u201821. With North America, I know you mentioned -- you feel like the momentum is still good, but I guess first is there some peak that we are going to see or some stabilization of activity as the companies remain capital disciplined which should get back to kind of this maintenance level? And then on the international side, it sounds like you have called the bottom in 1Q, some pick up in 2Q, but the magnitude of the pickup in the second half, what\u2019s your confidence level on that pickup? Jeff Miller : Yes, thanks, James. Let me start with North America and then start with \u2013 I am more optimistic today than I certainly was 90 days ago, and 2021 will feel better than the second half of 2020 annualized. James West : Okay. Jeff Miller : So what\u2019s important is we see momentum coming into the year and it looks steady for the remainder and that\u2019s predicated on customers, I think will be certainly rationale and capital disciplined, but I think there is also pressure to hold production flat in 2021, which creates a bit of a floor as we look at the full year. James West : Okay. Jeff Miller : From an international perspective, I feel confident around the international recovery. And I think in terms of magnitude into the second half of 2021, we believe or I believe we will be up low-double digits. So, that\u2019s fairly solid and that\u2019s based on the tender pipeline that we are seeing and the types of barrels that are produced shorter cycle, I think, will lend themselves to that type of uptick. And maybe one last word on international outlook, I mean, I think we view 2021 as a bit of a transition year. I mean, 2020 was the worst in our history, and we view 2022 as when we see the global rebalancing of supply and demand, which creates the sort of underpinning of a multi-year upcycle, and so that we see Q1 as a bottom and then steadily building from there. That\u2019s the kind of momentum that we really like to see going into that supply and demand sort of coming into balance. James West : Okay, okay. And then the tendering process internationally that\u2019s occurring. Are these chunky projects with big rooms or is it more smaller or is it kind of ramping of projects that had maybe ramped downwards, ramping back up, what\u2019s the kind of the nature of those tenders? Jeff Miller : We are seeing some tenders, some big ones, also seeing some extensions of existing work. So, it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag at this point, but visibility we have are of not all chunky though. Again, I think the extensions are important also to create sort of that steady momentum that we are talking about. James West : Right, okay. Thanks, Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you, James. Operator : Our next question comes from Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Angie Sedita : Thanks. Good morning guys. Jeff Miller : Good morning, Angie. Lance Loeffler : Good morning, Angie. Angie Sedita : Good morning. So Lance, maybe we can start with you and flesh out a little bit more commentary around the margin outlook for \u201821 for both C&P and D&E, and maybe you could start with 150 to 200 basis point decline on mix for Q1, flush that out for us and just talk about the full year? And then D&E, 8.2% in Q4, you set up slightly in Q1, can you talk about the margin outlook for the full year and the potential to return to a double-digit margin? Lance Loeffler : Sure, sure, Angie. Look, I think it\u2019s simply as it relates to the guide that we gave, it\u2019s simply a business mix for C&P. So, we have got completion tool sales that are falling off and are being replaced. That revenue is being replaced by an improving North America market activity, but not the same level of profitability. But look, we are encouraged about some of the backlog that we see building in our completion tool business, and I think that also gives us the confidence that Jeff just outlined in terms of the back half of the year, particularly in the international markets. As you think about C&P margin progression in 2021, I mean, I would remind you and others on the call that we are starting from a much higher point in 2021 than we did even in 2020 before the impact of the pandemic, and that\u2019s on a much lower activity level. On a full year basis, I would say, Angie, that our expectations are that we still drive mid-teens margins for our C&P division. And look, if we are able to get some pricing momentum, it could go higher than that. But we are happy with what we have done, particularly creating the operating leverage in the business. Jeff has mentioned several times that it\u2019s sustainable. And I think it fundamentally drives higher incrementals, at least that\u2019s what the management team here is focused on for this next upcycle. On D&E margins, again, I think we are starting 2021 higher sequentially, which is typically not the case for our business as we go through some of the seasonality issues that we have mentioned and year end software sales falling off. So, I am encouraged to see the momentum and margin progression across the end of the year and into the beginning of 2021. And that\u2019s coming off again a largest rig drop in history for our business and our industry. Our expectation is to get to double-digit margins by the end of the year, end of the year 2021. And I think that we are ready to do that through capitalizing on obviously a recovering market that Jeff talked about in the back half of the year, but also on the technology and digital investments that we have made into the business throughout the course of 2020 and reaping the benefits in 2021. But I think the overall point, particularly for our D&E business as you think about the international markets is a real focus on profitable growth. Angie Sedita : Yes, fair color. That\u2019s great color, Lance. Very much appreciated. So, maybe one more separate follow-up on deep leads, maybe Jeff, you could talk about the technology that you have, how it differs from the peers the contract you have with Cimarex and then thoughts around additional construction and could electric fleets become a larger part of the operations over time? Jeff Miller : Well, thanks, Angie. Look, I think that was \u2013 it\u2019s an elegant and differentiated solution, but clearly a premium solution. We have been working on the electric technology for a number of years and have always described some of the challenges around electric also being the cost and the upfront capital associated with it. The grid solution actually eliminates the requirement for turbines, which have come with a range of either operating problems or emissions. And so \u2013 and it\u2019s important to give a shout out to the Cimarex management team here, because a lot of innovation and collaboration together in order to bring together a very efficient solution and also one with the absolute lowest emissions, I mean, because now it\u2019s tapped into the grid and consuming sort of a variety of different energy sources. So, the customer commitment was very important. I think customer interest will be high. But it\u2019s also over time, but it\u2019s also going to require pricing and different types of contract terms and I view this though as part of our normal reinvestment cycle. Clearly, there is interest, but we have a planned reinvestment cycle that\u2019s inside of our capital budget and our outlook on capital efficiency and certainly see electric having a place in that, but that\u2019s where it will sit. Angie Sedita : Great. Thanks. I will turn it over. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Scott Gruber : Guys, good morning. Jeff Miller : Good morning, Scott. Scott Gruber : So Jeff, just staying on that same line of questioning, the demand for emission reduction solutions and frac appears pretty robust these days, with crude climbing above $50, do you think customers are going to be willing to pay up this year to begin a more material expansion of these solutions? Jeff Miller : Well, we will have to see. Like I said, we have seen \u2013 haven\u2019t seen it necessarily at this point, but I think that it\u2019s part of an evolution. By that I mean, emissions are part of the cost of operating today. And in my prepared remarks, I indicated that I thought technology would lower operating costs and also emissions. And I think viewing it that way is going to be important. And beyond that, from a Halliburton perspective, we think about nutrition labels in effect, which help us work with our customers to lower the emissions not just for us, but in the services that we provide so that we can make choice and drive R&D towards what we think will be a lower emissions sort of footprint on location? Scott Gruber : Got it. I mean, Lance just coming back to C&P margins, big question on Halliburton these days is just how C&P margins trend here given the recovery domestically, but have come in at a lower margin profile than international. Are you able to provide just a bit more color on the incrementals that you are seeing on the domestic side of C&P? You are not asking for the absolute level, but just in terms of the rate of change as activity comes back here, are you seeing that incrementals say in 4Q that approach there the segment average and those types of incremental sustainable into the first half of \u201821? Lance Loeffler : Yes. I think look, incrementals will start off naturally slower when you are just working on activity ramp. Clearly, there is a lot more punch to incrementals when you start to get pricing as well. We are not there yet as you have heard us say on the pricing side, but I think our incrementals have been very healthy as it relates to just the activity improvement in North America. And again, it goes back to the things that we were doing around the structural cost initiatives to get the cost structure right in this market and to watch that business improve on activity alone has been good to see. Scott Gruber : Got it. Appreciate it. Thank you. Lance Loeffler : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Sean Meakim : Thanks. Hey, good morning. Jeff Miller : Good morning, Sean. Sean Meakim : You hit your $1 billion free cash flow bogey for 2020 I am just curious how you think 2021 current flows who got moving parts as well as improving cash from operations as you go through the year, but also working capital needs shift as revenue is going to improve sequentially. CapEx you are expecting flat year-on-year, just how do we think about sending that mark for \u201821 in terms of what you all can achieve from a free cash flow perspective? Jeff Miller : Well, Sean, let me take the first part of that, because it\u2019s maximizing free cash flow is a priority of mine. And the strategic priorities that I have laid out are designed to deliver and maximize free cash flow, but as you say, I think the profile may look different this year. Lance, why don\u2019t you go? Lance Loeffler : Sure, sure. You are right, you are right, Sean. Yes, I think the free cash flow profile for 2021 versus 2020 will be much more from an operating profit perspective, right. So the full year of cost cut benefits will be rolling through 2021. We will also have the increased activity that you have heard us reference so far on the call. Yes, you are right, capital discipline and our philosophy around that remains in place, but as the business begins to grow, working capital will require investment, right as activity picks up. And so think about it outside of some of the noise that\u2019s created from working capital movements. So excluding working capital for a second, I would expect free cash flow to more than double in 2021. Is that helpful? Sean Meakim : Very helpful. Yes, thank you for that. And then on international markets, you talked about shorter cycle maybe taking back some share, I think that makes sense. And you noticed that tendering activity is picking up, can you just talk about expectations for bidding behavior between you and your competitors, how that may compare and contrast to what we saw in the most recent cycle? What should give investors confidence that tendering rounds may look different than what they did in the most recent round we saw, let\u2019s say prior to the pandemic? Jeff Miller : Yes. Look, Sean, I am not going to comment on the strategic and the competitive issues that you brought up. But what I can speak from our perspective is our focus is on profitable growth and profitable growth that maximizes free cash flow and drives returns. And I would say that, that\u2019s been something that is important and we were making progress on that in the first quarter of 2020 in terms of improving margins and cash flow and returns and then we took a COVID pause internationally. Now, I don\u2019t think dynamics have not changed in terms of available equipment for the international markets during the COVID period of time. So, with activity and our focus on profitable growth, I am encouraged by what I see, clearly, it\u2019s always competitive. Certainly, it\u2019s always competitive. But that focus on profitable growth is front and center with me. Sean Meakim : I understand. Thanks very much for that. Operator : Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Chase Mulvehill : Hey, good morning, everyone. I guess so I wanted to come back to the conversation around kind of your E&P spending and then kind of your outlook for 2021. I don\u2019t know if you can maybe just take a minute and talk to which your expectations are for North American E&P spending this year and then also on the international side, I know you said kind of activity up low double-digits in the back half of this year for international, but I don\u2019t know if that means that we can actually kind of get more flattish spending this year by E&Ps or is that still going to be down? Jeff Miller : Look, from an international standpoint, I mean, I think that\u2019s a fairly tight range around flat. But I also think what\u2019s more important is the improvement that we are seeing into what we believe is supply and demand balancing in 2022 and that\u2019s the right kind of trajectory to have going into that. And so if we have got double-digit growth in the second half of the year, we have called the bottom in the first quarter of the year, we used to kind of work through that. And like I said, I believe that the tighter range around flat, but I think that\u2019s going to be, it\u2019s got to be the path to solid improvement. And I am pretty optimistic about how all of that plays out. In North America, again, I think Q1 last year creates a lot of noise in that comparison, but the important thing is I do believe customers will be capital disciplined, but we have got a lot of road to go just to get back to where we were, even pre-pandemic when the first quarter of \u201820. And so I think that and we saw production come off pretty hard in 2020. So, just to keep things flat in 2021, from a production perspective, requires a reasonable amount of activity and actually more activity than we even see today based on kind of our calculation and outlook, which gives me good confidence that while we have got good momentum in the first quarter and we have got pretty good visibility for the year. So, I think that our outlook that, that momentum it builds in the first quarter, but it doesn\u2019t fall off at the pace that it has in the past certainly, I think that just because the drivers will be different. And I think capital discipline and flat production coexist in the market and that\u2019s what gives me confidence. Chase Mulvehill : Okay. One quick follow-up, if you think about international pricing, we have heard some anecdotes from some people about some competitive pricing with some larger projects out there, but we don\u2019t see all the data points. So I don\u2019t know if you can maybe just take a second and just kind of talk about what you are seeing out there in the international pricing trend? Jeff Miller : Well, what I would say is that it\u2019s always competitive on big projects. We will see different behavior at different times. Yes, I think the under the most important thing is I think we are going into a multiyear cycle internationally and building profitable roads is what will be most important and certainly most important to Halliburton. And I say it that way, because the equipment availability hasn\u2019t changed. Certainly, we do capital efficiency as one of our strategic priorities, which also means we want to put it to work where in the places where it\u2019s going to make the best returns and that\u2019s not going to be everywhere. That\u2019s going to be in the best returning opportunities, but I think there is enough growth there. And again, it\u2019s this multiyear cycle, it\u2019s the balancing in \u201822 and the progression through \u201821 gives me confidence in certainly taking that approach. Chase Mulvehill : Okay, perfect. I will turn it back over. Thanks, Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Kurt Hallead : Hey, good morning everybody. Jeff Miller : Good morning, Kurt. Lance Loeffler : Good morning, Kurt. Kurt Hallead : Hey, thanks for that. Thanks for that great detail. Really appreciate it and always good to start the year on a positive tone and positive note, especially after what we have been through right over the last few years. So, it\u2019s good to hear. Hey, just I wanted to follow-up with you in the context right on the international front since that\u2019s been a point of focus on your messaging, you kind of gave the dynamics for the second half of the year, but when you talk about short cycle opportunity sets and short cycle projects kind of what regions and areas would that be geared to? Jeff Miller : Yes, Kurt. I mean, I think that you look around the world and where are there either intervention opportunities or onshore type opportunities and offshore tiebacks, which that starts to lead us to, I would think, through the Middle East, that could certainly have application in Asia, the North Sea as well as another sort of important market that demonstrates those characteristics. So, I think it\u2019s going to be fairly widespread in terms of where I think it\u2019s the type of work and again, the short cycle type barrels of what require less capital upfront, they yield production more quickly, they demonstrate better returns for operators. And so \u2013 and I think that that\u2019s where we will see more activity. Kurt Hallead : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Appreciate that. And then I want to follow-up on your experience using highline power to run frac in the Permian. We have outlined some benefits of that highline power relative to turbine-driven e-frac. So, how do you see this evolving, right, Jeff? And what are some of the near-term opportunities for highline driven e-frac to accelerate and then what do you see as some of the roadblocks potentially to the adoption? Jeff Miller : Well, the highline certainly, our grid-powered frac certainly is the lowest emission solution. Look, we learned a lot through the first project and so early days and still learning, but we have always said about electric that the capital upfront around power was going to be the sticky wicket and one that we were not willing to dive off and invest in, because from one day to the next, it\u2019s not clear what\u2019s most efficient. We actually knew all along that ultimately there would be a better both market for availability for power and also ultimately grid power. So, I think that there is a lot of collaboration that\u2019s required. There is a fair amount of technology involved in solving for how to get power of where it needs to be. But I can \u2013 as I said in my remarks, it\u2019s a very good solution to both a capital efficiency problem and an emissions problem. And I will look forward to seeing it catch on, so I don\u2019t think it will be immediate, because it takes quite a bit of work upfront to get that all put in place and very much a commitment by the operator to stay the course. Kurt Hallead : Got it. That\u2019s great. I appreciate that color. I will leave it there. Thanks for the info. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from George O\u2019Leary with Tudor Pickering Holt. Your line is now open. George O\u2019Leary: Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Lance. Jeff Miller : Good morning, George. George O\u2019Leary: Yes. Just to get insight into the North American completion services space and just curious clearly thus far, the increase in profitability has mostly been driven by top down actions on your part and then utilization increases. I wonder if you could speak to the supply demand dynamics, which you see in the market today and if there is any alignments made to greatly increases in midpoint this year or any frac spread count level that you guys are looking at that would you think the market may actually start to tighten up a bit and pricing can increase? Jeff Miller : Yes, thanks, George. Look, I think attrition has taken its toll. We certainly saw a lot of it visibly in 2020. And I think our view is or my view is that the supply and demand gap continues to tighten. I also think the market structure is improving. And so \u2013 and as we look forward from here just normal attrition or normal replacement probably runs 10% to 12%. So we have got that at a minimum in front of us. I also think that capital constraints are \u2013 the current market for capital and capital investment makes us a lot tougher for companies. And so harvesting and cannibalization of equipment that we saw in 2020, we also saw entire transactions predicated to a degree on harvesting equipment as part of that cycle, but all of those things are taking equipment out of the market. And so, could we see some tightening towards the end of 2021? I think so, particularly with kind of how our outlook on activity for the balance of the year, but I think this is \u2013 it will continue to tighten is our outlook. George O\u2019Leary: Okay, great. Very helpful color, Jeff. And then just digging through the game plan regarding the specialty chemicals business and you highlighted the plant [ph] inside clearly is a key part of the strategy, but just thinking bigger picture and longer term, what all do you guys need to execute on to dethrone one of the larger two players in that space, what\u2019s left to do from here for you guys strategically to really grow that business? Jeff Miller : Well, look, our view of that is we stay the course and we have got the infrastructure in place in the U.S., we have got what we are progressing to completion, the plant in the Middle East. But we are certainly encouraged about what we have done and our outlook, I am not going to try to predict market shares and those sorts of things. Look I like what we are doing and I am confident that what we are doing continues to improve and grow that business over time take a very long view of the chemicals business, has long sort of cycle times around tenders and awards and those sorts of things. So, but certainly all of the plumbing is getting in place now. And I am very encouraged about the outlook for that business particularly as it applies to mature fields and the kind of sustainable throughout the cycle type activity that it brings. George? George O\u2019Leary: Great. Thanks, guys. You have both my questions. Thank you very much. Jeff Miller : Alright. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks. Jeff Miller : Thank you, Liz. Before we end the call, I would like to make a few closing comments. Halliburton\u2019s five strategic priorities are designed to deliver industry leading returns and to maximize free cash flow. Our strong international business is well-positioned with the right geographies, technologies and people to deliver profitable growth, while our North American business is recovering and demonstrating margin improvement. Halliburton\u2019s market outlook, strategic priorities and execution culture make me optimistic about our future. I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Liz, please close out the call. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for joining and have a wonderful day.",

Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Abu Zeya, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Abu Zeya : Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton first quarter 2021 conference call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton\u2019s website for 7 days. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO and Lance Loeffler, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton\u2019s views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton\u2019s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020; recent current reports on Form 8-K; and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.  Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of impairments asset dispositions and other charges. Beginning this quarter, we have modified our free cash flow metric, a non-GAAP financial measure to include the impact of Proceeds from sales of property, plant, and equipment. We believe this item is recurring in nature and including it improves comparability of this metric relative to our large cap peers. Additional details including recalculation of this measure for prior periods and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our first quarter earnings release and can also be found in the quarterly results and Presentation section of our website. After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period to allow time for others who maybe in the queue. Now, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you, Abu, and good morning everyone. We are off to a good start this year. The world is reopening and even though some regions still experience lockdowns, overall economic and demand recovery continues to build. Oil demand is increasing globally. Oil inventories are down near their five-year averages, and OPEC+ actions continue to support commodity prices. The first quarter strengthened our confidence about how this transition year will play out.  Our first quarter performance demonstrates the strength of our strategy and operating leverage in this global market recovery. Here are some highlights. International revenue grew 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Marketing and activity inflection in the international markets, strong recovery in Latin America more than offset declines in other regions, while margins remained resilient.  North America revenue grew 13% as both drilling and completions activity ramped up throughout the quarter. Higher utilization and our significant operating leverage supported sequential margin expansion despite weather disruptions.  Our Completion and Production division revenue grew 3% with increased North America and Latin America activity offsetting seasonal declines in other regions. Our Drilling and Evaluation division delivered solid revenue and margin performance. Revenue grew 11% while margins increased 2.6 percentage points, driven by stronger drilling activity in North America and software sales across multiple regions.  Finally, we delivered approximately $160 million of free cash flow in the first quarter, which is a great first step to delivering strong free cash flow for the full year. This was another quarter of solid execution on our five strategic priorities that define Halliburton\u2019s path and will drive our success.  We are committed to drive profitable growth internationally; maximize value in North America; accelerate and integrate digital technologies; improve capital efficiency; and actively participate in advancing cleaner affordable energy. Our first quarter performance demonstrated that aligning our actions with these strategic priorities boosts our returns and free cash flow generation. We expect to continue delivering strong free cash flow and industry-leading returns as we move through the year. We are encouraged by the inflection in international activity we saw during the first quarter and anticipate that recovery will gain momentum across all regions in the second quarter and beyond.  Today, we see early indicators of future activity growth internationally. Our completion tool orders, a leading indicator of upcoming orders grew throughout the first quarter. The volume of tender work has significantly increased. We are on pace to nearly double the value of submitted bids compared to last year with the most work coming from the NOCs in the Middle East, followed by Latin America.  These signs give us greater conviction that the second half of this year will see a low double-digit increase in international activity year-on-year. We believe the international markets will experience multiple years of growth. However, this upcycle is expected to be structurally different from prior cycles and Halliburton\u2019s international business is better prepared to benefit from it. Here is why. We expect the NOCs and other short cycle barrel producers will increase investments and gain share to meet future oil demand growth. Halliburton has the established footprint and the customer relationships to capitalize on this growth. As deals become smaller and more complex, operators work harder to produce more barrels.  Their pursuit of incremental production to meet future oil demand growth should require higher service intensity. In certain markets, maturing assets are changing hands. New owners require proven technology and experience to revitalize their assets and unlock remaining reserves. Halliburton\u2019s broad technology portfolio, local expertise, and commercial flexibility are helping these customers achieve their efficiencies and production objectives.  Multiple years of service company CapEx reductions limit equipment availability in the international markets. In early 2020, pre-COVID, international pricing was beginning to increase on the back of equipment tightness, but paused with the oil demand collapse. As the world reopens and activity rebounds, we expect large tenders to remain competitive, but leading edge pricing should increase. Our strategic priority is clear; deliver profitable growth as the expected international recovery unfolds. We believe the following factors will help us accomplish this : first, we expect our ongoing investment in technology innovations to benefit us as the market recovers.  For example, as the global leader in completions technology, we introduced the Ovidius Expanding Isolation Packer. Ovidius uses material science innovation to transform a metal alloy into a rock-like material when it reacts with downhole fluids. It creates a long-lasting seal for improved well integrity and is specially suited for high pressure and high temperature environments, as well as permanent plug and abandonment operations. Our completion tools R&D pipeline incorporates the latest advancements in material science, sensors, telemetry and digitalization. Ovidius is one good example of this pipeline. The successful rollout of our iCruise intelligent drilling system continues to deliver excellent results.  In the first quarter, iCruise improved drilling speeds 55% for a customer in the Middle East; saved an operator three days of rig time in the North Sea and increased drilling rates 25% compared to offset wells in offshore China. Second, our Production business continues to expand internationally with unique growth opportunities. We plan to start executing on our first multiyear electric submersible pump contract in the Middle East in the second half of this year.  We see significant volume and future growth potential for artificial lift solutions in the Middle East as many mature fields across the region come off natural flow and require ESPs to sustain production. With proven Summit ESP technology, a strong local presence, and a focus on profitable growth, we expect to thrive in this market. As we progress towards completing our specialty chemicals plant in Saudi Arabia, we are actively participating in regional tendering activity. In addition to providing new business opportunities, this plant will also manufacture chemicals for our internal consumption. We expect the new plant to deliver cost savings and profitable growth for Halliburton in 2022 and beyond. Finally, we are accelerating the deployment and integration of digital technologies with our customers. We believe digital creates technological differentiation, contributes to higher international margins, and drives internal efficiencies.  In the first quarter, we introduced a new real-time data transmission system for a major customer in the North Sea. This high fidelity, low latency data highway is an essential building block for virtual remote operations that are performed without human intervention and use real-time data and tailored algorithms. We also launched a new digital workflow on a private cloud for an integrated services contract in the Middle East.  This workflow helps our employees make better decisions. It uses a proprietary natural language processing service to extract specific information from a variety of documents and locate associated data in our data lake. This is digital technology in action facilitating collaboration and knowledge management, while improving operational efficiencies. These digital technologies are important milestones in our journey from digital planning to virtual execution. We are using our open architecture platform to integrate real-time information from the customer, Halliburton\u2019s many digitally-enabled technologies and third-party providers across the entire asset.  I believe that Halliburton\u2019s current strengths and new capabilities will deliver profitable growth in a multi-year international recovery. Today, North America is staging a healthy recovery. In the current oil price environment, shale operators have a larger portfolio of economically viable projects. As a result, the average U.S. land rig count grew 27% sequentially in the first quarter, outpacing the growth in completed stages.  We still expect the majority of our customers to remain committed to a disciplined capital program this year. But what we are seeing today solidifies our confidence in a steady activity cadence for the rest of the year as operators work to maintain their productive capacity. The market dynamics continue to improve. Supportive commodity prices should allow our customers to spend their announced budgets and meet their cash flow objectives. Customer mix should transition as the year unfolds. Privates led the recovery in the first half and we expect some public companies to increase activity in the second half of the year.  Halliburton serves both of these customer groups aligning with operators that have longer term and more efficient programs. As a result, demand for our equipment is increasing and our calendar is filling up for the rest of the year. Last year, we used digital technology to redesign our service delivery approach and create significant differentiation in our cost structure. Adding to our cost reset in 2020, we continued to drive cost out of our North America operations.  As an example, we\u2019ve engaged with Vorto, a software company that designed an artificial intelligence supply chain platform to transform how we buy, move, and sell sand and trucking within our U.S. Land Operations.  Without human intervention, Vorto\u2019s platform optimizes thousands of logistics loads per day while also identifying and addressing issues before they occur. This fits with our strategic priorities to use digital technology to drive down costs in our business and to maximize value in North America. Together with our size and scale, our sustainable operating leverage should widen our margin differential relative to our competitors in North America. We are steadily improving margins and our first quarter performance was another step in the right direction.  As we look ahead, we see upside to our margin performance based on utilization, technology, innovation, and pricing. Utilization is the first step to better margins with a smaller equipment base and the right customer alignment we intend to continue optimizing utilization as market demand grows. Given our scale, the operating leverage impact from utilization increases alone should improve our cash flow generation in North America. Technological differentiation and digital innovation is the next step. Halliburton has the leading low emission solutions in the market today, both electric and dual fuel and we expect they will command a premium as market demand expands. As the leader in hydraulic fracturing, Halliburton has the scale and R&D depths to deliver a proven power-agnostic, capital efficient solution for e-frac. Deployed in the Permian Basin, our fully integrated all-electric frac site includes our 5,000 horsepower Zeus electric pumping unit, our new ExpressBlend blending system, E-Winch electric wireline unit and the electric tech command center built using our flagship Q10 pumps, Zeus delivers performance levels up to 40% higher than conventional pumps and substantially reduces emissions limited only by the grid power source. As certain components of our input costs rise, we are working with our suppliers and our customers to adjust our gross pricing in line with cost inflation we are seeing in the market. While improving U.S. economic activity and winter weather disruptions led to increases in sand, chemicals, cement additives, and raw materials costs, Halliburton\u2019s purchasing power and technology have allowed us to procure and deliver these materials in a cost-efficient manner, such that both Halliburton and our customers are more competitive. Service pricing improvement is the final step. We are not there yet but we see positive signs of market rebalancing that should drive future pricing improvements. Total fracturing equipment capacity has limited room to grow in the current pricing environment.  Continued attrition from the rising service intensity and insufficient returns for many service companies is altering the industry dynamics, because we are an integrated provider, Halliburton participates in all key businesses in North America today and we will benefit more than others when pricing moves up. We believe that Halliburton\u2019s leadership and strength in North America will allow us to take advantage of positive market dynamics and deliver on our strategic priority to maximize value in this market. Consistent with our strategy, we continue to turn every knob to manage greater capital efficiency and drive solid free cash flow generation.  This takes many forms and includes important technology advancements and multiple product service lines whether digital or equipment related, process changes that improve the speed with which we move equipment and respond to market opportunities. And finally, actions to reduce the pace of working capital consumption required to grow our business. The first quarter was a good demonstration of this and we will continue to build on these actions. We are also executing on our strategic priority to advance cleaner affordable energy and to support sustainable energy advancements using innovation and technology to reduce the environmental impact of producing oil and gas.  Halliburton has a three-prong approach to achieving this objective. First, we recently released our target to achieve 40% reduction in Scope one and two emissions by 2035 from the 2018 baseline. This is consistent with our goal to reduce the carbon footprint and environmental impact of our operations and follows our commitment to set science-based targets announced last year. Second, we are innovating. We continue to develop and deploy low carbon solutions to help oil and gas operators lower their current emissions profiles. We also use our existing technologies in renewable energy applications.  For example, today, the geothermal market in Europe is growing rapidly and represents an attractive expansion opportunity for our artificial lift business. We are currently supplying electric submersible pumps specifically designed for the high temperature, large well bore applications on the geothermal project in Germany.  We are also providing drilling and cementing services for geothermal wells in Indonesia. We developed new high temperature cementing formulations and directional drilling techniques that increase geothermal sites\u2019 generating capacity and improve project economics. And finally, we are excited about the progress of Halliburton Labs, our clean energy accelerator. In the first quarter, we announced Halliburton Labs\u2019 inaugural group of participating companies. They are working on solutions for transforming organic and plastic waste to renewable power, recycling of lithium-ion batteries and converting carbon dioxide, water and renewable electricity into a hydrogen-rich platform chemical. We are collaborating with these companies and providing world-class industrial capabilities and expertise to help them achieve further scale and increase their valuations.  This engagement in the clean energy space will inform Halliburton\u2019s future strategic decisions as the energy transition evolves. We are taking applications for the next cohort of participants as we continue bringing early-stage clean energy companies in to Halliburton Labs. To sum up, we entered 2021 optimistic and focused on innovation. We believe that the early positive momentum in North America will continue and the international market recovery will accelerate in the second half of the year. Halliburton will continue to execute on our key strategic priorities to deliver industry-leading returns and solid free cash flow as the anticipated multi-year recovery unfolds. I will now turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our financial results. Lance? Lance Loeffler : Thank you, Jeff. Let\u2019s begin this morning with an overview of our first quarter results, compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.5 billion, an increase of 7% and our operating income was $370 million, an increase of 6%, compared to the adjusted operating income of $350 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Now, let me take a moment to discuss our divisional results in a little bit more detail. In our Completion and Production division, revenue was $1.9 billion or an increase of 3%, while operating income was $252 million, representing a decrease of 11%.  The increase in revenue was primarily driven by higher stimulation and artificial lift activity in North America, higher cementing activity in the North Sea, as well as improved stimulation activity in Argentina and Mexico and higher completion tools sales in Latin America. These increases were partially offset by lower cementing services in Russia, lower pressure pumping activity in the Middle East, reduced seasonal completion tool sales and lower well intervention services in the Eastern Hemisphere. Operating income was negatively impacted primarily by decreased completion tool sales and reduced pressure pumping activity in the Eastern Hemisphere. Our Drilling and Evaluation revenue was $1.6 billion or an increase of 11%, while operating income was $171 million, an increase of 46%. These increases were primarily due to higher software sales globally, improved drilling-related services and wireline activity in the Western Hemisphere and Norway and increased project management activity internationally. Partially offsetting these increases were lower drilling-related services across Asia. Moving on to our geographical results. In North America, revenue was $1.4 billion, representing an increase of 13%. These results were primarily driven by higher drilling-related services, stimulation and artificial lift activity in North America Land, as well as higher wireline activity and software sales in North America Land and the Gulf of Mexico. Partially offsetting these increases were reduced completion tool sales and lower cementing and fluids activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Moving to Latin America, revenue was $535 million, representing an increase of 26% resulting primarily from increased activity in multiple product service lines in Argentina and Mexico, as well as higher fluid services in the Caribbean. Partially offsetting these improvements was reduced activity across multiple product service lines in Colombia. Turning to Europe, Africa, CIS, revenue was $634 million, a 1% decrease sequentially, resulting mainly from reduced completion tool sales and well intervention services across the region, coupled with lower activity in Russia and lower fluid services in Kazakhstan. These decreases were partially offset by higher well construction activity in the North Sea and increased software sales across the region. In Middle East Asia, revenue was $878 million or a 6% decrease. These results were primarily driven by lower stimulation and well intervention services in the Middle East, reduced drilling-related activity in Indonesia and China, and lower completion tool sales across the region. Partially offsetting these declines were improved project management activity in Iraq and Saudi Arabia and higher wireline activity across Asia. In the first quarter, our corporate expense totaled $53 million. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate corporate expense to be slightly higher. Net interest expense for the quarter was $125 million and we expect this level of interest expense to drift slightly lower in the second quarter as a result of our reduced debt balance.  Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 23%. As we go forward into 2021, based on the anticipated market environment and our expected geographic earnings mix, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. Turning to cash flow, we generated $203 million of cash from operations during the first quarter and $157 million of free cash flow. We also repaid $188 million in maturing debt with cash on hand in the first quarter and we\u2019ll continue to prioritize reducing leverage in the near-term.  Capital expenditures during the quarter came in at $104 million. We expect capital equipment deliveries for international projects to ramp up in the second half of the year and as a result, our full year 2021 CapEx guidance remains unchanged. Finally, turning to our near-term operational outlook. Let me provide you with some comments on how we see the second quarter unfolding.  In North America, we expect both completions and drilling activity momentum to continue, but sequential activity growth should moderate. In the international markets, we expect a seasonal rebound and a broad based activity increase, the pace of which will vary across different regions.  As a result, for our Completion and Production division, we anticipate low double-digit revenue growth sequentially with margins expected to expand by 125 to 150 basis points as a result of our strong operating leverage across all markets. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate a mid-single digit revenue increase with margins declining 100 to 125 basis points sequentially. The moderate growth and anticipated reduction in margins are primarily attributed to the seasonal decline in our software sales globally. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff? Jeff Miller : Thanks, Lance. To sum up, I am optimistic about how this transition year is shaping up. The demand outlook continues to improve both internationally and domestically, even as some regions still experience lockdowns. This year is headed in the right direction and Halliburton is focused on the right things to deliver on our shareholders objectives.  We expect our strong international business to continue its profitable growth as activity increases throughout the year. In North America, our business has recovered and is demonstrating margin improvement on the back of our strong operating leverage. Digital is growing our revenue and helping us and our customers increase operational efficiency and reduce costs. Our commitment to capital efficiency is expected to support growth and solid free cash flow generation. And finally, we believe that our strategy to advance cleaner affordable energy positions us well for the future. And now let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. James West : Morning guys. Jeff Miller : Morning, James. James West : So Jeff, clearly, international looks good in the back half where we are 90 days from your last conference call and obviously you announced [Photonics] [ph] in between. But your visibility on the second half and even more so on 2022, which I think is more important, should have increased at this point.  And so, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on kind of how the international recovery takes shape, I understand you have double-digit year-over-year second half of this year, but really, as it kind of runs into 2022. How we should be thinking about regions, markets, so where the growth is going to be and then should that double-digit momentum continue? Jeff Miller : Yes. Thanks, James. The \u2013 yes, confidence improving and visibility improving around our outlook both for 2021 and for 2022 and in fact, when we see \u2013 I see tender pipeline strong, strengthening, these are all sort of the things that start sometime later this year, but really start to get traction in 2022 and even 2023. Some of the programs that we are seeing are shorter cycle barrels, but the fact is, those are actually service intense barrels [defined] [ph] so it [indiscernible] going to drive more upstream spending faster and even if I look at just 2021 outlook confidence is more so today. I think earlier \u2013 we see it at a minimum improving to flat year-on-year which is an improvement from what we thought earlier. James West : Right. Okay. Okay. It makes sense. And then as we think about North America, obviously the big E&Ps are going to remain capital disciplined and probably show some really good cash flow this year given where the oil price is, but they\u2019ll step up next year as it committed to spend a certain percentage of cash flow. So, are you starting to have conversations or started to think about 2022 as it reflects to North America and then kind of what the increase could be in spending as oil prices are 30% higher than they were going into this year? Jeff Miller : Yes, James, I think we are going to see sort of the steady cadence of the increase as we move through this year and even into next year. I think, just the feedback and sense I get is that there is a lot of discipline around production and what they can do profitably and also think as we see improvement into 2022. They will face those service cost inflation just because of where everything is today, what needs to be replaced.  So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u2013 it won\u2019t be the \u2013 certainly won\u2019t be the same and I think that tightening of capacity is very good for Halliburton and I think that anything that will be a bit of a governor. James West : Got you. Okay. Thanks, Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Scott Gruber : Yes, good morning. Jeff Miller : Good morning, Scott. Scott Gruber : So, as you guys probably heard some of your investor conversations there has been some concern around Halliburton in terms of the C&P margins as we start the year just given the mix towards the domestic completion market and we heard the 2Q guide obviously. How should we be thinking about the second half and assuming no net pricing in the U.S. with the international side starting to accelerate, U.S. continuing to expand on a more efficient and streamlined platform, how should we think about second half incrementals and kind of some high level if could put some color around that? And can we do better than the 2Q pace which looks like to be around 25%? Jeff Miller : Well, look, thanks, Scott. We are confident about the progression in North America certainly for C&P and globally. And I think that the \u2013 our goal is to maximize the value of this business and I\u2019ve said I think we expect mid teens full year and I think that\u2019s a solid number and that\u2019s the reflecting and activity increase that is driving the incremental margins as opposed to pricing, no pricing in that. And I think we have visibility towards what will drive pricing which will substantially improve, in fact super charge those incrementals. But I think right now, we are building our outlook around what is a steady cadence of improvement and maintaining, actually continuing to drive further efficiencies in North America with respect to keeping our cost. The reset that we did last year is still alive and well in place. Scott Gruber : Got you. And a similar question on the D&E side. Obviously, some noise on the margin front around the software sales. But maybe some color on the second half for D&E, I guess, the question is, in the past as we\u2019ve seen the international side of the business accelerate off the bottom, we\u2019ve often seen startup costs, [indiscernible] the margin improvement potential at least for a couple quarters at the start of the cycle. Is there risk of that this cycle or is that really diminished given the digital applications and streamlining the platform? How should we think about D&E margins expansion in the second half as things start to pick up internationally? Jeff Miller : Yes. Thanks. Look, I think the D&E starting at a higher point than it did finished last year is important. I think it\u2019s just two important things. One, our software business is strong and accretive and it also says though that the rest of the business margins, the breadth of D&E\u2019s margins, the baseline is improving. And so, we are knocking on double-digits as we look out through the rest of the year.  As I look at the back half for the international expansion on D&E, we are positioned today for that. And so, the kind of investment we are making, we view it as of March. We want to continue to improve the baseline margins in that business. So, it\u2019s continuing to improve. And so, I think we\u2019ll see improvement in 2021. I think that continues beyond that.  And so, our outlook is for continuing to grow those margins. I don\u2019t see the kind of headwinds that we might have seen a year ago when we were ramping for one of the largest contracts in the North Sea. I mean, I don\u2019t see that repeat.  And in some of what we are getting also is the benefit of the capital efficiency that\u2019s baked into a lot of our D&E ability to move things around. In fact, that\u2019s at the core of our strategy is capital efficiency and I think that manifests itself around how we move tools and other things. Scott Gruber : Great. Appreciate the color, Jeff. Thank you. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. David Anderson : Hi, good morning, Jeff. I was just wondering if you could just talk briefly about the pressure pumping market. I certainly want to talk about DGB engines; E&P is increasingly looking to move away from diesel.  Some of it may be suggesting higher pricing on [indiscernible] equipment and I was just wondering if you could kind of tell us where you stand on this and are your customers pushing for this type of equipment? And are you starting to see any bifurcation in the market on pricing because of this? Jeff Miller : Yes. Thanks, Dave. Look, I think as we look into the future, those types of solutions will get pricing earlier and more so. We are seeing more demand for those types of solutions. We have a leading position around whether it\u2019s Tier-4 dual fuel or also the electric. And so, yes, we are seeing the demand. I think that the bifurcation will happen gradually simply because of the ability to do two things; one, put equipment into the market and so the way we look at that is that\u2019s replacement equipment generally.  So we\u2019ve got 10% to 12% of our equipment that goes off every year. And so, what we are able to do is replace that with what we view would be higher margin, better returning equipment over time, but that\u2019s more of the pacing that we see.  And then the other sort of key components around pricing, I mean, when we look at all of this, but when we think about returns for new equipment \u2013 any kind of new equipment, but particularly technology we expect some premium around the technology and also derisking the time horizon impact of making those returns also I think that\u2019s equally key. David Anderson : That makes sense. And then, if I could just switchover to the international side, you talked about improved project management activity in Iraq and Saudi Arabia. I was just wondering first, was there anything noteworthy behind this improvement?  Or is this more of the course of business, but kind of more importantly as you talk \u2013 look at the tendering activity out there, is this going to be a preferred contracting model for NOCs? I guess, assuming we are at the beginning of a multi-year growth phase and if so, are you comfortable increasing your exposure to project management activity? Jeff Miller : The answer to the first question, Dave, this is sort of normal course of business. We see improvements that we see more activity at different times. So, that\u2019s really all to read through on that. I think the \u2013 with respect to project management broadly and how we see those contracts in the future, obviously, a lot of activity around that, we\u2019ll be certainly very thoughtful around how we increase that exposure, we manage that risk. And in fact, the most important component of looking at those types of things is understanding and managing the risk. David Anderson : Of course. Jeff Miller : And it\u2019s one of the reasons also, you hear me say it a lot, but I am talking about profitable growth internationally. And so, that profitable component is going to be the lead punch around how we grow internationally. So we\u2019ll take that. Certainly, we are in that business. We are good at that business. But we are also pretty circumspect around how we make money doing that. David Anderson : Thanks, Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Sean Meakim : Thank you. Hey, good morning. Jeff Miller : Good morning. Lance Loeffler : Hey, Sean. Sean Meakim : So, C&P had pretty good quarter always considered, you expected some mix shift for the back half of the year. Private E&Ps led the very early recovery. You are suggesting some publics to add rigs in the back half. Does this also suggest that you think private E&Ps are mostly as what they can under the current oil price environment?  They have been \u2013 they are over half the rig count today. They are two-thirds of the rigs as of the trough. But their end economics are not that different maybe than from the publics\u2019. So just curious your visibility on the private E&P activity for the balance of the year. Jeff Miller : Yes. Look, I think that they are the most nimble groups. They are going to move the quick as to engage. They also have a leashed impact on the overall headline production number also. So I think that, I really am encouraged by the activity that we\u2019ve seen. The ability to continue that. I think they are all making their own economic decisions and they make that really without a lot of stakeholder beyond the owners their direction.  And so, I think what we are seeing is a natural reaction to that. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s indicative of how the whole market behaves. And so, they have the ability to get real busy and then, slow down and back it down as they see production start to ramp up a little bit for them and it changes their economics. So, a hard march up into the right not necessarily I think they all make their own decisions and could easily \u2013 I am not going to say, back off, but what they will do is make those decisions as other operators start to ramp and that\u2019s obviously a much more disciplined group. They have plans in place. I think the key point to make here though, we are at the end of the first quarter.  We are into Q2. And we haven\u2019t talked about any of the kind of budget blow outs that we talked about in prior years where, I, oh, wow, we\u2019ve overspent. So there is something coming that\u2019s going to slow things down. That\u2019s not all what we see.  In fact, what I am describing in terms of confidence and the cadence is, the confidence and the cadence that we are going to stay busy in marching through the second half of the year likely up some. In fact, I think our outlook today is up North America, maybe close to 10% on the full year. So, that\u2019s some moderation, but that\u2019s still growing. Sean Meakim : That\u2019s a good point. I\u2019d appreciate that feedback. On D&E results obviously impressively sort of unpacked the impact of seasonal software sales spilling into the first quarter. You have also been press releasing a lot of the new contracts and agreements tied to digital initiatives. So just curious how much of the confidence underlying your margin commentary is driven by the improved mix from digital? And could it eventually be justified to maybe enhance some disclosure around the materiality of digital to your results? Jeff Miller : Well, it\u2019s certainly digital enhancing our margins. But that\u2019s \u2013 and that\u2019s certainly where we want to see that go and we expect it to continue. It\u2019s also baked into all aspects of our business. So, from a digital perspective, it is sort of equal parts, customer-oriented by just consulting and software sales. It\u2019s also equal parts making our tools better, so they become answer products and we sell them through the normal course of business, but they meaningfully impact the value of those tools.  And then finally, what it does internally to drive our own cost down and so helping, yes, but I think more importantly, when I look at D&E is again back to that baseline of improving margins, which is built on the back of sort of the iCruise performance and technology there - wireline performance and technology there. So, those kinds of things that are operational. We can see them. We see them getting traction, more broad traction. Those are the kinds of things that as we look into a multi-year upcycle internationally, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive margin up 2021, 2022, 2023. Sean Meakim : Really helpful. Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from Ian Macpherson with Simmons. Ian Macpherson : Thanks, good morning guys. Jeff, I wanted to ask you for an update on your innovative frac operations. You spoke interestingly last quarter about the SmartFleet as well as we\u2019ve seen what you\u2019ve accomplished with the grid fracking. I know there has been some IP contest there. I don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t need to talk about that, but just kind of an update on how those operations on leading edge technology in domestic frac are going? And how you see that blossoming over the course of the year with incremental fleets of those varieties? Jeff Miller : Yes, look, I really like the technology. I like what we\u2019ve done. The smart fleet is as advertised. We got more trials to do. But we continue to find more effective ways to deliver that solution which should allow it to scale even more quickly. I think it\u2019s going to continue to gain a lot of traction, very capital-efficient approach to implementing technology, because it implements with the equipment that we have.  From an e-fleet standpoint, again, certainly pleased with the performance that we\u2019ve seen. Yes, it continues to drive or deliver on the kinds of efficiencies we probably would see both for us in terms of utilization and dollars per horsepower. Lot of interest from customers around that technology also. But just remember we are maximizing value in North America. So we only put this equipment out when it meets our return expectations and we can do this \u2013 the time horizon. And so, it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s going to look more like replacement of upgrading replacements as opposed to sort of new investment. Ian Macpherson : Understood. Thanks, Jeff. And then, separately, Lance, I want to ask you about the free cash flow progression going into Q2 and for the rest year. Obviously, the CapEx was light loaded in Q1. And so, just thoughts on how the CapEx sequences through the year? And just general, maybe a refresh on total absolute dollar working capital framework for this year \u2013 no, sorry, not working capital, but bottom-line free cash? Lance Loeffler : Yes, no. Good question Ian. Look, I think, overall, as everyone knows, maximizing free cash flow remains the key priority for us and what we are focused on. But more so, free cash flow is driven by margin progression and then all aspects of the capital efficiency. I know, Jeff covered a little bit in his prepared remarks around efficiency and working capital and remaining disciplined around CapEx.  Look, more operating profit we see ahead based on our activity outlook improving and obviously the progression around margins that we\u2019ve discussed already this morning, we are pretty optimistic about what all of that means for 2021 free cash flow target, which today gives us more confidence that we will be sort of ahead of where consensus sits today even excluding the change in the metric that we\u2019ve outlined this quarter. Ian Macpherson : Perfect. Thanks, Lance. Lance Loeffler : You bet, Ian. Operator : Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Chase Mulvehill : Hey. Good morning, everybody. Jeff Miller : Hey. Good morning, Chase. Chase Mulvehill : Hey Jeff and Lance. So, I guess, in your prepared remarks, you talked about a doubling of the value of submitted bids across the international market we compare that to what you saw last year. So, I guess, I was hoping that maybe you could provide a little color relative to the mix between NOC, IOCs, independent E&Ps and maybe the regions that you see the most pick up in bidding activity.  And then, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d be willing to kind of step out or squeeze a little bit and so, what it might would mean for activity as we kind of get into 2022 if you start signing a lot of these contracts. And so, I know you talked about some continued growth and some strong growth on the international side over the medium-term. But I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d like to quantify that at this point just given the bid activity you are seeing. Jeff Miller : Yes, look, I think that the type of activity we are seeing is probably more weighted towards Middle East, Latin America, broadly in terms of tender activity. I think that I am not going to try to quantify things that are two derivatives, kind of deviations in the future, but what our view is, that\u2019s certainly indicative of a growing market and a kind of market that will grow over time.  We are going to engage in that and participate in it, but at the end \u2013 and be successful. But our view is, A. focus on profitable growth and drive international revenue growth that way, but I think we are also going to see that sort of lead to the broader based kind of recovery which is equally important to price and so that bring that up is to say that these big tenders are always very competitive from a price standpoint.  But where we start to see price improvement typically is as the market sort of starts to fill up, then we see more opportunities and that is how we see the international market shaping up. So, I think that\u2019s an equally important concept to what we are seeing in terms of growth. Chase Mulvehill : Okay. Thanks for the color there. And maybe I can kind of come back to the conversation around U.S. onshore and try to tease out a little bit more in the publics versus privates. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d be kind of willing to share your mix of publics versus privates in the U.S. onshore. I know, kind of overall rig activity is roughly half between the publics and privates today and it continues to kind of see a shift towards privates as activity continues to rebound because they are obviously responding to a high oil price while the publics are not.  So, maybe just talk to your mix and kind of what advantages you think you have when you look to kind of pursue more opportunities on the private side versus your competitors? Jeff Miller : Look, we have a great footprint in North America. We\u2019ve got a leading position in North America, which means we really work for all of the customers in North America. So, from a mix perspective, what we look for is efficiency. We look for opportunity. We look for growth opportunity and we look for uptake on technology and performance.  And so, I think the \u2013 that\u2019s the way we view the market less around, A versus B, but it\u2019s more do they have the characteristics that allow us to drive our value proposition in market and maximize the kind of returns like we are talking about. And so, I think that, that moves in different times depending on where the market is, but it doesn\u2019t easily change a whole lot. Chase Mulvehill : Okay. I\u2019ll turn it back over. Thanks, Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Marc Bianchi : Thank you. I guess, thinking about the cost structure going forward, there are few variables I think with COVID normalization hopefully coming out of COVID where, maybe there could be some increased travel and entertainment expense. I am curious how that sort of factors into the margin outlook that you have and if there is any risk to maybe a headwind to margin as we get into the back half of the year? Jeff Miller : Yes. Thanks. Look, those types of costs are in our outlook. So, I don't \u2013 we manage cost all of the time. I don't see a bow wave of that coming back. We've reset the earnings. We reset it in terms of how we work and how we move people around and how we go to market. So, look forward to the market opening. I think that's going to drive a lot more demand that will continue to drive demand for oil. But I think from \u2013 from our standpoint, we're going to \u2013 we just manage those costs. Marc Bianchi : Yes. Thanks for that, Jeff. And Lance, back on the free cash flow, working cap was a positive number this quarter, but then there was another sort of 250 drag or outflow from other operating outflows. Could you talk about that? And then, just as I think about those two lines over the course of the year, would you expect them to be net neutral, positive, negative? Lance Loeffler : Yes. So, other operating in the cash flow line item tends to be pretty heavy in the first quarter. We've got compensation that tends to hit in the first quarter, as well as, taxes are heavy with property taxes, et cetera. And so, that's not atypical from us from a, intra-year cyclicality perspective. We expect that to lighten up obviously into Q, but that's \u2013 that's sort of the color I would give you on that. Marc Bianchi : Okay. Thanks for that. I'll turn it back. Lance Loeffler : Thanks. Thanks, Marc. Marc Bianchi : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Connor Lynagh : Yes. Thank you. I was hoping we could put a finer point on some of the discussion on pricing in international. You made the comment that obviously large tenders will be competitive, but leading edge pricing should increase. Can you maybe frame for us the extent to which leading edge pricing is meaningfully different from what you're more sort of contracts book looks like? In other words, if leading edge pricing is moving higher would that imply that contract pricing will follow? Or is there a market-to-market impact we should talk about? Jeff Miller : No, I think contract pricing will follow is the way that works generally. It starts there. The contracts themselves improve over time and I think that having alternatives that are higher priced also helped to create pressure \u2013 upward pressure on pricing even in large contracts. Lance Loeffler : And I would add. I mean, that's what Jeff is describing is exactly what we were seeing in the early part or late part of 2019 and 2020 was that dynamic in terms of large tenders still bid competitively. But rising level of activity was tightening the rest of the broader market. Obviously, we took a pause with COVID, but we expect as we see activity levels creep back to where we were in those \u2013 at that period of time, I think we are optimistic that we start to see the same behavior from a pricing perspective. Connor Lynagh : Got it. It makes sense. And I guess, just further to that, so on the large tender side of things, there has been some discussion about some of the softer elements maybe improving before pricing. How do you, guys feel about the potential for terms and conditions or different types of ancillary charges improving in the near term?  And I guess, the other question is, you've made a lot of changes to your cost structure. Do you think you can maybe drive improved margins without the increase in pricing? Jeff Miller : Yes, we expect to do that and that's as we continue to see activity come on we will see improving margins. Always working on T's and C's. There are always leading edge sort of things that we are working on that they come easier to do become very important overtime to do. We are doing those all of the time and we are doing those now. Also, digital sort of implicit through all of this. So when you see our digital improving driving margins better all of the time. And so, I think, we should see improving margins before we see even the pricing, but I think the pricing, that's what allows us to really that's where we see the real traction and incrementals. Connor Lynagh : Appreciate the color. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Voie with Wells Fargo. Chris Voie : Thanks. Good morning. Just want to ask first on some of the cost inflation that was mentioned in the prepared remarks. Is that mostly getting offset in the pretty near-term maybe this quarter next? Or is there any impacts that could be flowing through as you get price recovery in the second and third quarter? Just curious if there is going to any tailwind from that? Lance Loeffler : Yes, Chris. This is Lance. Yes, I mean, a lot of that\u2019s largely, the cost of inflation that we describe is driven by what's happening in North America and the growth that we are seeing there. Some of it was driven by the impact of the storms, right and some of the shortages that we saw across the value chain. But I would say, look, our size and scale gives us an inherent advantage to negotiate the best deals in a lot of those consumables.  And to the extent a lot of our commercial arrangements allow us to pass that through to the customer. Our guidance overall sort of incorporates that. And I think, look, we are always going to be continuing to focus on maximizing our value in North America regardless of the challenges in the environment. But that\u2019s sort of baked into how we see at least, the near-term playing out and obviously the outlook we've given the year. Chris Voie : Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, maybe on CapEx. So, I think in the past you said 5% to 6% range. In the data it looks like service intensity is very high. Pricing has not really caught up with the amount of work that\u2019s getting done. So just curious to check in on the 5% to 6% range. If you expect that would still be in place for 2021 and probably 2022 as well. Jeff Miller : Yes. Yes. I mean, that's what we talk about capital efficiency and driving capital efficiency through all parts of our business. That's what allows us to get to that 5% to 6% of revenues in terms of CapEx spend. So yes, for 2021 and 2022. Chris Voie : Perfect. Thank you. Jeff Miller : Thanks. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Jeff Miller for closing remarks. Jeff Miller : Okay. Thank you, Liz. Before we end the call, I'd like to make a few closing comments. I am encouraged by this year's positive momentum and demand recovery. We are well positioned globally for growing international demand. The expected steady activity cadence in North America and with our leading digital technologies, which allow us to maximize value for Halliburton and its shareholders. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.  Liz, please close out the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating.

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to hand the conference over to Abu Zeya, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Abu Zeya : Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton second quarter 2021 conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for 7 days.  Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO, and Lance Loeffler, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, recent current reports on Form 8-K, and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our second quarter earnings release and can also be found in the Quarterly Results and Presentation section of our website. After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow time for others who may be in the queue. Now, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you, Abu, and good morning, everyone. Our performance in the second quarter demonstrates that our clear strategy is working well and Halliburton strategic priorities are driving value. Let's get right to the highlights. Total company revenue increased 7% sequentially as both North America and international top line continued to improve. Operating income grew 17% with solid margin performance in both divisions. Our Completion and Production division revenue increased 10%, driven by the strength in U.S. land completions. C&P delivered operating margin of 16% in the second quarter, reaching three-year highs.  Our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue grew 5%. Operating margin of 11% was about flat sequentially with rig count increases across multiple regions, offsetting a seasonal decline in software sales. North America revenue grew 12% as both drilling and completions activity marched higher throughout the quarter. Increased utilization and our significant operating leverage supported sequential margin expansion.  International revenue grew 4% sequentially, with activity increasing in the key producing regions of the world despite COVID-19 disruptions in various countries.  Finally, we generated strong free cash flow this quarter, bringing the year-to-date free cash flow to almost $425 million.  I'm pleased with the solid performance we delivered in the first half of this transition year. While recent market volatility only demonstrates the fact that we remain in a transition year, today, I want to spend more time discussing what I believe will unfold over the next couple of years.  First, let me reaffirm the outlook for the rest of this year. In the second half of 2021, we expect activity momentum to continue. Internationally, we still anticipate a double-digit increase in activity compared to the second half of 2020 even as certain countries continue to face COVID disruptions.  With commodity prices remaining supportive, we believe activity in North America inches higher with drilling outpacing completions as operators build up well inventory for 2022. Looking beyond this year, let me describe the longer-term outlook. We believe that we're in the early innings of a multi-year upcycle. For the first time in seven years, we anticipate simultaneous growth in international and North America markets, and this view guides our business objectives and expected outcomes.  So, here's how we see the macro industry environment playing out over the next couple of years. First, we believe commodity prices will remain structurally supportive. With both demand resurgence in many economies and increased vaccines availability, we anticipate the global demand will continue to exceed supply, particularly to the extent OPEC+ manages supply additions over the near-term. As OPEC+'s spare capacity returns to normalized levels over the next year, we believe sufficient pent-up global oil demand will support a call on both international and U.S. production.  Second, multiple years of underinvestment in the international markets, coupled with the anticipated oil and gas demand growth, give us confidence in a healthy international recovery. I believe the growth will be led by the national oil companies and focused on shorter cycle barrels. This activity should come with higher service intensity and higher relative capital spend around the wellbore as opposed to long cycle infrastructure investments.  We expect mature fields, both onshore and offshore, to attract the most investment, while large scale greenfield exploration will be limited to a few markets in Africa and Latin America. As a result, we anticipate double-digit annual international spending growth at least over the next couple of years.  Third, we believe that a supportive commodity price environment, normalized levels of spare OPEC+ capacity and high decline rates in U.S. shale are constructive for North American spending. We expect drilling and completion spending in North America will also grow double digits annually over the next two years, although activity will not return to pre-pandemic levels. We expect private operators to opportunistically lead the activity comeback, while public E&Ps balance growth and returns. Fourth, I believe equipment availability will tighten much faster than most people think. In multiple product lines, we believe that equipment supply will fall behind anticipated demand. Today, both drilling and completions equipment are nearing tightness in North America, and we expect to see international markets tighten over the next few quarters. Given the scarcity of external capital sources, many North American service companies do not currently generate sufficient cash to organically fund investment in new equipment, innovation and maintenance, let alone generate sufficient returns. Internationally, multiple years of service company CapEx reductions should limit equipment availability.  We expect increasing demand and tightening equipment capacity will lead to higher prices. Pricing is beginning to return in North America now and is expected to lag internationally where contract durations are longer.  I know the positive macro outlook I just described as a case for the rising tide lifting all boats. However, what matters is how Halliburton is positioned to outperform in this market. The improving macro environment marks the first time in a long time that we see an increasing level of customer urgency and a pivot back to what creates value in our industry. And this reinforces the power of Halliburton's unique value proposition. Throughout the downturn, Halliburton doubled down on our value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. We continue to invest in technology, both digital and hardware, that maximizes value per barrel of production. We are expanding in new market segments. We are uniquely positioned in North America as the only integrated service company. Our collaborative culture and engineered solutions create sustainable competitive advantage, setting Halliburton up to move from value creation to value capture.  Here are a few examples of how Halliburton creates and captures value through our digital technologies. We're accelerating the deployment and integration of digital, both with our customers and internally. It creates technical differentiation, contributes to higher margins, and drives internal efficiencies.  Over the first six months of this year, we grew the total user count on our iEnergy public cloud by 70%, and cloud revenue now constitutes almost 20% of our overall software revenues. We believe that this shift from on-prem to cloud software solutions drives faster growth. It also allows us to expand our revenue base with the same customers as we add new cloud native applications and increase the number of users within the same operator.  Digital technology enables high value remote and autonomous operations. We see steady growth of our remote monitoring of open hole wireline operations. For example, this past quarter, we deployed virtual remote logging capabilities on a remote location in Continental Europe, utilizing a wellsite specialist in Norway to remotely operate downhole tools. Virtual remote logging allows us to place highly specialized personnel at regional hubs rather than in the field, which leads to better resource utilization, fewer personnel at the well site, less HSE exposure and higher margins. We also deployed digital and automation in our drilling operations across the globe, both on discrete and integrated contracts. Over 75% of our iCruise drilling system runs are fully automated today, and we expect all runs to have some automation by the end of this year. Across Europe and Eurasia, we increased the number of automated jobs fivefold since the beginning of this year. Drilling automation directly translates to top tier customer performance.  For example, over the last two years, it allowed us to improve the rates of penetration by approximately 25% on a Middle East lump sum turnkey project and on another integrated contract in the North Sea.  Moreover, digitalization and automation improved the resource efficiency of our own operations. In the second quarter, on an NOC project in Russia, we reduced rig site personnel by 40%. Separately, for an IOC in the Caspian, we captured cost efficiencies through using a remote operation center to monitor and control drilling jobs. Halliburton's differentiated drilling technologies penetrate the market and deliver results for our customers. Our multi-year investment in drilling technologies is paying off and we believe we are on the right path to outgrow the market as international drilling activity ramps up. Our drilling technologies deliver top quartile performance on discrete contracts and formed the core of our integrated project management offering.  This past quarter, on a challenging gas project on Russia's Yamal Peninsula, the Halliburton project management team drilled eight horizontal wells 36 days ahead of plan with zero HSE incidents. In close collaboration with our customer, we maximized drilling performance and accelerated the operator's production.  And lastly, we deployed digital solutions to optimize production. In the second quarter, we won a contract that highlights the enormous opportunity for digital adoption in the Middle East. After many years of collaboration with Halliburton on its digital transformation journey, Kuwait Oil Company expanded our automated production management contract in North Kuwait to all other assets in the country. KOC will use DecisionSpace 365, Halliburton's cloud-based subscription service for E&P applications to automate work processes and accurately plan, forecast and optimize production throughout KOC's portfolio. We're also expanding in new market segments. We expect to benefit from the significant growth potential of our specialty chemicals and artificial lift businesses, both in North America and internationally. As Halliburton increases participation in these new segments, we believe we will enjoy unique growth opportunities that are margin accretive and longer cycle.  I'm pleased to announce that, in the second quarter, Halliburton was awarded a seven-year production chemicals contract with a large IOC in Oman. Products for this new contract will be manufactured at Halliburton's new Saudi chemical reaction plant scheduled to open later this year. The strategic location of this plant will allow us to manufacture and sell specialty chemicals to other new customers throughout the region.  In North America, we recently expanded our footprint in the downstream process and water treatment chemicals business through awards of two separate five-year specialty chemicals contracts for large refiners on the Gulf Coast.  In our growing international artificial lift business, earlier this month, we completed the first installation of our ESP contract in Kuwait. We believe this contract gives us scale in the region that will allow us to profitably grow our artificial lift business in other key markets.  Finally, Halliburton has the broadest market exposure because we remain the only integrated service provider active in both North America and international markets. I believe this unique position allows us to capitalize on the double-digit growth, equipment tightness, and resulting better service pricing in both markets.  In the international markets, we expect that Halliburton's differentiated drilling equipment capacity tightens first. Over the next few quarters, as large tenders soak up capacity, I expect a return to the pre-pandemic environment when pricing improved in certain markets.  In North America, specific equipment categories are already tight today. There is a high demand for low emissions frac equipment and the supply is limited. Halliburton leads the market in low emission solutions today and that gives us a structural pricing advantage to further maximize value in North America.  Halliburton showcased our market-leading low emission solutions at a recent event in Duncan, Oklahoma. Over the course of five days, several hundred people from more than 40 operators came to see our electric and dual fuel equipment displays and operational demonstrations, including our 5,000 horsepower Zeus electric pumping unit, our new ExpressBlend blending system, eWinch electric wireline unit, the electric tech command center and an effective power generation solution. They didn't just see R&D plans and prototypes. Instead, they witnessed functional, job-ready equipment that works for our customers today and delivers unprecedented fracturing performance and reduced emissions. The Duncan event also showcased our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing system. SmartFleet marries our digital capabilities and fracturing expertise to do what was not possible until now \u2013 give customers control over fracturing performance in real time. It sets us apart from the rest of the hydraulic fracturing market and solidifies our industry leadership and intelligent fracturing. In the second quarter, we deployed it with two IOC customers in two different US basins with excellent results. Operators achieved more consistent fracturing placement on every stage with improved cluster uniformity and management of offset frac hits. SmartFleet, paired with our premium low emissions equipment, creates a powerful combination of Halliburton's leading technologies to deliver superior production results, reduced environmental impact, and drive a strong margin differential for Halliburton.  We believe that our unique value proposition, combined with customer urgency and equipment tightness in the US and international markets, will improve pricing for our differentiated equipment and services. As our equipment reaches sustained levels of higher utilization in North America, we are now moving from passing on inflationary cost increases to setting net pricing higher, and we expect this trend to accelerate into 2022.  Internationally, pricing will take longer to catch up to North America and will first manifest itself on discrete contracts in underserved markets. We expect large tenders to remain competitive, but our strategic priority is clear \u2013 deliver profitable growth as the recovery unfolds. We expect improved pricing, higher utilization, and our significant operating leverage will deliver strong incrementals for Halliburton in this upcycle.  In the face of both current and expected demand increases, we remain focused on improved returns and capital efficiency and expect our overall capital investment to stay in the range of 5% to 6% of revenue.  Now, let's step back for a minute and think about what this means for Halliburton. My remarks often focus on the practical view of the near term. But I also have conviction about Halliburton's performance in the early innings of this upcycle. Based on the market assumptions outlined earlier, we expect revenue to grow at a mid-teens compound annual growth rate over the next two years. We also expect operating margins to expand by about 400 basis points by 2023 and thus return to 2014 margin levels.  We are committed to driving significant free cash flow and returns for our shareholders as this multi-year upcycle unfolds. This earnings power results from the execution of Halliburton's strategic priorities. I am confident that our focus on technology differentiation, digital adoption, and capital efficiency positions us for profitable growth internationally and maximizing value in North America. Now, I will turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our second quarter financial results. Lance? Lance Loeffler : Thank you, Jeff. And good morning. Let me begin with a summary of our second quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2021. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.7 billion and operating income was $434 million, an increase of 7% and 17% respectively. Higher equipment utilization and our significant operating leverage supported these strong results as rig counts moved up globally in the second quarter.  Now, let me take a moment to discuss our division results in a little more detail. Starting with our Completion and Production division, revenue was $2 billion, an increase of 10%, while operating income was $317 million or an increase of 26%. These improvements were driven by higher activity across multiple product service lines in North America land, improved cementing activity in the Eastern Hemisphere and Latin America, increased completion tool sales in the Middle East, the North Sea and Latin America, as well as higher well intervention services in Saudi Arabia and Algeria. These improvements were partially offset by lower stimulation activity in Latin America. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $1.7 billion, an increase of 5%, while operating income was $175 million or an increase of 2%. These results were driven by improved drilling-related services and wireline activity across all regions, along with increased testing services in the Eastern Hemisphere. Partially offsetting these improvements were reduced software sales globally.  Moving on to our geographic results. In North America, revenue increased 12%, primarily driven by higher pressure pumping services, drilling related services and wireline activity in North America land, as well as higher well construction activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Partially offsetting these increases were reduced software sales across the region.  Turning to Latin America, revenue was flat sequentially, primarily driven by increased activity in multiple product service lines in Mexico, higher fluid services in Brazil, as well as additional completion tool sales in Guyana. These results were offset by lower stimulation activity in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil, decreased software sales across the region, and lower project management activity in Mexico and Ecuador.  In Europe, Africa, CIS, revenue increased 7%, resulting from increased activity across multiple product service lines in Russia, Norway, Algeria, and Ghana. These increases were partially offset by lower software sales across the region and lower activity in Nigeria. In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue increased 5%, resulting from improved activity in multiple product service lines in Saudi Arabia, improved well intervention services across the region, increased drilling-related services in Oman, higher completion tool sales in Kuwait, improved well construction activity in Australia and increased pipeline services in China. These improvements were offset by lower software sales across the region, reduced project management activity in India and lower overall activity in Bangladesh.  In the second quarter, our corporate and other expenses totaled $58 million. For the third quarter, we expect our corporate expense to remain largely unchanged.  Net interest expense for the quarter was $120 million and should remain flat for the third quarter. We remain focused on reducing our leverage in the near term, and recently announced the redemption of our remaining 2021 senior notes at par ahead of schedule in August using cash on hand, which should reduce interest expense beyond the third quarter.  Our effective tax rate for the second quarter came in better than expected at approximately 22%, benefiting from several one-time discrete items. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our third quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 25%.  Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $190 million and will continue to ramp up for the remainder of the year. However, we will stay within our full-year target of 5% to 6% of revenue. Turning to cash flow, we generated $409 million of cash from operations and $265 million of free cash flow during the second quarter. We believe that our year-to-date and expected earnings performance for the remainder of the year, combined with efficient working capital management, should result in a full-year free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion. The growth and earnings outlook that Jeff laid out positions us well to grow our free cash flow over the next couple of years.  Now, let me turn to our near-term outlook. In the international markets, we expect a steady increase in activity as the rig counts continued to recover. In North America, we anticipate modest pricing improvement and continued activity momentum in both completions and drilling, but sequential activity growth will be slower than in prior quarters. As a result, for our Completion and Production division, we anticipate high single-digit revenue growth sequentially, with margins expected to modestly increase by 25 basis points to 50 basis points.  In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate sequential revenue growth of 3% to 5% due to continued rig count increases globally and a margin increase similar to that of our C&P division.  I will now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff? Jeff Miller : Thanks, Lance. Before I wrap up our discussion today, I want to thank our employees for their terrific execution on our value proposition, dedication to Halliburton, and excellent service delivery for our customers.  Now, let me summarize what we believe and expect will unfold. We're in the early innings of a multi-year upcycle. As oil demand exceeds supply, the macro environment will be constructive for both international and US markets. Halliburton's unique value proposition, integrated service portfolio and differentiated technologies position us to outperform in this market. We have significant growth potential in new markets with our specialty chemicals and artificial lift businesses. Our technical differentiation allows us to disproportionately benefit from equipment capacity tightening across markets. Improved pricing, higher utilization, and our significant operating leverage will deliver strong incrementals for Halliburton in this upcycle.  We will continue to execute on our strategic priorities and remain committed to driving strong double-digit growth, margin expansion, significant free cash flow and returns for our shareholders as this multi-year upcycle unfolds.  And now, let's open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. James West : Thanks. Good morning, John. Jeff Miller : Good morning, James. Lance Loeffler : Good morning, James. James West : Jeff, you gave a great outline of what you see as this multi-year expansion for the business. And we certainly agree with what you're suggesting. How do your customers \u2013 when you're looking at the mosaic of all your different customers and all the different regions, are they aligned with kind of that view that it's time to get after it, we need to put some supply into the market and get going? Jeff Miller : Look, I think what we're looking at today is the macro. When we talk to our customers, particularly publics, they're going to do exactly what they've said they're going to do, and I think we see that playing out. But we also have a good view of the macro in terms of supply and demand. And I think, from that perspective, the planet will demand oil. Where does it come from? Clearly, we've got line of sight to improving activity internationally. I describe that primarily with NOCs. And yes, I think that it's not zeal, it\u2019s steady march to produce more barrels. And then I think that the call back on the U.S. is simply going to be that \u2013 that underinvestment that we've seen for a number of years internationally, it doesn't just spring back into action. And I think that's very positive for North America. So, from a customer perspective, obviously, the privates are much more opportunistic around the supportive oil price. So, we see quite a bit of activity and outlook from them. James West : Right, right. As then as we think about the returns on the assets that you are putting into the field, right now, we're probably at a sub-optimal type of return levels. So, you need prices to go up. And so, what are the levers? Or how quickly do you think pricing can move in this market to get back to what you need \u2013 would want to achieve to drive returns higher? Jeff Miller : Well, James, it's a process and it's probably multiple iterations. But I think we're seeing net pricing to a certain degree today in the U.S. slow going, but moving. And as we work through into 2022, I expect that continues to accelerate.  Internationally, I think it takes on the same type of dynamics that we saw in 2019, where markets, individual markets see tightness, see pricing, large tenders remain very competitive. And from our perspective, that worked well for Halliburton in 2019 and into the first quarter of 2020.  And we've been very clear, I think, about profitable growth. And so, I think it's key when I think about growth internationally, the key words there being profitable growth. And so that means that \u2013 and we see multiple years of growth in front of us. And for that reason, want to be deliberate about how we put equipment to work and make money. James West : Right. Right, got it. Thanks, Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you, James. Operator : Our next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is open. David Anderson : Hey, good morning, Jeff. Some clearly very bullish comments looking out over the next couple of years. I was wondering if you could talk about maybe some of the signs that you're seeing on the international side, particularly with the Middle East NOCs. Now, you've talked about increased completion tool sales, some artificial lift contracts and other tenders. Yesterday, Aramco suggests maybe shifting 6 billion more into upstream. I was just wondering when you start to see this inflect and when does it come through. We haven't yet seen the rig count pick up. Does 3Q guide indicate sort of a similar outpace of activity from second quarter? But at the same time, Middle East feels like it should be leading that double-digit growth \u2013 the double-digit guidance next year. I was wondering if you could just help me kind of understand that trajectory. Maybe it's obviously not a very opaque \u2013 or it's more of an opaque market. Just help us kind of see what you're seeing in that part of the world? Jeff Miller : Yes. I mean, what we see is, let's say, broadly, Middle East adding activity, adding it sort of as we speak, but more so focused towards next year. So, I think that we see \u2013 well, I think second half to second half, we're going to be up probably mid double digits for 2021 versus 2020. So, where does that come from? I think that alone is increasing and we see that sort of across the Middle East. But we also see it in Argentina, as an example. We see it in other parts of the market. And so, I think that gets traction and continues to get traction as we go further into 2022. But the activities \u2013 the demand signs are there now that we're seeing, and I think we see growth. But I think that continues to accelerate as we get into 2022 and 2023. But it doesn't necessarily overcome all the underinvestment. So, I think that there's work to be done to grow that business for operators to grow production, I think we see signs of growth now. But I think it'll be more pronounced in 2022. And we\u2019ve described 2021 as a transition year. So, we still see COVID slowdowns in markets. There's a number of rigs that aren't working because they're not staffed today, not by us, but just in general. And so, that type of disruption is weighing down on things a bit. But I fully expect this to work through that through the balance of 2021. David Anderson : Okay, that\u2019s good to hear. Kind of a different topic. I just wanted to ask about kind of some of the inflation that maybe you're seeing on the North American side, particularly maybe if it impacted your C&P margins at all this quarter. I know you're not really seeing any net - real net pricing right now. But I'm just kind of curious what the E&Ps are seeing in terms of inflation. Are we talking like 5% these days? And sort of around that same question, wondering about labor. If we do see this increase next year in E&P budgets and assuming completion crews are added over the next 12 months, the industry doesn't really seem ready for that labor-wise. I'm just kind of curious how that inflation could kind of start working its way through. And obviously, that could lead to net pricing at some point. But maybe just talk about some of those components that you're seeing on the North America side, please? Jeff Miller : Yes. I mean, I can speak to what we see in terms of inflation. And we saw inflation in many parts of our business, whether it's maintenance, in particular, cost, parts and people to do it. But we've also been able to pass that along. And in certain cases get \u2013 I think as we get through the second half of this year, we're seeing some net pricing now. And I think we'll see more of that more so as we go into 2022. But the ability to recover inflation is an important step also. In the range, is it 5% to 10%, 5%? It moves all around depending on the category. From a people perspective, we've been able to staff our equipment. We've got a very large footprint and have access to lots of people. And so, yeah, we have seen some attrition or turnover, but we've also been able to replace folks fairly efficiently. David Anderson : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Chase Mulvehill : I guess first thing, really appreciate you guys kind of giving some visibility over your outlook for the next couple of years on kind of top line and margins. And kind of looking back, if we were to go back to kind of pre kind of 2014 levels and basically look at the prior decade, you sustained 20% plus EBITDA margins for basically a decade and that even includes the 2009 downturn. And so, you've given us guidance that EBITDA margins will get comfortably above 20% over the next couple of years. So, I guess two questions. Number one, when do you think we will get back to that 20% EBITDA mark? Are you comfortable that it's first half of next year, second half of next year? And then, once we get there, how sustainable is 20% EBITDA margins? We haven't been above 20% since before 2014. But how sustainable do you think the 20% EBITDA margins will be over the next cycle? Jeff Miller : I think I've given you my outlook over the next couple of years. And so, over that period of time, we approach and then exceed those numbers that we got to in 2016. I think the most important part of this is the sustainability of that. And I feel like we see the strengthening macro and our unique competitive position in the marketplace very sustainable. I think we're back on to footing that we have to produce more, the things that we do to create value become more important. An example being the technology and our equipment in North America or our drilling technology, different elements of technology, whether it's digital or lift. But all of those things are what are so important in a market that requires more barrels, and that's what we see unfolding. And so, I think very sustainable. I've described it as the early innings. I think these are the early innings of at least a nine inning game to be played. And so, I really am convicted and excited about the outlook. Chase Mulvehill : A quick follow-up. You've given us this couple year outlook. Obviously, that's going to lead to some pretty strong free cash flow. You're paying down the 2021 notes here. So, what's the plan for excess free cash flow as we kind of get into 2022 and leverage ratios get to more comfortable levels? Is it a dividend bump? Special dividends, buybacks, M&A, or just maybe just build cash on the balance sheet? Lance Loeffler : You're right. In the near term, we're focused on trimming our debt levels. I think that that focus \u2013 good example of that focus is what we plan to do this month or early next, actually, with the $500 million maturity that we have coming due, paying it down with cash. Look, I think we're getting to a point where we're continuing to strive to cut our debt levels and get back to that 2 times debt to EBITDA leverage ratio that we've talked about before. But I think we are getting to a point where we intend to return more cash to shareholders, whether in the form of a dividend or share repurchase, not willing to commit to that at this point. But it's certainly something that we think is an and type scenario. So, we continue to trim our level of debt and improve the level of cash that we send back to shareholders. Operator : Next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Scott Gruber : I wanted to get some more color on the encouraging pricing trends here in North America. Is the net pricing that you're garnering, is that going to impact margins much in the second half? I ask because when you look at the 3Q guide, the embedded incrementals look to be kind of on the order of 20-ish-percent. And I would just think it'd be something greater than that if it's really having a big impact. Is there just a time lag here? Are there other offsets, maybe on equipment sales? Or do we just really need to see a little bit more activity growth to see pricing take a bigger leg higher into 2022? Jeff Miller : Yeah. As I said, it's not across the board. It is a process, but we are seeing net pricing in certain pockets and certain things today, and I expect that that accelerates, as I said, into 2022. But, clearly, with frac ESG friendly equipment that is in very short supply, we have a leading position in dual fuel electric, tier 4 also. And so, in all those categories, that's what the market demands and that's an \u2013 structurally, because of our large footprint there, we have a structurally differentiated position, but that equipment isn't everywhere and that equipment is some under contract, some is not under \u2013 it's moving. I think what's important at this point is that we're negotiating up and not down, and that's sort of a different dialogue than what we've had. And that's what we're seeing today. So, do you see all of that in Q3? Absolutely not. But what you do is you see us on a journey now that's different than the one that we've been on. And that's where we are. Scott Gruber : Turning to the digital contract wins, which are great to see, couple of questions there on the impact on margins. First, just so we can dimension it. Do the digital revenues and margin also flow through D&E? Or when you have Completion and Production [indiscernible], does some of it hit C&P? More importantly, how do we think about the real timing and magnitude of the benefit to margins? Is there much of a benefit during the second half through the initial deployment and scaling up in places like Kuwait? Or is it more to come in 2022 and 2023? Particularly for D&E, it's been a segment where you guys have been pushing to structurally lift margins over the last couple of years. How do the digital wins in the digitization of the industry and Halliburton's participation really push where the D&E margin could go on a more normalized basis as we get deep into recovery? Jeff Miller : When we think about digital, digital margin impact is across the business. Obviously, the software sales and the cloud native apps are in D&E. But more broadly, digital capability affects the whole business. And so, that's behind our [indiscernible] products, so tools like EarthStar and our SmartFleet, all of those are a byproduct of having digital capability in the company. In fact, the capacity to develop software at scale is pretty unique. And that is what allows that to happen. The third way we consume software, and this has an impact also on the entire business, is the ability to consume the solutions ourselves and reduce our own costs. So, I would argue a large part of our ability to, for example, last year, reduce the roofline by 50% was rooted in our ability to do things digitally that remove many steps and change the processes and took people out. That's why I'm careful how we describe that.  I think that, clearly, it's a contribution to D&E. But I would say that the contracts we've described are all good contracts, but you ramp up \u2013 it might ramp up, they get started. It's a consultative process. And so, I would expect later this year or really more so into 2022 and beyond. I think these build one on top of another and become very sustainable over time, less of a sort of pop all at once, but sort of building into larger projects over time. Operator : Our next question comes from Ian Macpherson with Piper Sandler. Ian Macpherson : The one question that I had, Jeff, is when you look at double-digit trajectory for synchronized expansion for North America and international, just given the strong command that OPEC+ has over the oil market over the intermediate term, what type of call on US production growth are Ae you contemplating which underpins your North American outlook for the next couple of years? Jeff Miller : We think that some of what we've seen over the last couple of days, I think, lays out a path for OPEC. And so, that's, to a certain degree, defined. If we look at pent up demand for oil at least today \u2013 if we look up the pent up demand that we see for oil today, we're at 98 million barrels a day now, the economy feels more than 2 million barrels shut in, to me. In fact, it's probably 4 million barrels consumed in aviation alone. So, I think there's a normalized level of spare capacity that's expected. So then when we think, okay, North America, what happens there? Well, we're up 10% year-on-year. And I think the expectation is that production is largely flat for this year. I would expect that there would be a call of \u2013 is it 500,000 barrels, some number like that? Some level of growth that would be called on in 2022. That, the price clearly supports, which would then drive more activity for us, certainly, and we have \u2013 in that mix is stemming the decline curve that is always working on North America production. So, those are the things that underpin our outlook. Ian Macpherson : And then, staying on the domestic pressure pumping side, we're obviously beginning to see some of the smaller competitors announce firm plans and sort of abstract plans for renewing their fleets with clean fleet, but different iterations of it. In your view, is that coming earlier than you would like to see it? Or do you think that the market is ready to support the pricing and the returns for that equipment at the scale that we've already seen over the last few months? And should we expect Halliburton within your 5% to 6% CapEx and below to march along at that same industry cadence with new clean fleet investment? Jeff Miller : Well, if we always look at our \u2013 we're fortunate today that we have one of the youngest fleets in the market. And as we replace equipment, we also have a large fleet. And so, as we systematically replace equipment, we have a choice to make. So, what type of equipment do we replace it with? And it's a combination, generally, of electric or dual fuel. But I think that our steady drumbeat of replacements and within our 5% to 6% of capital spend, we're able to meet demand and also at terms that are adequate. I think those two things have to be in place. Fortunately, we're in a position where we are able to deliver those things today. I say today, but today and over the near term from operations. Remains to be seen the pace at which all of that can happen in the market, given where sort of broadly that market stands today in terms of returns. So, without the returns, it's not \u2013 we wouldn't be investing in these types of equipment at all. Fortunately, we're in a position to do so and do it ratably along with our sort of planned replacement cycle. Operator : Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Congrats on a good quarter here. I have a really high level question. It's been a tough 10 years for the energy sector, but it's been an even tougher period of time for oil services relative to the rest of energy. Jeff, as a leader of this industry, what do you think the key is to attract the generalist investor back into this vertical within the space? Do you think it's about earnings execution? Is it about returns on capital? Or is it about returning excess capital to shareholders, so return of capital? Jeff Miller : It has to be all three of those. But I think it starts with some clarity around what is the trajectory over time that's sustainable as opposed to all of the ups and downs that we seem to have had sort of intra-period gyrations. And I think what's shaping up today, as I've described it, is a more sort of predictable, sustainable trajectory. And that's what we see out over the next couple of years and really beyond that, just because I think we've been through a lot of the over-capitalization. There's been under investment for a long enough period of time, particularly in the resource that, as demand recovers, which it will recover, I think there's a solid opportunity set for our services. Now, within that, obviously, I have a view that \u2013 and believe firmly that our competitive positioning is different also. And because of that, Halliburton has tools, whether it's our value proposition, our technology or sort of our portfolio and how it's placed to maximize value in North America, which we've always been clear on. We want to maximize value in North America and grow profitably internationally. And I think both those macros are set up perfectly for doing that. And so, as a generalist, there's some clarity around where we're going. We've got some track record of where we've been, where we're going. And I think that sets up well for a generalist investor. Neil Mehta : The follow-up on that on on return of capital, if you look at the energy sector, S&P energy sector, it trades at a 4.5% dividend yield. How do you think about Halliburton's value proposition on a multi-year basis around return of capital, whether it's through dividends or through buybacks? Do you ultimately need to be offering a total return of capital yield that's far in excess to the market, given the questions about the terminal value of the business? Lance Loeffler : Neil, I think it's a great question. And I think that we're going to continue to reevaluate what it means for us in the near term as we continue to grow into this recovery. We certainly believe that we need to improve those yields today on a dividend basis. But we're going to continue to look at and get comfortable with the forward free cash flow profile, what we think that this business, we believe, can generate in these out years that Jeff discussed. But, clearly, we believe it requires improvement from where we are today. Jeff Miller : Maybe one follow on to that, Neil. Strategically, we have changed the cash flow profile of our business, and that is the shift from 10%, 11% of revenues going into capital down to the 5% to 6%. But what that does is that sets Halliburton up to do those things. And so, I think it's our view and the change in our cash flow profile certainly aid that process. Operator : Our next question comes from Aaron JR [ph] with J.P. Morgan. Unidentified Participant : My first question relates to just the activity mix in the US. The privates have added more than 70% of the incremental rigs since the activity bottomed mid last year. I guess my first question is, what is your expectation around, call it, the mix of public company activity next year once some of the OPEC barrels are returned? And do you think that a higher mix of public company activity is \u2013 are you indifferent about that? Or do you think it's helpful to your revenue growth and margin opportunities relative to industry next year? Jeff Miller : I think we will always look for the best return opportunity for us. I'd say operators have not said anything about next year, and I'm not going to project what they might say. I think I have \u2013 we can see what the demand sort of looks like to us as we look out into next year. But I also think that every operator will make their own decisions around how they deploy their capital. And overall, a supportive commodity price, which we see creates headroom for our clients to do work and return cash to their shareholders, which is important for them to do. So, I think the improving commodity price and the structural sort of support that we will see in the commodity price makes all of that work as we go into 2022. Neil Mehta : Just my follow-up. We had a dynamic, particularly in the US, where budget exhaustion has led to some frac holidays which has obviously been a headwind. How is Halliburton looking to mitigate that risk as we approach the back half and the fourth quarter kind of given that dynamic? Jeff Miller : I think operators are going to do exactly what they said they would do. And we really haven't seen budget exhaustion, to this point haven't talked about it. And I think that is because operators are ratably doing exactly what they said they were going to do. So, I don't anticipate that we see any of that or much of that this year. And I'd say the other thing that we've done a lot of work to variabilize our business, such that when we see slowdowns or holds or anything else, we're able to respond to it very, very quickly as opposed to how we might have done it in the past. And that all is process change and really philosophy change, but it's working quite well. I think we'll have a solid sort of working through the balance of the year just because of the clarity that our clients have and are providing to us. Operator : Our next question comes from Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Connor Lynagh : I wanted to return to the multi-year outlook you guys gave. And basically, what I'm wondering is, certainly, I know you want to stick to the ranges you put out there for capital expenditures, but I would assume there's a certain degree of growth investment required to realize that. So, I was wondering if you could discuss just where you plan on allocating capital, what some of the big areas that you think are sort of priorities within the business over the next couple years here? Jeff Miller : I think that as we look out, I believe that we've got the opportunity to meet those expectations within the guidance that we've provided with respect to CapEx. I think there is growth CapEx in that sort of 5% to 6% range that we've provided. For example, if I look back over the last five years, asset turns have improved by 50%. That's strong improvement. But this is back to my commentary around strategically approaching capital efficiency. So, as we're very sharp around our R&D dollars, drive capital efficiency, our process drives capital efficiency, and those are the kind of results we see in terms of capital efficiency. And so, we will continue to drive that as the market expands over the next couple of years. And really, strategically, that becomes our operating process. And I expect we'll continue to do that. Connor Lynagh : Sort of similar question here. But just in terms of thinking about \u2013 particularly your labor pool, and I guess, your overhead in international markets, so certainly, you've right-sized in select areas, but you're anticipating a pretty big recovery here. I guess I'm just curious, it seems like in the outlook there's an acceleration in incremental margins as you get out into some of the later years. Is that because you have sort of excess labor that's going to be more highly utilized, is that because of the pricing that you're anticipating. Just curious what the what the big drivers are of that improvement in incremental margins? Lance Loeffler : Look, Connor, I think it's less about cost savings structurally. I think it's more about volume of activity combined with price. So, it's volume, utilization and pricing improvement throughout the course of that journey that Jeff sort of outlined. Jeff Miller : We're always working on costs. We've got a continuous improvement program where we're constantly driving, managing costs down. And I believe that that program and our approach to that is adequate. As we grow, we will manage the cost. But clearly, we expect to see tightness in pricing and more activity over time that all drives incrementals. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks. Jeff Miller : Before we end the call, let me close with this. We are in the early innings of an unfolding multi-year upcycle that presents growth opportunities for Halliburton internationally and in North America. Those opportunities match Halliburton's unique customer-focused value proposition and our position as the only fully integrated energy services company in both international and North American markets. As this unfolds, we remain committed to driving returns and free cash flow for Halliburton shareholders. I'm optimistic about what lies ahead and look forward to speaking with you next quarter.  Shannon, please close out the call. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you David and good morning everyone. Last quarter, we discussed a longer view of a recovering market and our confidence in a multiyear up-cycle. I am pleased with the steady march of activity and Halliburton 's performance in the third quarter internationally and in North America, all reinforce our enthusiasm today, and for what we expect in 2022 and beyond. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of both our strategy and our execution as the market recovery accelerates. Here are some highlights. Total Company revenue increased 4% sequentially with top-line improvements across all regions. While adjusted operating income grew 6% with solid margin performance in both divisions. Our Completion and Production division revenue grew 4%, driven by increased global activity. Operating margin was essentially flat in the third quarter, as we made operational choices to prepare for higher demand for our services in 2022. Our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue grew 4% with increased activity across multiple regions.  Operating margin of 11% was about flat sequentially. North America revenue increased 3% as growth in U.S. land was partially offset by a decline in our Gulf of Mexico business due to Hurricane Ida. International revenue grew 5% sequentially in line with the international rig count growth. Our year-to-date free cash flow generation of almost $900 million puts us solidly on track to deliver our full-year free cash flow objective.  Finally, we retired $500 million of our long-term debt and ended the quarter with 2.6 billion of cash on hand. As this upcycle unfolds in both the International and North America markets, Halliburton is executing on our strategy to deliver profitable growth and generate industry-leading returns.  In the international markets, third quarter activity momentum continued, and I believe it will accelerate into year end and support mid-teen second half revenue growth compared to the second half of last year. This expected outcome is better than we anticipated a quarter ago. In the third quarter, we started long-term projects across all regions in spite of the COVID-19 interruptions.  While mobility restrictions and daily precautions remain in place, business activity around the world has adjusted and continues to improve. In the Middle East, countries relaxed border restrictions and Opec (ph) members prepared for activity increases. We started to work on several rigs offshore UAE, mobilized a work-over project in Bahrain, and completed multiple ESP installations on our Artificial Lift contract in Kuwait. We expect the Middle East to exit the year with solid activity momentum. In Asia-Pacific, we launched operations on an integrated project offshore Malaysia with full implementation of Halliburton's Digital Well construction capabilities. We also ramped up for an increase in our Indonesia drilling operations where the local NOC plans to boost production from its assets. In Europe, Africa, CIS region.  The start of operations on a 23 well offshore integrated development campaign for Woodside in Senegal marked a new country entry for Halliburton. In Russia, we're mobilizing for a multiyear IOC operated project on Sakhalin Island. In the UK sector of the North Sea, work continues on several new development drilling, and workover projects for local independent operators. Finally, Latin America delivered its best quarterly performance since 2015.  We spotted the first well on a three-year integrated project in Brazil, deployed our new drilling technologies on multiple wells in Argentina and prepared to mobilize for new work in Ecuador and Columbia. In addition to contract startups, our pipeline of new tenders continues to grow. While large Middle East tenders and Latin America projects received most of the headlines, customers in Africa, Russia and Southeast Asia, among others, are also issuing tenders for new work. All of this points to increasing international customer urgency and demand for our services. Let me describe what I'm seeing that gives me this conviction. Global supply and demand balance continues to tighten, resulting in a strong commodity price environment. In response, asset owners are eager to reverse baseline production declines caused by multiple years of under investment. We expect that NOCs and other operators with short cycle production opportunities will commit additional capital and gain share to meet future oil demand. Additionally, new fields are smaller and more complex. More customers work harder to produce more barrels. Finally, as mature assets change hands, new owners move quickly to revitalize the assets they acquire and unlock remaining reserves.  They require service partners who can deliver proven technology and decades of experience. All of these things have one thing in common. They require higher service intensity, more dollars spent on the wellbore rather than on infrastructure. As the international recovery accelerates, we remain committed to a clear strategic priority. deliver profitable growth, and we have unique competitive advantages to deliver on this priority.  We have the established footprint, geographic presence, and customer and supplier relationships to capitalize on growth. We have a strong presence in all major international markets. The substantial majority of our workforce is local and within the regions where we operate, our supply chain spend is primarily with local suppliers. We have proven capabilities to ramp up our services as customers enter new markets. We demonstrated this in Guyana, Suriname, and most recently, in Senegal.  The Halliburton team mobilized personnel and built a multi-functional operational base to support Woodside as we embark together on a development campaign offshore Senegal. We also engineer innovative solutions, both digital and hardware to meet the complex reservoir challenges faced by our international customers.  For example, in well construction, this quarter we introduced the iStar comprehensive measurement platform. This next-generation intelligent platform provides multiple logging and drilling measurements that enabled reservoir evaluation, faster drilling, and consistent well delivery. For multiple customers in the Middle East and North Sea, the iStar platform provides insight into the impact of drilling parameters on well work conditions, and optimizes the drilling process in real-time. In completions, we're the global leader in downhole completion solutions. As our customers increase their activity, our e-completions ecosystem integrates manufacturing digital twins and technology development processes to increase our speed to market for these long lead complex systems.  In many regions, as customers drive for better performance in the face of increasing operational challenges, I expect adoption of integrated and bundled contracts will continue to grow. Halliburton has strong project management capabilities, and they've proven track record that deliver efficiencies and reduce total customer cost of ownership. Our digital innovations reframe customer project economics through greater efficiencies and improved decision-making.  For example, in the third quarter, we deployed our well construction 4.0 digital solution to deliver further operational efficiencies for our customer in the Middle East. Finally, our customers call on us for collaboration from an IOC, looking to reduce emissions on its operations in Mexico, to a European independent working to remotely monitor and control all of its global drilling operations.  Halliburton 's value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers is working for both our customers and Halliburton. Now, turning to North America, the bifurcation between public and private Company activity continued in the third quarter.  Public E&Ps remain committed to their spending plans for 2021 while private operators continue to take advantage of a strong commodity price environment. As expected, completions growth moderated in the third quarter as operator's shifted their focus from completions to drilling activity. Just like in the international markets, customer urgency and demand for our services keep growing in North America.  Drilled but uncompleted well counts reached the lowest levels since 2013 as operators depleted the surplus of ducks accumulated in 2020, we expect customers to drill and complete more new wells to offset steep base decline rates and deliver production into an anticipated attractive market next year, Completions equipment availability is tightening.  Customers have responded by starting the 2022 tender process earlier in an attempt to lock in access to quality services for next year's programs. Private companies now operate about 60% of the U.S. land rig count. And current commodity prices provide a strong incentive for their activity to expand. Our market-leading position in North America is rooted in the groundbreaking technologies we put to work in this market.  We are the only fully integrated service provider in North America, and this gives us a unique competitive advantage. We combine the full breadth of our technology disciplines, geo -sciences, physics, chemistry, material science, and mechanical, electrical and software engineering to deliver innovative solutions at scale around the world, and uniquely in North America, to maximize production and minimize costs, Our smart fleet intelligent fracturing services transitioned from pilot to campaign mode. Several large operators today have smart fleet working on multi-pad completion programs. Smart fleet for the first time allows operators to measure treatment placement in real time, which among other things, has demonstrated up to 30% improvement in cluster uniformity. In the third quarter, we introduced the IsoBond Cement System and pumped it for multiple customers in the DJ Basin and in the Marcellus shale. By removing liquid additives, this dry-blended cement provides significant operational efficiencies and lower capital requirements for land operations. Taking advantage of the increasing demand for our services require strategic execution on many fronts, particularly in the current environment of stressed supply chains, tight labor, and inflationary pressures. Against that reality, I believe that Halliburton is best prepared to provide reliable execution for our customers. Our sophisticated supply chain organization translates Halliburton size and scale into real savings for us and our customers.  We are seeing that in action as our supply chain delivers what our customers require for their projects. The labor market is tight today. We've seen the situation before, and our human resources team knows how to navigate it. Over the last few years, we compressed our onboarding time, strengthened our national recruiting network, and used digital solutions to significantly reduce our field personnel requirements. Despite real challenges, we have the scale, speed, and systems to recruit talent nationally and quickly deploy it for our customers. In logistics, we have ready access to a fleet of drivers to make deliveries to the job site. We expanded our collaboration with Vorto, an artificial intelligence supply chain platform. Our early adoption of Vorto's platform that connects drivers, asset owners, and maintenance yards allows us to effectively manage trucking inflation, and availability constraints.  Now let me spend a few minutes on our activity and pricing outlook for 2022, first in the international markets and then in North America. Next year, we expect international activity momentum to accelerate, and international leading edge pricing to move upward in pockets as a result of higher activity. This is what we're seeing today.  Large tenders remain competitive, but we're already seeing modest price increases on discrete work in underserved markets. We see increasing customer demand for Halliburton's high-end technology and the recognition of its value. Finally, as a result of lower spending by service companies for more than half a decade, international market face tightening equipment supply. To meet these demands, we are strategically reallocating assets to drive, improve utilization and returns. Let me be clear. Halliburton prioritizes profitable growth internationally and this will drive our capital allocation decisions to the best returning product lines, geographies, and contracts.  In North America, we expect customer spending to increase in and around 20% next year, including solid net pricing gains. Many factors drive that spending and pricing, including customer urgency, equipment tightness, handed desire to align with a reliable and differentiated service provider like Halliburton. Last quarter, we highlighted the pricing traction that exists for low emission equipment.  Today, as we tender for 2022 work, we're seeing price increases for the rest of our fracturing fleet as well. Net pricing has also increased across different non - frac product service lines, drilling, cementing, drill bits, and artificial lift. To generate the highest returns as this market grows, we are taking steps to maximize the value of our North America business.  Specifically, we are repositioning our fracturing fleets to customers in areas where we can maximize returns in 2022, securing longer-term, premium pricing contracts for our existing and planned electric fleets, and accelerating fleet maintenance and deployment of the next-generation fluid in technology, which extends the life of our equipment. Halliburton has committed to North America and I expect we will benefit more than others as activity and pricing momentum accelerates across the board. Next, let me turn to how we are executing on our strategic priority to advance a sustainable energy future. As we are witnessing now and saw in the third quarter, the worlds requires a greater supply of oil and gas. As an oilfield services Company, we have the core competency to help our customers to deliver this supply in the most efficient and technologically advanced ways possible.  With our customers, we are bringing our technical expertise and over a century of industry experience to actively participate in the transition to a cleaner economy. One of the most meaningful contributions we can make today to this transition is to help our customers reduce emissions from their existing production base.  Emissions reduction is a critical part of our technology development process, and our innovative low-carbon solutions are helping oil and gas operators reduce their carbon footprint. Halliburton 's electric fracturing solution delivers results now for our customers. In the third quarter, Halliburton completed an all electric pad operation on a multiyear contract with Chesapeake Energy in the Marcellus shale.  We deployed our electric fracturing spread with electric blending, wireline, and ancillary equipment, and an advanced power-generation system from VoltaGrid. This high-performing solution reduced Chesapeake's emission using over 25 megawatts of lower-carbon power generation from Chesapeake's local field gas. We are collaborating with an IOC in Mexico on their total carbon footprint reduction.  Because we provide both well construction services and logistic services on this contract, we changed supply boat fueling mechanisms and optimized usage to achieve emissions reductions in the first year of operations. We are now using a similar contract structure to collaborate with this IOC on its other projects in Latin America.  We're also advancing renewable energy solutions through Halliburton Labs, our clean energy accelerator. In the third quarter, we doubled our size by increasing the number of Halliburton Labs companies from 4 to 8. Welcoming Alumina Energy from California, Ionada from Ontario, and Parasanti and SurgePower Materials from Texas. We help these companies scale their exciting technologies, from innovative energy storage solutions to modular carbon capture systems. In September, Halliburton Labs hosted its third finalist pitch day, featuring 9 early-stage companies, and an audience of several hundred entrepreneurs, investors, academics, and other professionals, looking to engage with companies that advance cleaner, affordable energy.  The Halliburton Labs participants are achieving results, and Roxol Bioenergy completed a $10 million series 8 round of financing, and Roxol 's patented modular system uses locally sourced organic or plastic waste to generate clean on-site energy, even in the most remote and inaccessible location. Other accelerator participants achieved important scaling milestones in the third quarter. With both current and expected demand increases, Halliburton remains committed to the priorities we set in 2020. We prioritize profitable growth and returns, remain focused on capital efficiency at are keeping our overall capital investment in the range of 5% to 6% of revenue.  I'm excited about the multiyear up-cycle we see in front of us. I believe our value proposition, technology differentiation, digital adoption, and capital efficiency will allow us to deliver profitable growth internationally and maximize value in North America. Halliburton will continue to execute our key strategic priorities to deliver industry-leading returns and strong free cash flow for our shareholders. Now, I'll turn the call over to Lance (ph) to provide more details on our third quarter financial results (ph). Lance. Lance Loeffler : Thank you, Jeff. And good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a summary of our third quarter results compared to the second quarter of 2021. Total Company revenue for the quarter was $3.9 billion and adjusted operating income was $458 million, an increase of 4% and 6% respectively.  During the third quarter, Halliburton closed the structured transaction for our North America real estate assets that I described earlier this year, which resulted in a $74 million gain. We also discontinued the proposed sale of our pipeline and process services business, leading to a depreciation catch-up related to these assets previously classified as assets held for sale. As a result, among these and other items, we recognize a $12 million pretax charge. Now, let me take a moment to discuss our division results in more detail. Starting with our completion in production division, revenue was $2.1 billion, an increase of 4% while operating income was $322 million or an increase of 2%. These results were driven by increased activity across multiple product service lines in the western hemisphere, higher cementing activity in the Middle East Asia region, as well as increased well intervention services in the Europe, Africa, CIS region.  These improvements were partially offset by reduced completion tool sales in the eastern hemisphere, lower stimulation activity in the Middle East / Asia region, and accelerated maintenance expenses for our stimulation business in North America, which related to upgrading our fluid and technology in preparation for the anticipated market acceleration that Jeff described earlier.  In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $1.7 billion, or an increase of 4%, while operating income was $186 million, or an increase of 6%. These results were due to improved drilling-related services internationally and in North America land, additional testing services and wireline activity across Latin America, along with increased project management activity in Mexico and Ecuador. Partially off-setting these increases were reduced drilling-related services in Norway and the Gulf of Mexico.  Moving on to our geographic results. In North America, revenue increased 3%. This increase was driven primarily by higher well construction, artificial lift, and wireline activity in North America land, increased completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico, and additional stimulation and drilling activity in Canada. Partially offsetting these increases were reduced drilling-related, wireline, and stimulation activity in the Gulf of Mexico as a result of the impact from Hurricane Ida. Turning to Latin America, revenue increased 17% sequentially. This improvement was driven by increased activity in multiple product service lines in Argentina, Mexico, and Brazil, as well as higher well construction services in Columbia, and improved project management activity in Ecuador. These increases were partially offset by reduced fluid services in the Caribbean. In Europe, Africa, CIS, revenue was essentially flat sequentially. These results were driven by higher well intervention services across the region, increased well construction services and completion tool sales in Nigeria, additional pipeline and fluid services in Russia, and increased activity across multiple product service lines in Senegal.  These improvements were offset by decreased activity across multiple product service lines in the North Sea and Algeria and lower completion tool sales in Angola. In the Middle East Asia region, revenue increased 2% resulting from improved well construction activity in the Middle East and Australia.  These improvements were partially offset by lower completion tool sales across the region, along with reduced wireline and stimulation activity in Saudi Arabia, lower projects. Management activity in India, and lower stimulation activity in Malaysia. In the Third Quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $50 million For the fourth quarter, we expect our corporate expense to moderately increase.  Net interest expense for the quarter was a $116 million. In the third quarter, we retired $500 million of 2021 senior notes using cash on hand, as a result, our net interest expense in the fourth quarter should decline modestly. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter came in at approximately 24%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our fourth quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 22%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately a $190 million. In response to higher demand for our services in both international and North America markets, we are pulling forward spending on long lead time items for our premium equipment, and now expect our full-year capital expenditures to be closer to $800 million for the full year.  Turning to cash flow, we generated approximately $620 million of cash from operations and almost $470 million of free cash flow during the third quarter. I am very pleased with our working capital performance this quarter as we delivered net cash proceeds from working capital despite our revenue growth.  Now let me describe our near-term outlook. In North America, we expect moderate pricing and activity improvements in drilling and completions to drive sequential growth. In the international markets, we expect continued improvement in rig counts, the pace of which will vary across regions. As a result, for our Completion and Production division, we anticipate mid single-digit revenue growth sequentially, with operating margins expected to expand by approximately 50 basis points.  The higher year-end completion tool sales will be partially offset by seasonal North America land activity impacted by the holidays and lower efficiency levels typically experienced in the winter months. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate sequential revenue growth of 5% to 7%, and a margin increase of a 150 to 200 basis points, due to seasonal software sales and higher overall global activity. I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thanks, Lance. To summarize our discussion today. Halliburton is on track to deliver strong results and our financial commitments for this year. We see customer urgency and demand for our services increasing internationally and in North America. We expect to benefit from the accelerating recovery and deliver profitable growth in the international markets and maximize value in North America.  We prioritize our investments to the highest returns opportunities and are committed to capital efficiency. As our forward outlook unfolds, we expect to deliver strong free cash flow and industry leading returns for our shareholders. And now, let's open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. James West : Hey. Good morning, guys. Jeff Miller : Morning, James Lance Loeffler : Morning, James. James West : Just -- clearly, a very bullish global outlook of North America and International. It seems though that International really stepped up even further than you thought, maybe initially in the last 3 months since the last conference call. Could you perhaps describe where the -- these pleasant surprises are coming from? Jeff Miller : Well, thanks, James. Look, I think broadly if I look out at the improvements, it's really a function of the tightening macro, and what we see and so. I think supply is clearly short. I mean, this underspending that's been happening for really 7 years is starting to have an effect on the supply side, and that drives clearly urgency, but it's harder to do.  And then along with that, we've got short supply service assets, and that is also driving great environment for us and Halliburton's in the right places. And so when I think about profitable growth internationally and also maximizing value in North America, that's right in the fairway of where we want to be.  And so this beginning of an up-cycle, I think what we'll see are our operators work very hard to improve production, but it's short-cycle style barrels are just going to take a lot more work around the wellbore. And all very good. And it's really, as I said, beginning of what I see as a very strong up-cycle for our services. James West : Sure. No doubt about that and we certainly agree. One follow-up from me, North America, the 20% number that you put out there, which is actually the same number that we're using, but how much of that increase is activity versus pricing in the inflationary environment that we're now seeing in North America? Meaning, is activity in that scenario up 10%, 12%, is up 15%. How are you thinking about activity levels versus the overall spend level? Jeff Miller : Look, I think -- clearly it's a combination of both. I think that we will see certainly inflation, I'm not going to give you a number today, but I think that we're seeing strengthening pricing -- strengthening pricing into 2022 so I think that'll be a part of it. In fact to our strategy of maximizing value in North America, I think that we're going to be really sharp around where we work and how we generate those returns.  So I -- is it -- I would -- I think that pricing will move up more. And I think there will be a lot of effort put into the activity but the combination of equipment shortages that drive prices are going to probably be a headwind to a degree on activity as we get into the year, biased more to price than activity probably. James West : Okay. Got it. Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Neil Mehta : Good morning team. I want to go back to the comments last quarter, the 400 basis points of margin improvement by 2023. Given we're in a firmer oil macro environment and the activity pick-up that you anticipate. Do you see potential for that actually get pulled forward. And how are we tracking relative to the 400 basis points of their upside or downside, as you tested out real-time. Jeff Miller : So thanks, Neil. But look, I'm really excited about the outlook and the possibility to pull that forward. Certainly, that's a possibility. I think that we're on track. I mean, everything that I see indicates that's well on our viewfinder in terms of getting to the '23 outlook that I had.  The pace at which oil -- oil demand comes back, which I would say is surprising a little bit to the upside in spite of what's out there with respect to COVID, certainly encouraging, certainly highlights what we've been seeing for some time, which is how important oil is, and more importantly, the impact that not spending normal rates for quite a long time has on the supply of oil. Of course, operators are going to work really hard to accelerate that, which is fantastic for Halliburton. So I'm very encouraged about the outlook and the Pacing. Neil Mehta : Alright Jeff. And then the follow-up is just return of capital, that $500 million of debt this quarter next year is set up to be a good free cash flow year, how do you think about getting the dividend or capital returns profile to be more competitive relative to the rest of energy Lance Loeffler : Yes, Neil, this is Lance. Look, we certainly -- no doubt, we see an environment that provides us with a lot more flexibility as we look towards 2022. And I would just say this year, 2021, we've had a strategy and we're continuing to execute that. It starts with EBITDA growth, Capex control, and a focus on deleveraging throughout the course of the year. The dividend raise is certainly in the viewfinder as our outlook plays out. We're still going to continue to be focusing on deleveraging our business and to a certain extent accelerating it when it makes economic sense. So there's still work to do there, but I think the message is that we've got a great opportunity to address all of these things as we move into next year. Neil Mehta : Thanks, Lance. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is open. David Anderson : Hi. Good morning, Jeff. So the question on everyone's mind right now is net pricing in the U.S. and whether or not you're getting that now. I was wondering if you could just confirm you have in fact recently put through a pricing increase in U.S. pumping business. And addition, if you could address the topic of labor inflation and how much is that offsetting pricing and what could that mean if the industry looks to add, say, 20 or so fleets on the coming quarters. Our E&P seem to think pricing is going to stay flat outside of inflation, so I'm just kind of curious where you think that disconnect could be. Jeff Miller : I think the disconnect will be around supply of equipment and also the type of equipment, there's a lot of demand out there. I'll talk about pricing may be first. We're seeing it now, it looks a little different than maybe in prior cycles in the sense that it's more of a process than it is a point in time, but yes, making a lot of progress around that.  We've talked about premium equipment and clearly that's -- a lot of demand for that and it's in short supply and likely stays that way. And so that's certainly positive. Our outlook is that we're going to, certainly, getting that pricing -- getting some net pricing now, and we expect to continue that, particularly as equipment tightens. It starts with the premium equipment, but my view is that we will see that across the entire fleet as we go into 2022.  And so with respect to inflation, yes, seeing that, I think that's been passed along fairly straightforward manner, but that's not the pricing that actually we're looking forward to and seeing some of now. From a labor perspective and, if you described 20 more fleets into 2022, your 40 to 85% utilization today, that takes us what, like close to 100. That drives a lot of pricing activity around equipment, and the labor, I think, it will exacerbate that.  We were very fortunate at Halliburton that we're able to manage the labor, other elements of transportation, I think, more effectively than the market. I described some of that in my comments. But I think that will continue to get tight and I like the way we're differentially positioned around those things also. David Anderson : Clearly, labor is an issue everywhere and I'd have to think of the oil field especially acutely. A separate question. You touched on this a little bit, but I'm really wondering what the inventory of kind of both directional drilling and completion tools globally. Now, you're spending only about 5% of revenue on Capex.  It's less than half the rate of just a few years ago. Your competitors have also been very capital disciplined. Obviously, not just the E&Ps were capital disciplined, but you guys have been as well. But now on this cost of this global recovery in activity, as you said, multi your up-cycle unfolding. And we're also seeing the supply chain issues across the industry. I guess my question is, if there's going to be the shortage of type of specialized equipment next year and where do you see it most acute? You talked about reallocating equipment, but I feel like we've done this already a couple of times, and I know you've been moving it around, but it feels like we're kind of coming into this inflection on a lot of this equipment out there, and I'm just kind of curious of your views on that. Jeff Miller : Well, we likely are and we are -- it's getting tight, it's tighter, and we're going to reallocate equipment to the highest return opportunities. And I think we're just going to see some tightness, which is a healthy thing, which is going to drive better asset allocation to projects. We're -- we see capital velocity as a strategic plank for us that we're very focused on and we think that's the key to driving profitable growth. And I say it that way because there will be many opportunities, our focus is on the profitable slice of that. And things that we're seeing set up as it gets more active internationally. Short-cycle barrels clearly will use equipment, but as we see, some element of offshore activity creep into that, that soaks up more capacity.  And so I expect we'll see quite a bit of tightness which is very, very positive for Halliburton and our outlook. I mean, I don't -- I think that the returns haven't been there, and we expect to see solid returns, and growth in returns, and free cash flow, and a tight market is what makes that happen. David Anderson : Looking forward to them. Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Your line is open. Chase Mulvehill : Good morning, everyone. So I just wanted to -- Jeff Miller : Good morning Chase. Chase Mulvehill : Good morning. I just want to follow up on the commentary around the North America Capex being up 20%, obviously U.S. onshore will be up a little bit more. But I just want to connect the dots there and just try to understand how you're getting to the 20%. Because if you just look at operating cash flow of E and Ps, those could be up 30 to 40% year-over-year. So that would imply that they would spend less of operating cash flow [Indiscernible] today, they're spending about 50% of operating cash flow.  And if you just look at consensus for public E&Ps, we're talking high teens already for growth. So that implies a more modest pace of growth for the private E&P s. So I just I want to kind of understand the 20% [Indiscernible] that you put out there for North America. Jeff Miller : Thanks, Chase. Look, 20% is a good starting point. Obviously, could it be more? It could be certainly and I think the more activity there is, the more price there will be and so kind of take those in tandem. When we look at 2022, clearly there's a call on U.S. production at the kind of commodity prices that we see today, and particularly given the supply shortage.  So we have always expected that we would see North America move first and strongest as we got into the real heavy lift around short supply. That said though, I do believe that it is moderated to a degree because there are formulas in place around how reinvestment -- around reinvestment rates, around dividend requirements, around compensation schemes.  So all of that's in place which serves to certainly moderate activity for the public. And I suspect we'll -- those budgets aren't out, but I certainly expect that we'll see those. The privates clearly are very active. An evidence to me that we see sort of that strengthening, is we're finding more work.  The reality is -- was we readjust pricing and look at the market that requires moving around to different operators at different times. And we're doing some of that now. But the old adage, you don't quit a job till you have a job. And we're finding jobs. All of that is positive, but I think that there will be tightness around equipment in that environment. I don't -- we're in and around 20 is just sort of a current outlook on 22. I don't mean that to be prescriptive. Could it be more clearly, it could be more. But I also think it will be very tight. Chase Mulvehill : Thanks. Great. Can I follow-up on the frac maintenance expense. I mean, you noted -- in the press release you talked about it during the earnings call. I don't know if you would offer up how material it was, is it -- does it recur again in 4Q and so maybe that's impacting margins on the CMP side a little bit.  And also maybe, is -- should we think about this is as an indication that you think you're going to be able to get the pricing you need in 2022 to really kind of drive more activity on the frac side. Jeff Miller : Yeah. Look at the -- the maintenance was maybe a penny. But clarity around where that equipment will go. I mean, that's an indicator that we have certainty around where that equipment will go to work and the kind of things we're doing are like the, the [Indiscernible] end are things that drive better margins for us and a longer life over the life of that so it's just wise to do, I think more important is that we've got real clarity around where that equipment goes and 22 and we want to make certain that we're ready and it goes to work at prices that clearly eclipse any cost of maintenance on the equipment.  It's just the thing that we want to do. Q4, we've given you our guidance and all that's in that guidance. So look, I take it as a real positive that we've got the clarity that we have, and just the concrete evidence of where this equipment will go. And we just want to make certain that we're taking care of everything in real-time. Chase Mulvehill : Right. Perfect. I'll turn it back over. Thanks, Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is open. Scott Gruber : Guys, good morning. Jeff Miller : Hey, Scott. Lance Loeffler : Morning, Scott. Scott Gruber : I just want to come back to the domestic inflation question again. Are there any numbers you could put on the delta in your inflation versus the market inflation just given your advantages. And now that you're securing, what I assume is market-based price increases, kind of what that combination could be.  The framework is -- if the market pricing is up 15%, but peers are seeing like 10% inflation only getting net 5. But -- there is a meaningful gap for Halliburton, maybe you're net inflation or your net pricing gains are 10% because you aren't experiencing half of the inflation.  So if you could tell us what that inflation gap could be and obviously I just made those figures up, so [Indiscernible] any color on the potential net pricing gains for Halliburton vis -a - vis the competition would be great. Jeff Miller : Yeah. Look, guys, it's very competitive information. I'd say we out perform ed the numbers you laid out. But maybe I'll just walk through the components of how we manage these things. It's very -- we have very sophisticated supply chain organization and they are working overtime, but absolutely getting it done.  Price fairly passed on to customers. The labor [Indiscernible] the ability to recruit nationally in the US, and the ability to have a strong local workforce internationally, both are key elements of managing inflation for Halliburton. From our raw materials perspective. Again, supply chain buys from the entire world, we manage logistics, and we actually see that improving in terms of tightness as we go into 2022.  Particularly we're seeing sort of space on airplanes. As the world opens up and we see more carriers sort of get back to work, we actually believe the international logistics around raw material gets better. And then in North America, our relationship with Vorto is having quite an impact. I mean, we are able to add drivers. We were able to retain drivers, it's been quite disruptive but very effective.  And so look, I'm confident that we outperform in terms of managing inflation for Halliburton, but that's a separate topic from where we see pricing going in 2022 and many cases now. Scott Gruber : Just a quick one on international Jeff, you mentioned an acceleration in international activity next year. Any early read on where that figure could go. Are you thinking potentially mid [Indiscernible], high - [Indiscernible]. We've seen 20% growth in past years during strong up cycles. Just any early read on where international activity growth could ascend to next year? Jeff Miller : Yeah. Look, the entire international market is a huge market, and so to move all of that at a high rate is probably more difficult to do, particularly given where the supply chain actually in project backlog is for clients. But nevertheless, could it be low-teens to mid-teens? Yeah, certainly could be. Super excited about Latin America and the pace of growth and the outlook there. Middle East should be very strong.  And I think we're going to see the kind of broad-based improvement that allows pricing and pockets of places to continue to get better. So it's going to be good. It should be really, really good market internationally. I think we build into it throughout 22 as well. Scott Gruber : Got it. Thank you. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Arun Jayaram : Good morning. I wanted to get a bit more color on some of the implications of house decision to reposition some of your frac fleets to get the better pricing you mentioned and exposure to long-term contracts. So I wanted to maybe get a sense of are you mobilizing that equipment today. So, is that going to be a little bit of a drag on 4Q, and as you get that equipment into those newer markets, does that give you some tailwinds as we think about 2022. Jeff Miller : Yeah. I think it does give us tailwinds as we go into 2022. Drag our headwinds near-term. Not much -- any of that would be in our guidance. But look, this is making -- maximizing the value in North America, which is clearly what strategically we want to do and plan to do. And our doing involves making decisions around what we do with the assets that we have. And I think you're seeing that and will continue to see that from Halliburton.  And so I'm super encouraged, and a lot of the discussions we're having today with customers are around 2022, in fact, most of that dialogue is 2022 and beyond, actually, even into some sort of 23 type discussion. So I'm super encouraged, so what we want to make sure is that our assets are deployed where they're the most valuable for us and our clients. And yes, that does include moving them around. When we're moving them around, we tend to do more maintenance on them and what not. That's the opportunity that we take typically to do high-grades of fluid ends and that kind of thing. And so it should be interpreted in a very positive way what we're doing, and particularly a demonstration of really two strategic planks. One is maximizing value in North America and the second is capital velocity. Capital efficiency. Arun Jayaram : Got it. Got it. Any color, Jeff, on which basins that you sense is a better opportunity to get better pricing in these long-term commitments? Jeff Miller : Well, fortunately, we're in all the basins. And so I don't really take a view of basin by basin as much as we do customer opportunity by customer opportunity, and that can be wherever it might fall. I'm not going to necessarily carve out a particular location. Clearly, there's more activity nearly in all of the basins today, and so that's very encouraging. Arun Jayaram : Okay. My follow-up is just on international -- there's 3.5 to 4 million barrels offline by OpEx Plus. I wanted to get your views on -- are you seeing any shifts internationally from customers, perhaps shifting from a focus on maintenance Capex, sustaining Capex projects, to growing productive capacity. and if so, which markets are you seeing perhaps some shift towards that -- into a bit more growth? Jeff Miller : Look, I think [Indiscernible] we're going to find internationally, there's been a lot of under spend for quite a long time and a lot of countries are declining today. Declining is hard to overcome. They'll work hard to do that, but that doesn't necessarily move the needle in terms of production. It might get it back to flat instead of even with extra work, it takes extra work to just stem the decline.  All of that's positive for us. I mean, clearly we see more activity as we go into 2022 in the Middle East and Latin America. But again, I think that those that can spend and are in a position to do so will, but there's the capital austerity by a number of clients is still well in place, and so I think that -- and I say that in the sense that I think that production is going to all be near wellbore, which is very good for us, and I think that a lot of work will get done. But I still see supply as tight for really quite some time.  I mean, it doesn't turn back on. Maybe a point worth remembering, in 2014, the number of big multi-billion-dollar projects with 30-year payouts that were being completed or in the process of finishing, we don't see those today. And the reality is that means there's less spin on infrastructure and a lot more spin on what we do. And I think that's all very, very positive. Arun Jayaram : Thanks a lot. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ian Macpherson with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Ian Macpherson : Good morning. Jeff Miller : Good morning, Ian. Ian Macpherson : Jeff, it seems like an unsung hero of your year so far has been Latin America. It's whe -- That's where you've had really outsized growth and the market there, the total activity has grown, but it looks like you punched above your weight in Latin America.  Can you speak to those strengths? And you said, I think it's -- not towards in your mouth, but synchronized global, international growth going into next year. For Latin America, in particular, do you expect to see continued momentum on par with the rest of Eastern Hemisphere growth into next year as well? Jeff Miller : Yes, I do. Look, I'm very encouraged about Latin America. And that team has punched above its weight in Latin America. We've got an excellent team, great position. We're in every country. The technology introduction has been effective there which I've talked about sort of our Drilling Tools and what we've been able to accomplish.  Our project management capabilities are very strong in Latin America and it's allowed us to outperform in my view. I think that continues into 2022 as more work comes on. And again, that's a part of the world where oil production, and it's very important to economies and operators. and I think that we'll continue to see a strong Latin American business. Ian Macpherson : Great. Thanks, Jeff. And then I was going to ask a follow-up to Lance after. You had a really good quarter here with free cash, with the disposals, and some working capital as well. Any indicators for Q4 [Indiscernible] with regards to extras outside of the basics of free cash with respect to net disposals and working capital movements to close the year. Lance Loeffler : Yeah, I think we certainly expect continued strength in the operational profit piece of the equation. That's pretty obvious based on our guidance for the quarter. Some of that will be offset by some of that acceleration in Capex spend that we talked about in my prepared remarks. Jeff Miller : We'll be looking to round out the year around Capex. And look, I think we'll have to see how working capital continues to play out. We have clearly been very focused on working capital and the required investment it would take to put back that investment as we continue to grow, a great outcome this quarter where we actually still generated cash from working capital, despite the fact that our revenue was growing globally.  So all good facts historically, whether we can keep -- whether it's realistic that we can keep that momentum from a working capital perspective going forward might be a little bit harder. So those are all the things that we think about. I mean, look, overall, I'm excited about the way that free cash flow has behaved so far this year and I continue to be encouraged about what that means for next year as well. Ian Macpherson : Great. Thank you, Jeff. Jeff Miller : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Marci Bianci with Cowen (ph). Your line is open. Marci Bianci : Thank you. I guess, with regard to CMP in North America here, you've got these little bit of maintenance overhang, I guess it's about 50 basis points based on your comment, Jeff, and then there's these pricing initiatives. Is there any way you could give us a sense of the margin leverage that you could see in 2022 from all of this?  I don't know if it'd be perhaps unreasonable to get to 19& or 20% margins towards the end of the year in CMP, if you're willing to comment on that or any other color about how you would see the margin average shaping up. Jeff Miller : Look, I feel good about our business in 2022, most certainly for the reasons I've described. I'm not going to try to give an outlook today on 2022, but what I can say from an operating -- from an earnings power standpoint. We've been very effective at maintaining the earnings power reset that really happened a year ago, but that's well in place.  And all of the things, there were a lot of things that we did when we were reducing costs a year ago that really they were going to be savings as we saw activity pick up, but they were sort of the things that improved margins with activity. We didn't have much activity, so we didn't see the benefit of that, but a lot of the digital work that we've done in North America and reduction of roofline and changing of maintenance and all of those things become more valuable as we get into an environment where we see more activity.  And so we're really encouraged about the outlook. And not only activity but our technology offering, particularly around frac in North America, is very unique and I think we will see the power of that also. Marci Bianci : Yeah. Okay, great. And then, Lance, going back to free cash flow, it looks like you're going to be approaching maybe 50% conversion of EBITDA here in '21. Maybe walk us through the puts and takes as you look at '22 Capex, probably in that 5% to 6% range, but just any other color you could talk to around the conversion, that would be great. Lance Loeffler : Yes. So, I think as we look to '22, it's certainly healthier, right? Generally speaking, I describe it that way because it means that our operational profit contribution is clearly moving higher as -- into the year -- into next year. But like I said earlier, even as I was relating to the fourth quarter, our revenue increase is going to require incremental working capital. Look, 21 is proof that we're focused on it, and managing it as tight as we can and as efficiently as we can. And then you're right, Mark, from a Capex perspective. I think we've been pretty clear what the guardrails are on our business even into next year, 5% to 6% of revenue. But look, at the end of the day, maximizing value in North America, growing international profitably, and that keeping real tremendous amount of focus on capital efficiency. I think all leads to free cash flow growth next year. Marci Bianci : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. That's all the time we have for questions today. I'd like to turn the call back to A - Jeff Miller for closing comments. Jeff Miller : Thank you, Katherine. Look, I'm pleased with the quarter and look forward to speaking with you again at the end of the next quarter as we see this multiyear up-cycle continue to unfold. Katherine, you can close out the call. Operator : This concludes today's Conference Call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to Halliburton\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to David Coleman, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. David Coleman : Good morning. And welcome to the Halliburton fourth quarter 2021 conference call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on Halliburton\u2019s website for seven days. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO; and Lance Loeffler, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton\u2019s views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton\u2019s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2021, recent current reports on Form 8-K, and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statement for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our fourth quarter earnings release or in the Quarterly Results & Presentations section of our website. After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow time for others who may be in the queue. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. 2021 finished strong for Halliburton, and I\u2019m excited about the accelerating upcycle as we enter 2022. We have an effective value proposition and benefit from increasing activity both in North America and international markets. At the same time, we see improving service pricing in both markets. Throughout this upcycle I expect Halliburton to grow profitably, accelerate free cash flow generation, strengthen our balance sheet, and increase cash returns to shareholders. But first, I want to take a minute and recognize the men and women of Halliburton for their execution on every dimension of our business : safety, service quality, and financial results. In spite of global complexity in 2021, you outperformed. So, to all of our employees, thank you. I believe 2022 will be a strong year for our industry and especially for Halliburton. While global energy demand and economic growth demonstrated resilience, global energy supply has shown its fragility. The impact of several years of underinvestment in new production is now apparent and the structural requirement to invest around the wellbore is crystal clear. We see increasing customer urgency and a pivot back to what creates value for Halliburton. Our customers demand reliable execution, dependable supply chains, effective technology, and a collaborative service provider to maximize asset value. And this is at the core of Halliburton\u2019s unique value proposition. But first, I\u2019ll highlight some of our 2021 accomplishments. We finished the year with total Company revenue of $15.3 billion, and operating income of $1.8 billion. Both of Halliburton\u2019s divisions grew revenue and margins this year. Our Completion and Production division finished the year with 15% operating margin, driven by activity improvement, despite inflationary pressures. We expect to build on this margin growth in 2022, as global activity and pricing improve. Our Drilling and Evaluation division margins remained firmly in double digits throughout 2021 and achieved full year margins of 12% for the first time since 2014. This is a good demonstration of our steady March forward, and we are not done. I\u2019m pleased with the trajectory of our international business. International revenue and operating income increased every quarter in 2021. In North America, Halliburton achieved 36% incrementals year-on-year as U.S. land activity rebounded, and we maximized the value of our business. We announced our science-based emission reduction targets, added 11 new participating companies to Halliburton labs and were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, which highlights the top 10% most sustainable companies in each industry. Finally, we generated strong free cash flow of $1.4 billion and ended the year with $3 billion of cash on hand, even after the retirement of $685 million of long-term debt in 2021. Next, let me share a few highlights from our fourth quarter performance. Total Company revenue increased 11%, and operating income grew 20% sequentially. Our Completion and Production division revenue increased 10% sequentially and operating income increased 8% with completion tool sales showing the highest third to fourth quarter improvement in the last 15 years. Equally important, our current completion tool order book has more than doubled from a year ago, signaling strong growth and profitability again in 2022. Our Drilling and Evaluation division grew revenue 11%, which outperformed the global rig count growth for the quarter and delivered over 300 basis points of sequential margin improvement. International and North America revenue grew 11% and 10% respectively due to strong year-end sales and activity increases across all regions. Building on this strong foundation of disciplined execution, today we announced two important strategic steps we are taking to further create value for our shareholders. First, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend to $0.12 per share in the first quarter of 2022. This action reflects our confidence in Halliburton\u2019s strong cash generation capacity. Second, in order to accelerate debt retirement and strengthen our balance sheet, we\u2019re redeeming $600 million of our $1 billion in debt maturing in 2025. When these notes are redeemed in February, we will have retired $1.8 billion of debt since the beginning of 2020. These steps demonstrate my confidence in our business, customers, employees, and value proposition. As I discussed with you on recent earnings calls, I expect the macro industry environment to remain supportive, and as we saw in 2021, the international and North America markets will continue their simultaneous growth. This is momentum that I have not seen in a long time. With this momentum, we plan to execute our unique strategic priorities, deliver profitable growth internationally, maximize value in North America, accelerate digital and automation deployment, improve capital efficiency and advance a sustainable energy future. Let\u2019s discuss how we plan to do this. First, internationally, our strategy is to deliver profitable growth. We allocate capital to the highest returns opportunities, which means we are selective on what we bid for and win. Our D&E margin performance in 2021 is a demonstration of this discipline. We continue to invest in technology, both digital and hardware, that maximizes asset value. In 2021, we brought to market over 50 new technologies, including our iStar intelligent formation evaluation platform and the next generation of our iCruise system for harsh drilling environments. Our multiyear investment in drilling technologies is paying off, and we expect to outgrow the market as international drilling activity ramps up. We have unique international growth opportunities in specialty chemicals and artificial lift. As Halliburton expands the international footprint of these businesses, we have a pipeline of opportunities that are longer cycle and should be margin-accretive. Halliburton\u2019s size, scale and sophisticated supply chain and HR teams reliably execute for our customers in the face of supply shortages and labor tightness. Second, in the structurally smaller North American market, our strategy is to maximize cash flow, and it dictates how we approach our North America business. Strong cash flow starts with strong margins, and Halliburton\u2019s margins are the best in class. We completed the most aggressive set of structural cost reductions in our history. We also made significant changes to our processes that drive higher contribution margin, for example, how we perform equipment maintenance and provide engineering support. These changes give us meaningful operating leverage as North American activity accelerates. We consistently replace equipment as it wears out and avoid outsized recapitalization requirements. And we have the right type of equipment. We are the leaders in the low-emissions equipment segment. We believe this gives us a structural pricing advantage as operators are willing to pay a premium for differentiated, more environmentally friendly solutions. Our second generation Zeus electric fracturing technology is working in the field today and delivers results for a growing list of customers. Importantly, in addition to emissions reduction, electric fracturing technology provides unprecedented operational control and precision. For example, Zeus makes pumping rate adjustments at least 4 times faster than a diesel pump, allowing us to respond to surface and subsurface changes more quickly than with a conventional frac spread and precisely execute the job design. We expect fully electric locations to become a larger share of the market. Halliburton has the right kit, including our Zeus electric pumping unit, the ExpressBlend blending system, the eWinch electric wireline unit and the electric tech command center to meet the market demand for lower-emitting fracturing operations. We develop differentiated technologies to focus around the wellbore. As the oil price and customer urgency increase, these technologies become more valuable to operators. For example, our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing solution helps customers optimize fracturing performance and maximize production. Several large operators will have smart fleet working on multi-pad completion programs this year. Additionally, SmartFleet delivers fully automated frac operations, which ensures more consistent fracture placement on every stage, improves cluster uniformity and manages offset frac hits. Finally, I want to highlight the importance of our well construction and production service lines. They each have unique competitive advantage and technology to maximize value in North America. Third, our strategy is to advance digitalization and automation in all aspects of our business. Our digital investments drive higher margins through customer purchases of software, smarter tools and ancillary products, and cost savings for Halliburton. Let me give you an example. Currently, 100% of Halliburton\u2019s drilling jobs run on a cloud-based, real-time system to deliver data and visualization to our customers around the world. Close to 60% of iCruise operations are fully automated, allowing for up to a 70% reduction in headcount per rig. Automation alleviates health and safety concerns by removing personnel from rigs, accelerates service delivery improvements and reduces the environmental footprint of oil and gas operations. Our fourth strategic priority is to drive capital efficiency across the balance sheet. This positions Halliburton to generate industry-leading returns and strong free cash flow as markets grow. We will optimize the working capital required to grow our business and maintain our CapEx in the range of 5% to 6% of revenue. Our business thrives in this range because of our research and development efforts and process changes. These allow us to build tools cheaper, lengthen their run life and move assets quicker to where they make the most money. Our final strategic priority is to advance a sustainable energy future. Our clean energy accelerator, Halliburton Labs, continues to add new participants. We help these early-stage companies achieve important scaling milestones and significantly increase their enterprise value. Through Halliburton Labs, we are actively participating in the clean energy space without committing shareholder capital. Halliburton will evolve as energy evolves, and we will add to our already expanding opportunities to participate as clean energy value chains mature. However, we will do so consistent with our capital allocation strategy and mindful of our commitment to deliver industry-leading returns and free cash flow generation. We will proceed with patience, discipline and resolve. Now, let\u2019s review our fourth quarter 2021 performance and expectations for 2022. As OPEC+\u2019s spare capacity returns to normalized levels this year, we believe sufficient pent-up oil demand will support a call on both international and U.S. production, and lead to increased activity. International activity accelerated in most markets in the second half of the year and finished strong in the fourth quarter with a 23% rig count increase year-on-year. All Halliburton regions grew revenue, led by Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa with both of our divisions contributing to the revenue and margin expansion. I\u2019m excited about our future international growth. Despite typical first quarter seasonality, we are starting 2022 a lot higher than where we entered 2021. I expect our customers\u2019 international spend to increase by mid-teens this year. We anticipate projects in the Middle East, Russia and Latin America to attract the most investment with activity increases in Africa and Europe limited to a few markets. Asset owners are eager to reverse base production declines caused by multiple years of underinvestment. We expect that operators will focus on shorter cycle production opportunities to meet increasing oil demand. This disproportionately benefits Halliburton as these short-cycle barrels require higher service intensity and spending directly focused on the wellbore as opposed to long-cycle infrastructure investments. In 2022, we expect to deliver steady, profitable growth across the international markets. Our tender pipeline is strong. We anticipate higher utilization for our existing equipment in busy markets like the Middle East, Russia and Latin America. We plan to allocate our capital dollars to the opportunities that generate the highest return. Given the tool tightness that exists today in some product lines and geographies, we intend to strategically reallocate assets to drive improved utilization and returns. A tightening market focuses our ongoing pricing discussions with customers. We see pricing traction on new work and contract renewals, including integrated contracts. Additionally, we have introduced pay-for-performance models, negotiated favorable terms and conditions and applied price escalation clauses. While large tenders remain competitive, we are consistent with our strategy to pursue profitable growth. Turning to North America. In 2021, the recovery in North America was faster and more pronounced than in the international markets. In the fourth quarter, U.S. land rig count increased 84% year-on-year, and drilling activity outpaced completions as operators prepared well inventory for 2022 programs. Completed stage count growth moderated slightly due to the holidays, sand supply tightness and lower efficiency levels typically experienced in the winter months. In the fourth quarter, we finished the plant upgrade of all fracturing fleets to the next generation fluid end technology that extends the life of our equipment and helps reduce maintenance cost. We expect a busy 2022 in North America. Given a strong commodity price environment, we anticipate North America customer spending to grow more than 25% year-on-year. We believe the highest increase will come from private operators. Public E&Ps will continue to prioritize returns while delivering production into a supportive market. In North America, Halliburton uniquely benefits as the largest oilfield services provider in the largest oilfield services market in the world. We anticipate solid net pricing gains in North America throughout 2022. Here\u2019s why. The North America completions market is approaching 90% utilization, and Halliburton is sold out. Pricing for our fracturing fleets is moving higher across the board, both for our market-leading low-emissions equipment and our Tier 4 diesel fleets. As a result, we expect to see over 30% incrementals in our hydraulic fracturing business in the first quarter. Anticipated demand growth for equipment provides a runway for us to increase pricing throughout the year. We expect some market-wide operational efficiencies afforded by completing a backlog of DUCs in 2021 to reverse as frac fleets return to the usual mode of following drilling rigs. This will further increase the call on equipment as operators add rigs throughout the year. Finally, during the tendering season, we secured net pricing increases across several different non-frac product service lines : drilling, cementing, fluids, drill bits and artificial lift. As activity accelerates, the market is seeing tightness related to trucking, labor, sand and other inputs. While we pass these increased costs on to operators, Halliburton has effective solutions that minimize the operational impact of this tightness and provide reliable execution for our customers. As an example, in 2021, we expanded our collaboration with Vorto and now benefit from 5F, the largest integrated transportation platform in the oil and gas industry. This platform has several-thousand drivers, hundreds of carriers and a chain of asset maintenance yards. It allows us to effectively manage trucking inflation and availability constraints and significantly reduce logistics-related nonproductive time. Our human resources team and systems effectively mitigate local labor tightness. We recruit nationally and hire, train and manage a commuter workforce that makes up to 80% of our personnel in some areas. There is no doubt the much anticipated multiyear upcycle is now underway. North America production growth remains capped by operators\u2019 capital discipline, while meaningful international production growth is challenged by years of underinvestment. Energy demand has proven its resilience, fueled by pent-up economic growth and a global desire to return to normalcy. This is a fantastic set of conditions for Halliburton. In a strong commodity price environment with limited production growth options, operators turn to short-cycle barrels and increased spend around the wellbore. Our value proposition works. We have the right strategies for both international and North American markets. We are leaders in digital and automation, and we drive capital efficiency while advancing a sustainable energy future. I fully expect that Halliburton will accelerate cash flow generation, strengthen our balance sheet and increase cash returns to shareholders in this upcycle. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our fourth quarter financial results. Lance? Lance Loeffler : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a summary of our fourth quarter results compared to the third quarter of 2021. Total company revenue for the quarter was $4.3 billion, an increase of 11%. Operating income was $550 million, a 20% increase compared to the adjusted operating income of $458. These results were primarily driven by increased global drilling activity and end-of-year product and software sales. Now, let me discuss our division results in a little more detail. Starting with our Completion and Production division. Revenue was $2.4 billion, an increase of 10%, while operating income was $347 million or an 8% increase. These results were primarily driven by higher completion tool sales globally as well as increased pressure pumping services in North America land and the Middle East/Asia region. These improvements were partially offset by reduced stimulation activity in Latin America, Canada and the Gulf of Mexico; lower pipeline services in Europe/Africa/CIS and Asia; reduced well intervention services in Brazil; and decreased artificial lift activity in North America land. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $1.9 billion, an increase of 11%, while operating income was $269 million or a 45% increase. These results were due to increased drilling-related services globally, wireline sales in Guyana, improved project management activity in Ecuador and India, increased wireline activity in the Middle East/Asia region, and higher software sales in Latin America and Middle East/Asia. Partially offsetting these increases were decreased project management activity and testing services in Mexico as well as lower drilling-related activity in Russia. Moving on to our geographic results. In North America, revenue increased 10%. This increase was primarily driven by higher pressure pumping activity and drilling-related services in North America land in addition to higher completion tool sales and fluid services in the Gulf of Mexico. These increases were partially offset by reduced stimulation activity in Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, coupled with reduced artificial lift activity in North America land. Turning to Latin America. Revenue increased 7% sequentially. This improvement was driven by higher project management activity in Ecuador, increased drilling-related services in Mexico, increased activity across multiple product service lines in Brazil, wireline sales in Guyana, and higher activity across multiple product service lines in Colombia. These increases were partially offset by reduced project management and stimulation activity and testing services in Mexico. In Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue increased 8% sequentially. These results were partially driven by higher software and completion tool sales across the region, improved activity across multiple product service lines in Norway and Egypt, and increased well control activity in Nigeria. These improvements were partially offset by reduced activity in multiple product service lines in Russia, reduced pipeline services and well construction activity in the United Kingdom, and decreased stimulation activity in the Congo. In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue increased 16%, resulting from higher completion tool sales and wireline activity across the region, improved well construction services in Saudi Arabia and Oman, higher software sales in Kuwait and China, improved project management activity in India, and increased stimulation activity throughout Asia. These increases were partially offset by reduced pipeline services in Asia, along with lower activity across multiple product service lines in Vietnam. Now, I\u2019d like to address some additional financial items. In the fourth quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $66 million, which was slightly higher than expected due to an increase in legal reserves. For the first quarter, we expect our corporate expense to be about $60 million. Net interest expense for the quarter was $108 million, slightly lower than anticipated due to higher interest income from our cash balance. Today, we announced our decision to redeem $600 million of the 2025 senior notes using cash on hand. This action will reduce future cash interest expense and reflects our desire to continue reducing debt balances. As a result of the debt retirement in late February, our net interest expense should remain roughly flat in the first quarter. During the quarter, we recognized a noncash gain of approximately $500 million due to the partial release of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. This reversal is based on the improved market conditions and reflects our increased expectation to utilize these deferred tax assets going forward. Our normalized effective tax rate for the fourth quarter came in at approximately 23%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our 2022 first quarter effective tax rate to be approximately the same. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $316 million with our 2021 full year CapEx totaling approximately $800 million. In 2022, we intend to increase our capital expenditures to approximately $1 billion while remaining within our target of 5% to 6% of revenue. We believe that this level of spend will equip us well to execute on our strategic priorities and take advantage of the accelerating market recovery. Turning to cash flow. We generated nearly $700 million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter and delivered approximately $1.4 billion of free cash flow for the full year. As a result, we ended the year with approximately $3 billion in cash. I\u2019ve spoken before about our ability to concurrently reduce debt and increase the return of cash to shareholders, and today, we put that into action. This is a great start to a longer term goal of returning more cash to shareholders. Now, let me provide you with some comments on how we see the first quarter playing out. As is typical, our results will be subject to weather-related seasonality and the roll-off of year-end product sales, which will mostly impact our international and Gulf of Mexico businesses. However, we expect pricing recovery in North America to help offset these dynamics. As a result, in our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue and margins to be essentially flat to the fourth quarter. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect revenue to decrease in the mid-single digits sequentially, while margins are expected to be flat to down 50 basis points. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff? Jeff Miller : Thanks, Lance. To summarize our discussion today, we see customer urgency and demand for our services increasing internationally and in North America. We expect our strong international business to continue its profitable growth as activity ramps up throughout the year. In the critical North America market, we expect our business to grow and improve margins. We prioritize our investments to the highest-return opportunities and remain committed to capital efficiency. We continue to play a role in advancing cleaner and more affordable energy solutions. In 2022, I expect Halliburton to deliver margin expansion, industry-leading returns and solid free cash flow. And now, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James West, Evercore ISI. James West : So, Jeff, maybe just to kick us off here, could you talk a bit about the cadence of this cycle? You mentioned several times growth and you also mentioned a key word, which is urgency from customers. And I think that\u2019s going to be something that\u2019s very important when we think about pricing, margins, et cetera. Could you talk about how you see both, North America and the international markets and the cadence of the increases in activity, growth and how you and the broader industry, but you particularly, are expecting things to unfold here as we go through \u201822 and into \u201823 and beyond? Jeff Miller : Yes. Well, thanks, James. Look, I really like the macro setup, and I have said that before. And what we really see is the fragility, as I described it, of supply and the returning demand. And so, I think, there are factors that the underinvestment internationally means that has to be recovered over a longer period of time. And I think a lot of the return expectations of this industry in North America are still in place and such that is a bit of a cap on production growth. But nevertheless, the activity, that just means a longer upcycle in my view. And I feel really good about the cadence, meaning it continues to move up this year, next year and beyond. And the way that sets up for us is we got -- we have an opportunity to take advantage of the operating leverage that\u2019s already in our business. The pricing environment will be good throughout that period as equipment gets tighter everywhere and our technology is more valuable to customers in this kind of environment. And yes, activity, I believe, does ramp, and it\u2019s going to be the kind of short-cycle barrels that drive the most activity for us because this is urgently trying to return barrels to market under those sort of constraints, very good for us. And so, as we look out to 2023, I\u2019ll just start there, look out to 2023, I don\u2019t see 2023 as an endpoint by any means. I think the road goes on well beyond that. But I can tell you what we\u2019ve talked about for 2023 is biased higher. James West : Right. Okay, okay. Makes sense to me. And that\u2019s clearly in line with our expectations. How are -- Jeff and Lance, the dividend increase -- solid dividend increase, how do you think about and how are you guys thinking about shareholder returns going forward as we kind of move into -- well, we\u2019re into, but I guess is being accelerated into this upcycle? Jeff Miller : Yes. Look, thanks, James. I\u2019ll take that. Look, those were important actions that we took to date. And we expect to continue, continue finding opportunities to return more cash to shareholders and pay down debt. And as we pay down debt, that creates headroom in our fixed payments as we pay down debt. And think about it, we\u2019ve repaid $1.8 billion of debt since January of 2020. And we get through \u201823 and \u201825, as debt is paid. The next maturity is not until 2030. And so we fully -- I fully expect to continue growing shareholder distributions as the upcycle accelerates. Operator : Our next question comes from Dave Anderson with Barclays. Dave Anderson : I just want to ask about C&P margins during the quarter and then thinking about the progression for next year. Highlighted completion tool sales end, but margins kind of slipped a bit during the quarter. And then, Jeff, in your prepared remarks, you had talked about completion tool orders have doubled since last year. So, I\u2019m just trying to understand what all that means in terms of the mix. Obviously, we have the kind of the pressure pumping price in there. If you could just kind of help us understand how that margin should kind of move. Jeff Miller : Well, look, yes, I mean, as we look at 2021, for example, 15% margins, I\u2019m pleased with those. We got a lot of important work done in our frac business in Q4, which I talked about in my comments, but getting fluid ends installed and then raising prices involves moving equipment around. And so, we probably had 10% of our fleet moving as we raised price and got moved to different customers that were happy with the new price. And so that\u2019s Q4. As we look at the order book doubling in completion tools, that\u2019s really a look ahead to 2022, and that\u2019s very positive for 2022 to see those types of longer lead items building in our order book. I think when we think about progression in 2022, I expect to see 30% incrementals in our frac business in North America in 2022 in first quarter, but what that -- mixed in with that are the completion tools that don\u2019t repeat in Q1. But the reality is we are filling a big hole largely with recurring pricing and the kind of sticky things that we plan to build on. And we still get the 2022 doubling of the order book at some point during the year of 2022 in completion tools. I hope that\u2019s some clarity. Dave Anderson : That is. That\u2019s great, Jeff. And if I could just shift -- well, I guess, somewhat related question. I want to ask about kind of further e-frac deployment and kind of how you see that developing over the next several years. It\u2019s pretty clear that E&Ps are increasingly looking to reduce emissions. They\u2019re going to need to reduce emissions. E-frac is clearly part of that solution. But of course, it costs more with the power source. I think you\u2019re at like 5 or 6 fleets today. Maybe you could just update us where you are there. But I\u2019m just kind of wondering kind of thinking out the next 12, 18 months, is it possible you could kind of double that deployment? But I guess even more important, do you think E&Ps are willing to underwrite this with longer-term contracts? Jeff Miller : Let me unpack that a little bit. Just from an e-fleet deployment standpoint, we view e-fleet as replacements for our current equipment. So, the pacing of that is consistent with how we think about sort of fleet management over time. And obviously, that is contingent upon getting the terms and conditions and pricing that are clearly returning above what anything else is returning, and that\u2019s what motivates us there. All of that lives inside of our CapEx outlook of 5% to 6% of revenue. So, I just want to keep all of that sort of in the right frame. We think about power, however, that is a unique piece of this puzzle. And what I expect happens with electric broadly is, yes, it grows, our share will grow of that. I think we\u2019ve got fantastic equipment in the market working today. But the power piece, we\u2019re power-agnostic. And if you recall, over time, I\u2019ve always said, the issue here was the power, who owns the power. And I think we\u2019ve partnered with a very good firm, successful firm that has modular power such that over time, as operators can optimize power sources, meaning the grid, our partner has the ability to scale that back and sort of optimize along with clients. And so, I think that\u2019s the sort of unique power component that we solve for with both the grid. Operator : Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Jeff, I wanted to start on the 400 basis-point margin increase target for 2023. As you look at that, what do you think represents the biggest risk to achieving it? And how do you feel about upside scenarios, and what factors could drive that? Jeff Miller : Yes. Look, thanks, Neil. I\u2019m excited and encouraged about what I see, more so today than I was before, which was all the -- it\u2019s basically the simultaneous growth, North America and international and the -- effectively, the demand for equipment that we see, which now allows both activity and price to move at the same time. So I don\u2019t -- from a risk perspective, look, I think that we\u2019re in a good place to manage those risks that might be out there, whether it\u2019s a range of things. But all of those things appear to be manageable, particularly given how important producing oil clearly is to really our way of life, but also the markets see that. And so, I think that demand for activity will be there. Clearly, that\u2019s going to be biased higher at this point as we look out to 2023. And I think we\u2019re in a great position to take advantage of all of those things that happen, whether it\u2019s price and tightness, it\u2019s our technology. There\u2019s more demand for our technology in this kind of environment because it is our technology that -- drilling technology, for example, that help operators find more barrels nearby the wellbore, helps them do a lot of things that are important to them to accelerate their own production at an effective price. Neil Mehta : And there\u2019s been a lot of questions about where we are in terms of frac fleet utilization. I\u2019d love your perspective on that. How do you see this market as tight and if you\u2019d be willing to put a number on utilization? And how should we think about net service pricing in U.S. fracs for the back half of \u201822 and into \u201823, especially as you get some of these new built low-emission frac fleets starting to enter the market once again? Jeff Miller : Well, we see it as close to 90% utilized as a market for equipment that\u2019s existing today. And so, it doesn\u2019t take much increase in activity to continue to tighten that, and I see that tightening more so in the back half of next year. The electric equipment as it comes into the market, a testament to our R&D organization, but we were able to bring that technology to market very quickly. It\u2019s best in class, and that\u2019s one of the reasons it\u2019s going to work. And that team along with partners solve for sort of the power dilemma. And so, I think we\u2019re in a great place to bring equipment to market. But clearly, that is new capital into the market, which requires higher returns than what we certainly have seen. And so, I think a cap on that\u2019s going to be the requirement for higher returns. I think capital is -- capital for building equipment, clearly in short supply and particularly because there\u2019s a lot of repair to come for returns in North America. So, a lot of that informs our strategy of maximizing value in North America means we approach it differently. It\u2019s not can we grow -- build the most equipment? Can we maximize the most cash flow out of that market? And we think electric fleets positioned the right way help us do that. Operator : Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JP Morgan. Arun Jayaram : My first question is you guys have repositioned assets, frac fleets to improve utilization returns. And I just wanted to ask is absent pricing gains, what kind of tailwinds do you think that these types of actions could provide to margins as well as we think about adoption of SmartFleet and other Hal 4.0 offerings? Jeff Miller : Well, we move equipment to raise margins. And I expect that we will see that kind of margin improvement into 2022. You mentioned SmartFleet. I think that\u2019s a key component of what makes Halliburton unique in the fracs business in North America, and it\u2019s one of the unique things of being -- of our large peers, we\u2019re the only one in the frac business in North America, and that allows our technology budget is meaningful. And I think over time, applied consistently R&D investment has always been what moves this industry both from a productivity standpoint and a return standpoint for us. And so SmartFleet being but an example of what that R&D at scale looks like when it\u2019s applied to North America. And so, yes, I think that does contribute to margins as does electric fleets as the many other sort of technology solutions that we\u2019re working on all of the time. Arun Jayaram : Fair enough. And my second question is, you guys mentioned in your prepared remarks about what\u2019s going on with DUCs. DUCs have been down for 18 months in a row, and you\u2019re starting to see the mix of drilling increase over time. I know that DUCs have been a tailwind for operators and led to, call it, lower frac needs in last year and the year before. And I know it\u2019s difficult to measure, but I just wanted to know if you could maybe measure or quantify what kind of tailwind do you think this could provide the frac demand if the current fleet count\u2019s around 235 or so? Jeff Miller : Well, you\u2019re thinking about it the right way. And I expect that it does increase demand just because there\u2019s going to be more disruption in the system, meaning fleets will have to follow rigs. That will then create demand for more fleet. Yes, if we\u2019re at 90%, clearly, we sort of run to the end of that quite quickly and expect the entire market needs to get better from a price standpoint. And I expect that we will see that as it gets -- we\u2019re seeing it now. I think that is a dynamic that will continue certainly throughout the balance of this year. Operator : Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Chase Mulvehill : So Lance, I guess, maybe this question\u2019s for you, just thinking about the 1Q guide. I guess, I can kind of connect the dots with the C&P margins being flat because you\u2019ve got completion tool sales kind of rolling off and obviously frac getting better. But thinking about the D&E side, resilient margins as we get into 1Q, and typically, you have software sales in the fourth quarter. So, just maybe help us kind of connect the dots here between 4Q and 1Q with kind of flat to down 50 bps on the D&E side because typically, you see some seasonality in the Eastern Hemisphere and you have software sales that will be rolling off. So, do you have some -- maybe some software sales that kind of linger into first quarter? Or just kind of help us understand the resiliency of margins in the first quarter. Lance Loeffler : We do, Chase. It\u2019s a good question. We do. So, in our software business, the way that we recognize revenue is sort of spread now between the fourth quarter and the first quarter. So, we still have some resiliency from the software sales. But I wouldn\u2019t discount what we\u2019re doing on the drilling side. You heard Jeff talk about it in his prepared remarks. We\u2019re really excited about what that means for our business. I mean, clearly, we have the weather-driven seasonality that will continue, and that\u2019s always something that exists during the real hard winter months in places like the North Sea and Russia, in particular. But I really think that we\u2019re excited about what the drilling business and the change that we\u2019re making and the impact that\u2019s coming from sort of that investment that we made in rekitting Sperry, for example, is really beginning to pay off. Chase Mulvehill : Okay, perfect. And then, a follow-up, obviously, you said multiple times here, 90% utilization of frac. But there is some cold-stacked equipment that may or may not come off the sidelines. Obviously, it depends on pricing. I guess maybe could you give us some comments -- or your comments around cold-stacked equipment? How much pricing would have to move for people to spend $10-plus-million because you probably converted some of those from Tier 2 to Tier 4 DGB? So just how much would pricing have to move for the industry to start kind of reactivating and spending more on cold-stacked reactivations? Jeff Miller : Look, I think prices would have to move a long way. And some of the conversion you\u2019re talking about, that\u2019s dramatic. That\u2019s open heart surgery. Getting from Tier 2 to Tier 4 is not something that happened simply. And it\u2019s really going against the direction the entire market\u2019s going, which is towards environmentally friendly equipment. So, things that come off the bench aren\u2019t going to be in that category for sure. And I think the cost of getting things off the bench for what\u2019s there is going to be a lot higher than people think, and so I think that\u2019s a barrier to that coming back. A lot of that equipment was consumed in the last cycle as spare parts and all of the rest of that. So, I think we underestimate -- excuse me, I think there\u2019s a lot less of that and its cost is much higher. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Scott Gruber : I want to come back to the shareholder return question. Jeff, you commented on further actions to come down the road, which is great to hear. But just given the inherent volatility in the market, is the next move likely to be a buyback or a variable dividend? And then, we\u2019ve also seen many of your E&P customers commit to returning a certain percentage of cash flow or free cash flow. Is that something Halliburton would consider, especially in the context of a multiyear upcycle? Lance Loeffler : Sure, Scott. This is Lance. Look, we think about it very similar to sort of the line of question you\u2019re going down. I mean, look, today, I think this is a first step in a long line of other things that we expect to do to really accelerate cash returns to shareholders. It will come in the form of both increasing the dividend over time but doing it responsibly. And with any excess free cash flow that we would like to dedicate, we may reinstitute share repurchases. So, I think it will be a balance. We\u2019ll see what it\u2019s like when it gets there, not big band of a variable dividend today. Feel like we have the right things in place, and our communications to The Street are pretty clear around how we\u2019re managing this business and prioritizing free cash flow. And we\u2019ll be really good stewards about how we send it back to shareholders. Scott Gruber : Got it. I also want to come back to Dave\u2019s question on e-frac and ask a little bit broader question. We got the CapEx figure for the year, and you\u2019re keeping CapEx below the 6% level. But there\u2019s been this kind of outstanding question for Halliburton. As the frac market recovers, do your CapEx need to surprise and you have to go above that level? So, I guess the real question is, are you happy with the cadence of fleet renewal within the frac fleet? Are you able to kind of keep up your competitiveness with the pace of spend embedded in the budget this year? And just kind of as you think about over the medium term, do you think you can keep up your competitiveness with this -- with the cadence of renewal in the frac fleet that\u2019s built into that 6% -- sub-6% reinvestment level? Jeff Miller : Yes. Yes, we do, is the answer. We believe we thrive in this type of environment and managing or maintaining CapEx where it is. Look, it\u2019s a 5% to 6% of revenues. In my view, this very much show me story and we expect to deliver returns. And we do things ratably. And strategically, we view North America as maximizing value in North America. That means managing the right level of spend, the right type of technology, the right pacing of equipment. Clearly, the right pricing for equipment and making the right cash flow from that equipment. And so, the target is -- we are very consistent around our strategy, and that strategy is actually quite exciting for us to pursue a strategy that delivers the most free cash flow and grows and improves margin. So, I view this as a margin cycle, not a build cycle. And like I said, our team is excited about pursuing that, delivering on that. And that\u2019s why very comfortable with sort of that balance of the right level of investment, while we invest in D&E and international businesses at the same time. I mean, all of that fits together into how do we deliver and our plan to deliver accelerating free cash flow. Operator : Next question comes from Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Connor Lynagh : I wanted to return to the potential shareholder returns. And Lance, I wanted to just clarify a comment that you made in regards to excess free cash flow. I mean, how should we think about what that is? Is there a level of cash balance that you want to maintain in the business? Is there a sort of standard amount of delevering you want to occur over the next few years here? Basically, how would you define that for people? Lance Loeffler : Yes. Good question. I appreciate the follow-up. I think today, a minimum cash balance for us to run our business is around $2 billion, give or take. And so, we\u2019re always sensitive a little bit to that or mindful of it. But I would say, I\u2019ve been pretty clear about what we want to do in terms of strengthening the balance sheet. We need to be closer to 2 times debt to EBITDA. We spent a lot of time on this call, I know Jeff has, talking about the trajectory of the denominator in that equation. And we have work to do on the numerator. So, we expect to continue to find ways to attack gross debt. And I think starting with retiring the \u201823s and what\u2019s left of the \u201825s post this redemption is a good target. Connor Lynagh : Got it. Maybe just switching gears a little bit here. Drilling and Evaluation margins, very strong, and it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re expecting that much of a falloff. I appreciate the software accounting dynamics. But you\u2019re still year-over-year looking at something 250 to 300 basis points above where you were in 2021. I guess, two parts to this. Is that a good bogey for how we should think about the rest of the year in Drilling and Evaluation? And just as we think structurally about the return of international and the like, how should we think about the potential profitability cycle-over-cycle? It certainly is trending a lot higher right now. So, I just want to make sure we understand the moving pieces there. Jeff Miller : Well, it\u2019s a great starting point, and we expect it to trend higher over time as we move through. So, this is the result of technology investment, an excellent drilling business, drilling technology, collaborative approach with our clients, our value proposition; and the other service lines that are in D&E, very strong service lines, drilling fluids, I won\u2019t try to name them all here, but a very strong group of businesses. And I think what you\u2019re seeing in the margin is a demonstration of the improvement in capital velocity that we saw from the new technology in Sperry; also the improved capabilities, whether it\u2019s LWD or the ability to manage the data around that with the 3D inversion. So, there\u2019s a whole series of things that we\u2019ve been working on and actually have many more things left to deliver in that business during 2022. So, our expectations are that we\u2019re starting at a higher point -- or we\u2019re starting the year lower, but we are moving to a higher point. And I think we\u2019ll see that sort of repeat. Great expectations for that business. Operator : Our next question comes from Ian Macpherson with Piper Sandler. Ian Macpherson : Just sort of having to squint for concerning issues here as everything is set up pretty well for you here and executing well also. But just curious with escalating tensions in sabre rattling in Ukraine and given that Russia has been a pretty good growth market for the industry. Are you considering any risk with regard to sanctions impacting the trajectory of the business in Russia or Eastern Hemisphere on a knock-on basis at this point, or does this look like things that you\u2019ve seen and done before? Jeff Miller : Look, these are things we\u2019ve seen and done before. Always unfortunate in so many ways for so many people. But from a business perspective, we\u2019ve managed these sorts of things up and down for, I hate to say, nearly 100 years. So, these are the kinds of things that we would manage through. Ian Macpherson : Okay. Thanks, Jeff. Lance, just looking at our cash flow calculator for this year. You obviously had some good tailwinds in \u201821 with working capital release, which we know will reverse with cycle growth. And you also had probably better than sort of ratable disposal proceeds. So, when we think about 5% to 6%, you\u2019ll be probably closer to 5% and 6% of gross CapEx this year. How are you thinking about the other pieces? Because I did hear something in the prepared remarks about containing working capital expansion with growth, so maybe not a monster number of working capital expansion this year. Lance Loeffler : Yes. Look, you\u2019re right. Really happy with the way \u201821 free cash flow performed for us. And I think that we\u2019ve talked about before how we\u2019ve meaningfully, I believe, transformed the free cash flow profile of Halliburton and all the strategic priorities that we\u2019ve sort of discussed are things that help drive us to that end. But you\u2019re right. I think stronger free cash flow starts with stronger margins. And I think what you should expect for 2022 is to see that continued strength, operating cash flow less or excluding working capital to continue to drive higher, obviously. But I think that we\u2019re running into a period of time in 2022 that the amount of growth that we expect in the business is just going to drive an investment in working capital as opposed to a release of cash. But, as I\u2019ve always said, we are looking to put that investment back much more efficiently than when we took it out. And personally, that\u2019s something that I\u2019m committed to and working really hard with the organization to find those benefits. Operator : And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks. Jeff Miller : Thank you, Shannon. Look, I\u2019ll just conclude that this upcycle is a great setup for Halliburton to achieve profitable growth and accelerated free cash flow generation. Today\u2019s dividend increase and debt retirement announcements provide just two examples of what Halliburton expects to deliver throughout this multiyear upcycle. I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Shannon, let\u2019s close out the call. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased with Halliburton's first quarter results. Our performance demonstrates the resilience of our unique strategy in action and the importance of our competitive positioning, both in North America and international markets. Here are some highlights from the first quarter. International revenue grew 15% compared to the first quarter of 2021, with activity accelerating across all international markets. Strong growth in Latin America and the Middle East/Asia offset the winter weather impacts in Europe. In North America, revenue grew 37% year-on-year with the acceleration of both drilling and completions activity. Higher utilization in March and net pricing gains drove margin expansion despite weather and sand disruptions earlier in the quarter. Our Completion and Production division revenue grew 26% compared to the first quarter of 2021 on activity increases in North America, Africa and the Middle East, while operating income increased 17% despite transitory U.S. land/sand delivery disruptions. Our Drilling and Evaluation division grew revenue 22% year-on-year, while margins expanded 440 basis points and started the year at 15% for the first time since 2010. This exceptional performance was largely driven by the strength of our directional drilling and project management businesses. We added three new companies to Halliburton Labs, our clean energy accelerator. This brings the total number of program participants and alumni to 15 companies. Halliburton Labs allows us to actively participate in the future of clean energy value chain. Finally, we retired $600 million of our $1 billion of debt maturing in 2025 and nearly tripled our quarterly dividend to $0.12 per share. These actions strengthen our balance sheet and reflect our commitment to return cash to shareholders. Before we continue, I want to provide a few comments about the current situation in Ukraine and Russia. This is a tragedy on many dimensions and for us, especially for our people in both countries. As we've all seen, governments in the European Union, the United States, Switzerland and other countries swiftly enacted far-reaching sanctions on new investment and export controls on goods, supplies and technologies to Russia. In compliance with sanctions and consistent with our strategy for profitable international growth, we announced that we would begin steps toward a wind-down of our Russian operations, and we remain active in that process. Russia accounts for about 2% of our business. Sanctions and export compliance impact everyone in the oilfield and operations and supply chains in Russia are, at best, challenged. The situation is far too early and evolving to say more. Moving on to our macro outlook, we expect oil and gas demand will grow over the near and medium-term, driven by economic expansion, energy security concerns and population growth. At the same time, supply remains under structural threat of scarcity. While the war in Ukraine has created a short-term dislocation in commodity markets, the fundamental supply tightness existed before this geopolitical conflict. Current oil supply tightness and commodity price levels strengthen my confidence in the accelerating multiyear upcycle and very busy years ahead for Halliburton. In addition, I expect an important change in our customers behavior and priorities will provide structural support to oil prices throughout this upcycle. I believe supply dynamics have fundamentally changed due to investor return requirements, public ESG commitments and regulatory pressure, which make it more difficult for operators to commit to long-cycle hydrocarbon investments and instead drive investment flexibility through short-cycle barrels. The pursuit of increased investment flexibility leads operators to prioritize short-cycle projects, development over exploration, tiebacks versus new infrastructure and shale rather than deepwater. Clearly, there are important exceptions where successful long-term projects will be developed, but painting with a broad brush I believe most investments will be directed primarily towards short-cycle activity in the near and medium-term. The result of this focus is an industry-wide increase in the level of investment flexibility for operators and the subsequent support to commodity prices. With short-cycle barrels, companies make investment decisions annually and can respond more quickly to commodity price signals. As a result, when investment stops, production at a minimum doesn't grow. And in the case with unconventionals, it quickly declines. For example, when the pandemic drove the collapse of oil demand two years ago, U.S. shale companies swiftly reduced activity and production declined 2 million barrels in nine months. In contrast, long-cycle projects have two key elements : a long-time horizon and large upfront capital investment. Once these projects begin, investment continues and production cannot quickly respond to price signals. This tends to result in market oversupply. The pivot to short-cycle barrels creates the opposite effect, a perpetual threat of undersupply that is supportive to commodity price. I believe this pivot to short-cycle barrels is great for Halliburton and sets up fantastic conditions for us to outperform. Short-cycle activity results in higher relative capital spend by operators aimed directly at the wellbore for services Halliburton provides as opposed to infrastructure investments required for long-cycle projects. Our strong technology portfolio and market footprint match this activity globally. Halliburton works, innovates, and invests where it matters most for our customers. And finally, Halliburton's value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers explicitly focuses on helping operators maximize returns and cash flow. This makes Halliburton uniquely relevant for this environment. Our five strategic priorities are clear and effective and will drive our behavior in this upcycle. First, we focus on profitable growth in our strong international franchise. Second, we maximize value and cash flow in North America. Third, we accelerate the deployment and integration of automation and digital technologies. Fourth, we drive increased capital efficiency in all parts of our business. And fifth, we actively participate in advancing a sustainable energy future. As demand for Halliburton services increases, both internationally and in North America, we will execute on our five strategic priorities to deliver industry-leading returns and strong free cash flow for our shareholders. As I look across the international markets, I continue to believe our customers' international spend will increase by mid-teens this year. Here are some leading indicators. First, we started with revenues in the first quarter much higher compared to the same period of last year. Second, our completion tool order book increased 50% year-on-year in the first quarter, which represents work generally delivered within the current year. And third, we have a strong pipeline of new projects scheduled to start in the second half of this year, particularly in the Middle East. We expect international activity to gain momentum in the second quarter, led by the Middle East and Latin America and further accelerate in the second half of the year. More importantly, our strong first quarter Drilling and Evaluation division margins demonstrate our focus on profitable international growth. Beyond the shift to short-cycle barrels already discussed, we expect this international up cycle to be structurally different from prior cycles and Halliburton's international business is poised to benefit from it. Here's why. National oil companies and independents comprise a larger portion of the international customer set. As a result of divestitures in the last few years, many international assets now have new owners who require a more collaborative service provider to help unlock remaining reserves and maximize value. Halliburton's collaborative approach, broad technology portfolio, local expertise, and reliable execution help customers achieve their efficiency and production objectives. Halliburton's execution of our technology roadmap has completely transformed our competitiveness in Drilling and Evaluation. We enter this upcycle with the best product portfolio in our history and we see increased customer demand for our high-end technology and a recognition of its value. For example, Halliburton recently deployed our new Strata Examiner Wireline Imaging Service for multiple customers in Norway and Morocco. Strata Examiner helped operators acquire more accurate well data in oil and synthetic-based muds, better evaluate production potential and save rig time with log-down capability and increased logging speed. Another example is the latest addition to our logging while drilling suite, the StrataStar Azimuthal Resistivity Service for thin interbedded formations. Similar to our premium EarthStar service, the StrataStar combines high fidelity downhole sensors with powerful digital inversion capabilities. Multiple customers in the Middle East, Latin America, US and Canada use it for faster, more accurate reservoir characterization to precisely place wells in the most productive zones and maximize asset value. We also see a slight uptick in offshore exploration activity albeit from a historically low base. Halliburton's increased competitiveness in drilling and evaluation resulted in a doubling of our contract win rate in global exploration work over the last two years and we expect to benefit from any additional growth in this higher-margin market. Different from prior cycles, Halliburton's investments in specialty chemicals and artificial lift create unique growth opportunities as we expand the international footprint of these businesses. Last month, I attended the opening of our new chemical reaction plant in Saudi Arabia. Multiple years in the making, this world-class facility establishes our chemicals manufacturing footprint in the Eastern Hemisphere. It is our launch path for profitable growth in the specialty chemicals industry in the Middle East and beyond. This quarter, it will start manufacturing products for our production chemicals contract with a large IOC in Oman and chemicals for our own product service lines. Several years ago, I described digitalization as one of the defining trends in our industry for this decade. Today, digital innovations permeate all segments of the oilfield services market. At Halliburton, our strategy to drive digital and automation creates technological differentiation, contributes to higher international margins and drives internal efficiencies and cost savings. Here are some examples. On an integrated drilling project in Southeast Asia, Halliburton deployed Well Construction 4.0, our approach to digital transformation of well construction. It improved the rate of penetration by about 40% on initial wells and reduced rig site personnel by 21%. On an integrated project in the Middle East, we combine data science, smart bits drilling automation and project management services for a more than 40% reduction in average well delivery time. We also deploy our digital solutions to advance a sustainable energy future. In the first quarter, Energean hired Halliburton to assess the carbon storage potential of the Prinos Basin in Greece, who will use our DecisionSpace 365 cloud applications to perform long-term ploom modeling, characterize the storage complex and create a conceptual development plan with performance modeling. We expect to deliver steady, profitable growth in the international markets for the rest of this year. Increased activity and equipment tightness continued to sharpen our pricing discussions with customers. Pricing is increasing on current contract extensions. In the first quarter, the percentage of contract extensions exercised almost doubled compared to the same period last year, as operators generally prefer to extend existing contracts rather than bid work in an inflationary market. Pricing is also increasing on new work. Turning to North America. We see market tightness across all service segments. In the first quarter, average US rig count increased 14% sequentially and is up 62% year-on-year. Additionally, frac activity surged in March after winter weather and supply chain disruptions occurred earlier in the quarter. Halliburton's hydraulic fracturing fleet remains sold out and the overall market appears all, but sold out for the second half of the year. The market today presents several positive elements, previously absent in North America, and they give me confidence in the continued strength of this market over the coming years.  First, in the largest service segment in North America, the hydraulic fracturing market structure has improved. Today, the largest four pressure pumping companies account for about two-thirds of the market. Second, I believe that poor service industry returns over many years in North America, ultimately resulted in a closed-loop capital system because access to meaningful outside capital, doesn't exist today, market participants must generate their own cash in order to reinvest and grow their businesses. Broad-based profitability improvements are required to fund growth, not just what appears to be good economics on a single incremental fleet. Finally, I see greater differentiation in hydraulic fracturing equipment types. In prior cycles, fleets were relatively the same. Today, all equipment is not created equal. Significant operational, environmental and pricing differences exist ranging from electric fleets at the top; dual fuel and Tier 4 diesel in the middle; and finally, Tier 2 diesel equipment at the bottom. We have a terrific fleet composition. Halliburton is the leader in low emissions frac equipment.  Our Zeus eFleets have committed contracts, earn attractive returns and deliver improved performance. Another technology that sets Halliburton apart from the rest of the hydraulic fracturing market is our SmartFleet Intelligent Fracturing System. Customers are adopting this groundbreaking technology and it has moved from pilot to campaign mode. We are deploying it for multiple operators across different basins and expect a six-fold increase in the number of stages completed with SmartFleet this year. Tightness in North America is not just in hydraulic fracturing equipment. It exists across the whole oil and gas value chain, in spare parts, engines, electronics and many other inputs that cost more and are sometimes, not immediately available. While, we generally pass these increased costs on to operators, we also have effective solutions that minimize this operational impact and provide reliable execution for our customers.  For example, our sophisticated supply chain organization responded by sourcing sand from Wisconsin when local mines were down in the Permian. In trucking, our collaboration with Vorto provides us with real-time information on the market clearing price for drivers and allows us to manage inflation and significantly reduce logistics-related nonproductive time. Years of low pricing and low returns impacted the North American oilfield services sector and the larger supply chain that supports our industry. Sustainably improved pricing is required to avoid future supply chain disruptions and to invest in the equipment, people and technology necessary to deliver production growth. I believe our customers understand this. Against this backdrop, we see a long runway for ongoing net pricing improvement across all of our product service lines. In this recovery, Halliburton is focused on maximizing value in North America. For us, this is a margin cycle, not a build cycle.  Last quarter, I shared with you my view that North America customer spending would grow more than 25% year-on-year. Today, as I look at a combination of customer activity and inflation, my outlook has improved, and I now expect North America spending to increase by over 35% this year. With respect to activity, over 60% of the US land rig count sits with private companies and they keep growing, while public E&Ps remain committed to their activity plans. Activity and demand for our services are increasing, both internationally and in North America. With our unique value proposition, clearly defined strategic priorities and global presence, I expect Halliburton will deliver profitable growth, solid free cash flow and industry-leading returns and outperform as this upcycle accelerates. Now I will turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our first quarter financial results. Lance? Lance Loeffler : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a summary of our first quarter results, compared to the first quarter of 2021. Total company revenue for the quarter was $4.3 billion, an increase of 24%. Adjusted operating income was $533 million, or a 44% increase compared to the operating income of $370 million in the first quarter of 2021. These results were primarily driven by increased activity across all regions and improved pricing in North America. In the first quarter, we recorded pre-tax charges of $64 million. Of these, impairments and other charges totaled $22 million, including $16 million of receivables related to the write-off of all of our assets in Ukraine. The remainder of the charges totaled $42 million and was related to the redemption premium and unamortized expenses associated with the early retirement of $600 million of our 2025 senior notes. Now let me discuss our division results in more detail. Starting with our Completion and Production division, revenue was $2.4 billion, an increase of 26%, while operating income was $296 million or an increase of 17%. These results were primarily driven by increased pressure pumping services and artificial lift activity in the Western Hemisphere, higher completion tool sales throughout the Western Hemisphere in the Middle East, increased cementing activity in Africa and Middle East Asia, and improved well intervention services in North America land and the Eastern Hemisphere. These improvements were partially offset by lower activity across multiple product service lines in Europe and lower completion tool sales throughout Asia. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $1.9 billion, an increase of 22%, while operating income was $294 million or a 72% increase. These results were due to increased drilling related services globally; improved wireline activity in North America land, Latin America and the Middle East; increased testing services internationally; and higher project management activity in Latin America, India and Oman. Partially offsetting these increases were lower project management activity in Iraq as well as lower fluid services in the Caribbean, Brunei and Mozambique. Moving on to our geographic results. In North America, revenue increased 37%. This increase was primarily driven by improved pressure pumping activity and drilling related services in North America land, higher stimulation, artificial lift and drilling related activity in Canada and higher completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico. These increases were partially offset by reduced fluid services in the Gulf of Mexico. Turning to Latin America. Revenue increased 22% due to improved activity across multiple product service lines in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico; increased well construction services in Colombia; higher completion tool sales in Guyana; improved project management activity in Ecuador and Colombia; increased testing services and wireline activity across the region; and increased artificial lift activity in Ecuador. Partially offsetting these increases were reduced fluid services in the Caribbean and lower project management and stimulation activity in Mexico. In Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue increased 7%. This improvement was primarily driven by higher activity across multiple product service lines in Egypt, increased drilling-related activity in Azerbaijan, increased well intervention and testing services across the region, improved well construction services in West Africa, and higher completion tool sales and cementing activity in Angola. These increases were partially offset by reduced activity across multiple product service lines in the United Kingdom, reduced well construction services and completion tool sales in Norway and decreased fluid services in Mozambique. In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue increased 17%, primarily resulting from improved well construction services in Saudi Arabia and Oman, increased wireline activity and completion tool sales in the Middle East, and increased testing services across the region. These increases were partially offset by reduced project management activity in Iraq, lower completion tool sales throughout Asia, decreased fluid services in Brunei and lower stimulation activity in Bangladesh. Our corporate and other expense for the quarter totaled $57 million, and I expect that to serve as a good quarterly run rate for the remainder of the year. Net interest expense for the quarter was $107 million. I expect this level of interest expense to drift slightly lower in the second quarter as a result of a full quarter impact of our reduced debt balance. Our normalized effective tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 21%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our second quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 24%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $189 million. Our expected CapEx spend for the full year remains at approximately $1 billion, and we anticipate that our remaining capital expenditures will increase quarter-over-quarter into the end of the year. Our first quarter cash flow from operations and free cash flow was a use of cash of $50 million and $183 million, respectively. These results were primarily driven by investment in working capital, consistent with our strong activity growth. As is typical for our business in an upcycle, we expect our cash flow to be back-end loaded for the year. We still expect to generate strong free cash flow for the remainder of 2022. Finally, turning to our near-term operational outlook, let me provide you with some comments on how we see the second quarter unfolding. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect the seasonal revenue decline in software sales to be offset by further improvements in global drilling activity. Therefore, second quarter revenue is anticipated to grow low- to mid single-digits. As a result of the falloff of software sales, we expect D&E margins to decline 125 to 175 basis points. In the Completions and Production division, activity is accelerating globally and scarcity will drive pricing in North America in the second quarter. As such, we expect second quarter revenue to grow in the mid-teens and margins to improve 350 to 400 basis points. I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff? Jeff Miller : Thanks, Lance. Let me summarize what we've talked about today. We believe that this accelerating multi-year upcycle is different and more sustainable than prior cycles due to operators' focus on short-cycle barrels. Halliburton's strategic priorities are clear and effective and drive outperformance. Our technology portfolio and market presence mean that we are poised for profitable growth in the international markets. In the tight North America market, we remain focused on maximizing value and improving returns. And finally, I expect Halliburton to continue to deliver profitable growth, strong free cash flow and industry-leading returns in this up cycle. And now, let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is open. David Anderson : Hi. Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Miller : Good morning, Dave. David Anderson : Your sales force in the U.S. has been playing defense the past five or six years, returns of software, but now your customers are actually reaping record cash flows basically on the back of low service cost. And as you said, equipment is essentially sold out in the U.S., activity is ramping up, oil's at 100, fundamentals are pretty tight. I'm not sure if I've ever seen a better environment to push pricing. So I was wondering if you could talk about this process. What are you telling your sales force now in terms of pricing? And more importantly, what's the pushback from E&P? I understand the sense of sticker shock, but the situation is only going to get worse a year from today. I don't see capacity being built, E&P costs are only going in one direction. If you could kind of frame your -- frame the whole pricing debate for me, I'd appreciate that. Thank you. Jeff Miller : Yes. Yes, I will do that. Look, I think the most important -- I mean, obviously, pushing price all of the time, so guidance to the sales force is literally -- this is the amount of equipment, we expect it to earn more. And the sold-out conditions make that a lot clearer, certainly, for our folks and I think for our customers as well. And I think the other key here is, though, it's a more iterative process and it continues to be iterative. By that, I mean, we've moved on price and we'll continue to move on prices. We work certainly this quarter, next quarter and through the year. And so, I expect to continue to move that direction with price. I think it is a bit of a sticker shock, because you're seeing inflation across the entire sector. So we've got inputs that are going up meaningfully. Our own costs are going up meaningfully, and we're outpacing those costs in terms of net pricing. And so, I would describe it, I think you're accurate. It's more around sticker shock. I described last quarter, we were moving around a little bit between customers as customers, sort of, felt around in the marketplace for what's out there, what's possible. And so, I think that, obviously, we plan to continue moving. David Anderson : So, Jeff, I recognize it's early to talk about 2023. A lot has changed over the last 90 days, though, especially kind of, if you think about kind of global hydrocarbon movement. I was wondering, is it fair to say that your top line expectations for next year have materially increased, particularly around the international outlook that you're talking about ramping up? And kind of -- and part of that is 35% incremental margins are sort of the baseline, I guess, if we talk about double-digit growth, but could that actually be closer to 40% or even 45% on how you see pricing particularly on that -- based on what we saw in the mid-2000s? So it doesn't seem like much of a stretch. Jeff Miller : Yes. Look, Dave, I'm really excited about the outlook. And what I don't want to do is get in the business of refining a two-year outlook every quarter. But clearly, every quarter trajectory changes. And I'm very excited about those changes. And I think everything we see, including what you described as energy security, sets up a busier North America, clearly and strong growth internationally. And what's key is we're seeing them both at the same time. And that's -- it's something we really haven't seen in a very long time and sets up very well for certainly us. David Anderson : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. James West : Hey, good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Lance. Jeff Miller : Hey, good morning, James. Lance Loeffler : Good morning, James. James West : So Jeff, you talked a lot about short-cycle barrels, which makes a ton of sense, given the situation the world's in now being short oil in a pretty significant way that, that would be the focus today. When do you think that, if it does, that the cycle turns into one of a more balanced mix of short-cycle barrels and some longer-cycle barrels, some of the more complex, maybe more offshore or just maybe bigger development-type projects? Jeff Miller : Well, I think that what we see offshore generally today are tiebacks or development-type activity. But I think when I look further into the future, it's a combination of sort of ESG pressure is clearly one\u2026 James West : Right. Jeff Miller : \u2026capital returns, returns is another key element of that. And I don't think those are changing anytime soon. And so what I think we see is a marketplace that's going to have more optionality clearly for our clients. And in some respects, for us as well. I mean that's the approach we've taken sort of longer-term maximizing value in North America is a view that we are going to be where we need to be. But clearly, in places where we have optionality also, I think you see that in sort of CapEx spend. And I think that we've done -- everything I see, it just takes a long time to get those things underway and lots of money upfront, and I just don't really see over a longer period of time, like I don't know -- I want to give you a time, but a much longer period of time, could we see that creep back in? We probably could, but I don't see it in the viewfinder today. James West : Okay. Okay. That's fair enough. And then Jeff, we hear a lot about and we've been talking to a lot of the NOCs, particularly the ones in the Middle East and North Africa, who are reworking their budgets or have been over the last seven, eight weeks and using a little bit higher oil price estimation. And I'm curious what they're telling you and probably your competitors as well about how these budget increases will flow through? I mean these are, in some cases, fairly bureaucratic operators. And so their ability to change and to get capital into the field and get service companies lined up in rigs and frac spreads, et cetera, takes some time. So I know you're certainly more optimistic now than you were probably yesterday, a day before and six weeks ago, but are \u2013 do you think you see a lot of this in the back half, or are we really starting to talk about a 2023, 2024, 2025 story for a lot of these big NOCs? Jeff Miller : Look, I think we're going to see building activity sooner than that. I think it builds throughout the balance of 2022 and then probably continues to get legs in 2023, likely beyond. I think the key is that $100 oil, everything is busy. And people want to be busy, but the question is, can they be busy? And what we've seen is really seven years of underinvestment around the entire world spending about half of what we used to spend. And that's not something that's overcome in a day or a year or \u2013 that just takes time to \u2013 to get momentum. And I talked there are clearly all of Middle East, not the same. Clearly, there are NOCs that take a very long view and will build into growing production over time. But that's not the case everywhere. Lot of activity for us, but I think \u2013 and we'll see that sooner. But I don't think that you see the real long cycle-type work. It's just going to take quite a bit of time. James West : All right. All right. Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks, Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Your line is open. Chase Mulvehill : Hey, good morning, everybody. Lance Loeffler : Good morning, Chase. Jeff Miller : Hey, Chase. Chase Mulvehill : Hey, Jeff and hey, Lance. So I guess I wanted to follow-up on the margin guidance on the C&P side. Obviously, pretty strong sequential increase, I think you said 350 to 400 bps of margin improvement on the C&P side. So Lance, I don't know if you could step back and kind of walk us through some of the moving pieces. Obviously, 1Q was a little bit softer than we all thought. But just kind of walk us through price, so maybe some costs coming out or things just to help us kind of get confidence in that big sequential increase in margins on the C&P side? Lance Loeffler : Yeah. And you're right, Chase. A lot of noise in Q1, we've discussed before sort of the air pocket that exists as we move across the calendar year with completion tool sales and the profitability that goes with that. And certainly, the headwinds that we faced with sand supply early in the first quarter. But I think the real underpinning of the guidance is what we're beginning to see now on pricing in North America, and it really beginning to take hold. I mean, as Jeff said, we've been very careful about the equipment we've told you were sold out. So it's not like we're adding incremental equipment. This is really a pricing story for North America as it begins to turn. Chase Mulvehill : Okay. I guess, the follow-up is really on pricing. Obviously, pretty tight US market, you're really starting to gain momentum on the pricing side. And Lance, if we were to kind of squint really hard and look at leading-edge pricing, can we say that leading-edge pricing is starting to feel like its back to kind of 2018 levels, or are we kind of a long way from being able to kind of make that comparison just yet? Lance Loeffler : I think it's a little early, but I think that we're heading in that direction, and we'll get there, we'll eclipse that as we go throughout the course of the second and third quarter. Jeff Miller : Yeah. I think what's important, though, Chase, is that it's not the marginal fleet at the front edge of the curve, it's really the entire business that needs to get the recovery. And I think that's what we're in the process of doing. So does the leading edge makes sense, yes. But the fact is, as I described in my comments, an incremental fleet is not really the decision point here, it's the recovery of the whole business in order to generate free cash flow. Lance Loeffler : And improved returns. Jeff Miller : Yes. Chase Mulvehill : Great. Makes sense. I\u2019ll turn it back over. Operator : Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Neil Mehta : Good morning, team. Jeff, if I heard you right, you talked about North America growing 35% in terms of CapEx this year versus your previous estimate of 25%. Can you talk a little bit about what gives you confidence around that view? Is the composition of that more of the privates, or do you actually see it showing up in public E&Ps? And is that activity-driven, or is it inflation-driven? Any color around the margin because that's a material increase in your macro expectations. Jeff Miller : Well, a lot of that inflation that we see. It's -- and obviously, there's been a lot of inflation if we just look at the cost of inputs separate from our own, we've seen inputs ranging and cost increases from 20% to 100%, depending on what the item is. And so that weighs on it. Rig counts up 45% if we were to stop today, frac crews are up 20% if we were to stop today and the cost of each of those are more. And so look, I think really what we're seeing is public companies will stick -- are sticking with activity outlook. It's not necessarily increasing activity. And then with privates, we continue to see more activity and they keep growing. And so I think that operators all have different strategies and are very, very sharp around this. And so I expect that they will manage their business the way they plan to manage it, but there's just no question that when I see inflation and activity and clearly privates, to make clear, the private growth is an important part of that outlook. We just -- my view is that we've moved up from where we were a quarter ago. Neil Mehta : And Jeff, we clearly build in the rig count here and we're seeing an intention for to come into 2023 a little bit hotter from a production standpoint. But when we talk to producers, the constraint continues to be around labor and pressure pumping equipment. Do you see new capacity being added into the market by your competitors? And ultimately, will that be a constraint on the US production profile over the next couple of years? Jeff Miller : Yes. I think it will be a constraint. I'm going to go back to my earlier remarks about a closed-loop system and terms of generating cash in order to build equipment and there\u2019s a lot of equipment repair that needs to still happen or replacement in the marketplace. So I think that will be a constraint, labor and certainly equipment. And that's one of the reasons we take a very long view of fleet health, and we've got one of the healthiest fleets in the marketplace. But inside of our capital budget, we're always replacing aging equipment, and we're looking ahead today to 2023 and 2024 in terms of what that fleet composition needs to look like. So we're unique in that regard in terms of where we sit. But I do think that we don't -- I don't see capacity and I don't see meaningful capital to support any kind of build cycle at this point. Reality is this industry is still in recovery mode. David Anderson : Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is open. Scott Gruber : Yes, good morning. I just want to come back to the C&P margin outlook, especially given what's happening in the marketplace here with your improvement in frac pricing. When I look at the margins and the incrementals, obviously a lot of noise in 1Q, which you've talked about, but when I look at margins embedded in your guide versus the second half of last year, that the incremental still look pretty modest. But going forward, obviously, a building completion tool backlog, frac prices improving, but obviously, pretty stout inflation coming through the system. How should we think about those factors impacting C&P incrementals in the second half? Can we see incrementals rise into the 40s, although inflation constrained those incrementals kind of in the 30s? How should we think about it? Jeff Miller : Yes. Well, if we look at the Q2, I mean, the way you described it, everything we're doing is driving better margins in C&P, whether it's the operating leverage in the business, moving on price, equipment is tight. I think the Q2 guide is -- puts us in that sort of range. Yes, there's a lot of inflation on other inputs to the business that we are recovering, but even recovering the cost of those other inputs will have a bit of a dilutive impact on overall margins, but that doesn't change the recovery for us and the speed and the momentum of that recovery. And so I feel very good about where we're going and expect incrementals to be at the high end of what a range would be as we move through this process. Scott Gruber : Got it. Got it. And one of the concerns we've heard just on the capturing the next round of pricing in frac is just around timing. Your pricing leverage is improving. But I guess the question is, when do you see the next round really hitting? Is that kind of in 2Q, 3Q, or do we have to wait until kind of late in the year in the next budget season to really see a -- the next big step-up? How quickly does the next round of pricing in frac [indiscernible]? Jeff Miller : Yes. Yes, look -- crazy to get into the strategy for different customers and where we are. But obviously, this is an iterative process, meaning it's not something we wait until next year to do again. It's something that we are doing sort of in real time on a very regular basis. And so I expect -- we're in a $100 oil environment here. And this is part of the cost of delivering $100 oil. And so, a healthy recovering industry, we will continue to iterate on price as we move through the year, not planning for next year. Scott Gruber : Got it. Understood. Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from Ian Macpherson with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Ian Macpherson : Good morning team. The situation in Russia has shifted the paradigm not only for crude, obviously, but also natural gas and coal, both of which land on the shoulders of natural gas everywhere else. So, we've seen that strip move radically recently. What do you think the customer response will be from US and international producers of natural gas with regard to activity response to what might be a structural higher strip just like crude that maybe hasn't shown up yet in the fundamentals of your business through April? Jeff Miller : Yes. Look, I think, Ian, that has to strengthen certainly in terms of activity, and I expect we'll see that in the important gas-producing countries internationally, we will see more of that activity and even likely in the US. But the fact is, there still are some important constraints in place around pipeline capacity and whatnot that is serving to keep some of that market constrained today. But look, our business in the gas basins is improving and is busy and really not too dissimilar from kind of the demand response or the activity response that we see from oil. Ian Macpherson : Okay. And then, Jeff, just going back to the outlook on C&P margins. You -- obviously, there was significant weather and sand bottlenecks that distorted Q1 and you have a healthy recovery guided for Q2. But does your margin guidance for Q2 for C&P embed an assumption that the sand problem is sort of contained fully now, or do you -- or is that an area for remaining incremental recovery of margins from enduring bottleneck on sand as you've guided Q2 later in the year? Jeff Miller : No, I think the sand is largely behind us. That was a good example of underinvestment in supply chain. And as it was turned back on, it had a lot of maintenance, lack of maintenance thereof, and we even participated with some of our vendors to help them get things back online and I believe that's largely behind us. Look, I think the important point here is this trend is moving up. We're going to see all sorts of things, but our guide accounts for sort of all of the things that we see. And I think that we are just in this place where we're going to continue seeing improvement sort of over whatever the labor bottlenecks happen to be, those are going to all be overcome consistently as we move through year and really beyond. I mean I think that we'll continue to power through all of that and continue to see solid incremental growth at margins. Ian Macpherson : Super. Thanks Jeff. Jeff Miller : Yes, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Connor Lynagh : Yes. Thank you. I know it's a bit early to say precisely, but just returning to the topic of international pricing. Do you see meaningful constraints in either your available equipment in select markets or your availability of labor, or is that more of a US issue at this point? Jeff Miller : Look, I think a lot of the same tightness discussion that we talk about in the US is similar internationally. It comes in smaller pockets generally because it's 70 countries as opposed to one. But we're seeing more tightness in tools, clearly in people, and I think that's what's driving extensions today. I described the increase in the number of extensions we are seeing at higher prices. That's a great sign. But that's really predicated on tightening markets and the importance of having services available. Equipment is getting tighter. New work is pricing better. It moves more slowly than the US, so it may be a little less pronounced, but I expect that, that continues to improve. The large tenders remain competitive, but the fact is they're soaking up noticeable equipment. And in fact, some of that tightness in the marketplace is creating opportunity for Halliburton.  There are a number of situations where, because of our supply chain and access to raw materials and products, we were able to supply when others could not. And so, I think that's a real -- that's the evidence that, that market is getting tighter. When we get a third call from a customer says, hey, do you have anything' and we're able to supply it, that's an indicator that the market is getting tighter. Connor Lynagh : Got it. That's helpful color. Just on the supply chain side of things, there's obviously been a lot changing in the world over the last month or two here. Have you had any sort of hot spots that you're monitoring? Are there any areas that, we should think about being -- something we should be watching as you ramp activity through the back half of the year here? Jeff Miller : No, I don't think so. I mean I think what we're going to just see is the lengthening of delivery times. Things take longer to deliver, and therefore, planning matters more than ever. Obviously planning on our part, but also planning on the parts of our customers. And again, it is creating opportunity for us. And I think along the way, the key here is, we can't and won't subsidize operators in this process. So, we've been very transparent in terms of the cost to acquire things, the timing to acquire things. And I think that, again, our supply chain organization is very sophisticated and it outperforms. And so, I put Halliburton right at the top of that when it comes to solving those kinds of shortages, bottlenecks, whatever it may be. Connor Lynagh : Got it. Thank you very much. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Your line is open. Stephen Gengaro : Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. Jeff Miller : Good morning, Stephen. Stephen Gengaro : Two things for me. Just to start with, with the world evolving and you mentioned kind of the pull on short-cycle barrels, how do you think about CapEx? How do you think about investing in assets which have 5-year-plus lives in an environment where things have changed so dramatically? Jeff Miller : Well, we look at that returns on that equipment inside the time that we know it will work. And so, it much of that at all. Anything that we're doing, we've got line of sight to not only the initial project, but its full cycle return, and expect that to get returned in the life of that contract. I'd use eFleets as an example of that, where our view is, they have to make a return on capital and a return of capital inside of the time it goes -- its initial contract. And we view a lot of things that way. And so, I think just as operators sort of retain flexibility \u2013 budget flexibility around what they choose to do, we're doing the same.  And that's what allows us really in my view, to confidently drive profitable growth internationally, which D&E margins are an example of that, and then also maximize value in North America, which is our approach to North America is demonstrating that also. And so I really like our strategy very much, and I think it's very consistent with the kind of market that we see unfolding. Stephen Gengaro : Thanks. And I guess the follow-up, just when you think about -- and you mentioned the concentration of frac equipment in the hands of just a few operators now and you've seen consolidation. Have you seen behavioral change from -- in general, just from all the players in the market? Do you think it's just a function of the market being sold out? Do you think other -- your competitors are truly acting better when it comes to pricing? Jeff Miller : Look, I can't comment there. I mean, what I see is an industry broadly that has underperformed for a long time. And I know in our own case, for Halliburton, in order to reinvest in even replacement equipment, we need fundamentals that are better and returns that are higher in order to generate the cash back to my point around maximizing value in North America. We're only going to do that if the investment is produced by the equipment that is working in the marketplace. And so independent of what others are doing, that's what we are doing. And when I look across the marketplace, I see a whole industry that has largely suffered the same thing. And so that's just pure economics at work there. Stephen Gengaro : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks. Jeff Miller : Yeah. Thank you, Michelle. Look, before we end the call, let me just close with these comments. I am confident in my outlook on the strength of this market upcycle. And I expect Halliburton will deliver profitable growth, strong free cash flow and industry-leading returns as this upcycle accelerates. The pivot to short-cycle barrels only confirms this upcycle staying power. Look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Michelle, let's close out the call. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining, and have a wonderful day.",

Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to David Coleman, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. David Coleman : Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton second quarter 2022 conference call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being webcast, and a recorded version will be available on Halliburton\u2019s website following the conclusion of this call. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President, and CEO; and Eric Carre, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton\u2019s views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton\u2019s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our second quarter earnings release and can also be found in the Quarterly Results and Presentation section of our website. After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow time for others who may be in the queue. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. This was an excellent quarter. Our financial performance shows that our strategy is working and driving value. Let's get right to the highlights. Total company revenue increased 18% sequentially as both North America and international activity continued to improve in unison. Adjusted operating income grew 35% with strong margin performance in both divisions. Our Completion and Production division revenue increased 24% driven by robust completions activity in North America and international markets. C&P delivered operating margin of 17% in the second quarter, the first time it reached this level since 2014. Our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue grew 12%. Operating margin of 13% was down sequentially as expected due to the seasonal drop-off in software sales but increased 270 basis points year-on-year. This gives us confidence in the strengthening margin profile of our D&E business. North America revenue grew 26% as both drilling and completions activity marched higher throughout the second quarter. Strong net pricing gains across all product service lines supported sequential margin expansion. International revenue grew 12% sequentially with activity accelerating in all international regions, particularly Latin America and the Middle East. Finally, we recorded a historic best operational performance as measured by nonproductive time for the first six months of this year. I am pleased with the strong performance Halliburton delivered in the first half of this year, and I thank all Halliburton employees for their hard work, contribution to these outstanding results and dedication to superior service quality. Before we discuss our execution in the international and North America markets, let me address recent market volatility. In the second quarter, central banks took actions and an attempt to control inflation, raising concerns about a potential economic slowdown. Despite this near-term volatility, I believe the oil and gas market fundamentals still strongly support a multiyear energy upcycle. From a demand perspective, oil and gas remains a critical component of long-term economic growth. Post pandemic economic expansion, energy security requirements and population growth will continue to drive demand. Today, oil and gas supply is tight, despite an environment muted by ongoing China lockdowns and jet fuel demand below historical norms. Meaningful supply solutions will take time, OPEC spare capacity is at historical lows, the strategic petroleum reserve release is unsustainable, and the risk to Russia supply remains high. On the industry side, despite high commodity prices, operators remain disciplined because of investor return requirements, public ESG commitments and regulatory pressure. In response, service companies invested for returns and did not overbuild. In short, this cycle has been nothing like prior cycles. This means, any economic slowdown will not solve the structural oil undersupply problem. At Halliburton, the steps we took to improve operating leverage, lower capital intensity and strengthen our balance sheet best equip us to outperform under any market conditions. Here's why we believe that. First, we used the pandemic to redesign the cost profile of our business. We structurally removed over $1 billion of costs, the most aggressive cost reductions in our history. This gives us strong and sustainable operating leverage that we see today in meaningful year-on-year margin expansion in both divisions. Second, we fundamentally lowered the capital intensity of our business and set our CapEx target at 5% to 6% of revenue compared to 10% to 11% in the prior upcycle. We advanced our technology so that new generations of equipment would have higher capital velocity. This lower capital profile is key to our strong free cash flow generation. Finally, we prioritize strengthening our balance sheet and retired $1.8 billion of debt since the beginning of 2020. This reduced our cash interest expense and put us within striking distance of our leverage targets. Now, let's turn to our second quarter performance and expectations for the rest of 2022. With energy security firmly in focus, the diversification of supply sources is the central theme in the international markets. Never has energy security been a bigger issue to governments and people all over the world. However, political agendas and years of underinvestment in many markets make it harder to address this critical requirement. As I look across the international markets, our customer spend remains on track to increase by mid-teens this year, with the Middle East and Latin America expected to grow the most on a full year basis. New project announcements across the world, including in the Eastern Mediterranean, Australia and West Africa, give us confidence in continued activity acceleration in 2023 and beyond. Longer term, we believe the international markets will experience multiple years of growth. Halliburton's international business is better prepared to benefit from the upcycle than ever before. We have a strong portfolio of well construction and completion product service lines. We greatly increased our drilling competitiveness. We are present in all the markets that matter and we have unique growth opportunities in the production space. Let me elaborate. The activity mix in this upcycle is different from prior cycles. Today, operators focus more on developing known resources and less on long-term exploration programs. This means drilling more wellbores. The products and services customers require for drilling more wellbores benefit Halliburton. For example, in one of the largest international offshore markets, over 60% of a typical well service cost goes to drilling fluids, cementing and completion hardware. This means more operators spend on services where Halliburton has a leading position. Baroid, our drilling and completion fluids business entered this cycle as the leading fluids provider globally. During the downturn, we brought the chemical supply chain closer to our international customers and localized our workforce. This improved our cost competitiveness and the margins. We introduced new advanced chemistries and now run fluid systems that make better wellbores and create value for our customers and Halliburton through higher margins and lower inventory requirements. Halliburton was founded as a cementing company over 100 years ago. And since then, we never stopped leading and innovating in cementing. Every well in the world, be it a mature producer in the Middle East or a deepwater wellbore in Brazil, must be cemented. The secret to our enduring success in cementing is our capacity and drive to innovate and develop new methods to design, deliver and validate sustainable well barriers. Our latest innovation is the Cognitive Automated Cementing Platform, which allows us to deliver cement jobs autonomously. With limited human direction and intervention, a standard offshore cementing operation typically requires over 300 commands. The Cognitive platform consolidates and automates this to only five mouse clicks by an onshore operator. We already completed over 70 cementing jobs using the system in the North Sea, delivering safer operations, improved service quality and cost efficiency. Well completion tools constitute a larger portion of well services spend internationally than in North America, and they are high tech and high value-add products and services. Halliburton is a global leader in completions technology, especially in advanced completions that include sand control solutions, multilateral wells and intelligent completions. With over 20 years of multilateral installation experience globally, Halliburton is the market leader in multilaterals, a key technical component in many development wells. They help operators increase reservoir drainage in mature fields, address limited subsea infrastructure and reduce environmental impact. Over the past few years, we've strengthened our completion tools product service line in Singapore, which is closer to our international customer base and supply chain sources. With our world-class manufacturing facilities, strong local technical support and continuous innovation, Halliburton completion tools position us to outperform in the international upcycle. Another key well construction service is directional drilling. Over the last five years, we made a concerted effort to improve our drilling technology competitiveness. Our strong D&E margin performance this year demonstrates that our investment is paying off and we expect it to continue as international drilling activity ramps up. Our iCruise intelligent drilling system delivers excellent results. It now constitutes about half of our rotary steerable fleet and has been a key contributor to year-over-year margin improvements, which reflects its higher asset velocity compared to prior generation tools. Last month, for a Middle East customer, Halliburton achieved a new world record, the longest well ever drilled at 50,000 feet measured depth. This extended reach well redefine what's possible with advanced drilling technology. In many regions, as customers face increasing operational challenges and urgency to increase production, I expect that the adoption of integrated contracts will continue to grow. Today, about 20% of our international revenue comes from integrated projects, and this percentage is considerably higher in some markets like Norway, Mexico and Iraq. Halliburton's strong project management capabilities and a proven track record, compress the learning curve and drive cost savings and efficiencies for both us and our customers. The future is without a doubt, more collaborative. Customers across the world increasingly call on Halliburton for collaboration and that perfectly fits with our value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value. Geographic presence is very important in the international markets, and today, we are present everywhere that matters, which is different from prior cycles. We expect to benefit from our established footprint, geographic presence and customer and supplier relationships as international markets grow. Finally, I want to highlight the international growth opportunity Halliburton has in artificial lift and specialty chemicals, which is new for this upcycle. This month, we completed our first year of operations on our electric submersible pump contract in Kuwait. We have already installed almost 200 ESPs, built an artificial lift service facility in country and delivered excellent performance for KOC. We also have successful installations in Oman and have ongoing ESP trials in Saudi Arabia. Upon completion of trials at the end of the year, we expect prequalification to participate in Saudi Aramco's future artificial lift tenders. Latin America is another successful market for our artificial lift business, where we operate in all significant land markets and just installed our 500th ESP in Ecuador. Our new chemical reaction plant in Saudi Arabia mixed the first batch of chemicals last month and is on track to meet its ramp-up goals. This year, we expect the plant to manufacture products for our production chemicals contract with a large IOC in Oman and chemicals for our drilling fluids, specialty chemicals and hydraulic fracturing product service lines. Today, Halliburton is a much stronger international competitor and we expect to benefit more from this multiyear upcycle than ever before. This aligns perfectly with our strategy to deliver profitable international growth. Turning to North America. This market remains strong, steadily growing and all of it sold out. Our strategic priority is to maximize value in North America by focusing on cash flow and returns, not market share. The second quarter saw another step-up in both US land rig activity and stages completed. With the first quarter sand supply interruptions resolved, frac activity steadily increased throughout the quarter. As we look at the second half of 2022, Halliburton remains sold out. As for the overall market, I believe it will be all but sold out for the second half of the year due to service company discipline, long lead times for new fleets and supply chain bottlenecks for consumables. We expect public companies will steadily execute on their drilling and completion programs. Private E&Ps capitalized on available rigs and equipment in the first half of the year and will likely maintain a measured level of activity growth for the rest of the year. We continue to believe that North America operator spending growth will eclipse 35% this year. Our customer conversations have already pivoted to 2023 plans well in advance of the typical time frame. These conversations make it clear that equipment capacity for 2023 is tight. Today, we see a services market in North America that is almost unrecognizable from prior cycles or even a handful of years ago. I believe that the returns focus we now see in the services market is not a temporary phenomenon. The largest more publicly traded pressure pumping companies now account for about two-thirds of the market. This means that investors force discipline on the majority of the industry today. In addition, industry consolidation, structural changes to customer behavior and the requirement to self-fund capital investments all drive capital discipline. In short, it's the result of rational economic behavior and I believe that it is here to stay. Halliburton is well prepared to compete in this new paradigm in North America. We have the largest technology budget in the North American services industry and our advanced technologies deliver what matters to operators : efficiency, insight and emissions reduction. For example, today, our customers can reduce environmental impact with our proven Zeus electric frac offering and optimize completions performance by capturing downhole insight with our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing solution. We operate in every major oil and gas basin across the United States using the same design of equipment built by in-house manufacturing to our specifications. This one design approach greatly simplifies equipment maintenance and helps minimize the supply chain challenges for spares and equipment. Finally, we have global capabilities in managing supply chain and labor complexities that we believe give us a distinct competitive advantage over domestic service providers. To conclude on North America. I expect Halliburton to uniquely maximize value in the strong, steadily growing and all but sold-out market. Globally, supply chain and labor shortages are front and center for many industries as the post-pandemic recovery stressed both raw material supply and transportation logistics. I believe Halliburton manages these shortages better than competitors. Our global business development, supply chain and technology organizations closely monitor market trends and work to mitigate cost impacts through economies of scale and global procurement, technology modifications and efficient sourcing practices. For example, as chemical costs increase, we work with our customers to adjust our pricing for cost inflation. Operators appreciate that these price adjustments are required for us to continue delivering our services. Most customers expect and accept these adjustments. Halliburton's world-class technology organization gives us the ability to change formulations for certain products to avoid the most inflationary inputs. We have already implemented these design changes for some of our drilling fluids and completion tool elastomers. Finally, we have internal chemical manufacturing capabilities in the US and Saudi Arabia, which allow us to diversify supply, mitigate risk and better control input prices. In North America, we employ our global HR capabilities for managing commuter labor to hire out of basin and avoid labor shortage pressures in local markets. This allows us to secure talent from states outside of white hot labor markets in traditional oil and gas basins. At the same time, our voluntary attrition numbers remained stable, both globally and the US. This demonstrates that once we attract the right talent, we provide them with the right incentives and growth opportunities. Turning now to pricing dynamics that we see playing out in North America and internationally. As I stated before, this is a margin cycle, not a build cycle. In North America, net pricing improvements drove our strong C&P margin expansion in the second quarter, and I expect pricing gains to continue. Here's why. Existing active equipment and experienced crews are in high demand and will continue to be highly sought after to efficiently execute programs in the second half of this year and into 2023. The market remains all, but sold out. Supply chain bottlenecks even for diesel fleets make it almost impossible to add incremental capacity this year. Halliburton has the additional advantage that our fleet primarily competes at the higher end of the pricing spectrum. Our portfolio of low emissions equipment commands premium prices and our customers see value in the efficiency and emissions profile we provide. Internationally, we see structural tightness in many product lines, particularly drilling and wireline. Increasing activity soaks up capacity market-wide. And recently, some customer request for additional equipment had to go unanswered. As equipment availability continues to tighten, we expect prices will increase further. Due to the long-term nature of international contracts, only about one-third of our work re-prices every year. This means that margin and pricing inflections internationally will always materialize at a slower pace than in North America. We see evidence of customer urgency indicated by customer preference to pursue direct negotiations for contract extensions. The efficiency gains over the last several years have all accrued directly to operators, and there is still a great deal of room in customer's economics for service providers to earn a fair and durable return. So it often goes unsaid, a robust and investable service industry is a key enabler of our customers' ability to grow and maintain production to address the world's energy needs. I'm thrilled with Halliburton's performance in the second quarter and our immediate and long-term opportunities. Our team is executing well on near-term tactical objectives and the long-term strategic priorities provide real tangible value for Halliburton and our shareholders. Halliburton's competitive position is unique among our peers. We have the scale and technology to benefit meaningfully and differentially from the international market expansion, and we are the leader in the strong, steadily growing and all but sold out North American market. I could not be more excited about the future of Halliburton. Now I will turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our second quarter financial results. Eric? Eric Carre : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let me begin with a summary of our second quarter results, compared to the first quarter of 2022. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.1 billion and adjusted operating income was $718 million, an increase of 18% and 35%, respectively. Higher equipment utilization and net pricing gains supported these strong results. In the second quarter, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $344 million as a result of our decision to exit Russia due to sanctions. Now let me take a moment to discuss our division results in more details. Starting with our Completion and Production division, revenue was $2.9 billion, an increase of 24% while operating income was $499 million, an increase of 69%. These results were driven by increased pressure pumping services in the Western Hemisphere; higher completion tool sales globally, increased artificial lift activity in North America land and Kuwait, and improved cementing activity in the Eastern Hemisphere. These improvements were partially offset by lower stimulation activity in Oman and decreased artificial lift activity in Latin America. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $2.2 billion, a 12% increase, while operating income was $286 million, a decrease of 3%. This revenue increase was due to higher fluid services and wireline activity globally, increased project management activity in Latin America and the Middle East, and increased drilling services in Latin America. Operating income decrease was driven by seasonally lower software sales globally and decreased drilling services in Brazil. Moving on to our geographic results. In North America, revenue grew 26%, primarily driven by increased pressure pumping services and artificial lift activity in North America land, increased fluid services, wireline activity, well intervention services and higher completion tool sales across the region and increased cementing activity in the Gulf of Mexico. These increases were partially offset by lower stimulation activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Turning to Latin America. Revenue increased 16% due to improved activity across multiple product service lines in Argentina and Colombia, increased stimulation and well construction services in Mexico, increased drilling related services in the Caribbean, improved stimulation activity in Brazil and higher project management activity in Ecuador. Partially offsetting these increases were decreased drilling related services in Brazil and lower artificial lift activity in Argentina and Ecuador. In Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue increased 6% resulting from higher activity across multiple product service lines in Angola and Eastern Mediterranean, improved cementing activity, pipeline services, wireline activity, and testing services across the region and increased through its services and completion tool sales in the UK. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the wind down of our business in Russia and decreased drilling services in Norway. In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue increased 14%, primarily resulting from higher activity across multiple product service lines in the Middle East, Australia and Brunei. These increases were partially offset by reduced stimulation activity in Oman. All regions experienced a seasonal decline in software sales. In the second quarter, our corporate and other expense was $67 million, which was higher than expected due to the timing of employee incentives. For the third quarter, we expect our corporate expense to be slightly lower. Net interest expense for the quarter was $101 million and should remain about flat for the third quarter. Other net expense for the quarter was $42 million, primarily related to currency losses driven by the strength of the US dollar. For the third quarter, we expect this expense to remain about flat. Our normalized effective tax rate for the second quarter came in at approximately 22%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our third quarter effective tax rate to be slightly higher. Capital expenditure for the quarter were $221 million and will steadily increase for the remainder of the year. For the full year, we expect our CapEx to remain at 5% to 6% of revenue. Turning to cash flow. We generated $376 million of cash from operation and $215 million of free cash flow during the second quarter. Working capital investments grew to support the 18% sequential revenue growth. As is typical for our business in an upcycle, we anticipate free cash flow for the year to be back-end loaded and expect to generate free cash flow at or above last year's level. Now let me turn to our near-term outlook. In the Completion and Production division, we expect third quarter revenue to grow in the mid-single digits and margins to improve 75 to 125 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect our third quarter revenue to grow in the low to middle single digits. As a result of activity improvements, we expect D&E margins to be flat to up 50 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thanks, Eric. To summarize our discussion today, we are still in the early innings of a multiyear upcycle. The oil supply and demand fundamentals remain constructive for both international and North America markets. The steps we took to improve operating leverage, lower capital intensity and strengthen our balance sheet set Halliburton up to outperform under any market conditions. Internationally, Halliburton is a much stronger competitor, and we expect to benefit more from this multiyear upcycle than ever before. This aligns perfectly with our strategy to deliver profitable international growth. In North America, I expect Halliburton to uniquely maximize value in the strong, steadily growing and all but sold out market. We will continue to execute on our strategic priorities and remain committed to driving profitable growth, margin expansion, strong free cash flow and returns for our shareholders as this multiyear upcycle unfolds. And now let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question coming from James West from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. James West : Hey, good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Eric. Jeff Miller : Good morning, James. Eric Carre : Good morning, James. James West : So Jeff, as you think about the cycle from here, we're clearly setting up for a pretty strong and healthy upcycle where the operating leverage is really in the early days of showing up. But how do you think about the next several quarters, maybe several years if you want to take it that far, playing out in terms of the cycle, there seems to be a growing -- at least from what I can tell, growing urgency from the customer base to bring production or accelerate activity levels from here. And so we could be in a position where you see growth that moves much higher than kind of the steady growth we've seen so far, but could be at a tipping point. Jeff Miller : James, yes, agree in terms of the outlook. In fact, what I see is a lot of duration in this cycle. I mean, obviously, it's been moving up, and I expect it continues to move up. But the reality is if operators can be busy, particularly international, they are. And the tightness around oil supply is not something that's resolved quickly after seven, eight years of underinvestment. And so while I'm excited about the inflection and the improvement in the upcycle that we see, I have to say I'm equally excited about the duration. This is multiples of years, I was a decade in the making. It's many years in the undoing in terms of producing. And so I think this is a fantastic time for operators and an even better time for Halliburton. James West : Right. Right. Okay. That makes sense. And then from a competitive standpoint, are you seeing the discipline that maybe we hadn't seen in prior years from your competitors, but it seems now like everybody kind of is on the same page as its returns, its margin. And so are you seeing the same kind of pricing discipline that I know you guys are exhibiting the market? Jeff Miller : Look, pricing is improving around the world. And it's a rational -- it's the allocation of assets and it's moving them to the highest returning opportunities. And that's not unique to Halliburton in terms of expectation of return. I mean, we clearly want to improve our returns and plan to do so. But that's part of this different cycle, different market dynamics in the sense that returns and return of cash matter to our shareholders. And the best way to do that is to not just improve utilization, but improved returns on every asset. And clearly, the approach we're taking and our whole strategy internationally is built around profitable growth, which is, I think, precisely what you saw this quarter and what you'll continue to see from Halliburton in the future. James West : All right. Okay. Got it. Thanks, guys. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our question. And our next question coming from the line of David Anderson from Barclays. Your line is open. David Anderson : Great. Thanks. Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Miller : Good morning, David. David Anderson : Good morning. So nice increase in the North America top line this quarter, well above the rig count, wondering if you could put this into context for us in terms of the customer base that was sort of the incremental driver here? Was it the privates or the public, I guess, is sort of the core question. Along those same lines, I was just wondering, if you could talk about your customer mix and how you're thinking about it. On the one hand, with all the equipment shortages, I would think you could push pricing further with the private. But on the other hand, of course, you get the \u2013 the more visibility, the larger E&P program. So I was just wondering if you could maybe talk about that optimal customer mix today? And does a potential for any recession come into consideration in terms of that mix. Jeff Miller : Yeah. Let me start with the first part of that question. The activity was really in both camps. We saw a lot of activity. Obviously, a lot of the interruptions in the first quarter were out of the way. And so we had a full utilization quarter, which was certainly a positive from an activity perspective, and that applied equally to privates and publics. Really from a pricing standpoint, important that, we're iteratively moving on pricing and I would argue that's again, consistent in both groups. And from a visibility standpoint, I think it's important to note, I mean, A, we love our customer mix today. I want to be clear. And it maybe slightly weighted towards publics, but that is really \u2013 the privates we work for are big privates. And there are some privates that are bigger than public out there in the marketplace and work for them. And they have terrific visibility as well. So I mean the privates, just like the publics, fully understand, A, that OPEC spare capacity is not there or they would be meeting their quotas. They have great visibility of the supply and demand for oil in our business. And that dialogue has been about 2023 capacity for Halliburton to provide either more equipment or more services, not recession. I can promise you that it's not the discussion, the discussion and what we see in our business is activity demand moving up. We see a tighter 2023 than we see in 2022. So all of these signals and in our business are extremely positive. David Anderson : Absolutely, I agree. And also I think also noteworthy how your margins are now back to 2014 levels. That's really impressive, I would say. A separate question, Jeff, on the Middle East, you highlighted a 14% increase in revenue this quarter a bunch of contracts are starting up. You mentioned project management that Kuwait ESP project is moving well. It sounds like there's more tenders to come. Question, are we already starting to see the ramp-up in the Middle East? Maybe you could just, kind of, give us your sense of what's going on in the ground in terms of mobilization and the pace of activity. I think you highlighted kind of service discipline over there in terms of pricing. So hopefully, that's looking pretty good. But maybe just tell us what's happening on the ground today? I know we've been waiting for this for a while. Jeff Miller : Look, I think we're still early innings of Middle East. And so more activity, yes; activity underway, yes. But in terms of supply chain or let's just think more broadly around equipment, rigs, et cetera, those don't come back to work instantaneously. And so I -- my view is there's a lot more demand for services in the Middle East certainly than we're seeing today. So I would say as equipment can be mobilized as projects get underway, I think there's a lot more of that to come. David Anderson : Good to hear. Thanks Jeff. Jeff Miller : Yeah. Thank you. David Coleman : Next question please. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan Chase. Your line is open. Arun Jayaram : Good morning Jeff. Jeff Miller : Good morning. Arun Jayaram : Jeff, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how is contracting philosophy in North America this cycle. Is it consistent with typical cycles, but I want to get your thoughts on that. You've been essentially sold out for some time now, and we're just trying to gauge the velocity of pricing gains, which could manifest in the second half of this year versus 2023 when a lot of your customers are armed with new budgets? Jeff Miller : Yeah. Look, I'd be crazy to get into all of those details on a call. But philosophically, I mean, our -- in practical -- in practice, I mean, prices are moving iteratively. And I think that's an important component of what we're seeing when market's tight like this. We ratably look at the best opportunity for assets and what that drives this approach to pricing, which is one that we've seen until now. And so as we look out into the future, in a market like this, we maintain optionality, but we also have very good customers with deep relationships. And because of that, there's a premium on equipment that is working and efficient, particularly in a market that looks like this. And so, look, our customers understand that a vibrant service industry is a critical component of their ability to deliver what they have to deliver. And so I think that as we look out through this year and really into next year, we ought to continue to see improvement in pricing. Arun Jayaram : Fair enough, Jeff. I wanted to talk a little bit about specialty chemicals and artificial lift. You've highlighted how this provides some unique growth opportunities for how the cycle -- I was wondering if you could maybe help us think about just at a high level, what are some revenue or growth opportunities for how -- from these two segments. Again, we're just trying to estimate what this could mean for your full cycle earnings power? Jeff Miller : Yes. I want to -- I'm going to -- it's a meaningful opportunity. I mean I think if you go look at total available market for artificial lift, for example, we have a leading position. Actually, some it's number one in the US today and we are just beginning internationally. We've got talked about the growth we've seen, but it is a drop in the bucket compared to what that total available market is out there for lift internationally. And of course, we're super pleased with the technology at Summit, and it's just a matter of growing that business internationally, which the examples I've given you are examples of us doing that. But I would say this is the -- there is the beginnings on what's possible. Arun Jayaram : Yes. Fair enough. Thanks a lot, Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Next question. Operator : One moment for our next question. And our next question coming from the line of Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Your line is open. One moment. Chase Mulvehill : Yes. Good morning. Real quick, just kind of a follow-up on the 2Q guide and maybe we'll just chalk it up to conservatism. But if we think about the top line, I think if you kind of blend things together from your segment guidance, it kind of implies a 4% or 5% sequential growth in top line. But if we kind of step back and think about expectations for North America and International, I would have expected both North America and international revenues to actually outpace that 4% to 5%. So just kind of help us connect the dots and maybe Russia is a little bit of a drag in 3Q, but just kind of help us connect the dots between North America and international relative to your guidance. Jeff Miller : Well, I think the first half outperformed. It's a strong year. So I still see us eclipsing 35%. That means more than 35%. The international outlook for us includes Russia dropping out in Q3. So the guide that we have given in the 3% to 5% and that range overcomes Russia, which is exactly what we thought would happen. We thought there would be outsized spending outside of Russia likely to compensate for that, and that's precisely what we're seeing. North America, I'd describe it as steadily growing. And I think that's what steadily growing looks pretty strong on the first half, and it continues to grow. I think that the market is very positive. We got to put a number on it, but it's certainly been strong until now, and this continued to really outperform consistently, so -- Chase Mulvehill : Okay. Makes sense. Jeff Miller : This is clearly not -- this is not a step back. This is a step forward in both hemispheres, both US and international. Chase Mulvehill : Yes, makes sense. I mean, you've got a history of beating expectations, so we'll just kind of leave it there. The follow-up here, if we think about leverage ratios, obviously, they're falling pretty quickly. Your outlook remains robust. It looks like maybe early next year, you might hit 1 times on a leverage ratio. So it puts you in a position to really kind of focus more on returning cash to shareholders really over the next, call it, 6 to 12 months. So could you talk to this a little bit and how you're thinking about buybacks versus dividends and just kind of overall frame kind of the shareholder -- the cash return to shareholder framework. Eric Carre : Yes. Let me take that one, Chase. It's Eric here. So I'll start by saying that the most important point here is that our priorities as a company have not changed. So maybe let me summarize how we think about this. So first, to your point, we'd like to continue to pay down more debt. Then we would like to continue to return more cash to shareholders. From that perspective, our buyers right now is toward increasing the base dividends but would like at some point in time to address dilution as well. And if you look at the progress that we've made, we've made significant progress actually towards these objectives since the beginning of 2020. We've retired $1.8 billion worth of debt, $600 million this year. If you look at what's ahead of us, we have about $1 billion coming up between 2023 and 2025. Once that is retired, we basically have a clean slate until 2030, which is going to give us great flexibility. The other point I would make is that in Q1 of this year, we did both. So we did retire that and we increased dividend about triple -- pretty close to triple the dividend. So these things don't necessarily need to be done sequentially. We can do them at the same time. And finally, I would say that we fully expect to continue to grow shareholder distribution as the upcycle accelerates. Yes. Chase Mulvehill : Okay. Perfect. I\u2019ll turn it back over. Thanks, Eric. Thanks, Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Neil Mehta : Yes. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you, team. First question is just the 400 basis point margin improvement target, clearly making progress towards it. Maybe just talk about your views on when you think you can get there and whether there's some upside skew given the commodity macro. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Look, our -- my long-term outlook is unchanged except that it's biased upwards. In fact, I'm more bullish than I was before. I want to be careful and not get in the business of trying to update that every quarter. But our outlook, my outlook on sort of the trajectory of the market today, the macro in terms of supply shortage, short oil in the world. And I think really importantly, not only is the price of the commodity, always important. Energy security has moved back central -- front and center for a lot of countries and continents. And so that's going to just put further support under my outlook in terms of being busy, the type of activity I described in terms of more wellbores. That's a really important point, meaning that making more barrels is going to look like a lot more development work, a lot more tie back kind of work, and I've described sort of a lot of that spend or right in areas where Halliburton leads, whether it's drilling fluids, cementing and completion tools and then the progress we've made in other parts of our business, I think sets up very well. So without trying to update that outlook, hopefully, I'll give you enough color that we feel really good about it. Neil Mehta : Yes. That's good color. And then the follow-up is on working capital and free cash flow, to your point. Free cash flow did come a little softer than we were expecting, but a lot of that is working capital, which is consistent with an upcycle. So just talk about the back half progression in free cash flow as you see it and anything that would need to keep them up. Eric Carre : Yeah. Good morning, Neil. It's Eric. So the headline is expect free cash flow to follow the typical upcycle profile. So, basically, very heavily loaded towards the second half of the year. And we feel very good about the outlook of the business. The working capital built in Q2 was really to support our growth. So our revenues went up 18%, about $800 million Q2 over Q1. But what was really good is that the efficiency of our working capital improved versus the prior cycle. So \u2013 and we have to do that while managing inflation, managing longer lead time in the supply chain. So we're very pleased with how our organization has managed the situation and the overall progress we're making. So as we get into H2, I think the situation will evolve, and we fully expect to deliver on the free cash flow targets despite the working capital headwinds we had in H1. Neil Mehta : Thank you, guys. David Coleman : Next question. Operator : One moment for our next question. And our next question is coming from the line of Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Your line is open. Stephen Gengaro : Thanks, and good morning, gentlemen. Two things for me. I think the first is, when you look at the domestic frac business, and you obviously, you talked about consolidation you guys have stuck to your plans on CapEx. Are you seeing much out there as far as the new builds in the industry? And maybe talk a little bit about lead times for new equipment at this point? Jeff Miller : Yeah. Thanks. The \u2013 A, the lead times are still quite long. I mean \u2013 and so I think probably a year to meaningfully do anything. But the market has changed. And so A, we haven't had any meaningful additions into this business at all in six years. So that's a long time. And if I think about our business, I mean, we're always replacing the aging part of our fleet. That's not adding capacity. That's just simply retiring equipment or equipment that's unable to operate or gets damaged in the process of working, which that happens, too. And so at some level, addressing attrition at the bottom end of the fleet is important. And that's one of the reasons \u2013 we do that. That's one of the reasons we have Halliburton one of the healthiest fleets in the industry. The other broad thing that's happening, I would say, is this conversion to lower emission, which again is not adding capacity, but I would see it as a conversion. But the supply chain issues I started with are very real. And I think given the consolidation in the industry, the sort of lack of capital broadly to invest, I think what you'll see \u2013 I think -- I'm just going to guess others view the fleet the way that I do. And I think that what that means is that, we won't see capacity adds. Stephen Gengaro : Thank you. And then when we think about \u2013 you mentioned the pricing dynamics that you've seen, obviously, things are strong. Has there been any pushback from the E&P side? I mean, I know they're always not trying to take a lot higher prices, but have you seen any material pushback, or just because it's so tight, it's been fairly easy discussions. Jeff Miller : It's always a discussion, respectfully. But I also think what underpins this is how important service industry is to delivering on what our operators need to do. And I think there's clearly a recognition of that. And so always a discussion, always some back and forth, but realistically, our operators require quality services, and that means fleets that are well-maintained, fleets that are -- attrition is dealt with. And better efficiency in our case, better technology. All of that's appreciated and realized that that has to make solid returns for it to remain vibrant. And I think that's what underpins those conversations. Stephen Gengaro : Great. Thank you. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Next question. Operator : One moment for your next question. Our next question coming from the line of Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Your line is open. Marc Bianchi : Thank you. Jeff, you mentioned you had been speaking to some customers about 2023. What kind of increases are they talking about for North America and International? Jeff Miller : Look, I think it's consistent with making returns, but up. So let's start with surety of supply. Internationally, it's probably more around ability to supply. I think that operators, particularly in the US, understand returns and shareholder returns, and so do we. And so I think we see a steady march up, but a healthy march up in the sense that as we described, a lot of duration to this cycle, which I think is much welcome by us and I think by our shareholders are going to benefit from that meaningfully because of the duration. So the -- you look at how we've improved the capital intensity of our business, our clients view it the same way. And I think that -- so what we're going to see is more activity, no question, because there's going to be demand for the commodity. But it's -- so it's more around could you add one or do you have an extra one and really a lot of that dialogue given lead times and commitments around our own capital. And I think broadly, the industry's commitment around capital as it comes down to what's the highest returning opportunity for that equipment is more of what that discussion goes like. Marc Bianchi : Okay. Thanks. And on D&E, do you think you can get back to first quarter margins this year? Jeff Miller : Yes. I mean the D&E -- the short answer, yes. Longer answer is that I'm really pleased with the progression and the progress we've seen with D&E margins. If we -- I've always said take a long view of D&E margins and I expect them every year to be higher than last year and next year to be higher than this year. There is some seasonality in that D&E business, both where we work in the world and some of the components that comprise D&E. But the target, and clearly, the expectation by me is that we are just layering on that seasonality a step up every single year, and that's what we've seen. Marc Bianchi : Great. Thanks so much. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Next question. Operator : Thank you. I\u2019m sorry, that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Jeff Miller for closing remarks. Jeff Miller : Okay. Thank you, Olivia. Before we close out the call, let me just reiterate, Halliburton's performance during the strong quarter demonstrates that we're executing on the right strategy in the international and North America markets to drive value for shareholders throughout this multiyear upcycle. I look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Please close out the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our third quarter earnings release and in the quarterly results and presentation section of our website. Now I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Our outlook today is strong, oil and gas supply remains tight for the foreseeable future, International market activity is accelerating and North America service capacity continues to further tighten. As a result, pricing is moving up in both markets. Halliburton\u2019s strong third quarter results demonstrate the power of our strategy. Here are some highlights. Total company revenue increased 6% sequentially as both North America and International activity continue to expand. Operating income grew 18% compared to adjusted operating income from the second quarter with improved margin performance in both divisions. Our overall operating income margin was 16% representing 45% incremental margins over last quarter\u2019s adjusted operating income. Our Completion and Production division revenue increased 8% over last quarter, driven by completions activity and pricing in North America and International markets. C&P delivered operating margin of 19% in the third quarter. The Drilling and Evaluation division revenue grew 3%. Operating margin of 15% increased 140 basis points sequentially and 380 basis points above the same period last year, demonstrating the earnings power and global competitiveness of our D&E business. North America revenue grew almost 9% sequentially as both drilling and completions activity improved throughout the third quarter. Pricing gains and activity increases across both divisions drove these results. International revenue grew 3% sequentially with improved activity in the Middle East and Latin America that more than offset the revenue decline related to exiting our Russia business. Importantly, during the third quarter, we generated similar incremental margins in both international and North America markets. Finally, we generated free cash flow of $543 million and retired $600 million of debt during the quarter. I am pleased with the third quarter results. I want to express my appreciation to the men and women of Halliburton whose hard work and dedication made these results possible. Your commitment to collaboration, safety and service quality everyday make Halliburton successful. Turning to our macro outlook. Oil and gas supply remains fundamentally tight due to multiple years of underinvestment. This tightness is apparent in historically low inventory levels, production levels well below expectations and temporary actions such as the largest ever SPR release. Against tight supply, demand for oil and gas is strong and we believe it will remain so. While broader market volatility is clear, what we see in our business is strong and growing demand for equipment and services. There is no immediate solution to balance the world\u2019s demand for secure and reliable oil and gas against its limited supply. I believe that only multiple years of increased investment in existing and new sources of production will solve the short supply. The effective solution to short supply is conventional and unconventional, deepwater and shallow water, new and existing developments, and short and long cycle barrels, all of it. I expect progress towards increased supply will be measured in years, not months as behavior of both operators and service companies have changed. Operators remain disciplined. Their commitments to investor returns require a measured approach to growth and investment. Service companies follow the same discipline, delivering on their commitments to investor returns and taking a measured approach to growth and investment. What I think is underappreciated is how this results in more sustainable growth and returns over a longer period of time. Let\u2019s turn now to Halliburton\u2019s performance, starting with the International markets. Our third quarter performance demonstrates the strength of our strategy to deliver profitable International growth through improved pricing, selective contract wins and the competitiveness of our technology offerings. International revenue in the third quarter for the C&P and D&E divisions grew year-over-year from a percentage standpoint in the high teens and mid-20s, respectively, which outpaced International rig count growth and reflects our competitiveness in all markets. Our year-over-year growth and the margin expansion demonstrated by both divisions give me confidence in the earnings power of our International business. Looking forward, I see activity increasing around the world, from the smallest to the largest countries and producers. I expect the areas of strongest growth will be the Middle East, led by Saudi Arabia, but with meaningful activity increases in the UAE, Qatar, Iraq and Kuwait. Elsewhere, Brazil, Guyana and many others have also signaled a commitment to increased activity. Throughout these markets, I am pleased with the broad adoption of our new directional drilling platform such as iCruise and EarthStar. Importantly, these broad-based activity increases serve to tighten equipment availability and drive price increases in our International business. Shifting to North America, we had a fantastic quarter. Our solid performance demonstrates our strategy to maximize value in North America. We achieved this through improved pricing, partnering with high quality customers and differentiated technology. Our revenue grew 9% sequentially and is up 63% over the third quarter last year. Pricing continues to improve across all product lines and completions equipment remains extremely tight across the market. Interest in eFleets is strong and customers are pleased with the superior efficiencies, operational uptime and reduced carbon footprint of our market-leading solution. Looking into 2023, I see continued growth. The inbounds for calendar slots are stronger than I have ever seen at this point in the year. More importantly, I see increased demand for a limited set of equipment and an environment where technology and performance are increasingly valued, all perfectly set up for Halliburton to maximize value in North America. Market consolidation, competitors that answer to public investors, disciplined customers and supply chain constraints, all drive the services market that I expect to remain tight for the foreseeable future. Halliburton will continue to outperform in this market. Our best-in-class Zeus eFleets have pumped over 20,000 hours for customers. Our eFleet customers know that they have a field-proven technology, which carries the full weight of Halliburton\u2019s expertise to build, run and optimize this next-generation equipment. Additionally, our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing system continues to gain traction and we expect an almost eight-fold increase in stages completed this year. SmartFleet gives customers unparalleled access to data about where and how their fractures permeate, the potential for frac hits on adjacent wells and the real-time data necessary to improve completion designs. In all markets, Halliburton\u2019s strong financial performance demonstrates its strategy and action, profitable international growth, maximizing value in North America and improved asset velocity to deliver value for our shareholders today. These strategies equip us to outperform under any market conditions, but especially to maximize returns through this up cycle. Execution is at the heart of Halliburton\u2019s identity. We collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. You have seen that in action in today\u2019s results. You can hear how excited I am about Halliburton\u2019s future all around the world. The structural demand for more oil and gas supply provides strong tailwinds for our business and Halliburton is ideally positioned to deliver improved profitability and increased returns for shareholders. Now I will turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our third quarter financial results. Eric? Eric Carre : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let me begin with a summary of our third quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.4 billion, a 6% increase over the second quarter, while operating income was $846 million, an increase of 18% over second quarter adjusted operating income. Globally, higher activity and pricing improvement supported these strong results. Operating margin for the company was 16% in the third quarter, 164-basis-point increase over second quarter adjusted operating margin and 393 basis points over adjusted operating margin in the third quarter of 2021. Our third quarter reported net income per diluted share was $0.60, an increase of $0.11 or 22% from second quarter adjusted net income per diluted share and more than doubled the adjusted net income per diluted share for the same period last year. Beginning with our Completion and Production division, revenue in the third quarter was $3.1 billion, an 8% increase when compared to the second quarter, while operating income was $583 million, an increase of 17% when compared to the second quarter. These results were driven by increased pressure pumping services, primarily in North America land and increased completion tool sales in Middle East Asia. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in the third quarter was $2.2 billion, an increase of 3% when compared to the second quarter, while operating income was $325 million, an increase of 14% when compared to the second quarter. These results were driven by improved drilling-related services in Latin America and Middle East Asia, and increased project management and wireline services internationally. The exit from our Russia business negatively impacted financial results for both divisions. Moving on to geographic results, in North America, revenue in the third quarter was $2.6 billion, a 9% increase when compared to the second quarter. This increase was primarily driven by increased pressure pumping services and drilling-related services in North America land. These increases were partially offset by decreased activity across multiple product service lines in the Gulf of Mexico. Latin America revenue in the third quarter was $841 million, an 11% increase sequentially, driven by increased well construction services and project management activity in Mexico. Europe Africa revenue in the third quarter was $639 million, an 11% decrease sequentially, almost all of this reduction was related to exiting our Russia business. Middle East/Asia revenue in the third quarter was $1.2 billion, a 6% increase sequentially and primarily resulting from increased completion tool sales in the Arabian Gulf and higher drilling services activity in Saudi Arabia and Southeast Asia. In the third quarter, our corporate and other expenses were $62 million, which was in line with expectations. For the fourth quarter, we expect our corporate expense to be up slightly or roughly in line with second quarter. Net interest expense for the quarter was $93 million, a slight decrease due to higher yields on cash balances. For the fourth quarter, we expect this expense to decrease slightly due to lower debt balances. Other net expense for the quarter was $48 million, primarily related to currency losses driven by the strength of the U.S. dollar. For the fourth quarter, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat. Our normalized effective tax rate for the third quarter came in at approximately 22%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our fourth quarter effective tax rate to increase slightly. Capital expenditure for the third quarter were $251 million. We expect our full year capital expenditure to be in line with our target of 5% to 6% of revenue. Turning to cash flow, we generated $753 million of cash from operations and $543 million of free cash flow during the third quarter. We expect full year free cash flow to be in the range of last year\u2019s free cash flow. With the latest payment of $600 million, we have now retired $2.4 billion of debt since 2020. We are quickly approaching our near-term leverage target of 2 times gross debt-to-EBITDA. Given our balance sheet position and strong outlook, we now have greater flexibility to increase the cash we will return to shareholders through dividends and/or share buybacks under our existing repurchase program. Now let me turn to the near-term outlook. In the Completion and Production division, we expect fourth quarter revenue to grow in the low-to-mid single digits and margins to improve 50 basis points to 100 basis points. In the Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect fourth quarter revenue to grow in the low-to-mid single digits and margins to improve 75 basis points to 125 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. Halliburton\u2019s third quarter financial performance shows our strategy in action, delivering value for our shareholders. Oil and gas supply remains tight, requiring multiple years of investment. Demand for Halliburton services is strong. We will continue to execute on our strategic priorities that drive free cash flow and returns for our shareholders. And now, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dave Anderson with Barclays. Your line is now open. Dave Anderson : Hi. Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Miller : Good morning, Dave. Dave Anderson : So first question on U.S. land, so we often hear about budget exhaustion this time of year, but you actually are saying -- you are saying you are seeing stronger inbound than ever going to year end. I am curious as to how those inbounds have changed, are the inbounds more from public E&Ps versus privates? And I am also wondering, are these customers looking for term now, with such limited equipment available and does that get a premium? Jeff Miller : Yeah. Look, I mean, we are certainly not seeing budget exhaustion. We remain sold out through the end of the year and into next year. So the market is strong and activity remains strong. And so as we look at what kind of inbounds are we getting, I\u2019d say, it\u2019s a mix, but it may be a little stronger towards larger companies. Let\u2019s just say it that way just given they want to be certain they have equipment for 2023. I expect that in North America, the more you work, the more you produce, the more we have to work and I think we are seeing that play out. At term, I would say that, people would like term. We view that as -- we have term, but at the same time, flexibility around pricing, just because, I really believe and I think it\u2019s pretty clear to us that 2023 remains extremely tight, both from an equipment standpoint, repair parts standpoint, you name it, so very encouraged about the outlook for 2023 in North America. Dave Anderson : That makes sense. I locked in term right here. Shifting over to the Middle East, you talked about increased project management in the Middle East. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a little tricky to do, I was just curious if you could just think about all those projects collectively. Where are we on the overall kind of ramp-up, are you kind of halfway there, are you kind of -- do you -- are you in closer to fully ramped up? And I guess, secondarily, once you do get ramped up on this project management, is there another leg of growth out there in terms of more tenders or is it more likely to be follow-on potentially some upselling of these contracts. It\u2019s been a while since we have seen an upmarket in project management in Middle East? Jeff Miller : Look, I think that really hasn\u2019t even begun in my view. I think we are just getting underway in terms of some of the bigger projects, discrete work starting. But I think we have got a long way to run internationally and in the Middle East in particular. And this is all consistent with sort of my earlier look on the macro in terms of, we didn\u2019t get here overnight. We got to where we are from a supply standpoint over eight years to 10 years and that\u2019s the kind of time frame that it takes to solve for. And I think the Middle East broadly takes a long view of this business, and as a result, when they are getting traction now, but it\u2019s not a knee-jerk reaction. It is a methodical march towards reserve extensions and adding reserves, which takes time and money, and so I am super encouraged about the outlook in the Middle East. Dave Anderson : Thanks, Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. James West : Hey. Good morning, Jeff and Eric. Jeff Miller : Good morning, James. Eric Carre : Good morning, James. James West : So, Jeff, I wanted to dig in a little more on the International business, obviously, this quarter had some mixed results just given Russia coming out. But Halliburton as a company as at least I understand it and certainly you can elaborate on this, but you have spent the last the better part of the last three decades really building out a superior International franchise and one that should be competitive with your major peers or your major competitor here. Is there any reason that we should think that you would underperform or that you would outperform over the next several years in the International arena, given the outlook is as strong as kind of you are alluding to and certainly what we see in the market. We start with the Middle East, if you want, but there\u2019s also many other regions that are going to be showing really substantial growth. I am just curious kind of how Halliburton is set up for that? Jeff Miller : Thanks, James. Look, we are extremely well set up for International expansion and have outgrown many quarters in the past and expect to continue to do so into the future based on our technology portfolio and our footprint internationally. Just for some context, Halliburton grew 21% internationally year-on-year, while exiting Russia this quarter, and of course, this is the quarter in Russia, where we typically see the pre-winter sort of step up in the 15% range, so that wasn\u2019t there. But we are seeing strong growth and expect to continue to see that internationally. I think also important to recall, I mentioned in my comments, was the strong international incrementals, which were basically on par with North America, which continues to demonstrate not only growth but margin expansion internationally. If I look ahead internationally, we are only halfway through our iCruise deployment. James West : Right. Jeff Miller : I think that all of that left to do. So I feel, like I said, really good, our production business is new and on plan and so I expect to continue growing revenue internationally and expanding margins. So I feel really good about our international outlook, actually better than I ever have. James West : Okay. Well, that\u2019s a very strong statement. And perhaps to follow up on that, on the D&E side, which is an International bias, you are kind of hitting margin targets that we were anticipating for next year. So you are kind of already there. And do you think and as you see the outlook and I know you may not want to get bogged down in specific numbers, but how do you see that progression as we go through the end of this year and 2023? Jeff Miller : Look, I expect to continue to see improvement. We are in the right markets. We have got extremely competitive portfolio. All service lines are contributing to that. I think the -- when I look out, I have always said about our D&E business that we were making meaningful investments in that business, probably, started saying that four years ago and then every year\u2026 James West : Right. Jeff Miller : \u2026 we wanted to stack better margins on better margins, full year margin, and obviously, there\u2019s cyclicality throughout a year in weather and other stuff. But ultimately, the plan was to continue this march on stacking on better margins and that\u2019s what you are seeing. And as I have already said, if we are only halfway through deployment of what I think the flagship technology is in D&E, we should continue -- I expect to continue stacking those better margins up. James West : Right. Got it. Okay. Thanks, Jeff. Jeff Miller : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Arun Jayaram : Yeah. Good morning, Jeff. I wanted to talk\u2026 Jeff Miller : Hi, Arun. Arun Jayaram : \u2026 a little bit about the portfolio, I know one of your long-term ambitions is to grow house leverage to the production phase of the oil and gas life cycle versus just pure D&C. So I was wondering, if you could comment where you think you are on -- where you are at in terms of that journey and how you think about your potential to grow your share in things like lift and chemicals? Jeff Miller : Look, I feel good about that. I mean it\u2019s all marching along as planned and we continue to grow. We are still in the very early innings of that International expansion, so call it, the second inning. So, but it\u2019s doing exactly what we had hoped. We continue to grow the footprint in the Middle East with lift and with chemicals. Chemicals is -- we put our first full scale production lot through the plant this month. That\u2019s an important first step and a lot of work to do. But again, the infrastructure is in place and we are getting access to market and making sales. The lift bottomline just a fantastic business in North America and it\u2019s the same technology that we apply internationally and so those guys are just dead focused on profitable market entries and growth and we are seeing that Latin America and in the Middle East. Arun Jayaram : Great. And maybe just a follow-up for Eric. Eric, you highlighted your leverage target of 2 times. A number of your peers have announced some return of capital announcements at Liberty-Halliburton [ph] campaign. I was wondering, if you could maybe give us a little bit more thoughts on how you think about return of capital after reaching your deleveraging target and how you are thinking about future dividend growth versus buybacks? Eric Carre : Right. So, thanks, Arun. So what we have said for the last couple of years is that, our priority number one was really to get our balance sheet in order. So with the $600 million that we have retired in Q3 that puts us at about $2.4 billion retired since 2020, $1.2 billion retired this year alone. So if you combine that with our improved business performance for all practical purposes, we are at our target and considering as well our positive outlook we see no reason for that to change. So really big picture we are starting to turn our attention now to returning more cash to shareholders. So we are working through scenarios. We are engaging our Board. So, more details to come. Arun Jayaram : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Chase Mulvehill : Hey. Good morning, everybody. So, I guess, first, I kind of want to hit on margins and if we kind of look at how your pre-shale margins, so call it, 2011 and maybe going all the way back to kind of 2006 and 2008 timeframe, you did mid-to-high 20% EBITDA margins. Today, you are sitting in the low 20$s. So, Jeff, I don\u2019t -- could you just kind of walk us through what would need to happen to get back to these type of margins and whether you even think that this is possible to kind of get back to those type of margin levels in this cycle? Jeff Miller : Look, I think, the key thing about this cycle is its duration and it\u2019s the right kind of cycle from a duration standpoint that I think we grow into better margins as we continue forward. So I am not going to try to put a date or a time. But my expectation is the duration of the market, sort of the behavior that I described to both operators and service companies, which is absolutely rational in terms of returning cash to shareholders, which is what Eric just talked about. This is the kind of cycle where we are able to do that and I think setting up for margin improvement, the EBITDA strengthening, all of those are the things that create the free cash flow. And I think that historically, actually, I really haven\u2019t seen the cycle set up where we have got short supply the way that we do and the sort of runway that I see in front of us and all of the right sort of motivation by the industry. I think energy is a fantastic industry and I think what you are going to see is the demonstration from the entire industry of what returning cash to shareholders and generating meaningful returns look like over a good cycle, long cycle. Chase Mulvehill : Yeah. Perfect. Just to follow-up on International markets. Could you just talk about how tight the markets are today, what kind of pricing momentum that you are seeing and when you think about idled or spare capacity across international markets, at least for Halliburton, do you see an opportunity to continue to kind of mobilize the tighter markets or do you have a lot less spare capacity and what did that mean for CapEx for next year on the International side? Jeff Miller : Well, from a CapEx standpoint, we have already described that we are in the 5% to 6% range of revenues on CapEx. So what we do is deploy capital to the best opportunities, which opportunity -- which international markets demonstrate important opportunity, so we would direct capital that way as opposed to others. But I think what\u2019s important about the market as we are just seeing customer urgency return in the sense that quality matters equipment matters. Is it tight, yes, it\u2019s tight. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of spare capacity anywhere in the world. If I go back to our strategic tenants, it\u2019s profitable growth internationally and asset velocity. And I think what you see is that asset velocity being baked into just the way that we work is creating the ability to do a lot more with less than we ever have in the past. And that\u2019s one of the key reasons we are confident in our capital spend levels is because of the type of equipment we are putting in the market, its ability to be moved around, work longer, repair faster, and when we do all of those things, it just makes us a much better effective business internationally. Chase Mulvehill : Okay. I appreciate the color. I will turn it back over. Thanks, Jeff. Jeff Miller : Yeah. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Neil Mehta : Yeah. Good morning, team. The first question was around North America. You mentioned that you continue to see revenue growth in North America and that there is increased demand for a limited set of equipment. Can you talk about what the moving pieces are there? What kind of equipment type -- types of equipment are we talking about and how do you think about adding frac capacity, is there a demand for it as you look out in the market into 2023? Jeff Miller : Well, the activity we really see is, let\u2019s just describe it as service intensity, which is increasing and that\u2019s more reps on equipment, more sand through equipment. We are also seeing our drilling activity in the U.S. as well, so all services related to D&E. But principally, frac, and so as it works harder, it grow, I mean, that generates more value for us and so that\u2019s probably the principal thing. When I think about capacity, we are maximizing value in North America and we are growing profitably internationally, and that automatically balances where we spend our money and how we approach markets. North America from a capacity standpoint for us, really we look at eFleets and it\u2019s not really capacity, I view it as replacement over different time horizons. But we -- the conversations, for example, that we are having about eFleets are not anything really immediate. It\u2019s all around late 2023, 2024, 2025 in terms of eFleet additions and so that will likely wind up replacing equipment over time. Yeah, so I am really encouraged about where the market goes. It\u2019s extremely tight, it\u2019s tight for repair parts, it\u2019s tight for just everything, and we have all talked about sort of bottlenecks in the supply chain. I know that\u2019s really going to rectify itself over any sort of short horizon. So I think that under all conditions North America is tight. I think capacity\u2026 Neil Mehta : Yeah. Jeff Miller : \u2026 could be added in a meaningful way even if it was desired. Neil Mehta : Yeah. That\u2019s great perspective. And then just some early thoughts on 2023 in terms of what you are hearing from customers in terms of activity and any early thoughts around what you expect spending increases to be both in the U.S. and internationally as a percentage, and how much do you think inflation will be as a component of that increase? Jeff Miller : Look, I think, we have got strong growth as we look into next year. Really, we don\u2019t haven\u2019t even seen budgets from customers, but expect that growth to be strong. Clearly, we are going to be up from here, I guess, is how I would describe next year, up from where we are today, and obviously, that\u2019s really strong growth that we have seen over the last year. So I think that the North America demand continues to increase and internationally we have already talked quite a bit about that. But I expect that we will see growth really everywhere in the sense that customers can be busy, they will be busy. I think the traction in the Middle East is just getting underway and I think that we will continue to see a tightening. And I continue to view this as a margin cycle as opposed to necessarily, it\u2019s not a build cycle, it\u2019s a margin cycle and I think that we are going to be the real beneficiaries of that at Halliburton. Neil Mehta : Thank you, Jeff. Jeff Miller : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citi. Your line is now open. Scott Gruber : Yes. Good morning. Jeff Miller : Good morning, Scott. Eric Carre : Good morning. Scott Gruber : The smaller pumpers here domestically have discussed replacing about 10% of their fleet annually, generally with e-frac additions. As we think about Halliburton, is that a rough guide for you all, assuming returns stay positive or do you have a different framework? How do you think about that kind of multiyear replacement cycle? Jeff Miller : Yeah. Look, what we are seeing, we have a healthy fleet today and we have a healthy fleet, because we have always reinvested in our fleet through thick and thin. I mean, at the worst of the market, the best of the market, we are always maintaining a replacement cycle for equipment and we get the benefit of that all of the time. When I look at the market, I have feedback from a customer recently that a lot of the equipment out there looks just dead on its feet. Don\u2019t know how to get it replaced fast enough. I think that the pace at which we are working, what comes with the service intensity I described for frac equipment is just more revolutions and you can\u2019t meet physics and so I think that when we look at replacement cycle, we view it as an electric replacement cycle. And so we have focused on that. We have got leading technology. And we are seeing strong pull from our customers for that technology. And so what we are doing is, as [Audio Gap] we get -- demand and pull translates into contracts of duration that return capital and cost -- and margin and capital, the actual return of capital all happen inside the same contract. And that demonstrates for me, the strength of the technology and also what that pull looks like. But it\u2019s not something we rush to do. It\u2019s something we do as the pull is adequate to sign that equipment up and it\u2019s going to be over a period of time. Scott Gruber : Got it. Okay. No. Very well guys. I appreciate the color. And then turning to -- back to the International markets, you had impressive growth internationally even without Russia this quarter, as you highlighted. We had a few inbounds though this morning trying to ascertain exactly what the International growth was year-on-year excluding Russia. I apologize if you mentioned that number earlier, I may have missed it, but are you able to share with us what that\u2026 Jeff Miller : Yeah. Yeah. It\u2019s\u2026 Scott Gruber : \u2026 growth was? Jeff Miller : Yeah. It\u2019s 21% year-on-year International growth. Scott Gruber : Was that inclusive of the -- of Russia or excluding Russia? Jeff Miller : That\u2019s excluding -- well, that\u2019s -- Russia -- while we had Russia and excluding Russia for the last quarter. Eric Carre : With Russia in H1 and without Russia in Q3. Scott Gruber : Right. Do you have the number outside of Russia, how quickly you guys grew year-on-year? Jeff Miller : That I don\u2019t know. Eric Carre : No. Jeff Miller : But it would have been substantially -- it would have been more. Scott Gruber : Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I could follow-up. Okay. Thank you. Jeff Miller : All right. Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Your line is now open. Stephen Gengaro : Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. Jeff Miller : Good morning, Stephen. Stephen Gengaro : Two things for me. One just from a North American perspective, how are the conversations with customers about price? I mean, obviously, pricing has been improving for a while now, is there a pushback yet? How do the conversations go as far as 2023 pricing for frac and how do you think that plays out as you go forward? Jeff Miller : Look, I am absolutely not going to get into details around price discussions with customers. Look, I think that, I have already said, I view that pricing strengthens. We are still below pre-pandemic levels in terms of pricing, so there\u2019s room to improve there. Service quality and technology are both driving premiums. I have talked about sort of pull on eFleets and just general performance and maintenance of the fleet. Pricing is always going to be iterative. It\u2019s not giant steps. It\u2019s what I talked about like throughout the year that gets us to where we are today and I think there\u2019s a lot of power in having a structurally advantaged low emissions fleet, which is what we have out there today. Stephen Gengaro : Is it\u2026 Jeff Miller : Yeah, I think, one of the things that was left out of the conversation is securing capacity for 2023, reliable capacity, obviously, Halliburton we -- we are the execution company, we do what we say and so we are very reliable in terms of delivery. And I think securing that kind of capacity for 2023 is a high priority for our customers. Stephen Gengaro : And just as a follow-up, do you see -- is there a gap and how much in conversations the sort of cost of diesel relative to the lower cost of running eFleets play into either the gap in price or the conversations about pricing? Jeff Miller : Again, ignoring price, the conversation around the eFleets is really that it\u2019s a better mousetrap over the long run. Is it more efficient to operate? Yes, it is. It should -- it creates value from a price standpoint, but it also creates value from an effectiveness standpoint, the ability to pump. These fleets are extremely reliable and then we took one out of the box and it pumped 500 hours first month. I mean that\u2019s the type of reliability we are seeing out of the equipment. So I think all of that conspires to make it sought after in the marketplace. That\u2019s why we see the pulls. Is cost a component? It probably is. I am sure it is for our clients, it always is. But I think it would be wrong to ignore the other components of value there. Stephen Gengaro : Great. Okay. Thank you. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Roger Read : Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. I guess I\u2019d like to ask the question a little bit differently on the capacity versus investment and tightness of new equipment, spare parts and everything, as you said, Jeff. But if we were to look at, maybe work you have turned down in North America or contracts that you either don\u2019t want to bid on internationally or bid maybe less aggressively, has there been any change in that as we look across the course of 2022 and maybe what you are seeing for the early parts of 2023? Jeff Miller : It would be returning more not less in terms of, that\u2019s part of how we improve margins on the overall portfolio and returns. But we have been really consistent about our strategy and maximizing value in North America growing profitably internationally and that is one of the key levers that we have to do both of those things. And so, yes, we have done both of those. Roger Read : Yeah. But I guess I am just wondering, I mean, you are turning down more not less, is it a material amount at this point or is it still pretty much just on the margin you see a project that\u2019s not interesting or enticing? Jeff Miller : Look, I think, that it\u2019s -- clearly it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t know how to describe that is that at the margin. It\u2019s probably at the margin, but it is going to grow as the market continues to get tighter. We are building, I have already described, our CapEx and so we will be adding. We have been able to grow with the CapEx levels that we have had. I\u2019d say, meaningfully, over the last year and expect that we will continue to grow because of the way that we are building equipment. So it\u2019s not we are turning everything down by any means. But I think it\u2019s an important point that we are much more, I mean, the contracts that we pursue and win are accretive to what we are doing and if they are not, then they probably fall out of the list, just because we want to -- even the new capital that we would have, whether it\u2019s drilling equipment or anything else that\u2019s going to go towards things that are of higher value. Roger Read : Yeah. It makes sense. So glad to hear there\u2019s better selectivity out there. And then my other question was to follow-up. You mentioned tight for kind of everything in terms of new equipment, spare parts, et cetera. I know you are very integrated on the pressure pumping side in terms of manufacturing. But as you work with subcontracts, are you trying to do anything different in terms of helping them increase capacity or are we just -- the system is tight and there\u2019s not really much prospect for change in terms of, I am just thinking the supply chain all the way down on the types of equipment where you want to expand or where there\u2019s a relatively high maintenance component? Jeff Miller : Look, it will get fixed over time, but in most of these cases, there\u2019s not a lot that can be done to accelerate their supply chain when it\u2019s far reaching. Clearly, we plan ahead and we have been planning ahead for over a year. We have got great visibility. But that market will just be tight for spare parts and equipment. Roger Read : All right. Appreciate that. Thank you. Jeff Miller : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Your line is now open. Marc Bianchi with Cowen, your line is now open. Jeff Miller : All right. Operator : Please shut your mute button. Thank you. And I am currently showing no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks. Jeff Miller : Yeah. Thank you, Shannon, and thank you all for participating in today\u2019s call. Just let me summarize with a few key points. Halliburton\u2019s strong third quarter performance shows our strategy is delivering value for our shareholders. Oil and gas supply, shortness constraints and shortages I see today create strong and growing demand for Halliburton\u2019s equipment and services in support of this multiyear upcycle. At Halliburton, we will continue to execute on our strategic priorities to drive free cash flow and we will support of this multiyear. Looking forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Please close out the call. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Coleman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. David Coleman : Hello, and thank you for joining the Halliburton Fourth Quarter 2022 Conference Call. We will make the recording of today's webcast available on Halliburton's Web site after this call. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO; and Eric Carre, Executive Vice President and CFO. Some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly update any forward-looking statement for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our fourth quarter earnings release and in the quarterly results and presentation section of our Web site. Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Halliburton finished the year strong with solid financial and operational performance in both divisions and both hemispheres. Halliburton's execution in 2022 demonstrates the earnings power of our strategy, and I expect this earnings power to strengthen in 2023 and beyond. Let's jump right into the 2022 highlights. We delivered full year total company revenue of $20.3 billion and operating income of $2.7 billion. Adjusted operating income grew 70% compared to 2021 with improved margin performance in both divisions. Our full year international revenue grew 20% over 2021, and our revenue and operating income increased each quarter in 2022. I am pleased with the international growth and margin progression Halliburton demonstrated this year despite a second quarter exit from our Russian business. Our full year North America revenue increased 51% over 2021 with improved margins driven by activity and pricing gains. Both our drilling and evaluation and completion and production divisions grew revenue and margins this year. The Drilling and Evaluation division generated full year operating margins of 15%, an increase of 320 basis points over 2021. The steady expansion of D&E margins demonstrates the global competitiveness of our D&E business. Our Completion and Production division posted 18% full year operating margins, a year-over-year increase of 290 basis points, driven by activity and pricing improvements. We generated strong free cash flow of $1.4 billion, retired $1.2 billion of debt, maintained capital spending within 5% to 6% of revenues and ended the year with $2.3 billion of cash on hand. Finally, our service quality performance excelled in 2022. Nonproductive time improved by 7% over 2021, which drove the highest ever uptime across our business. Execution is at the heart of who we are and our results are a testament to our employees' continued commitment to superior service quality. I'm pleased with the fourth quarter results. Revenue grew 4% and operating income grew 15% sequentially. Margins increased in both C&P and D&E divisions and in both hemispheres. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $1.2 billion and free cash flow was $856 million. Building on the strong foundation of execution, today, I am pleased to announce the following shareholder return actions : first, our Board approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.16 per share in the first quarter of 2023, representing a 33% increase from last year; second, we have resumed share buybacks under our existing Board authorization of approximately $5 billion and in the fourth quarter of 2022, bought back shares totaling $250 million; finally, our Board approved a capital return framework that we expect going forward to return at least 50% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. These actions demonstrate Halliburton's confidence in our business, customers, employees and industry outlook. Before we continue, I want to take a moment and thank the Halliburton employees around the world who made these results possible. Our success this quarter and throughout 2022 was a direct result of your hard work and dedication. I thank you for your relentless focus on safety, operational execution, customer collaboration and service quality performance. Now let's turn to the macro outlook where everything I see today points towards continued oil and gas tightness. On the supply side, in the US, an increased spend of almost 50% and activity growth of nearly 30% yielded a production increase of about 5%. Given the increased spend required to grow and replace production, I expect activity to remain strong and service intensity to increase through 2023. I see the same supply side challenges in the international markets. One indicator being that despite OPEC's 2022 production quotas, several members did not meet their goals. On the demand side, we saw the resilience of oil and gas demand throughout 2022, even as central banks raised interest rates to combat inflation. I expect oil and gas demand to remain strong. As we start 2023, I also expect China's reopening to further increase demand. It's clear to me that oil and gas is in short supply and only multiple years of increased investment in both stemming declines and reserve additions will solve short supply. I believe these investments will drive demand for oilfield services for the next several years. The unique feature of this up cycle, as I see it, is the investor driven return discipline by both operators and service companies, which I expect drives a longer duration cycle and translates into years of increasing demand for Halliburton services. Now let's turn to Halliburton, starting with our performance in the international markets. We successfully executed our strategy to deliver profitable international growth through competitive technology offerings, improved pricing and selective contract wins. International revenue grew 20% year-on-year with strong growth and margin expansion from both divisions. This gives me confidence in the earnings power of our international strategy. In 2023, we expect international activity to grow at least mid-teens with most new activity coming from the Middle East and Latin America. As this up cycle continues, I believe that we will see substantial growth in all international markets, both onshore and offshore, led by development activity and increased spend at the wellbore. This is excellent news for Halliburton. About half our revenue comes from international markets. We have leading positions in key well construction product lines and a strong geographic footprint. I'm excited about the growth and profit opportunities that will come with the adoption of our new drilling technology platforms. Our iCruise drilling technology, iStar logging while drilling platform and LOGIX automation capabilities. Each of these technologies are in different stages of implementation, and we are already seeing benefits. Our iCruise directional drilling system represents about half of our rotary steerable fleet while drilling about 70% of our global footage. It is a key contributor to increasing international profitability. Our iStar logging while drilling platform now delivers high definition measurements closer to the bit and deeper into the formation. While early in its rollout with only 600,000 feet logged, the iStar platform directly complements the iCruise directional drilling system. Finally, LOGIX automates drilling with iCruise and iStar. With more than 7 million feet drilled in 20 plus countries the LOGIX platform reduces operational risk and delivers wells reliably. Turning to North America. We had a terrific year. Our performance demonstrated our strategy to maximize value in North America through capital efficiency, improved pricing, differentiated technology and alignment with high quality customers. In 2022, our North America revenue grew 51% year-over-year, while revenue in the fourth quarter was flat sequentially due to weather related downtime late in the year. Looking ahead, we expect strong activity and anticipate customer spending to grow by at least 15% in 2023. The market for equipment is tight. Lead times for new and replacement equipment remain long and service companies remain disciplined. Our completions calendar is fully booked and pricing continues to improve across all product service lines. Against this constructive market backdrop, Halliburton will outperform with our unique strategy to maximize value. We see strong demand for our Zeus e-fleets with several repeat customers contracting additional fleets. Zeus is a proven design with a strong operational track record. Our new automated fracturing platform, Optiv, fully automates equipment operation, reduces maintenance and extends component life. We are in the early innings of this rollout, having proven it over 15,000 stages, and I expect it to drive higher capital efficiency. Finally, our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing system is gaining significant traction with customers. SmartFleet data helps customers answer key questions such as the existence of flow barriers, well interference, parent-child performance and depletion, all to improve completion performance. These are a few examples of how technology maximizes value in North America. Each example delivers better margins either by reducing capital cost or increasing capital velocity and in many cases, both. Halliburton is unique and is the only integrated services company to have a strong presence in both North America and international markets, a strong execution culture and differentiated technology. We will continue to sharpen our value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. I am confident in Halliburton's strong long term outlook. This is the best setup and market outlook for oilfield services om Halliburton that I have seen in a very long time. Our exceptional financial performance this year is a clear result of the execution of our strategic priorities to maximize value in North America, deliver profitable international growth and drive capital efficiency. I expect Halliburton to continue to deliver financial outperformance. Now I will turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric? Eric Carre : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let me begin with a summary of our fourth quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.6 billion, a 4% increase over the third quarter while operating income was $976 million, an increase of 15% over third quarter operating income. Operating margin for the company was 17.5% in the fourth quarter, a 460 basis point increase over operating margins in the fourth quarter of 2021. These results were primarily driven by increased global activity, pricing and year end product and software sales. Our fourth quarter reported net income per diluted share was $0.72, an increase of $0.12 or 20% from the third quarter. Our 2022 full year adjusted net income per diluted share nearly doubled from 2021. Beginning with our Completion and Production division. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $3.2 billion, a 1% increase when compared to the third quarter, while operating income was $659 million, an increase of 13% when compared to the third quarter. Despite weather related downtime late in the year, C&P delivered an operating income margin of 20.7%, the highest operating income margin since 2012. This was due to improved pricing, service efficiency and activity mix in North America land as well as increased activity in international markets. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in the fourth quarter was $2.4 billion, an increase of 8% when compared to the third quarter, while operating income was $387 million, an increase of 19% when compared to the third quarter. These results were driven by higher year end software sales and an uptick in international activity. Operating margin increased 210 basis points above Q4 2021, which demonstrates the global competitiveness of our D&E business. Moving on to geographic results. Our international revenue increased 9% sequentially due to solid year end sales, pricing gains and activity increases. In North America, revenue in the fourth quarter was $2.6 billion, a 1% decrease when compared to the third quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by weather related downtime in North America land. Latin America revenue in the fourth quarter was $945 million, a 12% increase sequentially due to higher activity in Mexico and across the region. Europe/Africa revenue in the fourth quarter was $657 million, a 3% increase sequentially driven by higher completion tool sales, drilling activity and well intervention services across the region. These increases were partially offset by lower activity in Norway. Middle East/Asia revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.4 billion, a 10% increase sequentially, primarily resulting from higher software sales and drilling and evaluation services across the region. Now I'd like to cover some additional financial items. In the fourth quarter, our corporate and other expenses was $70 million. For the first quarter, we expect our corporate expenses to be slightly lower. Net interest expense for the quarter was $74 million, a slight decrease due to higher yields on cash balances and debt retirement in September. For the first quarter, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat. Other net expense for the quarter was $60 million, primarily related to unfavorable foreign exchange movements. For the first quarter, we expect this expense to be slightly lower. Our normalized effective tax rate for the fourth quarter came in at approximately 21%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our first quarter effective tax rate to increase roughly 150 basis points. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $350 million with our 2022 full year CapEx totaling approximately $1 billion. Turning to cash flow. For the full year, we generated $2.2 billion of cash from operations and delivered approximately $1.4 billion of free cash flow. As a result, we ended the year with approximately $2.3 billion in cash. Next, I'd like to provide a few more details about our capital return framework. First, an important pillar of our capital framework is to maintain CapEx between 5% and 6% of revenue. I believe the spending level is appropriate and supports our earnings growth and free cash flow generation over the next several years. Second, we expect to return a minimum of 50% of free cash flow to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 33% to $0.16 per share, effective with a dividend payment in March 2023. Finally, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased $250 million of shares and we have remaining authorization of approximately $5 billion. We were clear about our goals to reduce debt and increased cash returns to shareholders, and I am pleased that we've announced these actions today. I believe Halliburton's capital return framework provides visibility for investors and affords us the flexibility to pursue acquisitions and strengthen the balance sheet. Now let me provide you with some comments on how we see the first quarter. As is typical, our results will be subject to weather related seasonality and the roll-off of year end product sales, which will mostly impact our international business. As a result, in our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to be essentially flat with the fourth quarter while margins will drop between 75 and 125 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect revenue to decrease in the low to mid single digits sequentially while margins are expected to be down 25 to 75 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff. A - Jeff Miller : Thanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. Oil and gas is tight and only multiple years of increased investment will solve short supply, which translates into years of increasing demand for Halliburton Services. The announced dividend increase, share buybacks and Halliburton's new capital return framework provides shareholders with clarity and consistency on how we expect to return cash to shareholders. This exceptional financial performance is a clear result of our execution of Halliburton's strategic priorities. I expect Halliburton to continue to deliver financial outperformance, strong free cash flow and shareholder returns. And now let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. David Anderson : So Halliburton's international business is now half of overall revenue. Middle East has been a big part of that growth over the years, it was up 10% this quarter. Just wondering if you could just give us a little bit more insight into kind of your views on that market over the next kind of couple of years. So based on activity is how it's trending and the ramp up is going on, I guess, in the near term, is it reasonable to think the growth should sort of stay at these levels the next several quarters? And also, if you could highlight some of the countries where you see most of the growth coming from over the next several years, including kind of where you think you're best positioned in terms of footprints or product lines in the Middle East? Jeff Miller : Look, I'm really excited about international growth. I think I said in my call, north of 15%, which clearly, I expect it will be north of that and should continue actually to expand, I think, over the next few years just because we will -- it takes longer to get traction internationally, get things contracted. And so really excited about what we see. With our international business being about half of our business today, that indicate or demonstrates that we have strong footprint sort of everywhere where we think it's important and our technology, as I described, rolling out. So clearly, it's got strong application in the Middle East and Latin America, which we kind of saw this year but it's the same technology that's applicable in all corners of the world. And so I think we're early in the rollout a lot of this technology and that's only going to help strengthen our international business. As we see activity grow, I expect our share of that to grow and improve margins as we focus on profitable international growth. David Anderson : And if I could shift over on the US side, there's been a lot of recent talk about activity levels slowing down in the US. The rig count has drifted down a bit in recent weeks, been some weather, as you highlighted, and there's also some concerns out there in the natural gas market. I also know how any E&Ps have announced any spending budgets this year. So I was wondering if you can just help us out with a little bit of visibility on the market. Kind of what are your customers saying about kind of how activity is going to play out into the spring? And then based on that, kind of how do you see sort of the dynamics of that pressure pumping market in terms of capacity and the tightness for 2023? Jeff Miller : Look, North America is going to, in my view, will surprise to the upside. Our outlook is north of 15% growth. Clearly, we outpaced that last year and that's what I said last year. I don't have any clients that are not -- that are -- that plan to get smaller, they all plan to grow. And I think that North America has a dynamic of the more -- the more you grow, the more the market has to work in order to maintain even the growth given decline curves. And so I expect we see increased service intensity throughout '23 and likely beyond, the market is extremely tight for frac equipment and the supply chain still backed up. And so I don't see -- I see discipline in the marketplace and more importantly, I see sort of required discipline based on equipment being unavailable. So the more activity we see then ultimately, the more price we will see. And so I am very positive on '23 North America. So I think the the concerns are misplaced and rig count likely moves up actually as DUCs get blown down. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan. Arun Jayaram : Jeff, clearly, one of the themes this earnings season has been the inflection in Middle East spending in offshore. I was wondering, Jeff, if you could talk about Halliburton's portfolio and competitive position in both the Middle East and as well as offshore? And how do you think you're positioned in this cycle versus last? Jeff Miller : Look, we're better positioned than we've ever been as Halliburton, both from a technology perspective that I described examples of that. But clearly, that's not all of the technology we've got in the market today and from a footprint standpoint. So a lot of that build out was done prior cycles, it's still there and ready to go. So I feel very good about our geographic footprint, our technology advancement that we've made and our team. I mean we've just got an exceptionally strong team today internationally. So I feel very confident certainly from that perspective. And when we look at where our business is, offshore is good for us. I think that about 40% of our international business is offshore today. And so that's a good market for us. And I think another nuance as we look out into next year, certainly and likely beyond, is the sort of emphasis on development activity as opposed to exploration that maybe we've seen in prior cycles. And I think that's very consistent with where operators are from a capital discipline standpoint and just producing more barrels sooner, which leads us to development. And that is a place where we have leading positions in a number of the service lines that allow that to happen, so meaning drilling fluids, completion tools. And so I think this is going to be a great even better market for Halliburton. Arun Jayaram : And maybe a follow-up for Eric. Eric, I wanted to get your thoughts on cash conversion in 2023. And just wanted to think about just working capital needs to support the growth this year? And just any broad thoughts on collections, particularly for international -- some of your international and NOC customers? Eric Carre : So I mean, broadly speaking, we're looking at the cash generation profile in 2023 as being fairly similar to 2022. So quite a bit weighted toward the back half of the year. Looking at things overall, I mean, the big buckets, obviously, we'll see significantly increased net income driven by growth in our revenue, improvements in our margins. On the CapEx side of things, we finished 2022 on the low end of our range of 5% to 6%. We were at 5%. When I look at '23, we will be at the higher end of that range, primarily driven by supply chain constraints and extended lead time in our supply chain that we talked about on prior calls. And the third element in terms of working capital, again, our business will continue to grow, so we will continue to see some headwinds in terms of working capital essentially and also the impact of growing internationally, which tends to be more bigger consumers of working capital than when we grow our business in North America. So the way all of that is going to land is a little north of 20% growth in terms of free cash flow over our 2022 performance. Operator : Our next question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. James West : So Jeff, in North America, I want to start there. In North America, your customer base and the majority of the customers really have three options, you can grow, you can shrink, you can go international. Where do you see, in your conversations with the bigger shale operators -- and you mentioned earlier, you think there could be a surprise to the upside in North America. How do you think they're thinking about the North American market, especially given what's going to be inventory constraints at some point here, whether it's three years, five years, seven years, we don't really know but at some point on wells and what they plan to do over the next couple of years? Jeff Miller : Well, I expect that within sort of expectations -- within sort of capital discipline levels, I expect growth is really the only path for most of these companies. And commodity price very supportive, the international growth, very, very difficult, and shrink, not really an option. So I think that we'll see increased -- initially increased service intensity, that's the first step and that clearly we benefit from increasing service intensity. The second, if we want to go out 10 years, that's a bet against technology and that's not a bet I'm willing to make. I mean, in fact, I'm very confident in what technology will do. There is a lot of oil in North America and we're already seeing the impact of work harder producing more barrels. And then also that's one of the reasons as Halliburton the SmartFleet, as an example, I talk about it a lot, but that's one of the tools that operators can take. I expect over time and start to solve how to make more barrels and more productivity. And so as we invest a lot of R&D dollars into North America, we're kind of unique in that fashion and we try to put those dollars into what we think are most impactful. So it's not a bigger X or a smaller Y but more a function of what is the technology that I think and the company thinks will really unlock productivity over time. And I think those kind of tools in the hands of our operators, I mean, they are incredibly competitive, smart, technically deep. And I think it's more a matter of getting tools in their hands to allow them to unlock what 10 years down the road looks like. James West : Okay, that's great perspective there. And then if I could just switch to the international side of the business. At this point, are we in a market that is still price driven or have we switched now to a market where it's about availability and service quality? Jeff Miller : Well, I don't think you have one without the other, James, but I would expect -- my view is service quality and having equipment, quality equipment, is more and more important every day, that ultimately drives prices well. We spend a lot of time focused on how we execute and deliver service quality and our service quality feel very good. And so we are a beneficiary of that. As the market gets tighter, they start to get to the -- the market starts to pull equipment out, but I expect that sort of where we are, we've got a very good equipment portfolio and technology that we're bringing to the market and all of that certainly benefits us. Operator : Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Thanks, Jeff, for the framework around capital returns, and that's kind of where I want to focus my questions here today. Can you talk about why you thought at least 50% of free cash flow was the right number? And then talk about how you -- the definition of that calculation. I think it will be cash flow from -- cash flow from operations inclusive of working capital minus CapEx before M&A, but just to make sure we're on the same page. Jeff Miller : Go ahead, Eric. Eric Carre : I think your view is correct, yes. And the 50%, I mean, there's nothing magic in the 50% per se. We think that it's a number that gives some level of certainty in terms of what we're going to return to shareholders while giving us a lot of optionality to continue to invest in our business, to continue to make bolt-on acquisition or to make acquisitions that are complementary to our product line business. And also give us optionality over the next few years to continue to work on strengthening our balance sheet. Neil Mehta : And that was my follow-up around capital returns. So as you think about the buyback, how do you think about approaching it? Do you want to take a more ratable approach or do you want to be countercyclical in the way that you prosecute it? And when you talk about M&A, are we talking about bolt-on type of transactions that are -- or do you see a scenario where we could be looking at larger scale things? Eric Carre : So let me start with M&A maybe. So our philosophy there is extremely focused on adding technology. So it's a bit of a build versus buy approach to complementing our technology budget. It is a bit opportunistic at time depending on what's available and the opportunities that we have. Over the years, we've also invested in complements like smaller businesses that we can easily add to existing product lines. So that's kind of the general view that we have on technology. From an overall strategy standpoint, and I'll let Jeff jump in. But we are where we need to be in terms of the businesses we want to compete in at this stage. So going to the other part of your question, Neil, around buybacks. So I'm not going to go into a lot of details, but generally speaking, we look at buybacks as being level loaded through 2023, which will obviously top off in terms -- in order to make sure that we meet our overall target of 50% or more. So we're thinking about buybacks really as a mechanism to return cash to shareholders. We're not really trying to trade in our shares. Jeff Miller : Let me just add to that as well. I mean I think the -- no surprises from us, our outlook on M&A hasn't changed, and it will stay that way. As we look at the capital allocation, we also want to continue, as Eric mentioned, opportunistically take out debt. We don't want to be sloppy about it, but kind of in the current market that we see, we have the opportunities to do things that are -- that make returns for the company, but we want to be crystal clear around what our minimum return was. It's clearly -- we'll work through that. But I would expect that by setting that minimum, I think it gives clarity to the marketplace that we will only do things that we believe add meaningful returns to the company. Operator : And our next question comes from Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler. Luke Lemoine : Jeff, your 4Q EBITDA margins firmly hopped in that kind of low 20% range here, basically at 14 levels, which was the target for '23, totally get there are some year-end sales there that skewed us higher in 4Q, but you're on the cusp of hitting 14 margins on an annual basis in '23. You and Lance kind of gave us a two year outlook almost two years ago. And I just wanted to see if maybe you could refresh this or expand upon it and how you see margins evolving over the next couple of years? Jeff Miller : When we did that a couple of years ago, when we looked at published estimates, clearly, we thought they were too low. And so we've made some clear commentary and an effort to correct that. Now as we look at the published REIT estimates today, they seem about right. And so I don't want to try to continue to do that over and over. And what I am is super excited about our outlook. Margins from here are up, revenue is up. I'm as confident in our outlook and our business as I have ever been. But I just want to be clear, in Q2 of '21, we wanted to be clear that we were pointing out what we felt was missing in the future Street estimates. And today, as I said, I think published Street estimates today are about right for the years ahead, both top line and profitability. Operator : Next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Chase Mulvehill : Jeff, I guess a quick follow-up or a question, maybe we can kind of dig in a little more on the international side. We spoke a little bit about this at dinner, but we get a lot of questions around confidence in multiyear growth on the international side. Obviously, we saw a strong growth last year and expectations are for another year of strong growth. I guess, could you speak to what you see for continued growth on the international side, once you get past '23 and kind of what gives you confidence that we will continue to see growth on the international side post this year? Jeff Miller : Well, I would just start with the underinvestment that we've seen for the last roughly eight years and really haven't caught up with that. And so if I just look broadly at kind of reserve replacement and availability, that portends a lot of years of recovery and we're in the early stages of that in a lot of ways. It takes time to get international projects up underway, a lot has to be renegotiated with different partners. And so I think that what we see building is the tender backlog and these are tender backlogs that go beyond a year, well beyond a year and that's consistent with sort of the slower recovery in spend that we typically see internationally. But I'm confident that that's basically what's required to recover and produce enough oil to meet demand. Beyond that, specifically dialog with customers, target set by countries, outlooks that nearly all international countries that produce oil have targets that are certainly above where they are today, less clarity about how they get there, which actually really does indicate more service intensity in terms of how they get there, which is more activity certainly for us. Chase Mulvehill : If I can pivot a little bit and follow up on some of the North America questions. Obviously, here, you've stated you talked about there's probably upside to North America that you don't see pricing pressure unfolding in pressure pumping, supply chain constraints, probably upside to demand. But we do get a lot of questions around pressure pumping and the risk of pricing. And really, those questions revolve around kind of lower tier fleets and kind of investors kind of asking about who has the high end fleet to the lower end fleet. So I don't know if you could take a moment and just talk about how many -- what percentage of your fleets are kind of Tier 2 diesel where if you were to see some pricing pressure, that's maybe where you would see it if you would see any? Jeff Miller : Look, I don't see that in our business today at any level of equipment. In fact, all equipment is called for. Clearly, we have a strong environmentally -- a low emissions fleet as well that's probably at the higher end of price deck. But even at the bottom end of the price deck, our equipment -- we've systematically replaced equipment over time. And so we're really pleased with the fleet that we have and even a Tier 2 dual fuel equipment is in demand, most certainly. But what I'm most impressed with actually is sort of the strong market pull that we see around our e-fleets. We've got strong customer demand and especially I'm seeing repeat customers, which is terrific, where it's not one but two to the same customer are all fully contracted. And I think that's just an indication of the strength of our technology, it's proven, proven technology. I believe it's a better mousetrap. And quite frankly, we have a very strong IP portfolio and I think that is going to continue to be important. Operator : Our next question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Congratulations and well done on the quarter. I'd like to come back to some of your guidance and expectations for the international market. As we look at '23, you said kind of 15% but bias to the upside of that. I was just curious what what finished the year strong in '22, maybe better than expectations and sort of feeds into that expectation of, let's say, at least mid-teens to higher as we think about international in '23. Jeff Miller : Look, I think it's sort of like everything is pointing at busier '23 than '22. That comes in the form of tender pipeline, that comes in form of sort of backlog increasing, product backlog that we've seen strengthened throughout the year and all of that sort of point -- I mean all of it points to '23, maybe even into '24. Discussions with customers, sort of the intensity of customers, view of staying busy and producing more barrels sooner rather than later. It's a very favorable market. And so it just gives me a lot of confidence in the outlook for '23 and particularly from our standpoint where we sit with technology and our global footprint. Roger Read : And then on the supply chain side, not just yours, but the one you see for the industry. Any areas you think continue to have, let's just call it, headwinds broadly as we look at '23, something that would slow project development or acceleration in '23? Jeff Miller : Yes, I don't see anything that slows things down. Are there things that have extended lead times today, we're still working through some of that. But I don't think anything meaningful gets in the way of getting started. I think we still see inflation in the marketplace. So that's one of the ways that we saw for getting things. But I don't think that it's going to be a headwind necessarily. We're starting to see rigs come back. There will be a lot of work around getting those ready in some places. But clearly, motivated customers and there will be some -- as I said, some inflation to get all of that done, but I don't see those as headwinds. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Gruber from Citi. Scott Gruber : Jeff, you mentioned a very full completion calendar here in the US. A quick question on that topic. Does that pertain to the fleets that the new e-frac fleet will be coming in to replace. My question relates to, is there work already lined up that would keep the legacy fleet fully deployed or those fleets need to be bid on to new jobs? Jeff Miller : Look, no, we've got everything as spoken for in '23, whether replacement or not, I think over time, e-fleets, replace fleets, but they don't do it initially. And so there'll be some period of time where fleets take the place of legacy fleets, but that's not what we see in \u201823, we see everything busy in '23. Scott Gruber : Got you, that's encouraging. And then turning to D&E margins, it's another nice year of expansion there. And obviously, you guys have had internal initiatives that structurally lift those margins, but you also have a number of tailwinds today from pricing to mix. How should we think about any incrementals this year you\u2019re willing to provide some color there? And overall, how should we think about where you could take D&E margins over the medium to longer term. I was looking back at our model and your D&E margins basically match where they were last cycle. So think about whether you guys can get to the 20% plus margin that you witnessed back in the late 2000s if this up cycle sustains? Jeff Miller : Look, I think that I've always said, we've invested in technology and D&E in a meaningful way. We expect those margins to continue to move up. As you just mentioned, they have consistently moved up and that's on the back of technology and footprint and where we are, and I expect that trajectory to continue beyond where we are today or where we were last cycle. And so the outlook would be to continue to stack year-on-year quarters that are better than the last year. And so I have a lot of confidence in our outlook for D&E where they could go '23 and beyond. Operator : And our next question, one moment, is from Stephen Gengaro from Stifel. Stephen Gengaro : So I think two things for me, if you don't mind. Can you talk a little bit on the domestic pressure pumping side. Obviously, I know you guys are pretty much sold out for the year. What are you seeing in the market as far as new build supply demand fundamentals as we look three, four, five quarters out, because I know you guys are -- you got your finger on the pulse there, I'm just curious what your take is on the overall market growth or lack thereof in supply? Jeff Miller : Look, I think the market is certainly undersupplied today. And I think that attrition is happening every day even if it doesn't happen necessarily at the fleet level, but it does happen at the unit level. And part of the way that got solved in 2022 was through industry consolidation. So that's one method of dealing with attrition is bringing in more inventory and equipment. And then the other, as I look out throughout the year, all of '23, I mean, half the capacity additions that we've heard about are electric. And I think what's being realized in the field is electric is harder to do than it looks. And from our perspective, we have proven technology, we have technology with a track record, and we have a very strong IP portfolio around frac. And so I think that combination gives me a lot of confidence, a, in where we are and also that the market won't be oversupplied. Stephen Gengaro : And just as a follow-up, we've seen consolidation in the US pressure pumping space. And some of the larger competitors are doing things to kind of make themselves have a higher revenue content at the well site, right, different types of vertical integration or well site integration. Have you seen any change in the competitive landscape at the well site? I mean, obviously, now everybody is busy. But just in general, has there been any change in the way your competitors are competing with Halliburton? Jeff Miller : No, I don't see any change there. when I think about sand -- you're talking about sand, and when I think about sand, we've got very good suppliers in the sand business. We work well with them. And then I think about competitive advantage, I mean, real competitive advantage. What are things that we do to create competitive advantage. And we want to spend our dollars on things where we do have clear competitive advantage, which is in this case, pumping technology and then drilling technology, software, things where we clearly have competitive advantage. I view sand clearly as an input, it's an important input, we need access to it but at the same time, don't want to overinvest in that part of the business. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to management for closing remarks. Jeff Miller : Thank you, Catherine. As we close out today's call, let me just close out with this. In this strong market for oilfield services, I am confident that Halliburton will execute on its strategic priorities and deliver financial outperformance. I look forward to speaking with you next quarter. You can close out the call. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Coleman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. David Coleman : Hello, and thank you for joining the Halliburton first quarter 2023 conference call. We will make the recording of today's webcast available on Halliburton's website after this call.  Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Carre, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings.  We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our first quarter earnings release and in the quarterly results and presentation section of our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Halliburton's performance in the first quarter again demonstrated the earnings power of our strategy, strong competitive position and execution for our customers. Here are some highlights from the first quarter. Total company revenue increased 33% compared to the first quarter of 2022 with strong activity in both North America and international markets. Operating income grew 91% year-over-year. Operating margin was 17%, a strong start to the year and 530 basis points over the first quarter of last year. International revenue grew 23% year-over-year with strong activity in all markets. North America revenue grew 44% year-over-year with growth across every basin. The Completion and Production division posted 20% margins, an increase of nearly 700 basis points year-over-year. The Drilling and Evaluation division grew revenue 17% year-on-year while margins expanded more than 100 basis points. Before we continue, I'd like to recognize the employees of Halliburton for their outstanding execution on every dimension of our business. safety, service quality and financial results. The work you do each day matters to our customers and shareholders. Thank you. I'll start with a few comments on the macro. Everything I see today validates the strength and duration of this multiyear upcycle. The world requires more energy from all sources, including oil and gas, driven by population growth and economic development.  Multiple years of structural underinvestment in oil and gas supply can only be addressed by strong activity over the next several years. The commodity price volatility experienced in the first quarter does not change our view of customer demand and a tight services market. Our customers around the world recognize this, and we expect their spending to grow in 2023 and beyond. Further, we expect much of this investment will be directed towards development activity, which is great for Halliburton as it drives outsized demand for our products and services. My view of this up cycle is confirmed by what I hear from our customers and see in the world's oil and gas markets. The Halliburton outlook for both the current year and the long term is strong. Now let's start with our performance in the international markets.  Our revenue in the first quarter grew 23% compared to the same period of last year, reflecting strong activity in all regions. Halliburton executed its strategy to deliver profitable international growth through leading technology offerings, improved pricing and disciplined capital allocation. I expect international spending to grow high teens for the year 2023, with most new activity coming from the Middle East, Asia and Latin America. I am confident in this outlook because we have a strong pipeline of awards that will commence later this year and beyond. Our completion tool order book grew 40% year-on-year in the first quarter, which generally represents work delivered within the current year. And finally, pricing continues to trend up for all product lines in all regions. I'm excited about all segments of our international business. Today, I'd like to provide more color on our offshore business. We generated nearly 45% of our international revenue in the first quarter from our offshore business.  Here are a few examples of differentiated technologies that drive a higher level of performance, service quality and reliability for our customers. Halliburton's intelligent drilling and logging while drilling platforms, iCruise and iStar in combination with LOGIX, our automation platform, delivered the longest reservoir section in a single run for a customer offshore Norway. Our latest wireline imaging technology, STRATA Examiner, delivered high resolution, borehole imaging data, allowing a customer to increase reserve estimates during a recent exploration campaign in the Mediterranean Sea. Halliburton's digital solutions allow our customers to reduce cost per barrel and increase efficiencies. Hess, Repsol and Petrobras, all recently selected Halliburton Landmark's DecisionSpace 365 applications powered by iEnergy Cloud. Our trusted science and machine learning algorithms enable customers to optimize subsurface, well construction and production-related decisions. Cognitive Halliburton's offshore automated cementing system delivers cement jobs remotely with minimal human direction and intervention. More than 30 cement jobs were completed this quarter in the North Sea alone.  Finally, I'm excited about the progress of our TechnipFMC alliance on all electric completions. I believe this technology will over time, substantially change the cost and performance of deepwater completions and subsea infrastructure. As I look at 2023 and beyond, I am excited about our international business. Our customers are clearly motivated to produce more oil and gas. Service capacity is tight and pricing is increasing. Our differentiated technologies and our execution drive margin improvements and growth across our international business. Turning to North America. As I expected, Halliburton achieved strong results despite volatile commodity prices. We delivered on our strategic priority to maximize value in North America through capital efficiency, differentiated technology and alignment with high-quality customers. I know it's on your minds. So let me briefly discuss the natural gas markets. First, I firmly believe that the gas market softness will be solved the 6 billion cubic feet per day of additional LNG export capacity comes online in the next 24 months. Second, in response to market conditions, we are moving 3 fleets from gas basins to oil basins to satisfy specific customer demands.  Finally, we retired 1 Tier 2 diesel fleet which will reduce our near-term maintenance costs and accelerate Halliburton's transition to e-fleets. These actions reduced our gas market exposure by about 30% and maintain financial returns. I reiterate my expectation that North America customer spending will grow at least 15% in 2023. At today's oil prices, I believe that our customers will execute their activity plans and the market for highly efficient equipment and quality services will remain tight. Our strategy is to maximize value in North America. Let me be crystal clear about what that looks like. First, we improved the performance and utilization of our existing fleet and we align with high-quality customers who value our operational efficiency and consistent execution. Here's what the customers are telling me. Halliburton's performance is different, not only better than your competitors, but even better than your own past performance.  Our step change in performance, safety and operational efficiency comes from our investments in new technologies, crew training and process improvements. As a result, today, we see a 60% improvement in pumping utilization across our entire North America land fleet since 2019. Second, we only deploy service capacity to attractive return opportunities. We are always finding ways to improve average fleet returns.  Finally, we invest in differentiated products and services that improve margins and asset velocity. Our patented Zeus e-fleet and SmartFleet are examples they maximize asset values for our customers and structurally improve returns for Halliburton. Our Zeus e-fleets continue to outperform for our customers and smart fleet adoption is accelerating. We delivered about 6x more smart fleet stages in the first quarter than a year ago. Halliburton's position and outlook in North America is strengthened by the uptake and contract duration of our e-fleets. The contracting structure for e-fleets, which we only deploy on multiyear contracts and our technology road map for the future, create structural strength in Halliburton's North America business. Halliburton's e-fleet technology is proven to deliver better performance, lower total cost of ownership and increased operating efficiency.  For customers with the mandate to produce barrels over the long term, and maximize the value of their investment dollars, the attraction to e-fleets is self-evident. To summarize, I believe Halliburton is uniquely positioned to deliver financial outperformance, our strong execution culture, differentiated technology portfolio and collaborative approach with customers give us a strong competitive advantage. I am confident that we will execute our strategic priorities and deliver shareholder returns by maximizing value in North America, delivering profitable international growth and driving capital efficiency. Before I turn it over to Eric, I'd like to leave you with 2 financial points. First, given my outlook, I expect the execution of our strategy will deliver significant and growing free cash flow. Second, while our previously announced capital return framework provides a minimum of 50% free cash flow back to shareholders, it also gives us the flexibility to return more cash to shareholders in the form of share buybacks. Everything I see today points towards more cash to shareholders.  Now I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric? Eric Carre : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let me begin with a summary of our first quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.7 billion, a 33% increase over the first quarter of last year while operating income was $977 million, an increase of 91% year-over-year. Operating margin for the company was 17.2% in the first quarter which is an increase of 530 basis points over the first quarter of 2022. These results were primarily driven by increased global activity, improved pricing and strong seasonal product and software sales. Our first quarter reported net income per diluted share was $0.72, which more than doubled from the same period last year. Beginning with our Completion and Production division, revenue in the first quarter was $3.4 billion, a 45% increase when compared to the first quarter of 2022 while operating income was $666 million, an increase of 125% when compared to the first quarter of 2022. C&P delivered an operating income margin of 20%, driven by increased activity, improved pricing and service efficiency in North America. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in the first quarter was $2.3 billion, an increase of 17% when compared to the first quarter of 2022, while operating income was $369 million an increase of 26% when compared to the first quarter of 2022. D&E delivered an operating income margins of 16% and driven by strong wireline, testing and drilling-related services globally and an uptick in international activity. Now let's move on to geographic results. Our first quarter international revenue increased 23% year-over-year due to solid product sales, activity increases and pricing gains across multiple product lines. In North America, revenue in the first quarter was $2.8 billion, a 44% increase when compared to the first quarter of 2022. This increase was primarily driven by increased stimulation activity and efficiencies, higher activity across our well construction product lines in North America land as well as higher activity across multiple product lines in the Gulf of Mexico. Latin America revenue in the first quarter was $915 million, a 40% increase when compared to the first quarter of 2022 due to increased well construction services and stimulation activity in Mexico and Argentina, and higher completion tool sales across the region. Europe Africa revenue in the first quarter was $662 million, a 2% decrease when compared to the first quarter of 2022 as a result of the sale of our Russian operations, along with decreased activity across multiple product service lines in Norway. This decrease was partially offset by increased well construction services and stimulation activity throughout Africa. Middle East Asia revenue in the first quarter was $1.3 billion, a 30% increase when compared to the first quarter of 2022 primarily due to improved activity across multiple product service lines in Saudi Arabia, higher completion tool sales, improved well construction services and increased project management activity across the region. Now I'd like to cover some additional financial items. In the first quarter, our corporate and other expenses was $58 million. For the second quarter, we expect our corporate expenses to be up about $5 million. Net interest expense for the quarter was $79 million. For the second quarter, we expect this expense to be about flat. Other net expense for the quarter was $69 million, primarily related to unfavorable foreign exchange movements. For the second quarter, we expect this expense to decline approximately $15 million. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter came in at approximately 21%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our second quarter effective tax rate to increase about 50 basis points. Capital expenditure for the first quarter were $268 million. We anticipate that our remaining capital expenditures will increase quarter-over-quarter into the end of the year and total capital expenditures to be approximately 6% of our revenue for the full year. Our first quarter cash flow from operations was $122 million, and free cash flow was a use of $105 million. These results were primarily driven by seasonal investments in working capital. As is typical for our business, we anticipate our cash flow will be back-end loaded for the year. We expect to generate strong free cash flow for the rest of 2023. As a step toward achieving Halliburton's capital return policy of returning at least 50% of annual free cash flow to shareholders, we repurchased approximately $100 million of common stock during the first quarter. Finally, turning to our near-term operational outlook. Let me provide you with some comments on how we see the second quarter unfolding. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect the seasonal revenue decline in software sales to be partially offset by further improvements in global drilling activity. As a result, we anticipate sequential D&E revenue to increase low to mid-single digits and margins to decline 50 to 100 basis points. In the Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to increase low to mid-single digits and margins to improve 25 to 75 basis points.  I will now turn the call back to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. Halliburton's performance in the first quarter demonstrated the earnings power of our strategy. My outlook for Halliburton is strong. I expect international year-on-year growth in the high teens North America growth in excess of 15%. And finally, everything I see today points towards more cash to shareholders. And now let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dave Anderson with Barclays. Dave Anderson : So let's just get right into it. Despite the strong numbers you put up in North America this quarter and the guide for second quarter, we kind of firmed up everything. The bear case has been heating up during the quarter with the rig count softening a bit. A&P suggesting pricing is poised to come down. On the other hand, we're hearing from you, other service companies that you don't see this slowdown. In fact, prices continue to rise. I wonder if you help kind of help us start up the disconnect here. Does the difference line to customer mix? I know you highlighted the gas market and particularly weak. Is the differentiation of equipment just a lot of rhetoric keep during the quarter. I'm just wondering how we should be thinking about your U.S. land activity and the pricing trends in the second half. Jeff Miller : Yes. Well, thanks, Dave. Look, prices aren't moving down. And I think from our comments, I've told you what we've done and what we plan to do. Overall margin improvement comes from structurally bifurcated market, as you described, demand for high-quality services are very much in demand and hard to deliver. And quite frankly, the cost of the frac hasn't changed. I mean the engines are moving up. There's still inherent inflation in the frac business today. So there's not a connection there. And so as I look out at the rest of the year, we continue to improve the earnings power of our fleet through bifurcation, delivery of these fleets, retirement of -- it needs to be retired, be clear, not stacked, but retired. And then finally, efficiency and sort of repositioning around better pricing. Dave Anderson : But pricing in your mind, continues to move higher. And I would assume that pricing from last year still continue to roll through your fleets? Jeff Miller : I would say on average. Yes. Dave Anderson : And if I could just shift gears over on the international side, your Middle East business doesn't get a ton of credit on the street, despite actually being just as big as kind of 1 of your bigger peers on a relative sense, I was wondering if you could talk about how you see the pace of activity progressing this year in the Middle East. Are you still ramping up on contracts? I think you had kind of alluded to that in your prepared remarks, but what is -- also what is your outlook on tenders in the Middle East this year? And I guess, finally, should we expect to see a lift in D&E margins next year based upon what you're seeing in pricing activity levels this year in the Middle East? Jeff Miller : Yes. Look, pricing is improving. And so -- and I would expect D&E margins to improve along with that. I would still argue early innings of activity increase in the Middle East I'm pleased with our growth. So thank you for pointing that out. But I see this continuing rig counts aren't necessarily at near peak. And I think we've got a lot of opportunity to continue to run. And then broadly, international, it's beyond the Middle East, pleased with the growth that we saw in the first quarter. And just a reminder to to everyone that in Q1 of '22, Russia was 2% of our business. And so that's really pretty strong growth. Operator : We have a question from Arun Jayaram with JP Morgan. Arun Jayaram : Jeff, just digesting service prints and outlooks thus far, we are seeing or observing more resilient conditions in U.S. frac versus drilling. I wanted to get your thoughts on why do you think this is the case? And how do you see things playing out in terms of your drilling-related segments at Sperry in North America over the balance of the year? Jeff Miller : Yes. Look, I think wells drilled in North America really a function of DUC count. So as the DUCs get drawn down, more wells have to be drilled. And so I think fluctuation in drilling. And it's interesting that you see fluctuation in drilling, but a very steady march in terms of frac. And I think some of that is managing cost at the margin. but the fact is they don't produce more without fracking wells. And so I'm not surprised to see that. I think our D&E business in North America remains strong. confident on what we're seeing there. We continue to sort of make gains in the drilling part of the business. And I would say the other service lines are very strong. Arun Jayaram : Great. Great. And just my follow-up, Jeff, you mentioned that you have some sort of relationship with FTI on the electric side. I was wondering if you could maybe give us some more details on that partnership? Jeff Miller : Yes. Look, this is an opportunity to mine what the 2 companies really do well. And they're particularly areas where we overlap, and we're taking advantage of that. We've been working on a series of things and 1 of which is all electric completions for about 5 years is -- and we just signed up for another 5 years with TSMC. So great partner in this area. What we've delivered ultimately will be, I think, a revolutionary all-electric solution. They really only -- it takes the 2 of us to solve for, it's not the bulk of either 1 of our businesses. But the fact is in this narrow space, we bring some really unique synergies and opportunity to develop technology. And so very pleased with the relationship and the progress that we're making up to and including we're jointly marketing and selling some solutions today. Operator : Our next question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. James West : So Jeff, I know you spend, guys, probably 60-plus percent of your time on the road seeing customers and a lot of that -- the majority of that internationally could you maybe describe the customer conversations at this point where they are with their sense of urgency, where the pushback is, if any, with pricing? Or is there more concern about availability is kind of how we're thinking about the cycle as it takes off from here. And just curious to hear what you're hearing on the ground. Jeff Miller : Yes. Thanks, James. The discussion is more around availability than anything else. Whether it's services that we provide capital more importantly, availability of tools and people. And a lot of the planning, we're even doing planning today -- I mean, deep planning today for '24 activity that we expect to ramp up and so there's enough concern around availability in '24 that significant resources are committed now to solving for that. So I've got a lot of confidence in the runway internationally and the amount of work that we've won. James West : Okay. That's great. That's good to hear. And then on North America, the 15% plus growth that you're anticipating in forecasting for this year -- is there -- how much -- I guess, could you describe how much of that you think is just kind of the pure inflation in the market, whether it's rig rates or fractured costs, that kind of stuff versus rig count or activity led growth? Jeff Miller : Yes, James. It's -- I think it's a combination of the 2 and certainly the more activity you have, the more sort of replacing type you see. But if I just sort of look back to look forward, if I take last year, 5% production growth last year, year-on-year translated into about 50% revenue growth for us. I know in '23, the outlook is for, let's say, 3 production growth. And I think published estimates at least today around operator CapEx or 17% or so. I think it says a couple of things. Number one, producing oil doesn't get easier, meaning it demands more of our services and higher quality services. And so I'm confident that we're going to maximize value in North America. And I think that combination of activity and and price is what delivers the north of 15%. Operator : Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Congrats on the quarter there. Just a couple of things to follow up on, Jeff. Your comment in the opening about 45% of your international coming from offshore and obviously talking a little bit about planning for '24, which greater visibility on offshore, a lot of times than others. I was just curious how you see that potentially changing. Does it increase as a percentage of mix? And how should we think about that in terms of enhanced visibility, top line growth and maybe margin expansion? Jeff Miller : Yes. Thanks. Look, I'm pleased with the growth on a percentage basis of our position in offshore or the amount of offshore work that we're doing. Look, I think it continues to grow and I expect our position as we continue to bring out the types of technologies I talked about continue to help drive our growth in offshore work. And so we are levered heavily to offshore, and this is all service lines or levered to offshore. And I think that as we see that business grow, I expect, yes, it does translate into top line growth and margin growth. And I think that what's clear though, also is it higher service intensity, but it also requires more equipment to do offshore work. So it has a bit of a double effect in terms of growing revenues and margins, but it also tightens up the rest of the business by virtue of consuming backup tools and additional shifts of people. And so as offshore grows, that has a tightening effect really on everything, which again, helps to drive better margins and better growth. Roger Read : Okay. And then mine related follow-up on that. You mentioned the Smart frac had picked up quite a bit in the U.S. I think it was up 6x roughly versus a year ago. Any thoughts to what that growth rate is going forward? And should we anticipate sort of any change in terms of margins as that goes forward, positive, negative or unchanged? Jeff Miller : Yes. Look, I think that, that growth continues at sort of that pace. This is 1 of those solutions that is very affordable and scalable and provides important data to operators particularly as the focus becomes productivity per foot. And so this is really the best way, maybe the only way to meaningfully measure where the sand goes. And as a result of that, that's the building block of what produces more of what's better complexity, where is the sand, what's the most efficient solution. And so I expect that continues to grow at a very fast pace and we've continued to introduce more technology around that solution so that it's easier to deploy and ultimately -- this is 1 of those things that our target is to be the most efficient solution in the marketplace. And as it scales, it becomes more valuable to us and in my view, it's a very sticky solution because it's 1 of those things that once you have that data, and it becomes part of a working process, then it becomes very sticky over time. Operator : Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : First question is about the comments about moving 3 frac fleets from gas to oil basins. Can you talk about whether you see more potential for this to happen? What are some of the switching costs associated with that? And is this the beginning of a greater trend? Jeff Miller : Well, look, I think what we demonstrated is that's what we're going to do. Clearly, gas economics are challenged today. And I don't think it's something that service prices solve. And so I think gas is incredibly important, and I expect that it continues. But -- and even get stronger as we build into the LNG capacity that gets built here in the U.S. But along the way, we see opportunities for unmet demand in oil, and we've made the moves we described. We also want to accelerate our fleet as a percentage of our overall fleet, which requires that we retire fleets along the way. And so from our perspective, that is the path that we take. Now I think it's -- gas operators are continuing to operate, and they are working and really to that end, actually just placed an e-fleet into a gas basin with an operator. So there's clearly an outlook that gas recovers. Neil Mehta : And then can you talk about the return of capital comments. You had mentioned you could see a scenario where you go in excess of the 50% of free cash flow back to shareholders. So Talk about how you're thinking about using the buyback as a tool to create value. Jeff Miller : Well, as I described, our outlook is strong. I expect we generate a lot of free cash flow. And yes, I believe that as we do that, we'll be able to return more cash to shareholders. And so we took a step in Q1. But obviously, the ability to the flex there is going to be with share buybacks. Operator : We have a question from Scott Gruber from Citi. Scott Gruber : Just to understand that same line of inquiry given the appetite to go above the 50% threshold, Jeff, is there an appetite to pursue buybacks with bigger here near term when the stock is is quite attractively priced? Or do you wait until the cash flows show up later this year and risk buying at a higher price if the fundamentals stay tied as you foresee? Eric Carre : Yes, Scott, it's Eric. So generally speaking, how we think about cash returns today is -- I mean, obviously, we just raised the dividend. We intend to continue to do small bolt-on acquisition, technology-driven type acquisition, continue to chip at the debt as well as we go along. But clearly, today, the bias is towards increasing buyback as we go through the year. So yes, directionally, that's correct. Scott Gruber : Got it. And then an unrelated follow-up. I'm just looking at your year-on-year incrementals in D&E, and they appear quite strong. And I would guess this is largely driven by operating leverage and mix around offshore and technology, just given previous commentary. And I would guess pricing is less impactful today at this juncture with potentially more of a price contribution in the years ahead. Is that a fair assessment? Or is pricing having a significant impact here already in 2Q if you look year-on-year at D&E margins? Jeff Miller : Well, pricing certainly has improved year-on-year. But I think more importantly is the the depth of the technology that we're introducing is sort of the duration. And I don't want to get away from that. It's not a point in time. I think we've got pricing improving, but at the same time, we've got substantial capital efficiency happening also in terms of the technology. So the -- we've been pretty clear about the technology that we are investing in is driving capital efficiency, which means that we capture more of the value and cash flow over time. And so I would expect to see the margin improvement that you saw this quarter year-on-year to continue in terms of incrementals. And I say it that way. I've always said that our expectation is that we stack improvement each quarter in terms of margins in D&E. And expect that to continue to happen. Obviously, there's some intra-year cyclicality. But I think the key is if we look at each year by quarter, then we ought to be stacking improvements quarter-on-quarter. And I think we've got a long runway ahead of us in D&E. Scott Gruber : But it just sounds like it's more of the kind of structural investments you made around technology and driving your asset turns and mix more than pricing today. Is that fair, Jeff? Jeff Miller : Yes, I think that is reasonable to say. Operator : We have a question from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Chase Mulvehill : Jeff. I guess maybe if we can kind of hit on free cash flow. If we think about your outlook, your North America outlook was maintained. And it looks like you kind of bumped up your international outlook so I'm guessing that it would probably imply a bump to your free cash flow outlook. I think last quarter, you said free cash flow should grow at least 20%, which seemed conservative when you gave it so with a better international outlook and still maintain North America. Any updates on how we should be thinking about 2023 free cash flow? Eric Carre : Yes, This -- it's Eric. So directionally, as you said, we're very confident in the outlook of the business, the kind of profile of free cash flow. Typically, we're going to start generating meaningful free cash flow in Q2 and in H2 as we're done with the buildup of working capital we did in Q1. And directionally, -- you're right. Our outlook right now is more north of 30%, then it was 20% in Q1. So yes, we're revising our projections up. Chase Mulvehill : Okay. Awesome. And then unrelated follow-up, you highlighted a lot of digital wins in your press release and also in your prepared remarks today. So question around this, and are you starting to see more digital adoption by your customers? And if so, what's been the catalyst for accelerated adoption I'm going to give this 1 to try and in any chance that you could speak to how material digital revenues are today for Halliburton? Jeff Miller : Yes. I think the adoption is going to always be around business cases and what creates value for customers. And I think the idea that we're just going to go digital has started and stopped because it was proven unsuccessful. And so what we see is now more meaningful adoption around real solutions, software solutions and automation solutions -- it is a big business, but it's not one -- it's one that's sort of spread throughout the business as well. And so I think that we tend to think about it in 2 buckets. We tend to think about it as software is 1 activity and automation as another. And both are generated sort of from the same technical capacity by that, I mean the capacity to do software at scale, a lot of that resident and Landmark, the software business sort of being 1 thing and then the automation, which is many of the same tools maybe buy differently throughout the rest of the business. And it has a meaningful effect on our performance margin outlook, it's going to have -- it will continue to do that. Even in our offshore in the drilling business in terms of automation of the drilling tools can do and probably equally onshore North America in terms of what we can do with frac fleets from a maintenance and performance standpoint. It's not something we necessarily advertise, but it's very inherent in the type of performance and efficiency that we see today. Operator : Our next question comes from Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler. Luke Lemoine : Jeff you reached your international growth outlook this year from at least mid-teens to high teens. Can you unpack this a little bit? And maybe just talk about what's changed, what's accelerating and what you have more confidence in? Jeff Miller : Yes. I think I have more confidence in number -- well, really 3 things. One, the indicators that we're looking at things like completion tool order book, which has grown meaningfully and that all focuses on this year. I would say, pricing sort of improvement that we're seeing, pricing and tightness around equipment around the world internationally is another meaningful one. And then finally, just we're winning awards and we're growing. We're selective about the awards we're winning. Again, our strategy is profitable international growth. emphasizing the profit part of that statement. But at the same time, we are seeing success and we're seeing success in a lot of different markets. And so because of that, we see a path to sort of high teens. Luke Lemoine : Got it. Good deal. And then maybe on the geo market, you touched on the Middle East growth earlier, but could you expand on what you're seeing in Asia and Latin America for the balance of the year? Jeff Miller : Yes. I'm seeing Asia, again, pick up, particularly in terms of development type work, which is obviously right there in our wheelhouse. And then also in Latin America, clearly, we see activity growth in Brazil. But really throughout the region, we see the imperative to produce more oil and gas. And clearly, oil and gas is an important part of the economies of Latin America. And so there's a lot of motivation to be more effective and to deliver more oil and gas, partly for economic reasons and for tax revenues. But I think I'm really encouraged by what we see. Operator : We have a question from Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Stephen Gengaro : So curious, when we look at U.S. pressure pumping world, a lot of the competitors have expanded services at the well site. I mean going through all things from vertical integration to well site integration. How are you seeing it from your eyes as far as how it impacts how, how it impacts pricing and your profitability in the business at the wellsite. Jeff Miller : Well, we view all of this very strategically in the sense of we're looking at returns, long-term returns and where we create value in terms of competitive advantage. And so we don't -- vertical integration for the sake of vertical integration, in my view, is not necessarily creating more value, what we're doing in the frac space and really, in every business that we're in is focused on where do we create technical differentiation. So what our creates competitive advantage for Halliburton. And so when I think about what we've done with electric fleets, what we've done with the smart fleet really meaningful things. The inputs to the business are the inputs to the business and those are may be good businesses for others. But there are places where we create competitive advantage. So for that reason, it's not just how much volume can we capture around the wellbore. It's really where can we capture volume and create competitive advantage. And so I like where we are in our approach to it. Stephen Gengaro : And then just as a quick follow-up, are you seeing tightness in sand? And is that a profit center for you and any material movements in that over the last couple of quarters? A \u2013 Jeff Miller : No. Not a lot of movement in the last few quarters. And again, I view it like all inputs to our business. It\u2019s going to fluctuate at different times, different levels. There\u2019s a lot of sand in the world, and it\u2019s quite available. So I don\u2019t view that as a long-term impediment to anything that we\u2019re trying to do just given the availability and really how to go about producing it. Operator : And that's all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Jeff Miller for any closing remarks. Jeff Miller : Yes. Thank you, and thank you all for participating in today's call. Let me close out the call with just a couple of comments. First, Halliburton's performance in the first quarter demonstrated the earnings power of our strategy. And then secondly, my outlook for Halliburton is strong and everything I see today points towards more cash to shareholders. I look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Let's close out the call. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today David Coleman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. David Coleman : Hello! And thank you for joining the Halliburton Second Quarter 2023 Conference Call. We will make a recording of today's webcast available for seven days on Halliburton's website after this call.  Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO and Eric Carre, Executive Vice President and CFO. Some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements.  These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other securities and exchange commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.  Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our second quarter earnings release and in the quarterly results and presentation section of our website.  Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you, David, and good morning everyone. In the second quarter Halliburton once again delivered strong results driven by service quality, outstanding execution and strong global demand for high quality and high performance oilfield services. Let's get right to the highlights. Total company revenue increased 14% year-over-year. Operating income grew 41% compared to second quarter of 2022 adjusted operating income. International revenue grew 17% year-over-year with strong activity in all markets. North America revenue grew 11% year-over-year.  Our Completion and Production division revenue grew 19% year-over-year, while margins expanded by 320 basis points. Our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue grew 7% year-over-year, while margins expanded nearly 300 basis points. Finally, we generated $1.1 billion of cash from operations, $798 million of free cash flow, and repurchased approximately $250 million worth of shares during the quarter.  Halliburton delivered an impressive first half of 2023. I'd like to thank our employees for these outstanding results. Thank you for executing on our mainstays and strategy delivery. Now, let's turn to what I see in the markets and what I believe is driving this multi-year upcycles duration. Demand for oil and gas is strong as demonstrated by demand growth of 2 million barrels per day in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year. Oil and gas continues to demonstrate its critical role in the global economy and meeting long term demand requires sustained capital investment.  Commodity prices remain attractive. When I talk to customers they expect to work more, not less, and many of their activity plans extend into the next decade. Customers are settling in for a long duration upcycle. Overall, I expect upstream spending to grow in 2023 and beyond. For this year, I expect International and North America customer spending growth in the high teens and around 10% respectively compared to last year, despite reduced rig count and completion activity in the U.S.  Now let's start with our performance in the international markets. Revenue in the second quarter grew 17% compared to the same period of last year with strong activity across both divisions. Today more than 20% of our tender pipeline represents incremental activity, which is as high as I can recall.  Equally important, in addition to strong growth in the Middle East and Latin America, we see steady growth in activity across the globe. In this environment, I expect quality services and equipment to remain tight and pricing to continue to improve.  Halliburton's strategy is to deliver a profitable international growth. We are clear in how we do this, through differentiated technology offerings, selective contract wins, and a unique collaborative approach to working with our customers. Our differentiated technology and digital portfolio deliver high quality and high performance to our customers in all markets. Here are some examples.  Our drilling and LWD technology platforms deliver better reliability, data capture, and efficiency for our customers, while structurally expanding our margins. We build and deploy leading-edge drilling equipment that requires less capital to build and operate, compared to the prior generation of equipment. One example, for a customer in the Middle East, Halliburton achieved a world record for the longest well ever drilled, with a measured depth of over 51,000 feet, using Halliburton's iCruise, iStar and LOGIX Technologies. Our leading position in Completions Technology is unlocking production for customers. We recently set another world record with the successful installation of the first 12 ZONE intelligent completion for a Middle East offshore customer using Halliburton's SmartWell technology on our eCompletions Platform. In our digital business, Equinor joins several other customers in selecting Landmark\u2019s DecisionSpace 365 as their standard subsurface data interpretation tool.  During the second quarter, our Landmark software business closed on the acquisition of Resoptima, a leader in advanced ensemble modeling at the reservoir level. I'm excited about Resoptima's technology, both standalone and how it accelerates Landmark's roadmap for next-generation reservoir modeling technology. Now, turning to collaboration. Our value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers and our mainstay processes define how we consistently differentiate our services. This is the source of our competitive advantage. Our value proposition creates an environment where our customers and Halliburton collectively perform better.  A recent example of this is Halliburton and V\u00e5r Energi's announcement of a long-term strategic relationship for drilling services. I expect we will demonstrate with V\u00e5r, as we have with other customers, that our collaborative approach creates significantly better operational and financial performance for both the customer and Halliburton.  Our international strategy works. Our differentiated, cost-effective technologies and collaborative approach with customers empower us to strategically target work where we see a competitive advantage and a clear path to outperform financially.  Turning to North America, we delivered a solid quarter. North America revenue grew 11% versus the same period last year, and margins were sequentially flat versus the last quarter. Looking ahead into the second half, I expect overall market activity in North America will be slightly lower than in the first half.  More importantly, I expect Halliburton's North America margins to remain strong for the balance of the year. Our results in North America clearly demonstrate the success of our strategy to maximize value. We do this through capital efficiency, differentiated technology, and alignment with high-quality customers.  During our last call, I outlined the steps we took in North America land to maintain pricing and deploy service capacity to attractive return opportunities or retire old equipment to further accelerate Halliburton's transition to our electric fleets. Executing on our strategy during the second quarter, we deployed additional Zeus fleets on multi-year contracts, while retiring additional diesel equipment.  Demand for our Zeus e-fleets is strong. In fact, during the second quarter we signed more multi-year Zeus contracts than in any prior quarter. The multi-year duration of these contracts provides both stability and secure economic returns, which furthers my confidence in the strength of our margins. I continue to be impressed by the performance of our Zeus e-fleets and the optimization and efficiencies that come with scale. Our current system is the result of multiple iterations over several years and our continuous improvement processes. Every element of the value chain, from design and manufacturing to operations and maintenance, is continuously improved. Our advances in pump technology and system design result in higher horsepower density and pump efficiency.  With Octave, we are automating equipment operation for consistency and reliability. We work to be the best at getting better. Today, Zeus is a fully integrated system. We deliver new equipment on time that works right out of the box and on average this year our e-fleets pumped over 10% more hours than our high-performance diesel fleets.  For our customers, these improvements mean better performance and even lower total cost of ownership. For Halliburton, these improvements mean we further widen the moat around our growing e-fleet business. In all markets, international and North America, I believe our strategies yield improved financial results. Let's look at the steady growth and margin expansion in D&E. This is the result of a structural change and technology overhaul that began several years ago.  Our leading drilling platforms are lower cost and higher performance than the prior generation, which drives higher asset velocity and higher returns. In our testing business, our FloConnect Surface well testing service provides a safe, efficient, and automated platform to our customers, while lowering our overall operating costs. In our Wireline business, our Xaminer platform provides high quality reservoir data, reduces subsurface uncertainty, and allows us to win high-value exploration work. Finally, across all product lines, automation and remote operations are beginning to transform service delivery, driving higher quality and reliability, while lowering total cost of service delivery. Looking through any quarterly fluctuations and seasonality, I fully expect D&E margins will continue to expand over time. Our strategy also generates strong free cash flow, and our capital return framework returns cash to our shareholders. I expect over 50% of free cash flow will be returned to shareholders this year.  I am pleased with where we are today. In the last 18 months we retired $1.2 billion of debt, strengthening our balance sheet; twice increased our quarterly dividend, which forms the stable foundation of our capital return framework; and finally, repurchased approximately $600 million worth of shares, including approximately $250 million this quarter. I fully expect that the execution of our strategy in this long duration upcycle will deliver better returns, more free cash flow, and more cash back to shareholders.  Now, I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric. Eric Carre : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Before I begin the financial review, I'd like to discuss one item. In the second quarter, we kicked off our SAP S4 upgrade and recorded a $13 million expense, or about $0.01 per diluted share, in our Q2 operating results. Future expenses will be both included in our operating results and in our quarterly guidance. Here are a few more details on the upgrade.  This upgrade will take place over the next 2.5 years, concluding around Q4, 2025. We expect it to provide efficiencies, cost savings, and advanced analytics that will benefit Halliburton and our customers. The total project investment should be approximately $250 million, $50 million this year, and $100 million in each of the next two years. Upon completion, we expect significant ongoing savings, which will pay back the investment in about three years.  Now, let me move on to our quarterly results. Our second quarter reported net income per diluted share was $0.68. Excluding the effect of the transaction in Argentina, our adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.77.  Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.8 billion, a 2% sequential increase, while operating income was $1 billion, a sequential increase of 4%. Operating margin for the company was 17.4% in the second quarter, a 329 basis points increase over second quarter of 2022 adjusted operating margin. These results were primarily driven by strong international activity across both divisions, along with improved pricing.  Beginning with our completion and production division, revenue in the second quarter was $3.5 billion, a 2% sequential increase, while operating income was $707 million, an increase of 6% sequentially. C&P delivered an operating income margin of 20%. These results were due to increased activity from multiple product lines in international markets and higher artificial lift activity in North America.  In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in the second quarter was $2.3 billion, a sequential increase of 2%, while operating income was $376 million, a sequential increase of 2%. D&E delivered an operating income margin of 16%. These results were driven by higher drilling activity and increased fluid services in key regions including Middle East and Latin America, partially offset by seasonal roll-off of software sales across multiple regions. Now, let's move on to geographic results. Our second quarter international revenue increased 7% sequentially due to solid product sales, activity increases and pricing gains across multiple product lines. These results were impacted by lower software sales in the eastern hemisphere.  In North America, revenue in the second quarter was $2.7 billion, a 2% decrease sequentially. This decline was primarily driven by decreased stimulation activity in U.S. land, partially offset by increased artificial lift activity in U.S. land and higher activity across multiple product service lines in the Gulf of Mexico.  Latin America revenue in the second quarter was $994 million, a 9% increase sequentially, resulting from higher completion tool sales in Brazil and improved activity across multiple product service lines in Mexico and Argentina. Partially offsetting this increase is reduced activity in the Caribbean across multiple product service lines.  Europe/Africa revenue in the second quarter was $698 million, a 5% increase sequentially. This improvement was primarily driven by increased fluid services across the region and higher completion tool sales in Angola and Norway.  Middle East/Asia revenue in the second quarter was $1.4 billion, a 6% increase sequentially, largely resulting from higher completion tool sales in Saudi Arabia and higher Wireline activity, drilling services, and stimulation activity in the region. This improvement was partially offset by decreased project management activity in Saudi Arabia.  Moving on to other items. In the second quarter, our corporate and other expenses was $59 million. For the third quarter, we expect our corporate expenses to increase by about $5 million to $10 million.  As noted earlier, in the second quarter we spent $13 million or about $0.01 per diluted share on SAP S4 migration, which is included in our operating results. For the third quarter, we expect these expenses to be approximately $20 million or about $0.02 [ph] per diluted share.  Net interest expense for the quarter was $92 million. The increase this quarter was primarily related to the reduction of interest income as a result of the Argentina transaction. For the third quarter, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat. Other net expense for the quarter was $32 million. For the third quarter, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat.  Our effective tax rate for the second quarter came in at approximately 21.3%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our third quarter effective tax rate to increase by approximately 50 basis points. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $303 million. We anticipate that for the full year, capital expenditure will be approximately 6% of our revenue. Our second quarter cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion and free cash flow was $798 million. We expect to generate free cash flow for the full year 2023; that is 30% to 40% higher than last year. Finally, we repurchased $248 million of our common stock during the second quarter. Now, turning to our near-term operational outlook. Let me provide you with some comments on how we see the third quarter unfolding. In our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to be essentially flat with the second quarter and margins to remain approximately flat. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate sequential revenue to increase in the low single digits and margins to increase 25 to 75 basis points.  I will now turn the call back to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. Our international business is growing at a strong pace across all regions. I expect our differentiated technology offerings, selective contract wins, and our unique collaborative approach to working with our customers to deliver higher international margins and growth for Halliburton.  Our strategy to maximize value in North America is driven by capital efficiency, differentiated technology and alignment with high-quality customers. I expect this will allow us to generate solid financial performance. I expect that the execution of our strategy in this long-duration upcycle will deliver better returns, more free cash flow, and more cash back to shareholders.  And now, let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of David Anderson with Barclays. David Anderson : Hi! Good morning, Jeff. A - Jeff Miller : Hey! David Anderson : So, North America's slowing down a bit. International's starting to accelerate, to be expected. But I was wondering if you could perhaps take a bit of a step back and talk about how you see the primary markets trending in the next kind of 12 to 24 months in terms of NAM [ph], Middle East, and offshore. Maybe set LATAM aside, which has been a steady growth market.  I guess my question is, in terms of the cadence, how do you see the trajectory of each of these markets playing out? You lowered NAM spend. I think you were saying 10% up from down from 15%. So is that kind of flattish in the second half of the year? And then how do you see the ramp up in the Middle East and then the timing of offshore? I know it's a lot, but maybe kind of this bigger picture, how you see those markets trending [inaudible]? A - Jeff Miller : Certainly. And look, I'm as confident as I have ever been in the duration, the long duration of this cycle. And that's rooted in attractive commodity price and really the growth in demand for oil, so I'll start there.  I think the offshore piece of this, we're super excited about it. If we include Gulf of Mexico, we're eclipsing 50% of our revenues internationally are offshore, and so all of our service lines are represented there.  I think the cadence as I look over the next year, let's say year or so, I mean it just takes time to get this work underway. I'm just back from a trip and we were looking at projects that, you know they have to get rigs, get plans, get agreement from governments, but it's starting and I expect it continues to build into \u201824 and beyond. I mean, these are the kinds of projects that take a decade to do and so\u2026 You know Middle East, I see the same thing. The number of rigs being mobilized in the Middle East, that takes some time to do. But we are beginning to see it. We are seeing it, but my view is that we\u2019ll continue to build over the next 12 or 24 months.  Coming back to North America, I gave you an outlook on the second half of the year. But I think what's most important is, when I look into \u201824, I mean commodity markets are getting more constructive, oil prices firming up, gas seems to have found its footing you know and expect that ramps. We're seeing some consolidation with customers and that means that bigger customers do more planning through the cycle. They are committed to executing plans over a longer term and service intensity in North America never lets up. In fact, it only gets harder and you can't \u2013 you got to \u2013 you got to work harder just to stand still. So all of this is constructive for Halliburton's business as I look out into \u201824 and beyond. And you know, and some of that in North America, I mean just that it\u2019s backed up by the pace of e-fleet contracts that we're seeing. We've had more contracts last quarter. We've even signed another one this quarter, and that's really for work that starts in \u201824 and goes \u201824, \u201825, \u201826. So, there are a lot of reasons that I see \u201824 looking super strong for us. David Anderson : And then, Jeff, maybe we can just kind of get into the heart of kind of where a lot of the chatter has been during the quarter. Obviously, rig count has been falling. We've been hearing about pricing and pumping getting softer. Of course, a lot of this is coming from your competitors who would love to pay less for these services.  Can you give us some insight in kind of what you're seeing in the pricing trend? Is the softness kind of really stuck on the Tier 2 side? In your comments you talked about your Zeus fleets holding up. Is the Tier 4 holding up? What do you see on the competitive pricing side? If you can just kind of give us some more context here, because we just kind of hear these kind of generalized comments and I have a feeling there's more to it. I was wondering if you could provide some more context please. A - Jeff Miller : Well, I think that \u2013 you know I've told you what we're doing, which is retiring older equipment and transitioning to electric and so I think that's an important factor. We really don't see, we don't participate in the bottom part of that market particularly at all, really where that\u2019s the spot type market. Most of our work, I'd say over 70% of our work is with large privates and publics and so \u2013 you know these are customers that execute their plans and they do execute their plans.  And from our perspective, the performance \u2013 we continue to see our performance improving, okay, even as we add electric, but also even on our diesel fleets. And differentiated service performance, technology is getting better. I mean those are things that drive not only margins, but they are also part of the dialogue around what's it take to actually run a high-performing business that requires engines, transmissions and people. And we really haven't seen any deflation in those things. Operator : Our next question comes from a line of Arun Jayaram with JP Morgan. Arun Jayaram : Hey Jeff, maybe just a follow-up to David's question. One question we get is, how do softer conditions called in the spot market influence pricing on your dedicated fleets or as you start some of your price negotiations on 2024 in North America? Jeff Miller : Well look, I think that \u2013 you know again, we've got a little exposure to the spot as I described. I would say broadly, as we look ahead, high-performance, high-quality services really matter and we see a lot of bifurcation there and we're going to continue with our e-fleet rollout, which is sort of a whole different category of service. It's actually lower cost or better performance for our clients, but also lowers our total cost of ownership. And so I would say we're planning to deliver high-quality service and we really don't see any point in burning up equipment with no margins, that's not a good direction. It actually has longer-lasting impacts if surface equipment isn't taken care of. Arun Jayaram : Okay, fair enough. And Jeff, I wanted to get your thoughts on offshore. Obviously, one of the trends the market has been observing is just strength in offshore markets. Could you talk about how it's positioned from a product line perspective offshore and what you're seeing perhaps in the Gulf of Mexico to mitigate maybe some of the risk of lower activity in North America? A - Jeff Miller : Well look, we're heavily levered towards the offshore business. In fact, all of our service lines participate in our offshore business and we've got leading positions in cementing and HCT. You know our drilling business, we've talked a lot about where we're going with drilling and Wireline and so that's an important business for us. It is higher service intensity, which means that it takes more equipment to do and so we really like that. I expect the Gulf of Mexico continues to strengthen. And again, we talked about last quarter, sort of the percentage of our offshore international business anyway as a percentage continues to grow. And so I think that the offshore business is going to be very important for Halliburton, and the Gulf of Mexico and all around the world. Operator : Our next question comes from a line of James West with Evercore ISI. James West : Hey! Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Eric. Jeff Miller : Morning. Eric Carre : Good morning, James. James West : -: Jeff Miller : Look, it's not a perfect science in terms of one-in, one-out, but it\u2019s generally one-in, one-out over time. And so the type of equipment for example that we would retire is typically higher cost to maintain, and so when we retire a fleet, we sort of blow the parts back into the current fleet and that lowers the cost or improves the margins of the existing fleet. But we're replacing \u2013 say replacing \u2013 we're adding equipment only as it's demanded by clients, so that's the difference. We're not building it to replace it. We're building it for contracts where there is commitment to return the capital and also the return on capital inside of the contract, and so that's what's driving the pace of replacement. James West : Okay, okay, that makes sense. And then on the international and particularly offshore side, as these rigs are mobilizing and getting set up, governments, signing contracts, etc., and the companies your customers are sourcing, the Service Equipment and Service Products, what's the conversation like with them around pricing and kind of \u2013 or is there even really much of a concern about pricing, because they just need to get the equipment? Jeff Miller : Well, I think that we're seeing pricing moving up, whether it comes in the form of a tender or a dialogue, and a lot of that is around tightness, it's also around efficiency and performance of our equipment. We've just done a lot to structurally overhaul and technically overhaul a lot of our drilling business and I talked a bit about some of the Wireline things that we're doing, so you know. The dialogue is certainly price is up and it comes in a few forms, whether it's a negotiation or a discussion or in some cases we call and say we just don't have it, which is again, driving prices up. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Yes, thanks so much. Jeff, maybe I\u2019ll start with you to talk a little bit about return of capital to shareholders and I'll let you go anywhere you want with this. You did buy back $250 million worth of stock in the quarter and you've been pretty steady in terms of that dividend coming back to shareholders as well. As you think about the repurchase program, how aggressive do you intend to be? Do you view this as more of a radical program versus \u2013 or an opportunistic one? Jeff Miller : Look, I think that we've committed to return at least 50% free cash flow back to shareholders. The reality is it's going to be more than that. I think what we do is we build a base case around what we return to shareholders and then we're able to flex up from that and I think that's you know some of what you're seeing. Eric, do you want to add to that? Eric Carre : I think it\u2019s \u2013 you covered it well, I think. The \u2013 I mean, the main focus in the organization right now is to continue to generate free cash flow. That's really the first priority, and ensure that we have enough and actually we're generating enough free cash flow right now to continue to buyback share, but also to continue to work and further strengthen our balance sheet. So, if we look forward, we intend to do both, even though the buyers right now is clearly on continuing to buy back more shares. Neil Mehta : Thanks Eric and the follow up is for you. It's just, I hear you made some comments around this in the script, but any Q3 considerations you want us as a market to keep in mind as we think about and building this sequential model into next quarter. Eric Carre : No, I think we covered it in the prepared remark and Jeff mentioned it, as well as you look throughout the remainder of the year. I know there's a lot of question on North America, so maybe I'll repeat what we indicated, which is H2 is going to be a little lower than H1 for North America. Q3 is a bit down compared to Q2 and we're expecting Q4 to be flat relative to Q3, considering there were some holidays and seasonality as well. So you combine that with the guidance by division and I think it gives you a really good perspective on how we see the second half of the year unfolding. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Scott Gruber : Yes, I wanted to say on the second half outlook, typically frac activity does slow down into the holiday season. But the gas forward curve is actually quite encouraging today Jeff. As you mentioned in your conversation earlier, the conversations with clients today, are they suggesting that they are going to bring back some gas completion activity later this year or is that more likely to wait until next year, after the budget reset process? Jeff Miller : Look, I think that \u2013 I'm not going to try to call tops and bottoms, I'll let others do that. But I think that, the outlook I described for 2024 is consistent with what you just described and so when we see that, I don't have precision around the date. But there's no question that gas is firming up and that there'll be LNG takeaway and that the gas market will be busy. It's a question of the date, but I expect that build in \u201824, could it come sooner? Obviously, it could and I would say oil price is quite constructive today as well, which may bring some smaller players back into the market. But all of these things structurally from a cycle standpoint are very, very positive and as I look at \u201824, sometime between now and there, we see improving activity. Scott Gruber : Got it. That makes sense. Yes, and I did want to touch on the oil side as well. Obviously last year well productivity was down and that was starting this conversation around the need just to drill more wells to kind of offset that productivity loss. This year we do seem to be at maybe a localized plateau on well productivity on the oil side in the U.S.  But is that part of the conversation here with customers that you know over time that they are going to have to be drilling more wells in the U.S. given that productivity decline? Is that kind of top of mind as they kind of start to think about \u201824 needs or is that a kind of off the horizon still? Jeff Miller : No, I mean let me frame that differently. I think that this is my point around service intensity, meaning it takes more work to produce the same over time unless there are step changes in terms of either efficiency or insight. And so, we talk about our smart fleet offering quite often, but the reality is that's part of our technology portfolio to help customers better understand productivity of rock and where the frac is going and how to design fracs that can be more productive over time, so I think that's an important step.  But there is no question when we think about North America and we even saw that during the COVID when the pace at which North America declined following sort of the near slowdown or near stoppage in North America and so I think those are well understood by the market and our clients.  And so when I think about the way forward in North America, that features in it and is clearly part of our view as to why (a) there'll be more activity over time, even to stand still, and further why e-fleets in our case are so valuable, because they really do help clients achieve better productivity and lower costs. So I think that that's one of the reasons we're so focused on that and I think that's how it plays out. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler. Luke Lemoine : Hey! Good morning, Jeff and Eric. Jeff Miller : Morning, Luke. Luke Lemoine : Jeff \u2013 Morning! Jeff, nice job on that North America margins in 2Q, I mean those flat, and you talked about those remaining strong for the balance of the year. It kind of sounded like you're not expecting these to be materially different from the first half. Is that correct? Jeff Miller : That's correct. Luke Lemoine : Okay. And then Eric, 2Q D&E margins for better inter guide. Can you maybe walk us through what changed relative to your expectations? Eric Carre : Yes, I think, I mean there's a lot of moving parts in the D&E margins. I think we just delivered better across the board in most product lines and in all of the regions. There's really not a lot more to say about that solid execution from all product lines across the globe. Luke Lemoine : Okay, got it. Thanks a bunch. Operator : Our next question comes from a line of Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Stephen Gengaro : Hi! Can you hear me? Jeff Miller : Yes. Eric Carre : Yes. Stephen Gengaro : Oh, sorry. I got cut-off. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Two things to me, the first is, we've written and we've heard from others that, the consolidation in the U.S. frac business and then just the better behavior by you and many others has led to a different dynamic in the business. I\u2019m just curious, as you've seen a little bit of obviously rig count softness and frac spreads have come off a bit, are you seeing \u2013 can you visibly see any different approach to pricing across the industry yet? Is it too early to tell? Just curious if there's any proof of concepts here yet? Jeff Miller : Look, I think there is quite different, and I think it's different along a couple of dimensions. Number one, quite different in the sense of the type of equipment that we are putting into the market with e-fleet. So that's a very different dynamic than we've seen in the past. And I think that the, pull for those from customers is meaningful and so that's one key difference. And I think from the other perspective, the bifurcation and performance is an important point. And I think that we've seen quite a difference in our performance and that still matters. In fact, that matters a lot. And I think that, sort of the overall \u2013 we've always replaced our equipment, invested in our equipment and technology. But I think that, the idea that equipment runs in perpetuity or that it can be run to the ground and then somehow rebuild does not realistic. And so I think there's some understanding around that today that there probably wasn't before. Stephen Gengaro : Thank you. And when you \u2013 you touched on this a little bit earlier, but when we hear from E&Ps and just industry data in general, that well quality is curating a bit. Is that a net positive you think for the completion side of your business? How do you think about the impact that has or is it kind of too gradual to really jump out? Jeff Miller : Yes look, I mean, what that drives is more technology and more service intensity, both. I mean, that's the upshot of what you just described for our customers and we see that. And so we're \u2013 you know like you said, I'm quite confident about \u2013 I'm confident in North America's contribution to the overall oil and gas supply for the world. It's important and sustaining mass going to require investment and a lot of technology and a lot of just repetitions.  So I think it's not very well for Halliburton. Operator : Our next question comes from a line of Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Marc Bianchi : Hi! I just want to ask one more on sort of the North America outlook for the back half. I know it's been asked several times, but just because so many people seem to be focused on that. I think people are surprised by fourth quarter being flat quarter-over-quarter and margins seemingly holding in. Would you anticipate that overall the profit for Halliburton or the EPS should be flat to up in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter? Jeff Miller : Yes. I mean, we're not going to guide Q4, but directionally everything is intact. Marc Bianchi : Yes. Okay, great. Thanks for that Jeff. The other one I had is just a bit of a modeling question on the corporate line for you, Eric, because we've got this new software element that we need to include. So if I take those two together, the corporate plus the software, it looks like we should be something in the mid-80\u2019s of a negative number and then that should be sort of on a $20 million to $25 million run rate beyond third quarters. Is that the right way to think about that software impact. Eric Carre : Yes, I mean we guided the two separately, so as to give you clarity as to what they are. So we guided corporate going into Q3 to be $5 million to $10 million up from Q2, that's essentially a timing issue. We were a bit under guidance in Q2, so that gives you the corporate number. And then in terms of SAP which we guided as a separate line, we guided to $20 million or about $0.02 and what we'll do on that one, we give you the yearly number so $50 million this year, $100 million next year, $100 million the following year, so you can kind of run your models on the yearly basis and then we'll give you more color quarter-to-quarter. Because some of it depends on how the rollout is happening right. So we want to do that on a quarter to quarter basis. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with Benchmark. Kurt Hallead : Hey! Good morning Jeff and everybody. Hey Jeff, I'm kind of curious. On the international front right, just are you seeing the prospect of maybe an acceleration in an activity whether that be in the Middle East or Latin America, maybe relative to the beginning part of the year. I know that there is some questions about the OPEC production cuts, and that may be having a negative impact on activity. But I'm kind of curious as to whether that \u2013 you know there's a situation in the Middle East where there's a greater sense of urgency and maybe a push to move some projects a little more quickly. Jeff Miller : OPEC cuts absolutely do not have an impact on activity. I\u2019m being crystal clear around that. These are customers with plans that are meeting global demand and it is unrelated to cuts and OPEC. I would say that the growth, I wouldn't describe it as an acceleration, I would describe it as continued growth, and that's very positive. That's a good thing, because that's consistent with the long duration nature of this cycle. So it's not a spike to come at some point in time in the future to then level out. I think what we're going to continue to see is steady growth in activity, kind of like we've seen. Although does the pace pick up? It might some in fits and starts as big projects get started. But I think overall, this is a great setup for Halliburton in terms of timing and pacing and absolutely consistent with how we see the length of the cycle. Meaning, it's going to take quite a period of time as barrels are invested in and reinvestment is made. Kurt Hallead : Okay, that's great. I appreciate that color. Now, maybe then focusing again on the North American market, you've given some clear deep expectations on what you see there. With the fact that you guys are getting rid of older equipment, focusing on e-fleet, you mentioned a couple of long-term contracts. How do you see the prospects for Halliburton to continue to outpace the market if the market is just going to be flat? Jeff Miller : Well, I think I've described what we're going to do and I think that sort of the \u2013 we\u2019re focused on what we're doing in terms of \u2013 you mentioned e-fleet, but that's an important thing, and that's an important opportunity for Halliburton, it's somewhat unique for Halliburton.  I also believe that it's \u2013 as I look out into the future, as I said I see, we talked to extensively about service intensity and technology and I think both of those are going to be very high demand as we get into \u201924, and I would say for what we do, it's an high demand now. And so you know, I think the long term for North America clearly points towards what we do uniquely at Halliburton and so I feel pretty confident about that. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Jeff Miller for closing remarks. Jeff Miller : Yes, thank you and thank you all for participating in today's call. Let me close out the call with this. Halliburton delivered an impressive first half of 2023 and I fully expect that the execution of our strategy in this long duration up cycle will deliver better returns, more free cash flow and more cash to shareholders.  I look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Please close out the call. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Coleman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. David Coleman : Hello! And thank you for joining the Halliburton third quarter 2023 conference call. We will make a recording of today's webcast available for seven days on Halliburton's website after this call. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO and Eric Carre, Executive Vice President and CFO. Some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other securities and exchange commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our third quarter earnings release and in the quarterly results and presentation section of our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Halliburton delivered an impressive third quarter. Our margin strength demonstrated the power of our strategy. I am pleased with the stability of our North America business and the profitability of our international growth. Let's jump right into the highlights. Total company revenue increased 8% year-over-year, while operating income grew 23%. International revenue grew 17% year-over-year with strong activity in all geographic markets. North America revenue was roughly flat year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. Our completion and production division grew revenue 11% year-over-year, while margins expanded 280 basis points, margins expanded 105 basis points sequentially driven by international operations, while North American C&P margins remained approximately flat the last quarter. Our drilling and evaluation division grew revenue 4% year-over-year, while margins expanded 168 basis points. Finally, we generated $874 million of cash from operations, $511 million of free cash flow and repurchased approximately $200 million of common stock and $150 million of debt during the quarter. To our over 45,000 employees globally. Thank you for another outstanding quarter, you executed our strategy and delivered excellent financial results. I'll begin with what I see in the macro environment. Reliable and affordable energy remains at the very center of global economic growth and security. The most recent world oil outlook from OPEC expects 10 million barrels of oil demand growth before the end of the decade and further demand growth through 2045. Maintaining production while adding incremental supply requires meaningful long-term investment in both short and long cycle barrels to meet demand. This challenge is reflected in our customers' activity levels and future development plans. Consistent with this outlook, we expect continued demand growth for oilfield services in 2024 and beyond. Everything I see today strengthens my conviction in the long duration of this upcycle. Against this backdrop, I believe the execution of our strategy will deliver strong free cash flow, growing margins and more cash return to shareholders. Starting with North America, Halliburton performed exactly as I expected, delivering our strategy to maximize value in North America. Our North America business has changed. Despite the U.S. rig count decreasing around 20% since Q4 of 2022, Halliburton delivered strong revenue and margin performance during this period. That's quite a different result from what Halliburton would have delivered in prior cycles. Since 2015, we changed our strategy. We changed our operating model, and the market structure changed. Our strategy in North America is to maximize value. Executing this strategy made many of our decisions over the last few years crystal clear, including our decision to invest in differentiated and value-added technologies, such as our Zeus electric fleets, automation, and our fiber optic downhole fracturing diagnostics. We know that in a competitive market to capture value, you must first create value. Our decision to derisk returns and maximize free cash flow by only building fracturing equipment under long-term contracts. And finally, our decision to retire old equipment when returns are not sufficient rather than to pursue market share. Maximizing value means just that, do the things that improve returns and stop doing the things that lower them. Next, we fundamentally changed our operating model. We removed $1 billion of fixed costs from our business in 2020. Those cost reductions were structural and remain in place today. As a result, today, our cost structure is more variable and less fixed. And it's one of the reasons we have the flexibility to pursue returns rather than market share. Our commitment to continuous improvement drove significant changes in the way we work, which delivered efficiency improvements in our operations. This resulted in a 68% improvement in hours pumped per crew in just the last four years. Finally, the E&P and services markets fundamentally changed. Today the market is more consolidated, more focused on returns, and more focused on free cash flow generation. We see the benefits of this change. Customers assign value to technology and efficiency, and the service industry is rewarded for returns rather than growth. Never before as the success of our North America business been better aligned with the success of our customers who make significant long-term investments in the region. I expect the combination of our value proposition and strategy will deliver a more profitable business that generates more free cash flow for years to come. Now let's turn to international markets, where Halliburton's revenue grew 17% compared to the same quarter of last year. In the third quarter, we saw activity increase in both divisions, though particularly in our completions and production division. Our results clearly demonstrate Halliburton strong global competitiveness in both divisions and the successful execution of our strategy for profitable international growth. We execute our profitable growth strategy through our differentiated technology offerings, selective contract wins, and our unique collaborative approach with customers, all of which build on our foundation as a leader in service quality and execution. I expect the market for oilfield services will further tighten as asset intensive offshore activity increases. More importantly, I expect that pricing returns will serve as the mechanism to allocate scarce equipment. This is a great market for Halliburton to execute its strategy for profitable international growth. I'm excited about our international business and we're on track to deliver high teens year-on-year growth in 2023. Looking ahead, 2024 is coming into view and I expect to see international activity again directionally higher, with market growth in the double-digit range. I'd like to take a few minutes and talk more about our global offshore business. Let me start with some color. Offshore represents more than 50% of our business outside of North America land. About 25% of our C&P revenue is generated offshore. More than 40% of our D&E revenue is generated offshore. All of our regions contribute materially to our offshore revenue. All of our product lines operate offshore and Halliburton leads in many well construction product lines key to offshore development. Customers choose Halliburton because we collaborate and deliver impactful results. The combination of our leading product lines, and our collaboration from design through well delivery is what drives superior results for our customers. One example is in Norway, where according to IHS Rushmore data, the Aker BP Alliance where Halliburton provides well construction services consistently represents the top quartile of drilling performance. This performance matters even more in a market where offshore rig rates and spread costs are rising. With our customers, we deliver some of the most technically complex wells in our industry. We provide leading solutions in many areas including high pressure, deepwater completions, complex multilateral junctions, ultra deep reading LWD tools, narrow margin drilling fluids and tailored lightweight cement. These solutions enable our customers to efficiently and reliably develop their offshore reserves and maximize the value of their assets. Execution of our value proposition has created a strong offshore business underpinned by efficiency and differentiated technology. Our ability to compete in all parts of the offshore business including exploration, development and intervention has never been better. Let me close with this. I'm both excited and confident in the outlook for our business, the duration of this upcycle the clarity and depth of our strategy and the strength of our execution. Now I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric? Eric Carre : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Our Q3 reported net income per diluted share was $0.79. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.8 billion flat sequentially, while operating income was $1 billion a sequential increase of 3%. Operating margin for the company was 17.9% in Q3, a 207 basis point increase over Q3 2022. Beginning with our completion and production division, revenue in Q3 was $3.5 billion flat sequentially, while operating income was $746 million, an increase of 6% sequentially. C&P delivered an operating income margin of 21%. These results were primarily due to increased stimulation activity internationally, higher cementing activity in the eastern hemisphere, and improved completion tool sales globally. These increases were partially offset by lower pressure pumping services in North America. In our drilling and evaluation division, revenue in Q3 was $2.3 billion flat sequentially, while operating income was $378 million, which was also flat from Q2. D&E delivered an operating income margin of 16%, an increase of 168 basis points over Q3 last year. Sequential changes were driven by higher fluid services in Middle East Asia, and Latin America, and increased wireline activity in Latin America and Europe/Africa. These were offset by decreased drilling related services, lower project management activity and software sales in Mexico. Now let's move on to geographic results. Our Q3 international revenue increased 3% sequentially. Latin America revenue in Q3 was $1 billion, a 5% increase sequentially. This increase was primarily due to increased pressure pumping services, and drilling fluids in Argentina, improved completion tool sales in Brazil, and higher project management and drilling related services in Colombia and Ecuador. Partially offsetting these increases were lower software sales, decreased project management and lower well construction services in Mexico. Europe/Africa revenue in Q3 was $734 million, a 5% increase sequentially. This increase was primarily driven by improved well construction services, higher completion tool sales and improved wireline activity in Norway, and higher completion tool sales in the Caspian area. These were partially offset by lower activity in Africa across multiple product service lines. Middle East Asia revenue in Q3 was $1.4 billion, which was flat from q2. These results were driven by higher well construction in Iraq, increased drilling related services and completion tool sales in Qatar, and higher pressure pumping and fluid services in Asia. These were offset by decreased activity in multiple product service lines in Kuwait, and India and lower drilling, testing and well intervention services in Asia. In North America, revenue in Q3 was $2.6 billion, a 3% decrease sequentially. This decline was primarily driven by decreased pressure pumping services in U.S. land, and lower well intervention services in the Gulf of Mexico. Partially offsetting these decreases was improved completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico. Moving on to other items, in Q3, our corporate and other expenses were $64 million. For Q4, we expect our corporate expense to increase by about $5 million as a result of timing and special items. In Q3, we spent $23 million, or about $0.03 per diluted share on SAP S4 migration, which is included in our results. For Q4, we expect these expenses to be approximately $14 million, which makes our spent approximately $50 million for 2023 as planned. Net interest expense for the quarter was $93 million, which was flat from the prior quarter. For Q4, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat. Other net expense for Q3 was $28 million, primarily related to unfavorable foreign exchange movements. For Q4, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat. Our effective tax rate for Q3 came in at 21%, based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to remain approximately flat. Capital expenditure for Q3 were $409 million, we anticipate that for the full year, capital expenditure will be approximately 6% of revenue. Our Q3 cash flow from operations was $874 million, and free cash flow was $511 million. We expect to generate over $2 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2023. Finally, consistent with our capital return policy of returning at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders, we repurchased approximately $200 million of our common stock during Q3. Additionally, during Q3, we repurchased $150 million of debt. Now turning to our near-term outlook. Let me provide you with some comments on how we see Q4 unfolding. In our Completion and Production division, we anticipate revenue to decrease by 3% to 5% sequentially, while operating margins are expected to decrease 25 to 75 basis points as a result of lower North America land activity due to holidays and lower winter month efficiencies, partially offset by higher year-end completion tool sales. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate revenue to grow by 4% to 6% sequentially, while operating margins are expected to increase 75 to 125 basis points due to seasonal software sales and higher global activity. I will now turn the call back to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. Halliburton delivered an impressive third quarter. Our margin strength demonstrated the power of our strategy. I'm pleased with the stability of our North America business and the profitability of our international growth. Our North America business performed exactly as I expected, delivering our strategy to maximize value in North America. Our international results clearly demonstrate Halliburton's strong global competitiveness in both divisions and the successful execution of our strategy for profitable international growth. Execution of our value proposition has created a strong offshore business, and our ability to compete in all parts of the business has never been better. And now let's open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Dave Anderson with Barclays. Please proceed. Dave Anderson : So Jeff, the duration story internationally is very compelling with the capacity expansion in Middle East, offshore FIDs and offshore work that you were talking about. So I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how that translates into the cadence of international growth over the next 12 to 24 months. International sale looks a little sluggish this quarter, MENA was flat. I know Kuwait's been a bit slow, but I'm just wondering, should we start to see the region accelerate in 2024? Jeff Miller : Yes. Thank you, Dave. And look, I expect that it will. And I've talked about growth for 2024 double digits. But to frame that, our strategy is profitable international growth. And we've grown 20% in '22, high teens this year, double digits next year. So I'm comfortable with the growth and expect we will continue to see strong growth, certainly above market growth. But we're doing that while improving margins and expanding margins. And so I think that our strategy is crystal clear around what we're going about. There's plenty of market there to do that and expect we will continue to do that in '24 and beyond. Dave Anderson : And if I could just shift over to kind of one of the big topics out there is M&A, Chevron, Exxon, [indiscernible] EPs in North America. Can you talk a bit about what this means to Halliburton. On the one hand, I'm thinking this should provide you really significant visibility on your development programs. On the other hand, perhaps your pricing levers might be a bit compromised if you only have a handful of large customers. Could you just kind of big picture, talk about what's leading to your business, please? Jeff Miller : Yes. Big picture, good for Halliburton. I think it does a couple of things what we're seeing. Certainly, it demonstrates the long-term importance of oil and gas and more specifically, worldwide and more importantly, the long-term importance of North America. I mean what we're seeing are big players that take a really long view, and these are the kind of customers that clearly work through cycles. And so I think we'll see a much more stable North America I really like our position with our customer mix today is clearly biased. Most of our work is with very large privates and publics. And so I like our position there. And then more importantly, these are customers that care about the kinds of things we work on at Halliburton. So when we work on, I think important things like productivity, efficiency and recovery. And we talk about all 3 of those in our business. And I think we're unique in the way that we approach those. So I think it will be good for Halliburton. Dave Anderson : And what this accelerated adoption of e-frac, you think, with both of those two customers? Jeff Miller : Look, I think that's exactly the kind of tool that customers like this want to have in their hands, and we're seeing pretty good adoption. I would say north of 60% of our business today are repeat customers. So these aren't science projects. This is things that are being baked into workflows. Operator : It comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Neil Mehta : One of the notable things about the quarter was the return of capital, the $200 million of share repurchases. Maybe you could just frame out for the market, how you're thinking about your share repurchase strategy and setting us up for your framework as we go into 2024? Eric Carre : Yes. Good morning, Neil. So look, dividends and it's clearly part of our return strategy. But directionally nothing has changed in our overall policy of returning about 50% or over 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. I mean right now, we like the flexibility that buybacks give us, and we're thinking similarly as we get into next year. If we look at what we've done this year, we've returned $1 billion already to shareholders so far this year. As our business continues to grow and our margins continue to improve as well. I would expect that these overall returns would be higher as we get into 2024. Neil Mehta : Okay. That's helpful. And we appreciated a little bit of color on 4Q, but I was wondering if you could kind of unpack some of that guidance a little bit more, talk about what you're thinking about from a regional perspective? And any comments that we need to keep in mind as we think about the next quarter sequentially. Eric Carre : Yes. I think, Neil, we're typically giving guidance on a division basis, which is the way we report numbers, and I think we will leave it at that. Jeff Miller : Well, maybe just a little bit of color around North America, we're going to see some seasonality as we've described it in the last few years. We've had really strong tailwinds into Q4. I would expect this year, we'll see what I would describe as more normal seasonality. And then, clearly, there will be completion tools and other sales in there that help internationally, we'll probably see software sales in Q4, probably Q1 and more activity and more pricing. And hopefully, that's helpful color. Operator : And it comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. James West : If I could, I'd love, Jeff, as you would talk a little bit about the competitive environment that you see in front of you now. It seems to me that we've had a big change in the overall market over the last decade or so with one competitor kind of dropping back, one moving into other non-oil and gas businesses and so kind of leaving the oil and gas side is somewhat about a duopoly for yourself and your main competitor but both of you are focused on returns. And so it's not a pricing fight or a market share fight, it's kind of, hey, we're in the same game, let's generate cash, let's generate free cash flow to get back to shareholders. Let's get pricing up for returns. Is that kind of how you see '24, '25, '26 unfolding or am I mistaken in my view, we've got a different competitive environment. Jeff Miller : Well, James, it's highly competitive in the marketplace. And we are absolutely focused on our strategy at Halliburton and I've been really clear about that. And so independent of what anyone does in the marketplace from a Halliburton standpoint, we are maximizing value in North America. We are growing profitably internationally and driving capital efficiency. And I think some of the cash flows that you see and improving cash flow that you see is driven out of our fundamental strategy to develop R&D that is more capital efficient. And so this has been a strategy underway for probably 5 or 6 years, maybe longer. And today, we're seeing the fruits of that. But from a competitive perspective, highly competitive marketplace and we're always continuing to lower total cost of ownership for our customers and also drive the three things. And the outcome of that is clearly better free cash flow, more cash flow return to customers, but it starts with that basic strategy. James West : Right. Got it. Okay. And then, if we think about North America as this cash machine, as I think about it for you guys, with some seasonality here in the fourth quarter, do you anticipate pricing degradation? Or do you think that everything kind of holds up here and we're in just kind of this continued harvesting period. Jeff Miller : Well, look, I think that North America, as we look forward into '24, the consolidation activity that we've seen is clearly a demonstration of how important North America is. In the kind of environment that we're in today, it's hard for me to imagine operators who want to be smaller rather than bigger given the $85, $90 commodity price. So I think that will drive certain amount of activity up from here. From our perspective, we see largely a steady market from as you described it, just partly because we are focused on retiring diesel fleets and transitioning to electric. We've got a very clear strategy around North America. And we believe that our service quality performance and technology, those get better every day, and they drive margins. So this is an important component. They drive margins. And I think our customers understand the level of investment required in order to deliver service quality, performance and technology. So we've seen what this market looks like when we burn up equipment at very low returns that don't allow for that reinvestment, probably we've seen that, that's not a good outcome certainly not for service companies, but it's also not a good outcome for operators. So I think that's what gives me confidence in sort of the stability of this. And to that point, we're mostly I'd say, mostly contracted for 2024. Operator : And it comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed. Roger Read : Yes. Good morning. Probably just to follow up on a couple of the questions already been asked, maybe slightly differently. As you think about the outlook here for the fourth quarter and maybe in the first half of '24, I was just curious where you feel like you're being properly cautious, maybe slightly overly cautious and where you think things actually need to come through to sort of hit the numbers, right? I'm just sort of looking for some guidelines maybe of what to pay attention to as the quarter unfolds. Jeff Miller : Look, I think the guidance we've given you is fairly clear, and we've got a lot of confidence in the way we looked at the market. And as I described, seasonality in North America, it's something we've certainly seen before and we know what that looks like. I expect our international business continues to do, continues to grow, and we've already sort of laid out what we expect this year to look like. So I feel confident in our outlook. And then, as we go into the first half of next year, I think that we're going to clearly see North America up from here. Maybe that's the color that wasn't clear when I answered the last question. But in terms of sort of where the commodity price is and also not as dependent on that, but really what we're seeing in terms of customers' plans. And also, just the decline rates in North America. So the reality is you have to do more work in order to stay flat. And so I suspect that we'll see some of that as well. As the rest of next year plays out, it's too early to call that. We don't have budget numbers from customers but the customers operating in North America today are the kinds of folks that execute their plans and so those plans will be executed. I hope that's helpful. Roger Read : Yes, it is. My follow-up question is a little bit different tack. But it gets back to some of your opening comments about adjusting your cost structure and less fixed, more variable, we've typically thought of the way to measure performance with service companies in Halliburton, off the incremental margins. But if the fixed costs are becoming more variable, then maybe we don't see quite the same change in the incremental margin, but we'd still pay attention to the absolute margin. So maybe just as a way to ask about where you think the absolute margin can go relative to what we've seen over the last several quarters, any expectations there. I mean, is it -- these margins with revenue growth or margin expansion from here? Jeff Miller : Well, look, I tend to always think more about margin expansion just because it's sort of core to how we're operating the business. But I think that the cost reductions have been super important. And I think a lot of what we've seen has been off the back of that but that's critical to how we run the business. And as I've said, maximizing value in North America is our fundamental strategy, and that will translate into strong incrementals, which we've seen. And I don't expect those have gone away, but that's partly because of the type of equipment we're putting in the market as much as anything. And so as we continue to pivot from diesel to electric, I would expect to see over time as those go into the marketplace, stronger incrementals. I would also say the same about what we're doing sort of quietly but equally important with drilling tools in North America. So we have been able to put together much better capital efficiency around our drilling business, and it's gaining traction. So those are the kind of things that drive incrementals even off of a fairly low fixed cost base. Operator : And it comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please proceed. Scott Gruber : Yes. Good morning. Jeff, the trends in the U.S. certainly seem positive for Halliburton. So my question is, if we experience just a half recovery in market activities, so let's just say we get back about 50% of the rigs that we lost in the U.S. In that scenario, can Halliburton get back close to operating your peak frac fleet count from earlier this year. Can you get back close to peak numbers in that scenario? Jeff Miller : Yes. Thanks. So I mean, look, we've got a really good position in North America. And I think as we look at '24, a couple of things, even beyond activity is, I view we have asymmetric sort of opportunity in North America. So I've said, I expect activity to be up, not down as we go into '24, just given where we are and as you described it. But the opportunity is around demand we see for [indiscernible]. So that's an opportunity that is largely unique to us in terms of the way we're approaching that. And certainly, our drilling business is equally an asymmetric opportunity for Halliburton just given the fundamental change in technology and the ability to put that to work in North America. And I think that will benefit on its own just from the technology, but equally so, maybe from any growth in rig count will only accelerate the uptake on that technology. Scott Gruber : Got it. And another unique opportunity for Halliburton has been on the production side of the business, particularly outside of the U.S. as you take in the [indiscernible] business internationally and build the chemical facility in the Middle East. Can you just update us on the outlook for continued share gains within production outside of the U.S. in 2024? Jeff Miller : Yes, thanks. The lift business continues to grow. I mean, this is a fantastic technology. And the reason it's leading in North America is because of its execution and its technology. And those are the same reasons that we're seeing the growth internationally. And so also an initial really solid contract in Kuwait that has continued to expand in the Middle East with trials and opportunities and actually getting meaningful traction. Similarly, in Latin America, where we had quite a bit of success in a variety of countries, including Ecuador and others. And look, lift is becoming -- our ESPs are becoming more resilient, the technology continues to improve. The summit team is at the leading edge of that. And so look, very high expectations for where they go and expect that, that is, again, another unique international growth opportunity for Halliburton, very resilient in the North America sort of independence of activity rig count activity. And then, the chemical business is it continues to get traction. We're on pace, we're on plan, I would say, with the plant in the Middle East. So it's doing what we had expected it to do. And so pleased with where we are. Operator : And it comes from the line of Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler. Luke Lemoine : Jeff, you talked last quarter about a record number of these fleets that you signed in 2Q. I wanted to see if you could give us a qualitative update on incremental these fleets maybe interest from customers and how you see your, this program shaping up for 24? And then, if you could provide any commentary on conventional equipment displacements, that would be helpful, too. Jeff Miller : Look, we've continued on the track we were on. We've continued to see very strong demand. Yes, we've signed up new fleets. This quarter, we put a couple of work. I believe that trajectory is unchanged. And so very pleased with the trajectory that we see around e-fleets and they're performing very, very well. So that continues to sort of build up the confidence of the market and that technology. I think that the fact that they are lower TCO than existing equipment is a big part of why they are successful. From a displacement standpoint, we've described as we bring out electric equipment, we would retire diesel equipment. And I've always said, it's not a perfect science of 1 :1. But we've had an opportunity this year to retire diesel fleets, which we've described. And by doing that has effectively accelerated the marketplace. And what we're really pleased to see a repeat customer. And I think that's an important component of confidence in the technology, customers come back for a second one. Operator : And it comes from the line of Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Please proceed. Stephen Gengaro : Two things for me. The first, when you think -- you mentioned this I think a little bit earlier, Jeff, but when you think about U.S. production levels, where do you think frac fleet activity needs to be. Are we around that level, do you think to keep production flat under or over. Jeff Miller : Look, I think that's going to be unique to different and certainly the different operators and levels of efficiency and many other things. Look, I think that we'll know a lot more as we go into next year and start to see where production levels are. Clearly, this year saw a lot of broad activity by a lot of operators early in the year, and I suspect North America is getting the benefit of that right now. The private market was super busy the first part of the year 2023. You saw that group not really drill wells as we got into the late summer, which is the time they normally would. And so I think that will weigh on probably production as we go into '24. That said, we've got a commodity market that is probably quite supportive. And so it'd be hard to imagine less, not more. But in terms of production going into 2024, it would seem that a big chunk of what was added in '23 is not repeating right now with good weigh on production. That said, as I've said before, I think we'll see activity up, not down from here for those reasons. Stephen Gengaro : Great. Thanks. And then my follow-up question was around sort of the maybe lesser Tier 1 acreage out there and sort of the impact that you think it has on how's business from both the pressure pumping but also across C&P in North America as far as, does it help, do you think efficiencies are slowing on the completion side. So how does that phenomena play into sort of demand and service intensity of sort of on a per production or per well basis. Jeff Miller : Look, it drives service intensity up without question. And that's good for Halliburton. It also drives technology in terms of things like our downhole diagnostics, which we call SmartFleet. But I mean I think addressing productivity per foot which comes in the form of efficiency, and placement, reconciling all of those things between well design and production, having the tools to do that, and that's precisely what we introduced to the marketplace in the form of SmartFleet, which is a critical building block in my view, solving for that. And I think that's why we're seeing uptake on that technology. So I think that never bet against this industry ever. I mean our customers in North America are very smart, very good, very competitive. And the history of this industry broadly is improving recovery factors, whether it's through process and methodology or automation or in many cases, just physics and science. And I think that what that does do is it drives more reps for Halliburton. It will drive more sand in wells that will do a lot of things. But I also expect, as we've done for so many years, that we'll see the actual breakeven cost or the cost of producing oil and gas in North America continue to come down on the back of technology. Operator : It comes from the line of Marc Bianchi with TD Cowen. Please proceed. Marc Bianchi : Thank you. I wanted to ask about the C&P performance here in the third quarter and the outlook for fourth quarter. If I look at sort of the original guidance for third quarter, it was for margins to be flat, but they ended up growing by 100 basis points. And then as we look to fourth quarter, the decline is kind of guided to 100 basis points. Was there a pull forward of some completion tool sales that would usually occur in the fourth quarter? Is that explaining it? Or are there some other elements that we should be thinking about as we bridge from where we were in the second quarter? Jeff Miller : Look, I expect to see strong performance from C&P, Q4 and beyond. Look, I think that I've described some seasonality. But I think what you're really seeing is the quantity and the quality of the development work that's happening around the world. I mean, you saw equipment is clearly tight moving up. We've got a leadership position. And several things in C&P whether it's production enhancement, which is very important internationally as well, cementing and completion tools. And then, certainly, it helps that North America executed very well. So we've seen flat margins despite the rig count being down. Marc Bianchi : Okay. Thanks for that Jeff. The other one I had was on kind of the international growth. So if I look at your Middle East and Africa, it was flat this quarter. I'm curious how you're thinking about that region and maybe the other regions if we're going to get to sort of a low double digits for the year. are any regions leading that or would you expect them all to grow at a similar type rate? Jeff Miller : Well look, as I said, I expect we finished this year at high double digits, not low double digits. And so look, expect to see growth, but we're seeing growth everywhere. I mean, growth can be lumpy at different times. It depends on what's happening in a particular region on any given day or set of quarters. But I would say this quarter, we've grown 17% overall and would expect to see solid growth in '24. And so that will be in bright region, but I am not concerned at all about quarter-to-quarter where growth happens to be. We've seen very strong in Middle East earlier this year, and we'll probably see growth for the full year. So I think that quarter-to-quarter, trying to measure that is not as impactful as sort of year-on-year. And I think we take a set of assets and we put them to work where we see the best returns on them. And some of those C&P margins that you're seeing are at the root of that. Operator : It comes from the line of Jim Rollyson with Raymond James. Please proceed. Jim Rollyson : Jeff, I just had one question. On the pricing front, you've talked about this, obviously, over the past few quarters. And my recollection historically is international pricing kind of takes a longer cycle to roll over. I'm kind of curious what you think -- what inning you think we're in from a pricing perspective if we're truly in this longer duration cycle and just how you think about that impact from here on margins since your margins are pretty strong relative to historical cycles already. Jeff Miller : Look, I think that continue to strengthen. [Technical Difficulty]. We expect margins to continue to strengthen. The asset feedback, let's see. We expect margins to continue to strengthen internationally because they tend to move 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. However, what's important is, we're also seeing growth in offshore at the same time. And so we've got a tightening of capacity that sort of comes at a higher rate from offshore work just because it requires more capital offshore than it does onshore. And so the type of activity that we're seeing is continuing to tighten the market. At the same time, so that's driving pricing to a large degree. And I think the type of activity that we see planned that is either underway or being tendered or just being planned that clearly extends well into the decade is going to serve to drive our pricing. Operator : And it comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with Benchmark. Please proceed. Kurt Hallead : I'm kind of curious here, Jeff, right, you given mentioned a number of different positive factors, right, that are driving your business, both internationally and domestically. And on the domestic front, right, your fleet mix, technology, service quality, et cetera. So with that dynamic and with that kind of mix, right, are you confident or comfortable enough to suggest that you think your North America revenue could grow in 2024, even if overall activity is flat or down? Jeff Miller : Yes. Yes. I mean, again, I think we've got some unique opportunity. Asymmetric sort of positioning with Halliburton in terms of electric fleets that we're able to do that the market wants and that we can produce that is unique to Halliburton. And also, as I've described, our drilling technology as that grows in North America that will be, again, an opportunity for growth for Halliburton that probably won't be consistent across the broader piece of that. So yes, I am confident that Halliburton has the ability and will grow. Kurt Hallead : Okay. Good. Great. Now I have a follow-up. I think in your prior conversations, I understood this correctly that when you're being approached by customers to talk about e-fleet opportunities. You guys are kind of looking at contractual commitments that maybe could be as long as 3 years. Is that still the case? Jeff Miller : Yes. Look, it's a very good technology. We've talked about maximizing value in North America. That is what we're doing. And part of maximizing value in North America is building technology that customers want and creates value for customers. And for that, this is a fairly low risk decision by an operator realistically. The operators that we're talking to about e-fleets are the kind of operators that will always have equipment working. The reality is the first question is describe a scenario where you won't be fracking at all and the answer to that is there is no scenario where a large operator will not be fracking. Then it becomes, why wouldn't you want that one fleet at least to be your lowest cost operating fleet because it's burning natural gas, it's emitting less and it's working at the highest performance. At that point, this becomes a much easier discussion because it is the lowest cost operating fleet. It is extremely high efficiency and it lowers their overall cost. And so all of a sudden, that type of commitment isn't a huge hurdle to get over for customers that are committed to the long term in this business and that's been our experience. And I think that new capital should earn a return as part of maximizing value and we've got something that creates value for customers. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes the Q&A answer period. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff Miller. Jeff Miller : Thank you, Carmen. Before we close out, Halliburton delivered an impressive third quarter. And our margin strength demonstrated the power of our strategy. Everything I see today strengthens my conviction and the long duration of this up cycle. So I look forward to speaking with you next quarter, Carmen will close out the call. Operator : Thank you. And with that, we thank you for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our fourth quarter earnings release and in the Quarterly Results & Presentation section of our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey Miller : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. 2023 was a great year for Halliburton. Both of our divisions achieved their highest operating margins in over a decade, and we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders. Here are the highlights. We delivered full year total company revenue of $23 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year; and operating income of $4.1 billion, an increase of 33% compared to 2022 adjusted operating income. Our international business demonstrated strong growth with our revenue up 17% year-over-year despite our exit from Russia in August of 2022, completing 2 consecutive years of high teens growth. Our North America business showed strength with revenue up 9% year-over-year despite rig count declines. Completion and Production revenue grew 18% year-over-year and margins expanded 312 basis points. Drilling and Evaluation grew 7% year-over-year and margins expanded 171 basis points. Turning now to Q4, where Halliburton delivered exceptional margin performance supported by better-than-anticipated completion tool sales globally, strong performance across multiple high-margin product lines and favorable weather in North America. Completion and Production margins finished the year almost 100 basis points higher than Q4 of 2022. International revenue grew 12% year-over-year, led by the Europe-Africa region, which grew revenue 17%. Finally, during the fourth quarter, we generated $1.4 billion of cash from operations, $1.1 billion of free cash flow and repurchased approximately $250 million of common stock and $150 million of debt. Before we continue, I want to take a moment and thank the Halliburton employees around the world who made these results possible. Our success last quarter and throughout 2023 was a direct result of your hard work and dedication. Thank you for your relentless focus on safety, operational execution, customer collaboration and service quality performance. Let me begin with my views on the strength of the oilfield services market. As we look past the new cycle and near-term commodity price volatility, the fundamentals for oilfield services remain strong. Here are 2 reasons why. First, we see an increase in service intensity everywhere we operate. Whether it's longer laterals in North America, smaller and more complex reservoirs in mature fields or offshore deepwater, customers require more services to develop their resources, not fewer. Second, long-term expansion of the global economy will continue to create enormous demands on all forms of energy. I expect oil and gas remains a critical component of the global energy mix with demand growth well into the future. With this positive macro outlook, I believe Halliburton's strong execution, leading technology and collaborative approach will drive demand for Halliburton's products and services around the world. Now let's turn to international markets, where Halliburton's performance delivered another year of profitable growth. Halliburton's full year international revenue grew 17% year-on-year, and our quarterly revenue grew 12% compared to the same quarter of last year. Each region delivered year-on-year revenue growth throughout 2023, and both divisions delivered improved international margins year-on-year. Our results in 2023 demonstrate the effectiveness of Halliburton's profitable international growth strategy, the strength of our global competitiveness across product lines and the power of our value proposition with customers. In 2024, we expect international E&P spending to grow at a low double-digit pace and foresee multiple years of sustained activity growth. Although we anticipate regional differences in growth rates for 2024, we believe the Middle East/Asia region will likely experience the greatest increases in activity with other regions closely behind. As we look out to 2025, we expect Africa and Europe, among others, to demonstrate above-average growth. Beyond 2025, we see an active tender pipeline with work scopes extending through the end of the decade, which gives me confidence in the duration of this multiyear upcycle. While we expect overall activity growth, we also see above-market growth within our well construction product lines, where customers choose Halliburton to improve the reliability, consistency and efficiency of their drilling operations. One such technology is LOGIX' autonomous drilling platform, which is now used on 90% of our iCruise runs worldwide. Customers also rely on Halliburton's subsurface expertise to develop today's most complex reservoirs. This requires technologies to reduce uncertainties, such as our DecisionSpace 365, unified ensemble modeling and advanced formation evaluation systems like our iStar logging well drilling platform, and reservoir Xaminer formation testing service. These technologies enable customers to target small reservoirs, identify bypassed reserves and gather reservoir properties in real time. We see reservoir complexity increasing worldwide, and I expect the capabilities of these systems will continue to deliver customer value and lead in overall growth within our formation evaluation portfolio. For Completion and Production, we also expect increased adoption of our technologies like intelligent completions, multilateral solutions and artificial lift. Our intelligent and multilateral completions enable customers to produce, inject and control multiple zones in a wellbore, which is critical for offshore developments, a segment we expect to outpace the overall market. In artificial lift, our strategy targets markets like the Middle East and Latin America, where our differentiated performance and existing footprint create a solid foundation for profitable growth. We also expect strong demand for our services in carbon capture and storage, where Halliburton's leading capabilities to design, deliver and validate reliable barriers play a crucial role. As our customers invest in carbon storage, our tailored cement designs and casing equipment technology enable them to address the unique challenges of long-term carbon sequestration. With this activity growth, the availability of equipment and experienced personnel remains tight. We expect asset-intensive offshore activity to increase, which will further tighten the market. As offshore represents over half of our business outside North America land, we expect this activity to drive improved pricing and higher margins for our business. I am confident in Halliburton's strategy for profitable international growth, and I am excited about our performance in 2024 and well into the future. Turning to North America. Halliburton's strategy yielded strong results in 2023. Our full year North America revenue of $10.5 billion was a 9% increase when compared to 2022 despite sequentially lower rig count. Fourth quarter margins in North America land were relatively flat quarter-over-quarter despite lower revenue. Our full year and fourth quarter results demonstrated the strength of our differentiated business and the successful execution of our strategy to maximize value. The dynamic North America market continues to evolve with larger customers and stable programs, elevated quality expectations and greater demand for technology to improve recovery and well productivity. This evolution fits perfectly with Halliburton's value proposition. Our Zeus electric fracturing solution is highly sought after in this market, where its seamless combination of electric frac, automation and real-time subsurface measurements uniquely address customer requirements. We believe customers demand Zeus because it provides the lowest total cost of ownership and it's shown to be the most proven and reliable solution in the market. The market pull for this technology has been strong. The combination of Zeus fleets working in the field today and Zeus fleets contracted for 2024 delivery represent over 40% of our fracturing fleet. I expect well over half of our fleets will be electric in 2025 with all of these e-fleets on multiyear contracts generating full return of and return on capital during their initial contract terms. Consistent with our strategy from the beginning, we plan for our Zeus deliveries in 2024 to replace existing fleets rather than add incremental fleet capacity. This is how we maximize value in North America. The growth of Zeus and our commercial approach has transformed the North America completion services market. Technology is only transformative when adopted and is only adopted at the rate of Zeus when it works and creates meaningful value for our customers. Zeus' rapid adoption, both by new and repeat customers, tells us our solution is the right one for North America. Turning to our 2024 North America outlook. We expect a continued strong business with the combination of stable levels of activity in the market and the contracted nature of Halliburton's portfolio. We expect this results in a flattish revenue and margin environment for Halliburton. To close out, I am confident in our strategies to maximize value in North America and for profitable growth internationally. In 2023, Halliburton demonstrated the power of these strategies, the consistency of our execution and the value of our differentiated technology. We generated about $2.3 billion of free cash flow during the year, retired approximately $300 million of debt and returned $1.4 billion of cash to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends, which represents over 60% of our free cash flow. Today, I am pleased to announce that our Board of Directors approved an increase of our quarterly dividend to $0.17 per share. Our outlook for oilfield services remains strong, and I expect we will deepen and strengthen our value proposition and generate significant free cash flow. Now I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric? Eric Carre : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. 2023 was a strong year for Halliburton. Multiple financial and operational metrics showed the best business performance in recent memory, any one of which are worthy of highlighting. More important than any single metric, however, the overall business performance demonstrated the effectiveness of our strategy. Here are a few highlights. In our C&P division, our 2023 margins of 20.7% were the highest since 2011. In our D&E division, 2023 margins of 16.5% were the highest since 2008. In North America, our strategy to maximize value is about structurally changing the risk and return profile of our business. We delivered steady margins through the year despite lower activity driven by the rollout of our Zeus fleet and their associated contract terms and the strength of our well construction business. Internationally, our profitable growth strategy drove revenue and margin improvement across all of our geographies. Revenue was the highest in the last 8 years, and profit margins were the highest in over a decade. Beyond pricing and activity, this is the result of the multiyear investment in our drilling business and technology differentiation across multiple product lines. Our focus on capital efficiency allowed this revenue growth and structural margin improvement, while capital spending remained within our target range of 5% to 6% of revenue. Collectively, these results generated about $2.3 billion of free cash flow, the highest cash generation in the last 15 years. Let's turn now to our fourth quarter results. Our Q4 reported net income per diluted share was $0.74. Net income per diluted share, adjusted for losses in Argentina primarily due to the currency devaluation, was $0.86. Total company revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $5.7 billion. Operating income was $1.1 billion and the operating margin was 18.4%, a 95 basis point increase over Q4 2022. Beginning with our Completion and Production division. Revenue in Q4 was $3.3 billion, operating income was $716 million, and the operating income margin was 22%. Our better-than-anticipated results were driven by the best fourth quarter of completion tool sales in 9 years, strong performance across multiple product lines and favorable weather in North America. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in Q4 was $2.4 billion, operating income was $420 million, and the operating income margin was 17%, an increase of 122 basis point over Q4 last year. These results were in line with our expectation and driven by international software sales, higher project management activity in the Eastern Hemisphere and increased fluid services in the Western Hemisphere. Now let's move on to geographic results. Our Q4 international revenue increased 4% sequentially, which was our highest international revenue quarter since 2015 and tenth consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue growth. Q4 sequential growth was led by the Middle East region driven by improved activity across multiple product lines and strong year-end completion tool sales. Europe/Africa demonstrated sequential growth consistent with the overall international market with higher activity in Africa offsetting lower product sales in Europe. Latin America revenue declined slightly in the fourth quarter, where reduced completion-related activity following a very strong third quarter activity improvements in the Caribbean. In North America, revenue in Q4 decreased 7% sequentially driven primarily by a decline in U.S. land activity as a result of typical holiday-related slowdowns. However, we experienced fewer weather-related events than expected. As weather-related downtime is more expensive than planned downtime, this means our Q4 North America land margins were higher than anticipated. Additionally, completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico delivered the strongest quarter in 3 years. Moving on to other items. In Q4, our corporate and other expense was $63 million. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect corporate expenses to be flat. Our SAP deployment remains on budget and on schedule to conclude in 2025. In Q4, we spent $15 million or about $0.02 per diluted share on SAP S/4 migration, which is included in our results. For the first quarter 2024, we expect these expenses to be approximately $30 million or $0.03 per share due to the timing associated with accelerated phases of the rollout. In 2024, we expect to spend $120 million and $80 million in 2025. Net interest expense for the quarter was $98 million, slightly higher than expected primarily due to premiums associated with debt buybacks. For the first quarter 2024, we expect net interest expense to be roughly $85 million. Other net expense for Q4 was $16 million lower than our prior guidance due to the non-GAAP treatment of the Argentinian peso devaluation. For the first quarter 2024, we expect this expense to be about $35 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate for Q4 was 17.9%, lower than expected due to discrete items. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our first quarter 2024 effective tax rate to be approximately 21%, slightly lower than our anticipated full year effective tax rate. Capital expenditure for Q4 were $399 million, which brought our full year CapEx total to $1.4 billion. Approximately 60% of our CapEx was deployed to international and offshore markets in 2023, and we expect this ratio to remain similar in 2024. For the full year of 2024, we expect capital expenditures to remain approximately 6% of revenue. Our Q4 cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion and free cash flow was $1.1 billion, bringing our full year free cash flow to about $2.3 billion. For 2024, we expect free cash flow to be directionally higher. Now let me provide you with some comments on our expectations for the first quarter. As is typical, our results will be subject to weather-related seasonality and the roll-off of significant year-end product sales. As a result, in our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to be flat to down 2% and margins lower by 125 to 175 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect sequential revenue to decline between 1% to 3% and margins to be lower by 25 to 75 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff. Jeffrey Miller : Thanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. 2023 was a great year for Halliburton. We generated about $2.3 billion of free cash flow and returned over 60% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. We're committed to return over 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2024. For our international business, we expect low double-digit growth driven by the power of our value proposition, global competitiveness across all product lines and our profitable growth strategy. In North America, we expect a continued strong business driven by stable activity, our differentiated technical position with our Zeus electric frac solution and the increasingly contracted nature of our business. And now let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. First question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. David Anderson : So a question on the C&P margins that held flat during the quarter, and you said U.S. land was holding flat. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the influence of your growing e-frac fleet on the bottom line. We know the operational advantages, but I was wondering if you could talk about how it impacts financially. How does e-frac, say -- compared to, say, your Tier 4 dual fuel, the diesel fleets just in terms of pricing and operating costs, trying to get a sense of how accretive the new equipment is. And sort of secondarily on that, with E&P consolidation well underway and we look out, say, 12 to 24 months, would you expect the majority of your e-frac fleets to be with these larger operators under multiyear contracts? Jeffrey Miller : Yes. Well, thanks, Dave. Look, e-fleets are accretive. They're accretive for a couple of reasons. Number one, highly efficient to operate from our standpoint. And so that makes them more accretive. Clearly, the are bringing a lot of value to clients, and therefore, they're priced and thought about differently in the marketplace. And so look, I expect that, that will continue into the future. But I think what's most important is the contracted nature of the fleets, which mean a couple of things also. Number one, that the pricing is sticky, but it's sticky because it's contracted over time and the value is thought about. And so sophisticated procurers can look at that and model that, and we can model it as well and comfortable with the value created. But I think the second thing, as we think about what types of customers look at e-fleets, these aren't a spot market solution. I mean the companies that are interested in e-fleets are those that have steady programs, work through cycles, have a clear vision of where their business needs to go and are willing to commit to the technology to deliver that over the long term. And so -- and really, it's an entire system. If we think about an electric fleet, it's -- obviously, it's an efficient, lowest-TCO electric solution, but it's also automated, which drives the level of precision around fracking that I've never seen before. And so the clients know that they're delivering what they expect to deliver, and then finally, the subsurface measurement. But I bring all of that up because that's part of what drives it being accretive : a, it creates a lot more value, therefore, is more accretive than a Tier 4 diesel fleet clearly; and then also a different set of conditions, which also changes the return profile of these assets as we go into the market. I hope that helps, Dave. David Anderson : It does. A clear differentiation there. So a separate question here. I noticed in your release, you announced 2 new collaborations with other service companies : one in reservoir analysis, the other MPD. It sort of effectively fills a few of your weaker spots of your portfolio. And if I just think back to last cycle, we saw a number of acquisitions, but I don't recall too many collaborations out there. I mean, on the one hand -- I guess, from my point of view, on the one hand, maybe you're testing the waters a bit, but on the other, it seems like it's a pretty good way to fill product lines without spending a lot of capital. I was wondering if you could talk about the strategy and why it's different during the current cycle. And would you expect to enter more collaborations in the coming years? Jeffrey Miller : Well, look, I think it's more a function of the technology that we have and when we see -- we've developed some things around digital cores and the ability to evaluate them digitally, for example, but trying to buy our way into the entire core space. We'd rather partner with who we think the premier core analysis company is. And so we're able to bring our technology to that. And effectively, it's a complementary strategy where we make better returns doing the things that we've developed and know how to do. And obviously, we believe Core Labs is a fantastic company. And so we're able to bring something to that, that we believe creates more value rather than trying to enter into a different type of arrangement. You mentioned the other one was Oil State. Similar kind of thing, got terrific technology, but we don't know that we want to try to plow that much capital into the rest of their business. But we do know where we can generate outsized returns for Halliburton. Yes, I would throw in another similar type thing is subsea with TechniqueFMC, who -- I really believe TechnipFMC is the absolute premier subsea company in the world. And we work closely with them, developing joint IP, delivering on electric completions, all electric completions. And so there are a lot of things we're able to do where we can mine what I think is our core competency or competitive advantage along with others without trying to broaden our way into things that aren't really strategically fit. Hope that helps, Dave. Operator : Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : The first question is around a more macro question, which is one of the things that surprised us last year was the exit to exit of U.S. oil production, which came in above, I think, where consensus expectations were. You have unique visibility into U.S. completion and volumes. What do you think happened there? And as we think about 2024, how do you think about exit rate of U.S. growth? And maybe talk about the moving pieces, including DUCs. Jeffrey Miller : Yes. Look, if I'm thinking about production growth in '24, production is a function of service intensity. So simply put, more sand, more barrels. And we saw peak levels of service intensity throughout last -- really in the first half of last year, and a lot of that comes on in the latter half. And I think some of this is efficiency in the sense that we are delivering more sand to the reservoir. And that comes in a lot of forms. E-fleets are part of that and some of the technology that we brought to market. But I also think that the market that we see for next year, it's hard for me to forecast at this point exactly what operators will do because every operator plays their own game. But at the same time, I would probably be over on rigs because I think that we'll run out of DUCs at some point. I think I would take the under only production only because whatever you think it is, I'll take the under only because what we see are stable customers delivering to their plans. But what we don't see as a lot of the smaller companies coming into the market in an effort to really ramp up production. So I think from our perspective at Halliburton, very stable market. But from a production standpoint, as we watch it unfold, it will be a matter of how much incremental sand gets pumped to overcome what is clearly going to be a decline rate that comes with when we add barrels rapidly, obviously, they fall off rapidly. Neil Mehta : Good color there. And then you made a comment that you feel like you have international visibility through the end of the decade. Can you expand there and help give the market a little more confidence about what the post 2024-2025 file looks like? Jeffrey Miller : Well, look, I mean we are working on tenders today for work all of next year and the following year. I mean when we talk with customers, I think about what's going to happen. Really, I don't think the North Sea and West Africa even really wake up until 2025. We've seen strong in those markets. However, the real growth we're working on planning today doesn't even start until '25. And all of these things are 3- and 4-year-type efforts. I mean these aren't individual wells in places like that. These are programs. And so we spent -- we're actually on contract with a client working on just the planning of logistics for '25-'26 and beyond. And so I've just got a lot of confidence in terms of what we see in hand, the tender pipeline and then the pipeline of work that we are planning with customers that may or may not even be tendered. It's just more a matter of it will be done. And we've got clarity on that in '25 and beyond. Operator : Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Arun Jayaram : Jeff, you mentioned that 40% of your contracted fleets this year will be Zeus going to 50% or more in '25. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how your commercial model for Zeus has evolved. And one of the things we get questions on is just the significant amount of completion efficiency gains that the industry is generated. And what is the sharing of that between E&P and service company? Jeffrey Miller : Well, look, I think, number one, it's the value created by Zeus is what drives the contracting nature. A couple of things. When we started to develop Zeus, we started, like I said, quite a while back, our view was we want to maximize value to North America, number one. And in order to do that, we just had to -- we believe that the technology created enough value, so much value that we aren't going to build it unless it's demonstrated for customers. And I think the contracting nature of the longer-term contracts, 3-year-type contracts is because we let the market pull rather than trying to push thing into the market. It is that different and special. And as that system continues to develop and evolve, meaning automation, measurement, all of these things that drive really meaningful value, that is what's creating, I think, the different dialogue around Zeus with our customers because it will become more and more integral to how they create value as well. And then from an efficiency standpoint or like volume standpoint, our equipment is very efficient. So as we go from zipper frac to simo frac to, in this case, trial frac with the customer, that is not a one-to-one increase in horsepower requirements. So we become more efficient as those volumes go up. But that is also a unique feature, though, of Zeus and its ability to scale up, but it's not 1 one for one. And so from Halliburton perspective, we do create outsized value for Halliburton and also for our clients because we're using less equipment than we would had we gone at it in a traditional fashion. So I think that the combination of reliability but also automation, because it's -- as those fracs -- as fracs get larger, the precision gets more important. There are a whole lot of things that start to happen. And so very collaborative efforts with our clients to utilize that technology. In the case of a trial frac, really groundbreaking type work, super excited to do it with this customer. Arun Jayaram : Great. Jeff, my follow-up, natural gas is on people's minds in North America. Just given the contango in the market, 2024 is just above 2 50. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how much of your activity is levered just to dry gas. And what are some of the risks to the earnings picture from a soft market for gas this year? Jeffrey Miller : Look, we've got very little gas exposure in our business. Today, the ones -- the exposure that we do have is contracted under -- is sort of the Zeus solution somewhat and then we've got, I guess, a little bit of other things. But look, the gas work that we have is not a significant part of our overall portfolio. And so we plan for what we can see. I think legitimately, there could be equal upside on gas as LNG comes on. But we haven't baked it into our outlook today. But I would say that's clearly one of the upsides to North America, maybe more so than a downside to North America. Operator : Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : And actually, to last week to visit a tribal frac site and saw the e-fleet. So pretty impressive setup. One of the things the customer mentioned was a slightly different, I guess, sort of price-to-value contract structure. Looks like from a margin standpoint, you're doing fine on that. But is there anything you can kind of enlighten us on, on maybe how we thought about traditional pressure pumping contracting and a lot of spot exposure versus kind of how this is going through? What does it mean in terms of sharing gains with the customer? What's the right way for us to think about that on kind of a price... Jeffrey Miller : Look, from our standpoint, our -- Roger, thank you. We won't create value for our customers. I think you have to create meaningful value for customers in order to be a long-term supplier and partner to a customer. So we start from that position. And as you said, solid contract for us over the very long term. We went into this focused on maximize value, which in our view, means maximize returns, which we're able to do under these types of environments. And so rather than play sort of the spot -- we don't intend to play the spot game. That spot game is kind of a -- it's a win-lose on either side of the market. Really, when the market is getting tight, probably operators are losing. When it's going the other direction, service companies lose a lot. And our strategy is to stay out of that. And so right contracts with customers that, in our view, are fair and deliver a lot of value both in terms of pumping value and also recovery value. And I think that we're uniquely positioned to do that. And so improving recovery per foot or production per foot is a long-term game, and we want to play that long-term game with customers that are working on that long-term game. And we're ecstatic about the customers we have and who we get to work with, try to solve what we think are the real pressing issues of the future in North America frac. And so we don't get to play that game. That game doesn't get played successfully if it's the frac is sure. We need to be part of that process, and our clients allow us to do that. Roger Read : Appreciate that. The follow-up question I have, it's unrelated, but I think kind of critical to the announcement this morning raising the dividend. What is the right way for us to think about your uses of free cash flow between, as you did in the fourth quarter, sort of elective repurchases of debt as opposed to maturities? But as we're thinking debt, dividend is pretty fixed here and then share repurchases. What way do you want us to think about the return of free cash flow? Eric Carre : Yes. Thanks, Roger. It's Eric. So think about it in a fairly similar way as what we did in 2023, except higher. So we increased the dividend 6%. We're now back to about 95% of where we were pre-COVID. In terms of buyback, we intend to continue buying back share. Our intention today is to buy back more share in dollar terms in 2024 than we did in 2023. At the same time, as we did also in 2023, we intend to continue to retire debt and continue to strengthen the balance sheet. So overall, fairly similar structure in '24 as what we did in '23 but kind of bump up everything a bit higher. Operator : Our next question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. James West : So Jeff, it -- you talked about West Africa, North Sea not awakening until '25. A lot of tendering or just conversations about '25-'26. I know some of the -- your partners like FTI are bidding for deliveries that wouldn't happen until '29 and '30. The offshore rig companies, they're getting locked up into '26-'27. I mean the visibility this cycle seems to me to be somewhat unprecedented. And I'm curious if that's consistent with your view of how things are playing on how customers are behaving and how your conversations are going. Because it seems like the industry is on board with -- is it going to be a long cycle? What we recognize, of course, macroeconomic events could derail things. But at least for now, with this oil price range that we're in, it's kind of all systems go for a long time. Jeffrey Miller : Look, I'm careful speaking for the entire industry. But I would say I have this, including Halliburton, very focused on running return -- businesses for strong returns over the long term, which is precisely what we all do. And I think that's good for our clients and it's good for us as well. And so that level of visibility is not inconsistent with companies planning a future around how to make money for shareholders. And that's what we're doing as well. And so I think it's a very good setup for the rest of this decade, quite frankly, just because, a, we know there's demand; b, we are able to -- our whole value proposition around is how we collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. And this type of setup allows us to do that. The other thing that happens, though, when we run a business for returns is we don't overinvest in the business. And so we've told you kind of where our CapEx will fall and level of growth that we're looking at. And so we're very thoughtful about the growth because we are keeping profitable international growth firmly in hand. And so I think assets are tight and they'll remain tight for those very reasons. It's very natural economic reasons for an industry that's running their businesses for return, which is clearly what we're doing. And then I think our level of CapEx, the way that structured drives that level of thoughtful investment and manages the contracts that we win indirectly. And it also maximizes returning cash to shareholders. So it's a very good environment in my view. James West : Okay. That's -- we certainly agree with that. And then maybe a follow-up for me and potentially, I don't know if Eric is going to take this one. But the D&E margins, which I know are more levered towards international, where a lot of the volume growth is certainly going to come from, and you're going to have natural operating leverage from that and inflation. It seems to be cooling somewhat so you should -- incremental should improve here. Where are you anticipating? I know you gave this quarter guidance, but that's seasonal. Where do you anticipate margins? Or maybe if you want to talk about incrementals, however you want to discuss it for D&E going forward as we go through '24 and into '25? Eric Carre : Yes, Jim. So to your point, if you just look at Q1, obviously you get seasonal effect. So -- but more importantly, looking at the year-on-year and the general trend of the D&E margins. So first, I think it's worth noting, as Jeff mentioned in the script, that we had our best D&E margins in 15 years. So it means that a lot of the investment we have done in the last few years are paying off. So what to watch really is the general trajectory of margins in the business. And for us, it's a matter of balancing revenue growth, improvements in margin, improvements in returns as we continue to invest in the D&E business. So all of that to say that expect margins to continue to firm up as we get into '24. And we're expecting our margins to be materially higher in D&E in 2024 than they were in 2023. Now there might be some bumps along the road from 1 quarter to the next, et cetera. It's a business that typically tends to have a lot of moving parts. But directionally, margins will be higher in 2024 than they were in 2023. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Scott Gruber : So Jeff, as I step back and think about the outlook for your U.S. business, it appears that you're on a pathway to establishing a business that will deliver more consistent and better free cash flow in the years ahead than we've seen historically, in part that's given the e-frac investment investment across the portfolio. So I'm wondering if you'd just give some color kind of around that. We're seeing the consistency now. If I heard correctly, the CapEx color doesn't suggest a material reduction in domestic CapEx into '24. So curious kind of around kind of bending that curve lower and just kind of overall helping this business model that's much more consistent and less CapEx-intensive ultimately. Jeffrey Miller : Yes. Thanks. And that is precisely what we set out to do, and that's what's playing out now. And so in terms of a consistent business that generates strong free cash flow through the cycle, and that's been our intent all along. With the way we bring Zeus fleets to market, the way we invest in North America broadly, we are very deliberate about how we maximize value over the long term in North America. And I think you saw that play out in the last 2 quarters as we've seen the market moving around. But nevertheless, steady drumbeat of execution and cash flow delivery by Halliburton. And I expect to continue that because that is precisely our strategy. And so when it comes to cash flow, our capital allocation of our capital budget, we're going to allocate it to those things where we see that opportunity, which we certainly see that with Zeus fleets. But remember, that's a demand pull, not a push strategy. So we don't build fleets until we have contracts for fleets. And so that's a different -- completely different environment than maybe we would have seen in prior cycles from Halliburton, anything else we do in North America. Like we've developed some very good, in my view, fit-for-purpose drilling technology for North America. But we're not going to overbuild it. We're selling it into the market as the market will take it. It's a lot of excitement about it, but our approach is still going to be consistent delivery of margins and free cash flow in North America. And so I think you'll see us continue to do that. And that means we put e-fleets in the market, we retire sort of the fleets that are at the bottom of the stack and continue that march forward. Scott Gruber : Got it. Okay. Appreciate the color. Unrelated follow-up here. Leverage is down to about 1x now, which is good to see. And it sounds like the cash return could step up a bit. Can you just kind of walk us through your thoughts as you move forward in time, the cycle continues, you'll generate more free cash flow, leverage continues to come down. Outside of any M&A, should we think about that shareholder return as a percentage of free cash flow moving higher given that you will be trending somewhat on leverage on a go-forward basis? Eric Carre : Yes, yes. I mean just starting with free cash flow, I think that you can expect 2024 free cash flow to be at least 10% over '23. So that is going to basically help us return -- increase returns on a dollar basis. Now in terms of the percentage, we're still guided by our overall 50% return to shareholder. But directionally, it would make sense to believe that we'll do at least what we did in 2023 in terms of the percentage return. Operator : Our next question comes from Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler. Luke Lemoine : Jeff, your North America rev significantly outperformed the U.S. land rig count in '24. And I would guess some of the factors were Zeus fleet, service quality, more stable customer base and a pickup in the Gulf of Mexico. But could you talk about any other factors that drove this? And then with the U.S. land rig count most likely down in '24, do you think North America revs could be up in '24 for you? Jeffrey Miller : Yes. Look, the outperformance is just the stability of the business as I described it. And so a big part of that is 40% of our fleet by the end '24 under long-term contracts. That creates a steady environment. So the rig count is going to move around and do what it does, but our largest part of our business, very stable. And the reality is the North America business is very big. We saw growth Gulf of Mexico and other offshore environments. However, a very large, stable North America business -- land business is going to mute some of that. And as we go into '25, I expect the same kind of performance out of our North America business sort of in spite of what rigs do. Now I do believe a repoint where DUCs are drawn down, they're largely drawn down. And I think that we'll see rig count increase only because it's supplying the inventory of DUCs required to run a very smooth, stable-type business. And I would say our customers largely plan their business around turning wells into production more than they do numbers of rigs in the air. And so I think there's a lot of planning that goes on to deliver a very stable business of completing wells. And so I think one of the reasons I would say I'd take the over on rig count, I don't think -- I won't try to forecast rig count at this point. But I do think there's upside in North America. We plan the business for what we can see, and we expect it to be stable. But that being said, I think there are obviously factors that could push that up. Like gas activity is clearly out there and I would pull the pace at which LNG plants come online, but we know that they will. Is it '24 event or a '25? I think we'll get to that point and see that Halliburton participates in that upside, and that could happen this year. But at this point, we're planning the business around returns. Luke Lemoine : Okay. And I guess a follow-up with this more stable North American business, you talk about your North American land margins you're ascribing flat in 4Q. Could you talk about how you see this progressing in '24 kind of with that stable business? Jeffrey Miller : Well, look, let's just leave it at steady and stable moving forward. I think that we've got a very strong international business as well that contributes, and I think that continues to grow and expand margins. But we're really pleased with where we are. But U.S. revenue and margins flattish through any cycle, I think, is where we wanted to get this business. Clearly, there's upside. And I do expect from a C&P standpoint, we're going to see the benefit of our market leadership positions in PE, cementing, baroid and other things that we do around the world. So I think that we're going to continue to participate in that meaningfully, particularly from a margin standpoint. But again, our key in North America is stability through cycles. And I think we're demonstrating -- I don't think, I know we're demonstrating that now. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Stephen Gengaro : Two for me. Wanted just to follow up on the prior question around sort of margins in C&P and the Zeus fleets. When you talk about these assets being contracted, are there any difference in sort of the pricing dynamic versus sort of prior cycles and price openers quarterly? And how should we just think about the pricing for those assets in an environment where maybe there's a little excess capacity near term from some, quite honestly, maybe not as competitive assets but older assets in the market? Does it matter -- is pricing pretty stable? Can you talk about that a bit? Jeffrey Miller : Look, these are long-term deals that we go into knowing the cost of the asset and knowing what the return needs to be. So now it just becomes a bit of a math problem around duration. And so there are variable costs in the market that we don't control and we don't try to own. We just pass through to customers, whether it's sand cost and many other things. But for -- where we create competitive advantage for our equipment is we go into these long-term vehicles. We don't need price opener and all of that sort of jazz. There's no reason for it. We literally sit down and work through what is the return for client, return for Halliburton, and then we fix that and move forward. That doesn't change over time. And so -- well, the rest of the market, the spot-type market, all of that is going to do what it's going to do. But I think that's when we take a long view of the market in value creation, that's math that both clients and how can do. And I think that's what makes it so very different, our approach in North America. It's not particularly differentiated, if at all, in the spot market. And as a result, it's just kind of does what it does. It's on a free for all. But I would say, in the market where we want to play, which is technology-driven, lowest total cost of ownership and working on, I think, most important, which is productivity per foot. That's a different game. That's a long-term game. Stephen Gengaro : Great. And then just one quick one, probably for Eric, on the cash flow statement. Anything we should know about working capital parameters in '24 versus '23 that would be much different as we kind of build out the models, whether it's DSOs or payables, et cetera? Eric Carre : No. I think what's important around free cash flow is, as I mentioned earlier, is we're expecting the free cash flow to be at least 10% over '23. That's going to be on the back of improved income. It's going to be on the back also of improved efficiencies around working capital. So we spend a lot of time working on improving DSOs, working on improving DIOs. And when I speak like this, I don't mean just pushing the organization, I mean implementing different initiatives. For example, I'll give you a couple of examples on DSO. We spend a lot of time on automating the invoicing process on integrated services. For example, invoicing on integrated service is extremely complicated. We have multiple product lines, multiple parts of our organization, customer organization, so it takes a lot of time. And to the extent that you can automate that and then remove -- reduce cycle time, then you improve DSO. We just rolled out 18 months ago a company-wide demand planning software, which when combined with the rollout of S/4 in the future is going to give us totally different capabilities to plan our business and reduce inventory while not increasing the risk from an operation perspective. So these are the things where we're spending a lot of our time to basically structurally improve the efficiency of working capital. So that's going to be the other component of why we're expecting our free cash flow to improve next year. Operator : Our next question comes from Marc Bianchi with TD Cowen. Marc Bianchi : I just wanted to first clarify on the North America outlook that you provided for it to be flat. That's a comment for the full year. Is that correct? Or was that a comment from where run rates are today? Jeffrey Miller : Look, we think that Q1 is up from Q4. So there's activity that comes back to seasonal in Q4. As we look at the balance of the year, I think that there are -- as we plan the business for what we got visibility of and we can see our fleets are largely contracted for '24, that's what we know. Are there factors that may add to that? I think -- if you have to do that, I think if production levels are low, clients may speed up. There's a lot of variables that could happen that, I think, are to the positive. But nevertheless, as we look out to '24 and we plan a business that generates the kind of returns we expect to generate, that's what we see. Marc Bianchi : Okay. The other question I had was on D&E in the first quarter here. I think historically, there have been some onetime sales that continue for D&E in the first quarter. And then margin could be down in the second quarter. Is that sort of the base case outlook here? Or is there something unusual going on this year versus the prior years? Eric Carre : No, there's nothing unusual. I think if you -- actually, if you were to go back and look at the Q1 '24 over Q4 '23 guidance that we just gave, it is very much in line with the typical Q4 to Q1 seasonality that we saw prior to COVID, so you go back to 2020, 2019, 2018. So what we're seeing here is really a business that's fully in line with historical trend. What's happening on the D&E side, the influence of software sales in Q4 typically is maintained in Q1. But we're having a lot of weather-related issues in the Eastern Hemisphere and the North Sea, et cetera, that is influencing our D&E margins. But again, very much in line in terms of quarter-on-quarter guidance as we have had historically in our business, nothing unusual. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with Benchmark. Kurt Hallead : A lot of good stuff to digest here to make. Jeff, appreciate all that color. I think my question here, kind of what piqued my curiosity was, again, a couple of things that you -- one of which you put in the press release, which was a kind of AI-driven dynamic that you have going on with ADNOC. And maybe start with that one in the context of how you are seeing AI evolving as a tool for the customer base as a tool for your company. The -- how do you see the adoption of that? And how do you see the financial impact of that evolving over the course of the next couple of years? Jeffrey Miller : Yes. Thanks, Kurt. Look, I think software and automation, and I say it that way because software business is strong and focused on enterprise solutions, which will adopt all sort of AI and generative AI as we continue to move forward. And that will create efficiency and [indiscernible] in a lot of ways for our customers. Internally, as we adopt automation and AI into our tools and service delivery, I expect that it will have a meaningful impact. Probably over the next 2, 3 to 5 years, just as those things are adopted, it's going to reduce service costs, it's going to drive demanding. And it's also going to improve service quality, and I think will actually improve the capability of tools, which I think is so fundamental to how we generate long-term returns. Kurt Hallead : Appreciate that color. Also just that Halliburton Labs entered into a venture to some direct lithium extraction. So curious as to how you might see Halliburton involved in that process as well. Jeffrey Miller : Well, look, that's one of our labs companies. We're excited to have them here. We make a very, very small investment in companies that join our labs, but it's very small. It's around $100,000. So it's -- we're a tiny piece of their Series B, which we're excited for them. But Hal Labs continues to attract, in my view, more quality investable companies over time. We're watching them enter Series As, and in some cases, Series B. And it's a journey. We're doing a lot different industries, but we're careful. This is clearly not corporate venture capital. We are not investing in the companies that join Hal Labs other than small 3% to 5% stake that we get from them generally for the services that we provide to them as a member of Halliburton Labs. So super excited about where that's going. But we just need to let that continue to progress on its own. Operator : I would now like to turn the call back over to Jeff for any closing remarks. Jeffrey Miller : Yes. Thank you, Josh. Let me close the call with this : I'm excited about 2024. I mean our outlook for oilfield services is strong, and I expect Halliburton will generate significant free cash flow for shareholders in 2024. Look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Let's close out the call. Operator : Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff David Coleman : Hello, and thank you for joining the Halliburton First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. We will make the recording of today's webcast available for seven days on Halliburton's website after this call. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO; and Eric Carre, Executive Vice President, and CFO. Some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, recent current reports on Form 8-K, and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our first quarter earnings release and in the Quarterly Results & Presentation section of our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey Miller : Thank you, David, and good morning everyone. Halliburton delivered solid first quarter results that again demonstrated the power of our strategy and the strength of our execution. Here are the quarter highlights. We delivered total company revenue of $5.8 billion, and operating margin of 17%. Both divisions demonstrated margin improvement year-over-year. International revenue was $3.3 billion, and grew 12% year-over-year, led by Latin America, which delivered a 21% increase. North America revenue was $2.5 billion, a 5% increase over the fourth quarter of 2023. Finally, during the first quarter, we generated $487 million of cash flow from operations, $206 million of free cash flow, and repurchased $250 million of our common stock. Let me begin today's discussion with my views on the strength of the oilfield services market. Global energy use is on the rise, with crude oil demand projected to grow between 1.2 million and 2.3 million barrels per day in 2024. This demand growth is greatest in non-OECD countries, where we expect more per capita energy consumption, not less as they develop their economies and improve their quality of life. Globally, secure, reliable hydrocarbon production powers industries, moves people, and advances economies. In the U.S., after stable electricity demand for nearly two decades, we now expect it to grow more than 15% by 2030. Today, over 40% of United States electricity is supplied by natural gas, and we expect strong demand for natural gas as a base fuel well into the future. The world requires more energy, not less, and I'm more convinced than ever that oil and gas will fill a critical role in the global energy mix for decades to come. My outlook is confirmed by our customers' multiyear activity plans across multiple markets and asset types. Everything I see points towards long-term growth for Halliburton's services. My outlook for the industry is not new, and it drives our focus on oilfield services, and sets our strategy. This focus is the basis for our technology investment, capital allocation, and culture. This multiyear upcycle together with our successful strategy execution make this a great time for Halliburton. Now, let's turn to international markets, where Halliburton's strategy of profitable growth delivered another solid quarter. International revenue grew 12% year-over-year with growth demonstrated by each region. This marks the 11th consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth in our international business. For 2024, I expect full-year revenue growth in the low double-digits. Equally important, the international market remains tight for equipment, and people, and therefore, we expect to see margin expansion over last year. One of the many things that excites me about our international business is our technology that creates meaningful value for our customers, and drives above-market growth for Halliburton. In the Drilling and Evaluation Division, our leading formation evaluation tools such as the EarthStar X logging-while-drilling system, and our Reservoir Xaminer Formation Sampling Service, both see strong adoption and increasing levels of demand. The advanced measurements these systems provide create unique insights for our customers and drive profitable growth for Halliburton. In the Completion and Production division, our Artificial Lift technology continues to generate profitable growth throughout each of our international regions. Our electric submersible pump portfolio proved to be a market leader in the competitive North America market, and we expect to deliver similar results over time in the international markets. Our complete solution, which includes downhole motors, pumps, and surface systems with remote monitoring and automation, provides an end-to-end solution, and the ability to operate at scale. A great example is in Kuwait, where in less than three years, we captured a nearly 20% market share with over 700 ESP installs. Before we move on, I want to share an observation. I'm consistently seeing more global interest in unconventionals. I can recall over a decade ago, the global scramble to find unconventionals with limited success. Today, two significant markets outside of North America achieve scale, which serves as a proof point for what is possible, and drives interest by others. As global markets grow, the technologies and processes Halliburton developed as the leader in North America over the last three decades have broad applications to unconventional reservoirs throughout the world, which makes this a fantastic long-term opportunity for Halliburton. I'm confident in the duration of this international upcycle in 2024 and beyond. Turning to North America, our first quarter revenue grew 5% over last quarter. As expected, North America land completion activity bottomed in the fourth quarter of last year and rebounded in the first quarter as our customers quickly resumed operations after the holidays. Looking ahead for the rest of 2024 in North America, we expect steady activity levels for Halliburton. Our customers are planning for the long-term and I expect they will execute work throughout the year as planned. This is consistent with a more industrialized approach to asset development in North America. And while we expect an eventual recovery in natural gas activity driven by demand from LNG expansions, our 2024 plan does not anticipate this recovery. Overall, we expect that full-year North America revenue and margins will be flattish compared with 2023 levels. Clearly, our strategy is to maximize value in North America. We do it in multiple ways. Today, I want to talk about two of them. The first is the ZEUS platform and the second is our new North America focused directional drilling system. The ZEUS platform, its electrification, automation and subsurface diagnostics continue to advance. This quarter, we introduced Sensory, which is the latest generation of our subsurface measurement technology. Sensory provides an easy to deploy, cost effective and automated system for real time subsurface measurement of fracturing operations. Additionally, our automation technologies are at the heart of our highly efficient simul-frac and trimul-frac operations and they continue to expand their capabilities creating value for Halliburton and our customers. The ZEUS platform demonstrates its uniqueness every day. And importantly, it's deployed at scale. Our scale allows for rapid technology innovation. Each technology improvement to the ZEUS platform widens the moat around our leading position in the fracturing market. This creates outsized value for Halliburton and our customers. I am pleased with the results we see in North America from our drilling services product line, which late last year launched a new version of our iCruise Rotary Steerable System specifically engineered for the North America unconventional market. The new iCruise CX system is designed for the challenging curve and lateral applications in North America. The system's performance is driving strong uptake and this quarter, our iCruise footage drilled in North America more than doubled over last year. We also coupled this high performing system with an asset light sales and rental model that increases the addressable market when compared to a full-service model. This is how iCruise CX both participates in new market segments and increases its speed of market penetration. The key trend that I see in North America drilling is the move to longer laterals and more complex wells which customers drill to improve economics. iCruise CX is specifically designed for these applications. And its performance is why I am excited about Halliburton's growth in the North America drilling market. To close out, I would like to thank our employees. I regularly hear from our customers about the work you do. How much it means to them, and how your execution of our value proposition differentiates Halliburton from our competitors. Well done. I am excited about the business outlook for Halliburton. Energy demand growth is strong and so is demand for our services. I expect that our focus on oilfield services and execution of our strategy will generate strong free cash flow and shareholder returns. This quarter, Halliburton repurchased $250 million of our common stock, a solid start to the year and a good benchmark for our expectations going forward. Now, I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide more details of our financial results. Eric? Eric Carre : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Our Q1 reported net income per diluted share was $0.68. Adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.76. Total company revenue for the first quarter of 2024 was $5.8 billion. Operating income was $987 million. And operating margin was 17%; flat compared to Q1 2023. Beginning with our Completion and Production division; revenue in Q1 was $3.4 billion, down slightly from Q1 2023. Operating income was $688 million, up 3% when compared to Q1 2023. And operating income margin was 20%. Compared to Q1 of last year, these results were primarily driven by reduced pressure pumping services in U.S. land. Partially offset by higher activity in international markets. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in Q1 was $2.4 billion, an increase of 7% compared to Q1 2023. Operating income was $398 million, up 8%, and operating margin was 16%, an increase of 10 basis points over Q1 last year. These results were primarily driven by higher drilling-related services in the Middle East and North America as well as improvements across multiple product lines in Latin America. Now let's move on to geographic results. Our Q1 international revenue increased 12% year over year. Europe/Africa revenue in the first quarter of 2024 was $729 million, an increase of 10% year over year. This increase was primarily driven by higher completion tool sales in the region and fluid services in Norway and the Caspian area. Middle East/Asia revenue in the first quarter of 2024 was $1.4 million, an increase of 6% year over year. This increase was primarily related to improved activity in multiple product service lines in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Oman. Latin America revenue in the first quarter of 2024 was $1.1 billion, an increase of 21% year over year. This improvement was primarily related to higher drilling-related services and increased software sales in Mexico, improved pressure pumping service and fluid services in Argentina, and increased activity in multi-product service lines in Brazil and Ecuador. In North America, revenue was $2.5 billion, representing an 8% decrease year over year, but a 5% increase from the last quarter. This year-over-year decline was primarily driven by lower pressure pumping services in U.S. land as well as lower wireline activity. Moving on to other items, in Q1, our corporate and other expense was $65 million. For the second quarter of 2024, we expect our corporate expenses to be approximately flat. Our SAP deployment remains on budget and is on schedule to conclude in 2025. In Q1, we spent $34 million, or about $0.04 per diluted share, on SAP S4 migration, which is included in our results. For the second quarter, we expect SAP expenses to be approximately flat. Net interest expense for the quarter was $92 million. For the second quarter 2024, we expect net interest expense to be roughly flat. Other net expense for Q1 was $108 million, higher than expected, primarily due to impairment of an investment in Argentina and currency devaluation in Egypt. For the second quarter 2024, we expect this expense to be approximately $35 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate for Q1 was 21.5%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our second quarter 2024 effective tax rate to increase approximately 75 basis points. Capital expenditures for Q1 were $330 million. For the full year of 2024, we expect capital expenditures to remain approximately 6% of revenue. Our Q1 cash flow from operations was $487 million, and free cash flow was $206 million. During the quarter, we repurchased $250 million of our common stock. For the full year 2024, we expect free cash flow to be at least 10% higher than 2023. Now let me provide you with some comments on our expectations for the second quarter. In our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to be up 2% to 4% and margins to increase by 25 to 75 basis points. In our drilling and evaluation division, we expect sequential revenue to increase 1% to 3% and margins to increase by 25 to 75 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff. Jeffrey Miller : Thanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. Halliburton delivered solid first quarter results. I am confident in the strength and duration of this up cycle. We expect our North America business to deliver flattish revenues and margins year-on-year despite lower activity levels. We also expect our international business revenue to grow at low double digits year-on-year. I'm excited about the outlook for Halliburton and expect Halliburton to deliver strong free cash flow and shareholder returns. And now let's open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment for our first question, and it comes from the line of David Anderson with Barclays. Please proceed. David Anderson : Thanks. Good morning, Jeff. I want to ask you about a couple of things that you talked about in your prepared remarks. And the first is on the ZEUS fleet. You had an impressive 5% sequential increase in North America this quarter, despite the flat rate count. I have to think it's probably attributed to these e-fleets being rolled out. It's pretty clear, this is a big step change in efficiency for your customer, and demand seems to be exceeding supply at least for the next couple of years, but I guess, the question is what prevents the industry from building out? And can you talk about your competitive advantage today and how you maintain that? You were first to market, establish leadership, but is there differentiated technology? Is it more about relationships? I guess, the question is really on the moat on this business as you see it over the next few years. Jeffrey Miller : Yes. Thank you, Dave. Look, the most important point is this is a comprehensive platform. ZEUS is a platform. Clearly, it's electric. Yes, it drives efficiency, but the embedded automation actually really changes the dynamics of how it performs. And then, also the subsurface measurements with Sensory that are embedded in this system, and uniquely embedded. And so, that widens the moat. And I think equally important is being at scale. So, it's one thing to do a research project around a thing, but when we're working at scale, these are solutions that can be pushed to the platform at any point in time. So, it's really the ability to grow the moat on existing equipment as well as any new turns on the science as it goes forward. So, I'm super excited about it. Yes, obviously lowest TCO, but it's the technology differentiation as well that widens the moat. David Anderson : And then, just to touch on something else, you had talked about some unconventional fields in international markets. Clearly, one of the big stories this year has been the Saudi shift in CapEx from offshore towards those unconventionals, specifically around Jafurah. You have a toehold in that field with that liquid mud plant facility, but this is just starting development. My understanding is there's a bunch of tenders on the way more coming. Can you talk about sort of the opportunity set for Halliburton on this field in the near-term, maybe incremental growth you see in '25? And how do you support these build-outs? You said capacity is really tight in the market. Is this a market maybe you bring some diesel fleets in there? Is there other equipment in the region, or how do you think about that, the tightness and the capacity as it relates to building out to some conventional field? Jeffrey Miller : Thank you, David. And I'm really excited about it. And there's a lot of opportunity for Halliburton around unconventionals, as you know. How we address it, we've got a lot of ways to address it, including some of the technology we've talked about today. We've got a good position in there, but I think with even more opportunity to grow, particularly with drilling technology that continues to advance. You mentioned mud, but also other aspects of that where we'll be very competitive. So, I think that's a big move forward. And I think more broadly, so good for Halliburton, but I think that more broadly, just the discussion around unconventionals internationally, what can you see today are two markets, at least outside the U.S., that are truly at scale. And I think that serves as a bit of a template for how that can be done, because it was really unclear a decade ago, as you recall. But I think we're in a different place with unconventionals today. And so, we do hear more discussion around, hey, this is possible, and how Halliburton would play a more meaningful role in that in additional markets, so super encouraged. David Anderson : Thank you, Jeff. Jeffrey Miller : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. One moment, it comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Neil Mehta : Good morning, Jeff, and team. Jeff, you've talked about wanting to drive your free cash flow per share higher. And so, it's great to see the share repurchases for a couple quarters run rating at this $250 million mark. Can you talk about why you think that's the right number to use going forward? And how does share repurchase fit in the seriatim of capital allocation? Eric Carre : Yes, Neil, it's Eric. So, the baseline that we use is the framework that we announced several quarters ago to return a minimum of 50% of free cash flow to shareholders. We actually returned over that at just about 60% in 2023. So, when we look at the improvements in free cash flow year-over-year, which we mentioned to be about 10%. So, when we think through that, we think that the $250 million of buyback is a good base load for us to be repurchasing shares. So, expect more buybacks in dollars, expect more overall returns to shareholder dollar-wise, and then, we see where the overall percentage lands, but it should be pretty close to what we did last year. Yes. Neil Mehta : Okay. That's really helpful. And then, the follow-up is, we are seeing signs of industry consolidation, certainly more in E&P and services, but we start to see some in services as well. Halliburton always struck us as more of a organically driven business, but be curious on how you're thinking about M&A as you plan to go forward for the business? Jeffrey Miller : Look, Neil, no change to our strategy. You're correct. We like bolt-on M&A technology acquisitions. We think about M&A in terms really of research and development. Is it something that advances research? Does it move it more quickly so that we get to market more quickly? But we see significant organic growth in the businesses that we're in. And so, we like where we are and we see plenty of growth. And we also, I believe that organic growth generates more value for shareholders. And we've seen that with other things that we've done in the past in terms of small acquisitions that we're able to then grow and push through our channel. But we like the space where we compete and we like the technology and how we develop that. And so, you shouldn't expect any change from Halliburton. Neil Mehta : All right. Thanks, team. Jeffrey Miller : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JP Morgan Securities. Please proceed. Arun Jayaram : Yes. Good morning, Jeff. I wanted to see if you could characterize your thoughts on the future prospects of the OpEx versus the D&C cycle on a go forward basis. Can you talk about your current leverage to OpEx and production? And is this an area strategically you'd like to grow either organically or inorganically over time? Jeffrey Miller : Yes. Well, I want to answer the second part of that first in terms of organically. Yes. So, we don't see a change to our strategy or approach to markets. So, yes, we do see quite a bit of organic growth for us in the OpEx part of the market. We're in that business today. We've got strong, I mean, strong lift business today. We're in the chemicals business today. And we're in the intervention business today in a pretty big way. And we continue to develop technology similar to as we've done in the past. And so, it's my outlook for OpEx cycle. We've got plenty of exposure to that and have had. Now, I want to be careful and say the D&C cycle is very strong and continues to grow. And I suspect that it continues to grow also. So, I think we're well balanced across really all elements of this, whether it's exploration, development, drilling, and OpEx today. Some of the things we've done in the past, again, we bought smaller businesses that we've grown into bigger businesses. And so, again, a strategy that works for us and it delivers the organic growth that we believe is really good for our shareholders. Arun Jayaram : Great. Jeff, second question is, I wanted to see if you could give us your perspective on any potential impact to how from the changing mix of activity in Saudi Arabia, which looks to be a little bit more onshore versus shallow water. And maybe you could just talk about the year over growth in MENA, which at 6% seemed a little bit lower than we were expecting. Jeffrey Miller : Well, I think the first part of that in terms of Saudi growth, '24 is still growing, by the way. We expect growth in Saudi in '24. And the rebalancing, the gas and unconventionals is very good for Halliburton. We've got a very strong onshore business in Saudi Arabia. We participate in all aspects of that market. And that market remains tight for equipment. So, I feel good about that market. And I'm very confident in the long-term growth of that market. The rebalancing again to gas is, we're meaningful players in that part of the market and expect that will only be good for Halliburton. Pivot to growth, look, a couple of things. Number one, international business grew 12% overall. So, I want to start there. Clearly, I'd expect more growth in the region, but here's what we're doing. I want to be really clear that profitable growth has been our primary focus. We see a good pipeline of opportunities. We expect to continue to see growth in MENA. But at the same time, we want to make certain we're building a foundation shipment for growth. That means that we are delivering the technology, we're making the investment while expanding margins and growing, and that's been sort of our mantra, our strategy is profitable international growth. And that's what we saw this quarter. Arun Jayaram : Thanks, Jeff. Jeffrey Miller : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And one moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed. Roger Read : Yes, thanks. Good morning. Jeff, I'd like to get back in on the international growth. So, double digits, what you've delivered, double digits, where you're guiding or where you're headed. How much of this would you describe as due to new products or products and services or new markets and how much of it to just underlying expansion? Why don't you get kind of an -- you've talked about a lot of the new stuff you're putting in, just how effective that is in driving some of this growth? Jeffrey Miller : Yes, thanks. Look, I think the growth is broad based, but the technology matters. It's not necessarily new products. It's actually an expanding market. A couple of things are happening at one time, yes, activity is growing, but we're participating in a larger share of that growth than maybe in the past based on some of the technology I described. So, we're competing differently technically, and so we get a bigger part of that growth. We've added some new things, yes, like Lift internationally, that's a new product for growth, a new product that's a whole business, but it's growth end markets, and we're really pleased with the progress that that's making. And then, obviously, pricing in the tight market internationally helps us well because that's helping growth all around. But I would not overlook the importance of the improvement in drilling technology, particularly just because it's more access to a larger market and at a much better rate of return for us given the improvement over legacy technology. The capital efficiency of the new technology is probably is right about 40% more capital efficient than the legacy tools. So, getting sort of improvement along several dimensions there, growing market, bigger share, better pricing and better capital efficiency. Roger Read : Thanks for that. And then, just to pivot back real quick to North America, you mentioned not really anticipating or certainly not built into the expectations for recovery in gas this year. Presuming that that's kind of a well completions way you're thinking about it, at what point of the year would you have to see an increase maybe in activity spending rig count in gas to think that there was a chance that you could outperform I say you, but the market could outperform your expectation. Like if we get to the third quarter and we haven't seen an improvement, we should close the books on '24 having any improvements to dig about '25? Jeffrey Miller : Yes, look thanks. I think that's the next big leg of growth in North America. It's a question of timing, but it is no question going to drive a lot of growth in North America. And I expect it will drive market growth '25 and beyond. And I think what's overlooked, look through the current timing and look forward to what's coming, attrition has really shrunk the fleet. The fleet for the market is shrinking to meet the demand that is there today and that happens every day. Equipment is not being built, new equipment. So, when we get to that point in time, it will be an incredibly tight market. And so, I'm actually quite excited and confident about what gas means to the North America market. Just saying, yes, the leading indicators of that will be well construction, it will be offtake contracts for LNG. There will be a number of things that sort of happen, but it will happen just given the capital has been invested on the export side. There's no question that the gas will be developed to meet that. Roger Read : Great. Jeffrey Miller : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it's from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Please proceed. James West : Hey, good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Eric. Jeffrey Miller : Good morning, James. Eric Carre : Good morning, James. James West : So, Jeff, one of the areas that we haven't discussed in detail yet in the Q&A is really deepwater where you guys have an advantage position this cycle, I think relative to prior cycles even though you've been strong there for a while. But the technology enhancements that have happened at Halliburton puts you in a unique position to have more share, better profitability. And I'm curious kind of where you're seeing right now the biggest growth? And I think we know kind of Brazil and some other places, but where do you think we're going to be surprised as we go into kind of probably '25 and '26? Jeffrey Miller : Look, I think the surprise will be West Africa and North Sea in terms of '25 and beyond. I think really we're planning work now. There are great opportunities today that are being planned by clients with the full expectation that we see a meaningful step up as we go into '25 and beyond. And these are all long-term type projects that will extend into the end of the decade. So, but I do think that's where we'll see a lot of activity. James West : Okay. Okay. That makes sense. And then, maybe just back to North America to pivot back there. Again, I don't want to beat a dead horse, but you guys are dramatically outperforming some of the peers in North America. And where do you hold the line, I guess on kind of pricing? And where do you sacrifice utilization in a market that may be down a little bit? Is it -- we just we'll give up the utilization to keep our pricing, or do you -- are you willing to give some discount to keep utilization high? Jeffrey Miller : Yes. Look, James, do we see some pressure? Yes. But does that affect our strategy? Absolutely not. We've got a strategy with maximized value in North America. 40% of our equipment is contracted under long-term contracts, and we're not terribly exposed where we do see that pressure. And I think maybe more answer than you want, but I think it's important that we keep central as our strategy is delivering unique technologies that create real value for customers. And so, that's what lowest TCO looks like and that's why we're also work solving for recovery with ZEUS platform and Sensory. We think those two things alone create significant value for customers and so we keep that central. James West : Right, right. Totally get it. Thanks, Jeff. Jeffrey Miller : Thank you, James. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please proceed. Scott Gruber : Yes. Good morning. Jeffrey Miller : Good morning, Scott. Eric Carre : Good morning, Scott. Scott Gruber : Well, it's getting later in the call, so I'll give you a chance to mention AI a few times. Not that it's needed. But are global customers starting to discuss additional demands from power for data centers? And do you think this has the potential to pull forward additional gas developments over the next few years around the world? Or is this still off the horizon? Jeffrey Miller : I think gas is a critical fuel. And look, yes, I think we mentioned in the prepared remarks that the growth in demand for gas or gas and electricity and that being the most effective way to deliver power certainly today in the most reliable. So, I think that this is almost becoming, it's one of those things that you don't see it until it's on top of you. And I think that right now that demand is on top of us. And so, I think that can only be additive to demand. I have no question that will be additive. And clearly, AI consumes more power than traditional data centers. So, I think all of that combined, there's almost it's not almost, it is a secular trend towards demanding more power and that can only be good for our industry and for Halliburton. Scott Gruber : Yes, it'll be interesting to watch. Just turning back to the near-term, Latin America was a big outperformer versus our expectation. Can you just provide some more color on the details of what drove the outperformance in Latin America? And overall, what type of growth would you anticipate from the market this year? Jeffrey Miller : Look, Latin America performed very well. It's broad based growth in Latin America. So, really it's several geographies and types of markets, whether Argentina, Mexico, Caribbean, Ecuador. So, we saw strong growth all over. And important to say, our team in Latin America is doing an exceptional job. I'm very appreciative and pleased with the work that team does. And I think it also demonstrates how oil and gas is critical to economies. Those are economies that require oil and gas. They view oil and gas as critical to both security and economic growth, things that are important in Latin America. And so, I expect there's more to come. Scott Gruber : Got it. Appreciate it, Jeff. Thank you. Jeffrey Miller : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler. Please proceed. Luke Lemoine : Hey, good morning. Jeff, you've reiterated your full-year international revs up low-double-digits with margins expanding this year. But could you maybe talk more specifically about how you see the D&E margins unfolding on a full-year basis? And then also, as we kind of look over the next couple of years as international continues to unfold, you roll out new products and services like iStar and iCruise, what are kind of the aspirational targets here in D&E? Jeffrey Miller : Yes. Look, I like the trajectory that we're seeing in D&E. And I say that because we're growing the business, but we're growing the business at a pace that's profitable and building the kind of foundation that we can use the technology in markets where we know we've got solid growth and profitability and then be able to reach out from there. But clearly, it is a balance of growing margins while opening for example, new businesses. So, we've opened a few new markets while growing profitably. And I think that's sort of the foundational part of our D&E trajectory. So, I expect to continue to see it aspirationally, continue to expect it to go up and expand quarter-over-quarter, year-on-year. And in the first quarter, we actually saw flooding in some markets. We saw weather in some others, maybe more than we would have expected. Though I expect that we continue on the trajectory in spite of all of the things that sort of come along and businesses that are open. So, should expect to continue to see that moving up. Luke Lemoine : Okay. Thanks, Jeff. Jeffrey Miller : Thank you. Operator : Thanks. And one moment for our next question. And it comes from the line of Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Please proceed. Stephen Gengaro : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Jeffrey Miller : Good morning, Stephen. Stephen Gengaro : Two from me, the first, you mentioned the strength in iCruise in North America. I think you said more than double a year ago footage drilled. Is that displacing competitors? Is that organic growth? Is that replacing all technology that you're offering? Can you give some color around that? Jeffrey Miller : Look, it's performing very well and the uptake has been strong. And so, it is different technology than what we've ever had in the past. It's designed for this market. It's built on the iCruise platform. So, how it gets to market is really customer driven and there's been just more uptake on the technology self. Yes, it's all organic. In terms of it, we developed the technology ourselves. We've worked on it for some time. We built a platform that has been very effective internationally and now we've gotten to the North America part of it. So, it's early days, but stay tuned. I mean, we're really pleased with the advancement that it's making, but it's really customers will drive the uptake for that. So, the increase in footage drilled is indicative of customers gaining confidence in the performance of that technology, particularly in the curved lateral. Stephen Gengaro : Great. Thank you. And I know this may be a little harder for you to answer directly, but when we think about the CHX, SLV deal and what's going on in production chemicals, I would imagine it's an area that would have interest to you. But my question is really, you had a great amount of success with Summit and what you bought and built over the last, I guess five, six years plus and the strength of that business. Is that something that you can replicate in production chemicals if you went down that road? Jeffrey Miller : Look, I think, I'll revert back to strategically we like to grow things organically. We own the kernel of a business there. We continue to make progress. We've got the plant. The capacity is filling up in the Middle East. So, the trade-off is speed, but I think also the trade-off from our perspective anyway has been, we know how to do this and we believe it generates a lot of value for our shareholders when we go about it this way. And so, we're going to continue to grow our chemicals business around the world on the back of some assets that we built ourselves. And so, I'm pleased, I think there's opportunities for organic growth in chemicals, organic growth, and strong growth in intervention, a whole lot of different areas. Stephen Gengaro : Okay, great. Now, thank you for the call. Jeffrey Miller : Yes. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question, and it comes from the line of Marc Bianchi with TD Cowen. Please proceed. Marc Bianchi : Hi. I wanted to circle back to the discussion on pricing for North America just because you made the comment that you've seen some softening, but you're not changing your strategy. Could you just comment on how sort of the market has evolved over the last 90 days, if anything has changed. We've had a competitor out there saying that they're going to go after share at the expensive price. Jeffrey Miller : Look, I don't comment on competitors, but from a strategic perspective we haven't changed. What we're doing and I like where we are. A big part of our fleet is contracted today. We focus on delivering top-notch efficiency, sort of record-setting efficiency, and also lowest ECO. And so, that's where our primary focus is, and we plan to stay with that. Marc Bianchi : Okay, great. Thanks for that, Jeff. And then, on the second quarter outlook, you gave the C&P and D&E, should we assume that that's a similar profile for international in North America or anything that we should be contemplating there? Jeffrey Miller : In terms of -- I don't -- Marc Bianchi : Yes. Go ahead Jeff. Jeffrey Miller : Look, in terms of growth, I think the margin growth I expect will continue. I mean, I think that we talked about expanding margins and D&E and also C&P is continuing to grow. And I think we're solid. We're in a number of very good businesses around C&P. Marc Bianchi : Okay. Maybe just to clarify, the question was more on revenue, so I guess what I'm wondering is to get to the low double digits for international, it would seem that you need a pretty healthy growth in the remaining -- all three remaining quarters of the year sequentially. Jeffrey Miller : Oh, yes, sorry, I -- Marc Bianchi : Could you talk about where that's coming from? Jeffrey Miller : Yes. So, that's pretty broad-based. I mean, and so for C&P that's completion tools around the world. It's production enhancement around the world. So, in a very strong position, and we see a number of things growing, not the least of which would be lift, for example, and some things like that. So, I had heavy lift, I don't see it as a -- I see it as a very middle of the fairway, very doable from where we sit today. And again, equipment's tight. I think that we'll continue to see strengthening there as well, expanding margins in price. Marc Bianchi : Very good. Thank you. Jeffrey Miller : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question, and it comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with Benchmark. Please proceed. Kurt Hallead : Hey, good morning. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for slotting me in here. So, Jeff you've been at this a long time. You referenced on more than one occasion, not just today, but in other calls about increasing level of visibility, especially on the international front and talking about opportunities that could extend out to the end of the decade. I think a lot of investors are wanting to kind of get inside the room with you, if you will, and try to get the same sort of conviction you have with respect to that duration. So, I'm just kind of curious if you could give us some perspectives and insights on how those conversations are taking place, how much lead time your customers are asking for, and effectively, what two or three things are you seeing that continue to underpin this confidence and conviction that this cycle is going to extend through the end of the decade? Jeffrey Miller : Yes, thanks. Look, some of its work that will begin in '25 that is planned to go through the end of the decade. So, I feel very confident about that. Others are work that we're working on planning with clients that again are the types of projects that extend that far. I think just the price of the commodity and the tightness and the rising demand for oil and gas gives me confidence and it gives our clients confidence. And clearly, we've seen a bit of a return to oil and gas and its importance in a lot of places, but the type of work that we're starting, the type of offshore work that we're starting is takes time to get started and it takes a long time to do, and so, very confident about that broadly. And I would include, anyway, the outlook for North America is similar in terms of duration. I mean, this is the kind of investments that we've seen in North America that are not for a quarter or two. These are decade-long investments that we've seen happen. And the next leg on gas and the demand for gas, it's already been talked about on this call. I feel very confident in the resilience of this cycle. Kurt Hallead : That's great. I appreciate that. So, the other dynamic you referenced was approving margins, right? So, you've booked contracts that tend to last, I don't know, two to three years on average in the international market, so those will roll through this year and next year and so on. Just curious in the context of that margin improvement from here, right, if you were to try to rank and order it. Is how much of the pricing how much is it? Is it volume? How much is the technology value proposition? Can you give us some additional sense on how you see that? What's driving that margin improvement? Jeffrey Miller : Look, I think it's a combination of those. Some of it is certainly tightness in the market and pricing, but at the same time we've talked about our R&D investment over the last eight years has all been directed at better capital efficiency, and that drives margin also. That drives margins in our drilling business, it drives margin in our frac business. But these are deliberate choices that we've made to drive down or to improve capital efficiency and return. And I think that's evident, probably most evident in our drilling technology and our ZEUS technology. But at the same time, that's been a practice in all of our business. And so, anything that we're producing today, sort of its first criteria has to be improved capital efficiency and better returns out of R&D. And so, I'm really pleased with the success we've had there. And so, I would say all are contributing today, in addition to having sort of more market access, more opportunity to compete on the back of improved technology. Kurt Hallead : I appreciate that. Thanks, Jeff. Jeffrey Miller : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question, and it comes from the line of Doug Becker with Capital One. Please proceed. Douglas Becker : Thanks. Jeff, would you expand a little bit more on the drivers behind the sequential margin expansion in D&E? And really, the question is just a function that the last several years D&E margins actually declined in 2Q from 1Q. Jeffrey Miller : Look, I think that's, again, I'm back to the foundation building that I described. So, we've got a better foundation, broader-based work, and so I expect to continue to see expansion, certainly year-over-year. And then, also as that foundation gets stronger, that gives us more ability to grow the business profitably, but from a sound base. Eric Carre : I think Doug, it's Eric here, that the typical drop in margin in Q2 happens with the reduction in our software business. The way we recognize revenue in our software business means that it's essentially taken in Q4 and in Q1, so we see a bit of a drop there. You see that being more muted this year because, as Jeff mentioned, the D&E margins were softer than we were expecting in Q1, as we had much more significant weather issues in the North Sea in Norway, in Alaska, and then the flooding over in Indonesia. So, the combination of the muted effect and the more traditional software impact moving from Q1 to Q2 results in margins going up here. Douglas Becker : That all makes sense. Maybe switching to North America, U.S. more specifically, last quarter you were talking about ZEUS e-fleets would represent about 40% by the end of the year, going to maybe 50% in 2025. Is there a reasonable or realistic or probable scenario where you would accelerate this deployment? The results certainly suggest the outperformance and there might be a case for that. Jeffrey Miller : No. Look, this is a market push. The whole strategy behind e-fleet for us has been build the best technologies and clients demand it, and we've built to the demand that we see in hand, and therefore, they are not built on spec, they are built for customers that plan to use them. And we don't plan to change that. And so, in some ways that adds central to maximizing value in North America. When we maximize value in North America, we are not going to build things, we don't have home. And so, I expect to continue to see market demand for this equipment. 2024 is actually already in hand. It's just delivering the units themselves. They already have homes. And in '25, we actually have some deliveries. And I expect that we will see more as we go forward. But I think that important to remember that that our approach is to build to contract. Douglas Becker : That makes sense. Thank you. Jeffrey Miller : Thank you. Eric Carre : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And with that, we conclude our Q-and-A session for today. I will pass it back to management for final comments. Jeffrey Miller : Okay. Thank you, Carmen. Let me close out the call with this, I am excited about the outlook for Halliburton and expect Halliburton to deliver strong free cash flow and shareholder returns.

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to David Coleman, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. David Coleman : Hello, and thank you for joining the Halliburton second quarter 2024 conference call. We will make the recording of today's webcast available for seven days on Halliburton's website after this call. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President, and CEO; and Eric Carre, Executive Vice President and CFO. Some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, recent current reports on Form 8-K, and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our second quarter earnings release and in the quarterly results and presentation section of our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Halliburton delivered solid second quarter results that demonstrated the strength of our international business and the differentiation of our North America service offerings. Here are the quarter highlights. We delivered total company revenue of $5.8 billion and operating margin of 18%. International revenue was $3.4 billion and grew 8% year-over-year, led by Latin America, which delivered a 10% increase. North America revenue was $2.5 billion, an 8% decrease year-over-year compared to a 12% decline in rig count over the same period. Our Drilling and Evaluation division and our Completion and Production division both demonstrated margin improvement year-over-year. Finally, during the second quarter we generated $1.1 billion of cash flow from operations and about $800 million of free cash flow and repurchased $250 million of our common stock. I'll begin our discussion with the international markets, where Halliburton's strategy of profitable growth delivered another solid quarter. International revenue grew 8% year-over-year, with growth demonstrated by each region. This marks the 12th consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth in our international business. As I look ahead for the remainder of this year, my outlook today is consistent with our expectations at the start of the year. I expect steady growth for Halliburton throughout the remainder of 2024. In our international markets, we see strong demand for Halliburton services, high activity levels, and equipment tightness across all major basins. We expect our international business to deliver about 10% revenue growth for the full year. I am pleased with the profitable growth we're seeing across our product lines. And today, I would like to highlight three specific ones in more detail. The first is our Landmark Software business. I recently attended our Landmark Forum, LIFE2024, in Athens, Greece. It is an annual event where we share our latest software innovations and our customers share their successes and future opportunities. While in Athens, I had the opportunity to meet with dozens of customers and they told me how excited they were about our latest offerings like unified ensemble modeling, scalable earth model, and our latest developments in AI and machine learning. These tools change the way customers work by driving efficiencies from asset level planning through production. The conference included customer presentations that showcased their business transformation and their use of Halliburton Landmark\u2019s tools. Our customers tell us we create unique value with our iEnergy cloud platform, which seamlessly integrates into their workflows. I am confident that Landmark's DecisionSpace 365 will expand and add to our customers' productivity and innovation journey. Next, Halliburton's artificial lift product line is growing in the international markets at double the rate of our overall international business. It embodies our successful M&A strategy of bolt-on acquisitions that bring leading technology into our portfolio. We organically grow new technologies through our global footprint and through collaboration with our customers to engineer solutions that maximize their assets value. As one example, this quarter we launched our GeoESP line, which is engineered for the harsh geothermal environment. The GeoESP line solves for extreme thermal cycling, scale development, abrasion, and corrosion. While geothermal ESP technology has applications across the globe, Halliburton sees substantial growth opportunities in Europe where customers require advanced technology to bring geothermal to scale. Finally, Halliburton's drilling services are key to our success in the international markets. We had another strong quarter in unconventional drilling with our iCruise X rotary steerable system and our LOGIX autonomous drilling platform. We deployed advancements that improved drilling speed and reliability and set several [general] (ph) records during the quarter. We invest in differentiated drilling technology and we expect our strong performance and reliable execution to drive above-market growth. For example, in the Middle East, our drilling services revenue grew about 30% year-over-year. I am pleased with our international business and look forward to deepening our strategy and delivering additional profitable growth. Turning to North America, our second quarter revenue declined 3% compared to the first quarter. Halliburton's first half 2024 results were largely as we expected. However, as we have seen, rig counts and overall service activity declined through the quarter. As I look to the second half of 2024, I now expect full year North America revenues to decline 6% to 8% versus last year, driven by lower activity. I expect that the second half of 2024 will be near the low point of activity levels this cycle, and while it's too early to give specific guidance for 2025 in North America, I expect activity to be directionally higher than the second half of 2024. Here's how I think about this. First, I expect an increase in activity after E&P companies complete their acquisitions and establish new development plans. Second, some of the merged assets will be divested to smaller operators who will put them to work. Finally, I expect some recovery in natural gas activity. Six years ago, when we set our strategy to maximize value in North America, I understood it may take a market like we see today where North America activity declined by over 200 rigs in the last 18 months to demonstrate the margin resilience and earnings power of our strategy. I am pleased that Halliburton delivered strong C&P margins through this period and I am confident that our strategy will deliver strong results in the future. We're committed to our strategy to maximize value in North America because it delivers shareholder value and it is the right strategy for this market. For Halliburton, we focused on returns. We allocate capital to the markets and products that drive superior returns and margins. We prioritize returns over market share, and to that end, we retired a few fleets this quarter. We developed differentiated technologies to solve for the unique requirements of the North America market. And lastly, we improve efficiencies for our customers through those technologies, service quality, and execution. I expect this strategy will deliver leading performance for our customers and a structurally more resilient North America business for Halliburton. A key part of how we do this is our strategic investment in technology. One technology I'm excited about is the latest addition to Octiv, a key component of the ZEUS platform. Today, Octiv is a cornerstone of how we deliver large multi-well pads with unmatched precision and consistency. As our customers execute completions with ever-increasing size and intensity, automation, as delivered by Octiv, provides better control and more effective delivery for simul-frac and trimulfrac operations. During the second quarter, we completed field trials of the latest level of Octiv automation called AutoFrac. With the single click of a button, AutoFrac executes the entire frac job from ramp up at the start to ramp down at the end, making autonomous fracturing a reality. This new level of automation gives customers control to execute the frac design exactly how they want it without human intervention. Following our commercial trials, AutoFrac is ready to scale and I'm excited about what this technology means for our customers and for Halliburton. Lastly, we see rapid adoption in North America of our iCruise rotary steerable system. We consistently reduce drilling times for our customers and create significant value. In the Permian Basin, the number of rigs running the system has increased by almost 45% since the start of this year. We are on pace to triple our footage drilled in North America this year and I'm excited about the market adoption of iCruise. North America is the largest oilfield services market in the world. We are crystal clear on how we maximize value in North America. We have demonstrated that this strategy works. And that's why I am confident that we will continue to deliver strong returns through this cycle. To step back, Halliburton's returns and cash flows are strong and I am pleased with our performance this quarter. I'm just back from a few weeks in Europe/Africa. What I saw is a microcosm of Halliburton around the world. The quality of our people, the clarity of our strategy, our leading technologies, the depth of our pipeline of opportunities, and the competitiveness of our business segments all give me incredible confidence in Halliburton's future. Now, I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide a few more details on our financial results. Eric? Eric Carre : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Our Q2 reported net income per diluted share was $0.80. Total company revenue for the second quarter of 2024 was $5.8 billion, flat sequentially. Operating income was $1 billion, a sequential increase of 5%, and operating margin was 18%, a sequential increase of 69 basis points. Beginning with our Completion and Production division, revenue in Q2 was $3.4 billion, sequentially flat. Operating income was $723 million, up 5% when compared to Q1 2024, and operating income margin was 21%. These results were primarily driven by strong international completion and production performance, offsetting softer results in North America. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in Q2 was $2.4 billion, while operating income was $403 million, both sequentially flat from Q1 2024. Operating margin was 17%, a sequential increase of 20 basis points. These results reflect the strength of our global D&E business despite the roll-off of seasonal software sales in Q2 which affected every region. Now, let's move on to geographic results. Our Q2 international revenue increased 3% sequentially. Europe/Africa revenue in the second quarter of 2024 was $757 million, an increase of 4% sequentially. This increase was primarily driven by higher well construction activity and improved wireline activity in Norway, along with increased completion tool sales and higher stimulation activity in West Africa. Middle East Asia revenue in the second quarter of 2024 was $1.5 billion, an increase of 5% sequentially. This increase was primarily related to higher activity in the Middle East across multiple product lines and higher fluid services in Asia. Latin America revenue in the second quarter of 2024 was $1.1 billion, sequentially flat. In North America, revenue was $2.5 billion, representing a 3% decrease sequentially. This decline was primarily driven by decreased pressure pumping services in US land and decreased completion tool sales and testing services in the Gulf of Mexico. Moving on to other items. In Q2, our corporate and other expense was $65 million. For the third quarter of 2024, we expect our corporate expenses to increase slightly. Our SAP deployment remains on budget and is on schedule to conclude in 2025. In Q2, we spend $29 million, or about $0.03 per diluted share, on SAP S4 migration, which is included in our results. For the third quarter, we expect SAP expenses to increase slightly. Net interest expense for the quarter was $92 million. For the third quarter 2024, we expect net interest expense to be roughly flat. Other, net expense for Q2 was $20 million, which was lower than anticipated, driven by favorable FX movements. For the third quarter of 2024, we expect this expense to be approximately $35 million. Our effective tax rate for Q2 was 22.5%, lower than expected due to discrete items. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our third quarter of 2024 effective tax rate to increase approximately 1%. Capital expenditures for Q2 were $347 million. For the full year of 2024, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 6% of revenue. Our Q2 cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion and free cash flow was $793 million. During the quarter, we repurchased $250 million of our common stock. For the full year 2024, we expect free cash flow to be at least 10% higher than in 2023. Now, let me provide you with some comments on our expectations for the third quarter. In our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to be down 1% to 3% and margins to decrease by 75 basis points to 125 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect sequential revenue to increase 2% to 4% and margins to increase by 25 basis points to 75 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thanks, Eric. Here are a few key points I would like you to take away from our discussion today. I am pleased with our 18% margins and about $800 million of free cash flow in the second quarter. We are well on track to deliver over 10% free cash flow growth this year. I'm excited about our international business where our technology portfolio has never been stronger. I am confident that our strategy to maximize value in North America is working, and I expect it continues to deliver strong returns. Finally, I am convinced that our collaborative approach and value proposition differentiate us from our competitors and are directly aligned with how our customers expect to drive improved performance. And now, let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Dave Anderson with Barclays. Dave Anderson : Hi, good morning, Jeff. Jeff Miller : Good morning, Dave. Dave Anderson : So, North America is softening a little bit, not a surprise. A lot of your fleet, though, is under contract with e-fleet. I think it's around 40% or so. And you're continuing to roll out equipment. So I'm just wondering about the re-contracting of those. I think you typically have like two to three year contracts. I would assume, like, maybe a third of that gets repriced each year or something like that. So what does that look like right now in terms of contracting? I think -- I'm assuming demand still outstrips supply here. So, is pricing able to still move higher in there? Are you doing to blend in, extend deals with some customers who want more? Just a little color around the repricing of that, on the e-fleets. Jeff Miller : Yeah, well let's -- still see a lot of demand, Dave, for e-fleets. I mean, clearly it's a leading technology and we rolled a couple out this quarter and signed some more contracts. And so, that's a runway through the end of this year and into \u201825 that we see today. We don't have any contracts that expires early till next year. And so, that's a process that we're working through. I'm not going to go through all that on this call, but we're signing up with repeat customers, which is a pretty good indicator of the value that they're creating. So, feel confident about that process, but really don't want to go through it on the call. Dave Anderson : Totally understand. But would you expect that most of those fleets stay with existing customers? Jeff Miller : Yeah, I feel -- yes. Yes, still confident. I mean, these are the same customers in some cases that are signing up the second and even beyond their fleets. And so, no reason to believe that they would not. And we\u2019re clearly on the path to the 40% in 2024 and 2025 as well. I mean, I think that's just that trajectory gets clearer every day. Dave Anderson : Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And if I shift over to your international story here, and within the 10% revenue growth, you highlighted Middle East up 5% this quarter sequentially. Can you just talk about that part of the international story for you and kind of how you see that growth? Should growth start to accelerate here? There's big unconventional play over there that I know you're involved in. I don't know if you can talk about any other contracting opportunities with that, but I would -- am I wrong to think that that growth should start to accelerate in the Middle East, even, I mean, within the 10%, I know, but really into next year as well? Jeff Miller : No, you're not wrong. Look, I'm very confident around our business in the Middle East and as you say, I'm not going to talk about contracts, but Aramco obviously is a fantastic operator and we've got a lot of exposure to both the unconventional and the gas work in Saudi Arabia. We've got -- our typical services, a lot of exposure and even some creative sort of new things. So, I'm very optimistic, actually bullish around Middle East. Dave Anderson : All right, it's good to hear. Thanks, Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Arun Jayaram : Yeah, good morning. Jeff, my first question is on North America. You now expect revenues down 6% to 8% year-over-year. How would you characterize the declines in terms of impact from lower activity levels versus, call it, pricing impacts? Jeff Miller : Look, it's -- primarily this is activity based. The fact that we -- and then we retired a few fleets during the quarter as well, but this is activity and that's, as we look at activity for the year, gas market actually took a leg down. I didn't think it would come up, but I didn't really expect it to take a leg down either, so it's not flat. And I think M&A takes some time to digest, and so that has an impact on activity broadly and clearly efficiencies. I mean, we've got terrific technology. We talk about efficiencies all the time, but we also catch up to rigs. Glad we're at the leading edge of that technology and that performance makes Halliburton more value, but it really doesn't change the activity outlook. Arun Jayaram : Understood, understood. Jeff, you've obviously been on the road quite a bit internationally. You expect 10% year-over-year growth this year. I was wondering if you could give us any qualitative or even quantitative thoughts on how you think international spending trends in 2025 for industry and how is growth prospects internationally next year? Jeff Miller : Look, they look strong for next year internationally. I mean, we see a lot of projects that are either just now being hindered or activity going into next year and in some cases, it takes a while to get the international up and going. And so, probably the activity that picks up [indiscernible] will be where it's sort of NOC driven, which would look in some cases like obviously the Middle East. Others where IOCs are engaged, it takes a lot of negotiation, contract extensions for them. And so, I'm seeing meaningful work. I just talked about my trip to Europe, Africa, and I see meaningful step-up there. Still excited about Latin America and what's possible there. And so, no, I feel really confident both in Halliburton's outlook for \u201825 and the industries. Arun Jayaram : Great. Thanks a lot. Jeff Miller : Yeah, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Yeah, good morning, team. Jeff, I guess the first question just building on North America, what do you think is going to be the driver that forms the bottom in activity? I think you alluded to some of those points around M&A and natural gas, but maybe you can unpack that more. And are you seeing any green shoots in customer conversations that would suggest that $2.8 trillion is the bottom? Jeff Miller : Yeah, look, I think that customers, in a lot of cases, are working through plans for 2025 now. And, let me maybe just step back and give you kind of where I see capacity and industry structure, because I think that's really important from a services standpoint. We've got -- new equipment is not being built. The old equipment is attriting. And I think that, I talked about retiring fleets this quarter. I mean, this is sort of shrinking of capacity availability and it's happening pretty much in real time, I think, across the board. And clearly as we look at next year, I say all that to say, I do expect an increase in activity around companies that get sort of new plans in place. I expect assets end up in the hands of new teams, which is -- I never bet against North America entrepreneurs. That will happen. I do expect some pick up in gas next year, at least not a leg down from here. So, clearly, I would expect a leg up. And I don't think it takes a lot of activity to firm things up, I think, is the point I'm making here. Neil Mehta : Thanks, Jeff. And then just to follow up, it was a very good quarter for free cash flow and the company has been very consistent around $250 million of return of capital. So there's probably two parts to that question. One is, how should we think about working capital in the balance of the year and how should we think about your commitment to returning capital to shareholders? Eric Carre : Yeah, Neil, it's Eric. So as we said in terms of the working capital, I mean the working capital will evolve in a way that is consistent with our overall guidance of free cash flow being up over 10% compared to last year. We had more of a working capital headwinds in 2023, so that's a significant delta between the two years. And as an organization, we continue to focus on the overall efficiency of working capital as a whole. In terms of cash return, we bought back $250 million in Q1, $250 million in Q2, and I think generally speaking, it's a good kind of guiding point in terms of what we intend at this stage to do for the remaining of 2024. Neil Mehta : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. James West : Hey, good morning, Jeff. Jeff Miller : Good morning, James. James West : So, Jeff, as you think about -- and I don't want to beat a dead horse too much, but if you think about North America going into next year, I'm increasingly bullish on the outlook for \u201825 and certainly for \u201826, both with oil prices where they are and gas prices which should rebound nicely. And we have this huge power demand pull coming from the tech industry. And I think the tech industry is more fully aligned with the oil and gas industry than it's probably ever been. So I'm curious about your customer conversations, how they're thinking about, how do we get this gas to market, how do we size up crews or size up equipment and get ready for what's going to be a surge in demand and kind of pair that with constructing more natural gas-fired power generation and things of that nature to meet data centers and AI demand? How are your conversations kind of evolving there? Jeff Miller : Look, there's a lot of discussion around what to do with gas. I think your point around data centers and alignment, it just -- in my view, that will be takeaway for gas at some point. Seems easier to lay data lines and gas pipelines. And the -- gas is such a fantastic fuel and resource for this country that I think it's directionally absolutely correct. In terms of timing, I think that will come on. I think it's early to still work through the mechanics of what that means to plants but I expect all that's coming together in the degree to which gas gets taken away that only creates more runway for oil in the Permian Basin. So I'm like -- I'm -- share your excitement around what data centers and AI mean for our industry in terms of natural gas takeaway and we've got a pretty good seat at that and get to watch it really closely and excited. James West : Got it. Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And then iCruise, you mentioned adoption. Now, I mean, we had great adoption internationally, but it sounds like you're getting better adoption in the US as well. Could you maybe highlight, kind of, what you're seeing with the iCruise and technology and how that's unfolding? Jeff Miller : Yeah, thanks. Look, man, I'm really pleased with the technology in North America and I really like the way we're going to market with it because you were going to market with full services, our own services, we\u2019re also selling direct sales and some rentals and that tells me three things about the technology. It tells me, A, it's in high demand. B, it tells me that it's very reliable because we could sell it that way and C, it's delivering performance And I'm really pleased with the customers that are adopting it because in my view, this kind of adoption is really, these are the gold standard of, in my view, drillers that, good drilling organizations that pick this tool up and say, wow, we really like it. We want more of it. And so, like I said, I think we've got a really good runway around drilling in North America and it's all rooted in sort of investments we've made over quite a few years, but I believe we're there today. James West : Got it. North America is a nice cash flow machine for you guys. Thanks, Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler. Luke Lemoine : Hey, good morning. Jeff Miller : Good morning, Luke. Luke Lemoine : Hey, morning. If you kind of revised the international outlook a little bit for this year, could you walk us through some of the puts and takes that have unfolded, or is some of this just a push into \u201825 on the spend? Jeff Miller : Well, look, we're sort of halfway through the year and we've got really good visibility into the balance of the year. And so I didn't think we'd hit the high end of the range. So wanted to tighten that up for you guys as we look out. Q4 will be the highest international quarter we have, typically with software sales and tool sales. But day in and day out, we're continuing to grow, and we're very focused on profitable growth. And as I think I alluded to earlier, my expectation is that we see a continuing march internationally of growth. And oil price says that, our clients are saying that, my own project inventory is saying that. So if you describe it as a push, that's one way to think about it. But just from where we sit today, I know what we can get done and I thought it would be worthwhile to narrow that a bit. Luke Lemoine : Okay. And then you touched on it a little bit earlier, but could you walk through some of the various unconventional international opportunities you're seeing develop over the next two or three years? Jeff Miller : Certainly. Look, Saudi Arabia and Argentina today are meaningful markets that are -- really have heft and are executing. The -- and I think what has changed and so the rest of the middle east I'm excited about and Middle East is a pretty big place if you think about it in terms of sort of from the Mediterranean all the way to back into Saudi, that's a long way. But there's a lot of activity being talked about. And I think we're right in the middle of those, I think. I know we're in the middle of those discussions. We've got a lot of experience in this. And I think what's different today is the sort of ability to accept sort of what the testing is. The early days activity of this, I think there's a lot of sort of we've seen starts and stops internationally, but now we have a proven model in two international markets where you get through the initial phase and then it becomes a meaningful contributor to production and I think that's being sort of seen by other places where they have good reservoirs, good rock and working through, I think, very thoughtfully and pragmatically what does it take to get from A to B. And so from my perspective, that's a much better discussion than sort of a scramble or wildcat sort of move all over the world. These are very serious operators that are taking a long view. Luke Lemoine : Okay. Thanks, Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Saurabh Pant with Bank of America. Saurabh Pant : Hi. Good morning, Jeff and Eric. Jeff Miller : Good morning, Saurabh. Eric Carre : Hey, Saurabh. How are you? Saurabh Pant : Good. Thank you. Maybe, Jeff, I'll start with a question on D&E margin. Obviously, Eric, you guided to the third quarter, but anything beyond that, not just fourth quarter, but \u201825, how should we think about margin expansion opportunity because this is a primarily international driven business, right? How should we think about the impact from net pricing improvement, technology uptake? I know you talked about Landmark, right? But just help us a little bit with the margin expansion opportunity in D&E. Eric Carre : Yeah, I think the way to look at D&E margins is really the progression on year-on-year basis. There tends to be quite a bit of difference between different quarters as we recognize revenue around software impacts mostly Q1, Q4, et cetera. So it's really the year-on-year progression by quarter that you need to pay attention to from that perspective. We continue to improve the margins in D&E. We firmly believe that it continues as we get into next year. Jeff talked about the progression of the directional drilling business in North America. We continue to see progression and adoption of the new drilling technologies in the international markets as well. So directionally, we continue to be very confident in the growth of our D&E margins as we go into 2025. Jeff Miller : Maybe a little more color on that, because when I think about our drilling business, we rolled out iCruise, which is the drilling tool, the BHA, and then, that penetration has grown to -- we're drilling a lot more feet with our iCruise than we are our legacy tools. Probably, 60%, 70% percent of our fleet is that today. But what follows on that is an equal sort of step-up in efficiency, performance and actually margin for us around our iStar technology, which is basically the LWD technology that goes with it. And that adoption or actually implementation is much less, I want to say, in the 20% range. So we've got a very good glide path of things that structurally improve margins for the most part D&E. And so I see that as part of my confidence around, look, we just need to continue to retire the old as it's time and replace it with the new. And that is structurally improving our capital efficiency. Saurabh Pant : Okay, fantastic. Now that's helpful. And just one on the production side of things. I know you talked about artificial lifting in your prepared remarks. Good to see international growing at a much faster pace than the overall international market for lift. But if we focus on the production chemicals side of things, I know you acquired Athlon, you've been investing time and money to expand that business, right? Maybe just update us on that, Jeff, where does the production chemicals fit and what's the opportunity just on that side for Halliburton? Jeff Miller : Well, according to that business, it's clearly part of our portfolio, but it's also an inherently sort of lower returning business than the balance of our business. So we run it like all of our business with a focus on profitability and returns. I'm pleased at the pace we're filling our plant in Saudi Arabia. And that business has a long sales cycle. But we know a lot about chemicals and continue to execute that. Saurabh Pant : Okay, fantastic. Okay, Jeff, Eric, thank you. I\u2019ll turn it back. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Eric Carre : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citi. Scott Gruber : Yes, good morning. Jeff Miller : Good morning. Eric Carre : Good morning. Scott Gruber : Good morning. I'm curious, diesel prices have come off a little bit and there's hopes for a natural gas price recovery next year. So, Jeff, I'm curious, what gas price would close the cost of fuel delta between e-frac when using CNG and traditional diesel? I don't think it's $4 or $5 gas. I want to check that with you and just overall how would you describe e-frac economics even in an environment of healthier gas? Jeff Miller : It's a couple things. It's a lot higher than that to start with. I mean if we just use sort of Btu 6 times, 6 times 4, at $4, you're still a long way from diesel prices. The other thing is the efficiency of the mousetrap. I mean, it's just -- our e-fleets are creating value well beyond the economic trade-off with gas. That's not to say there isn't a lot of runway around economic trade-off with gas, but that platform in and of itself is just a better operating machine and it provides technology for clients that really they can't get -- that's not available in another form. And whether that's AutoFrac, Octiv, what we're doing with sensory in terms of understanding recovery, a lot of this. And so we're able to help solve for delivering what was planned with precision and in measuring performance of what was placed in the reservoir. That's a whole different kettle of fish, but it's all attached to the ZEUS platform. And so all of that runs together. So when I think about e-fleets broadly, yes, there is the gas arbitrage which is happening all the time and like I said, long way to go on gas arbitrage before that ever comes up. But I think more importantly is what we're able to achieve with that technology for our customers. Scott Gruber : Makes a lot of sense. And ultimately it sounds like Octiv and AutoFrac are going to help kind of further that ultimate penetration for e-frac with your customers and kind of extend any type of saturation point that ultimately could be hit. Just as you think a few years out, as you develop these softwares, develop a platform for a more efficient operation, where do you think e-frac goes as a percent of Halliburton\u2019s fleet? And kind of when do you get there? Jeff Miller : Well, look, I think we talked about this. We'll eclipse 40% this year. I expect we're at 50% next year. And we continue to invest both in the -- we're at scale today. And that allows us then to both improve or continue to extend the technology around the pump itself and the power systems, and then also the software that we're talking about that really addresses in my view what operators are focused on which is recovery and placement and a whole lot of things that affect productivity over time. And so we're extending that moat around that technology every day. And so I'm confident that as we continue into the future, we've got quite a glide path of ideas and things that will make that, yet again, even more effective for customers over time. So, pleased with where we are there. Scott Gruber : I appreciate the color, Jeff. Thank you. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Becker with Capital One. Doug Becker : Hello? Jeff Miller : Doug? Doug Becker : Yes, can you hear me? Jeff Miller : I can, good morning. Doug Becker : So, Halliburton's North America revenue is regularly outperforming the North America rig count. Just wondering if you could just highlight some of the key drivers of that outperformance that you expect going forward and really asking to try and calibrate how Halliburton's North American revenue might outperform the rig count next year. Jeff Miller : I think a lot of it, it's -- e-fleets are contracted. That's a large part of our business. The performance is leading in terms of efficiency and technology and we continue to invest in technology that differentiates Halliburton. And that's one of the key things. I mean, it's consistent with our strategy. I'll pivot back to our strategy just for a minute but we want to -- maximizing value in North America means that we're very targeted about what we do, what we invest in, where we spend money and on those things that we know will create differentiation. And clearly, technology is one of those key areas and not technology for the sake of technology but targeted technology that can solve for automation, that can solve for subsurface understanding and measurements, direct measurements. And so, that focus allows us to outperform on the revenue side of that and the maximize value again. That strategy hasn't changed at all and gives me a lot of confidence into \u201825 and beyond in terms of where Halliburton is in the market. Doug Becker : I mean, is it too aggressive to think about in a flat North America rig count environment? Halliburton\u2019s revenue is still growing 5% next year in that type of environment. Jeff Miller : Yeah, I mean, it could be. We need to watch it unfold next year. But look, I -- again, I'll go back to -- our performance in the market is going to outperform. It's early on \u201825 but I\u2019ve got confidence in the technology and the solutions that we provide for our customers that are unique and that puts us in the position to outperform. Doug Becker : Right. That completely makes sense. And then just a quick one on the e-fleets. We've been hearing more talk about white space even on dedicated or contracted fleets. Just wanted to get a little bit better sense for your e-fleets. Is there any risk of white space? I fully appreciate that they're long-term contracts and they justify the returns, but just thinking about any potential white space risk on those contracts. Jeff Miller : No, not the case. Our clients -- that contract -- again, these are contracted with customers with long programs, they're going to use these e-fleets. It will be always -- if there were white space, this is the fleet that they will keep working no matter what. It is -- when you're delivering lower cost of ownership, you are -- and delivering the technology and the client is committed to the fleet, that's the fleet that's always working. And so, no, not worried about that. Doug Becker : That's what I wanted to hear. Thank you. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Operator : Our last question today will come from Marc Bianchi with TD Cowen. Marc Bianchi : Hey, thank you. The first one I had was on the activity outlook. Jeff, you mentioned that it could improve here from the second half of \u201824, but it sounds like you're stopping short of talking about revenue. And I guess maybe following on some of Doug's question, when you look at how hard it is to call revenue, is price -- uncertainty about price the main thing or maybe talk about the top one, two or three things that are uncertain around revenue versus activity. Jeff Miller : No, I think the uncertainty around activity is really the driver here. And when we look at the second half of the year, we've had some customers that did -- we caught up with them and they're still customers and they plan to go to work again next year and maybe even later this year. So no, that's not my concern. It is, again, I'll pivot back to our strategy in terms of maximizing value. We've got a lot of tools that allow us to do that technically. And, I think it's just a question of pacing of things happening in -- whether it's setting plans or other things. But, the \u201825 will be, in my view, clearly higher than the second half of 2024. Marc Bianchi : Okay, great. And then the other one I had, maybe this one's for Eric, but just looking at the third quarter guide for C&P, the margin reduction sequentially seems pretty steep for the revenue reduction we're getting. Could you talk about maybe some of the moving pieces there, what might be driving that margin weakness? Eric Carre : Yes, I mean, there's the -- the margin guidance is actually a combination of what we talked about for North America, but really Q3 margins in the international business are going to be lower than Q2 as well. So there's just not too much to read into this except there's a lot of moving parts in the business. It's not just North America. It's multiple product lines as well. So it is not all related to North America. Marc Bianchi : Yeah. Great. Thank you. I'll turn it back. Operator : That concludes today's question\u2026 Jeff Miller : Okay. Well, thank you. Let's wrap up the call here. I know all of you have a very busy day ahead of you, and maybe I'll give you a few minutes back before your next call. But as we close out today's call, it's important to step back and remember this. Halliburton delivered 18% margins and about $800 million of free cash flow in the second quarter. We're well on track to deliver 10% free cash flow growth this year. Our international business and its technology portfolio have never been stronger. Our strategy to maximize value in North America is working. We are committed to maximizing value, not market share, and I expect that strategy continues to deliver strong returns. Look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2024 Halliburton Company Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I will pass the call over to the Senior Director of Investor Relations, David Coleman. Please go ahead. David Coleman : Hello, and thank you for joining the Halliburton third quarter 2024 conference call. We will make a recording of today's webcast available for seven days on Halliburton's website after this call. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO; and Eric Carre, Executive Vice President and CFO. Some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our third quarter earnings release and in the quarterly results and presentation section of our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin today's discussion with our highlights from the third quarter. We delivered total company revenue of $5.7 billion and adjusted operating margin of 17%. International revenue was $3.3 billion and grew by 4% year-over-year, led by Middle East Asia, which delivered an increase of 9%. North America revenue was $2.4 billion, a decrease of 9% year-over-year. Finally, during the third quarter, we generated $841 million of cash flow from operations, $543 million of free cash flow and repurchased approximately $200 million of our common stock. The August cybersecurity event has not had a material effect on our financial condition or operating results. However, that event, together with the effect of storms in the Gulf of Mexico, did reduce our adjusted earnings for the quarter by roughly $0.02 per share due to lost or delayed revenue. The cybersecurity event also had an impact on our free cash flow during the quarter due to delayed billing and collections and caused us to pause our share repurchase program while we assess the impact of the event. Importantly, our full year expectations for free cash flow and cash returned to shareholders remain unchanged, and we expect both to accelerate in the fourth quarter. Before we move on, I would like to take a moment and thank our employees for their extraordinary work while we navigated the cybersecurity event this quarter. Our employees maintained operational continuity under challenging conditions, and I celebrate their effort and grit as they work through the event. I would also like to extend my thanks and appreciation to our customers for their support and close collaboration through this time. Turning to our geographic results. I'll begin with the international markets where Halliburton's revenue grew 4% year-over-year, led by the Middle East Asia region. For the full year, I expect international revenue growth to be in line with the overall market and below our prior guidance. I am pleased with our performance and the continued growth of our business. Next year, directionally, we see international growth in the low- to mid-single digits. I'm encouraged by projects I see in the pipeline, and I am confident that Halliburton will deliver on these opportunities and create value for both us and our customers. My confidence comes from the strength of our largest international business lines, the depth of our technology portfolio, the breadth of our global reach and the power of our value proposition. Halliburton's largest international business lines, cementing, completion tools and drilling fluids form the backbone of oil and gas development spending globally and each is a leader in their market. We've earned these leadership positions through our legacy of execution, consistent service quality and our digital and technology developments. The transformation of our Sperry Drilling business clearly demonstrates the impact technology developments have on our business. The success of our organically developed iCruise and iStar directional drilling and logging tools, LOGIX automation and remote operation platform and ultra-deep resistivity and look ahead tools create a step change in Halliburton's international competitiveness and return profile. Year-to-date, Sperry has delivered the highest international revenue growth of any major product line. Further, Halliburton today is present in all major international basins as well as select frontier areas with promising future development potential. Our international business operates both on and offshore with roughly 50% of our revenue outside of North America land earned from offshore operations. Finally, our value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers drives our unique approach to creating value for our customers and Halliburton. Our collaborative approach wins with our customers and is exemplified by our alliances in the North Sea and elsewhere. These alliances have pioneered new ways of working to consistently deliver industry-leading performance on integrated projects. I am confident in our international business. I am confident because of the strength of our technology portfolio, our unique value proposition, our clear strategy, our experienced workforce and deep customer relationships. I expect that Halliburton's international franchise will continue to deliver growth and returns. Today, I would like to spend some time describing a few areas where I expect outsized international growth for Halliburton in 2025 and beyond. These are unconventionals, artificial lift and intervention. Two things are clear to me. One, unconventional developments are becoming more important, and I expect they will grow faster than other market segments over the next few years. Two, Halliburton is the clear leader in unconventionals, both in technology and execution, and I expect Halliburton to play the same leadership role internationally as we have in the U.S. We see evidence of this in the Middle East, where Halliburton was awarded a multiyear unconventional drilling services contract and started up an unconventional hydraulic fracturing fleet, both of which grow Halliburton's market share in a strategically important customer asset. Elsewhere in the region, we see several other growth opportunities for Halliburton in emerging unconventional plays. Turning to Halliburton's international artificial lift business, we saw over 30% year-on-year revenue growth this quarter, and we expect to continue to outgrow the market on the strength of our leading technology portfolio. One such technology is our TrueSync hybrid motor, which combines the reliability of an induction motor with the efficiency of a permanent magnet motor. Initially deployed in North America, we anticipate strong international demand, especially in Latin America and the Middle East, where its economic benefits can be realized at scale. Another key technology is our Intelevate service, which uses AI to process real-time data and remotely manage pumps for optimal performance. We saw a 50% increase in international wells monitored since the start of the year. In North America, Halliburton performed over 160,000 remote interventions this year, and we expect Intelevate to deliver similar value internationally as we expand our installed ESP base. Well intervention is another segment, I believe, will outgrow the overall market. We have seen this already with our Production Solutions product line, which this year alone has grown at twice the rate of our overall international business. Well intervention has long been an area of focus for Halliburton's organic investment and technology development. For example, Halliburton and alliance with TechnipFMC achieved the world's first riserless coiled tubing intervention service. This technology means Halliburton's full suite of subsea well intervention services can be deployed without the requirement for a riser equipped deepwater rig. Customers can now intervene in thousands of marginal or end-of-life offshore wells that otherwise could not be economically serviced. These are a few examples that describe the unique above-market growth opportunities we see for Halliburton. To summarize international markets, I am confident in the strength of our international business. I believe our technology portfolio, value proposition, and strategy will drive profitable growth in 2025. Turning to North America. Our third quarter revenue declined 4% compared to the second quarter, primarily due to lower hydraulic fracturing activity in U.S. land. I expect the combination of seasonality and budget exhaustion will result in a full year revenue decline at the low end of our prior guidance. Our strategy to maximize value in North America remains unchanged, and I expect we will continue to outperform our competitors. Here's how I expect to maximize value in North America as I look to 2025. In our Completion business, maximizing value means unique technology leading service quality and efficiencies and disciplined capital deployment. The success of this strategy is clear. And today, I am pleased that 90% of our fracturing fleets are committed for work in 2025, with multiple opportunities for the remaining 10%. Further, the unique completion technologies we deploy in this market are key differentiators for Halliburton and our customers. Together, they comprise the Zeus platform, electric pumping units, Octiv Auto Frac and Sensori subsurface measurement. Each of these technologies is commercial, and we are seeing accelerated adoption into customer workflows. This quarter, we signed contracts for two new e-fleets and also secured extensions on several existing fleets at prices commensurate with the leading performance of our platform. We believe the performance of our e-fleets and their integration with other unique components of the Zeus platform will continue to drive demand for this equipment, which we expect exceeds 50% of our active fleet next year. Turning to Octiv Auto Frac. Customers have contracted this automation technology at a remarkable pace. Since launch in Q3, we've deployed Auto Frac on 20% of our e-fleets and expect to expand to 50% in the next two months. In 2025, we expect the vast majority of our e-fleets to operate with Auto Frac contracts. I am also pleased with the deployment progress of Sensori fracture diagnostics, which provide the building blocks for improved per foot recovery for our customers. During the third quarter, we embedded Halliburton's Sensori fracture monitoring technology into a number of our customers' well completion workflows and expect to further expand our customer base for this unique technology in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, I expect the Zeus' platform and its constituent technologies to see continued adoption. I believe these technologies, working together seamlessly in an automated real-time environment will create a path to greater fracture consistency, ever higher levels of efficiency and ultimately improved recovery. The potential value creation related to these technologies is significant. We are working today with several market-leading operators to advance this integrated application of the Zeus platform. I believe we are just at the beginning of what this technology will accomplish. Shifting to Drilling and Evaluation. Our North America drilling services business demonstrated nearly 20% year-on-year growth this quarter despite a rig count decline of 5% over the same period. I expect this unique growth to continue in 2025. In unconventional basins, our iCruise rotary steerable tool and LOGIX drilling automation platform, reliably deliver curve and lateral sections in a single run. We delivered revenue growth this year in each of our commercial models. Rental, sales and full service, and I expect further expansion next year. In Canada, Halliburton's leading portfolio of well ranging technologies, such as our Aurora magnetic ranging service, is the preferred solution for steam-assisted gravity drainage wells. Expanded midstream infrastructure has improved market access for oil producers in Canada, which creates a strong future runway for these technologies. In Alaska, our EarthStar ultra-deep resistivity tool and reservoir mapping service deliver unmatched performance and unique insights for customers drilling extended reach wells on the North Slope. We see significant growth opportunities for our logging while drilling and directional drilling services as activity increases in multiple projects in the area over the next few years. Across a broad spectrum of North America drilling applications, Halliburton's technology delivers performance, precision and unique insights for our customers that have driven meaningful share growth and strong returns, and I expect further revenue growth in 2025. To finish my thoughts on North America. Our strategy to maximize value is unchanged. The strategy means we focus on returns, not share. We deliver leading service quality and efficiency, and we develop differentiated technologies that create value for our customers and Halliburton. I believe Halliburton's execution of this strategy has transformed the resilience and profitability of our North America business. Let me close with this. I see solid opportunities across business lines and geographies for Halliburton. As we execute on our strategies, profitable international growth and maximize value in North America, we will target opportunities to deliver unique value, allocate capital to the highest return opportunities, and prioritize free cash flow generation and shareholder returns. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric? Eric Carre : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Our Q3 reported net income per diluted share was $0.65. Adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.73. Before we turn to our detailed results, I want to take a moment to discuss the impacts of the cybersecurity event this quarter on our earnings, free cash flow, stock buybacks and SAP deployment. Starting with earnings, the lost revenue resulting from the cybersecurity event and the storms in the Gulf of Mexico impacted our adjusted results by approximately $0.02 per diluted share. In addition, we incurred $35 million of cybersecurity event related expenses, which is excluded from our adjusted results. In Q4, we do not expect to incur significant further expenses related to the event. Our free cash flow was impacted by system outages, which affected our ability to invoice and collect receivables during the quarter. We work closely with our customers and expect to collect those amounts in Q4. We maintain our expectation of greater than 10% growth in full year free cash flow compared to last year. We paused our stock repurchase program as we assess the impact of the event and repurchased fewer shares this quarter than targeted. Our plan is to catch up on buybacks in Q4. Finally, this quarter, we successfully completed the implementation of SAP S4 in our first country. Based on lessons learned there, and the cybersecurity event, I now expect the project to be delayed three to six months and cost approximately $20 million to $30 million more than our initial estimate. Turning now to our company results. Total company revenue for Q3 '24 was $5.7 billion, a decrease of 2% sequentially. Adjusted operating income was $987 million, and adjusted operating margin was 17%. Now turning to the segment results. Beginning with our Completion and Production division, revenue in Q3 was $3.3 billion, a decrease of 3% sequentially. Operating income was $669 million, a decrease of 7% sequentially and operating income margin was 20%. These results were driven by lower hydraulic fracturing services in U.S. land and Latin America. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in Q3 was $2.4 billion, while operating income was $406 million, both sequentially flat. Operating margin was 17%, a sequential increase of 36 basis points. These results were driven by improvement in fluid activity in Latin America and higher software sales globally, offset by greater-than-anticipated rig count reductions in the Middle East and project delays in the North Sea, two of our largest well construction markets. Now let's move on to geographic results. Our Q3 international revenue was flat sequentially. Europe Africa revenue in Q3 was $722 million, a decrease of 5% sequentially. This decline was primarily due to decreased drilling-related services in the North Sea, and lower completion tool sales in West Africa. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher cementing activity in the North Sea. Middle East Asia revenue in Q3 was $1.5 billion, an increase of 3% sequentially. This increase was primarily due to increased pressure pumping services in Saudi Arabia, higher completion tool sales and fluid services in the Middle East, and higher wireline activity in Asia. Partially offsetting these improvements were lower drilling services and project management activity in the Middle East. Latin America revenue in Q3 was $1.1 billion, a 4% decrease sequentially. This decrease was primarily due to lower hydraulic fracturing activity in Argentina, partially offset by increased drilling-related services and improved project management activity in the region. In North America, Q3 revenue was $2.4 billion, a 4% decrease sequentially. This decline was primarily driven by decreased pressure pumping services in U.S. land in addition to lower activity across multiple product service lines in the Gulf of Mexico, partly due to the impact of storms. Moving on to other items. In Q3, our corporate and other expense was $60 million, which was below our prior guidance. As a result, we expect our Q4 corporate expenses to increase about $10 million. In Q3, we spent $28 million or about $0.03 per diluted share on SAPS for migration, which is included in our results. For Q4, we expect SAP expenses to increase about $5 million. Net interest expense for the quarter was $85 million. For Q4, we expect net interest expense to increase about $5 million. Other net expense for Q3 was $52 million, which was higher than anticipated, driven by unfavorable foreign exchange movements in multiple currencies. For Q4, we expect this expense to be approximately $35 million. Our effective tax rate for Q3 was 21%, and our normalized effective tax rate was 23.5%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 23.5%. Capital expenditures for Q3 were $339 million. For the full year of 2024, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 6.4% of revenue. Our Q3 cash flow from operations was $841 million, and free cash flow was $543 million. For the full year 2024, we expect free cash flow to be at least 10% higher than 2023. Now let me provide you with comments on our expectations for Q4. In our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to decline 1% to 3% and margins to decline 75 to 125 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect sequential revenue to be flat to up 2% and margins to be flat to up 50 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thanks, Eric. Here are the key points I would like you to take away from our discussion today. I am confident in our international business. I believe the strength of our technology portfolio, unique value proposition, and clear strategy will continue to deliver growth and returns. I'm excited about the emerging trends in the international market, where I believe Halliburton will demonstrate unique growth. And in North America, we are widening the moat around our Zeus platform and expect to keep growing our drilling business. And now, let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] First question is from the line of Dave Anderson with Barclays. Please proceed. Dave Anderson : So maybe let's just start with the obvious, and how you think the election might impact your business? Is the thesis out there, obviously, the market sort of buying first asking questions later? But that reduced regulation, faster permitting is going to result in higher onshore activity kind of going forward. Is that a valid assumption? I mean, is that the way you're thinking about the market for the next couple of years? I could certainly see how complete the Gulf of Mexico, which seems to be mired in red tape. But how do you think this impacts your North America onshore business? Jeff Miller : Look, Dave, it's only positive. It could only be positive. In fact, I'm quite optimistic about that outlook. And here's why. I mean, I think what you saw was a reflection of a commonsense view of economics and resource development, which are incredibly important in this country. And then more importantly, it's the way it was rolled out. I mean it reflects the majority of people that have a rational view about how important energy is to our country. And so, when I think about that, I think every dollar that is not spent defending and debating the industry, but rather being invested in this industry, are absolutely good for Halliburton's business. Dave Anderson : What about the Gulf of Mexico? Do you think this could -- you could start to see a pickup in activity out there? I mean I know there's been some issues kind of getting permits and things like that. Do you think that could potentially free that up? Jeff Miller : Yes. I think -- look, Dave, yes. I mean I think that there's a lot of risk that's been painted over this industry, particularly regulatory risk, and it's probably even more acute in the Gulf of Mexico, given the significance of the investments and the types of decisions that get made that are long term in nature by operators. And I think the more that those are derisked either through regulation or legislation creates an even better runway. I mean operators don't operate in a vacuum. I mean they are digesting risk every day. And I think what we saw was directionally, hey, energy is extremely important. There's absolutely no reason we should be -- anyway, I think that we're in a good place with energy development in this country. Dave Anderson : Understood. And if I could maybe shift to just more specifically kind of the here and now and U.S. onshore. It's clearly slowing as we approach year-end, we've all sort of seen this. It does look like you faced a ton of pricing pressure so far, but you're kind of guiding down to margins kind of moving down a little bit in the fourth quarter. I was wondering if you could talk about sort of potential widening spread of pricing amongst say conventional diesel, Tier 4 and e-frac. Are you seeing that kind of spread happening here? And if so, does this kind of -- are you thinking about accelerating your Zeus? You talked about this towards Zeus platform, which really does sound very differentiated. I just wanted to accelerate that program because that should, therefore, kind of drive into higher pricing going forward? Jeff Miller : Well, Dave, we still see demand for our Zeus platform and growing demand for that Zeus platform. So, we'll be consistent with in terms of acceleration is more a matter of customers that see the value and contract them. And we've seen that actually this quarter, and we've seen renewals. So, I feel really confident in that. And I think it will accelerate almost just by virtue of making that available in the market and having more opportunities to put it to work, as opposed to when you think acceleration, that means we push the pedal and spend and do. I really think we're going to stick with our maximize value approach and let the diesel, retire or move outside the country, that will be replaced with electric and also -- as important as the electric is, quite frankly, the entire platform that is creating outsized value for customers. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Securities. Please proceed. Arun Jayaram : Jeff and Eric, I really want to get your thoughts on how you see North America and Completion and Production kind of trending next year? You mentioned that 90% of your frac fleets is committed for '25 and perhaps 50% of that capacity up to that could be Zeus fleets. So, it sounds like you've kind of navigated through the RFP season, and you got a lot of equipment kind of committed. You also mentioned that you've announced some extensions on some Zeus fleet that's maybe a little bit earlier than we're thinking. So, I was just wondering, given that amount of capacity that's been committed, what's your just outlook for non-frac next year? And I'm trying to think about how margins could play out over the next 12 months. Jeff Miller : Well, look, look, I feel good about 2025, and we talk to customers -- I talk to customers every day, and they are clearly planning to work. But they're also planning to be more efficient and improve recovery at the same time. Now that's plays directly into our strengths, whether it's more silo frac, longer laterals, faster wells and obviously the Zeus platform. So, when I think about 2025, I think about maximizing value, and that means solving the hardest problems are unconventionals with better recovery, widening the moat around our Zeus platform, the drilling performance that I described in the outsized adoption that we're seeing for our drilling solution. And yes, having 90 fleets committed -- 90% of our fleets committed today, does form a view about 2025, and I've described those things that we're going to be doing in the market that are consistent with the performance as you've seen till now. So, I think about the market today. I mean we've arguably been arguably have been in a downturn for 18 months. And the tools and the approach that we've taken are the tools and approach that we will take. Arun Jayaram : Okay. Fair enough, Jeff. Maybe -- it does help us think about '25. This is kind of a consistent buy side question that we've gotten, Jeff. Is the dynamic in North American frac is the fact that companies like Halliburton are pumping more hours per day doing more completion footage completed per day? And so, a lot of my E&P coverage now is highlighting the ability, for example, one operator mentioned that they could do -- in '25, they could use four frac fleets to do what five frac fleets did in '24. Does that make sense? So, you're using less equipment. And the question we're asking ourselves is how does this impact your profitability if these four frac fleets are doing a similar amount of footage? How does that impact Halliburton, were thinking maybe you lose some margins or some revenues through pass-through, but how does that impact your base frac business using that example? Jeff Miller : Well, look, number one, we're at the leading edge of that efficiency, which means that we're getting more reps, and in most cases, based on sort of our equipment, we get more reps on less capital. So, from a maximized value standpoint, it doesn't take 2x the equipment to do a simul-frac. In fact, it takes less than half more. And so, generating the same or more revenue with less equipment is positive and strategically why we build the equipment the way that we do. At the same time, creating more value by pumping, which just takes me to the Zeus solution and the platform. That's also part of how the operators get better. And I'll tell you, I would much rather be on the front end of this than somewhere else. So, leading this charge is where we want to be. It keeps us busy and creating opportunities to create more value. So, you're thinking about it the right way. Yes, this industry gets more efficient. I think it gets harder to get more efficient from here. But I expect Halliburton plays at the front end of that and as a leader. So, in some ways, the capital efficiency. I mean, we're driving capital efficiency, which ultimately does support margins. And look, there's a -- we are where we are today. If I look forward into the future, we know how to operate in that environment, and we're doing it, and we're successful at it. But I also think it's unreasonable to ignore future catalysts, whether Tier 1 rock becomes Tier 2, becomes Tier 3. There are other things that happened that I think would be positive. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Please proceed. James West : You highlighted a lot on intervention this quarter. I think maybe investors that aren't following you as closely as myself or Dave or Arun would know about the tremendous amount of, not capital, but just R&D and work you guys have done in building that business out as a big strength of yours. Could you maybe talk through kind of -- I guess, why highlight now? I guess first and then kind of where you were, where you've been, where you are today, and how you view that as one of the kind of huge strength of the Company? Jeff Miller : Yes. Thanks, James. Look, this has always been an important business for Halliburton intervention, whether it's stimulation, it's entering wellbores, and those are the markets that maintain the baseload of oil and gas production around the world. And so, we've been in that business, but I'm highlighting it partly because I don't anyone to forget how important predicting that base load is, and how much work that generates. But I also would like to characterize that in terms of the R&D effort that we're putting in around that. And so, if I go sort of contextually over look over some history. In Halliburton when we invest in a direction, it's important for us. So, I think unconventionals, if you go back a number of years, then we've talked about what we've done around Sperry drilling from an R&D and creating critical mass and a bigger business doing the same thing with intervention. And we've done it for a number of years. However, you're going to see us developing things like we described on the call today, riserless intervention is an incredible step forward in terms of making wells economic. We've talked about it for a decade probably worked hard on it with a technique FMC for five years, and now we're here. But those are the kind of things I expect to see us do more of and create a bigger growing market for us. And so, from our perspective, this is where we will see outsized growth internationally. James West : Okay. Very good to hear. And then, Jeff, the growth in the interventions part of the business make earnings a little bit less cyclical than perhaps they've been previously and therefore, a higher multiple. Jeff Miller : I think so. I mean these are completely agree with you, and it's part of the reason we want to continue to invest and generate that outsized growth. But it's the kind of growth that decline curves never go away. And so, everything is obviously declining. Therefore, there is always demand for intervention as we described. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed. Roger Read : Jeff, can I get your take, you talk a lot here about the opportunities international. And obviously, everybody talks about the productivity and efficiency that's going on in North America. Could you give us a little bit of a contrast of what you see happening globally? I mean, not just your products and services that improve it. But if you were to just say, what you think your customers are getting right now in terms of productivity and efficiency, how that's affecting your business question asked earlier, I think, by Arun, right, five frac crews goes to four, what the impacts are. So, as you think about the opportunity internationally, how does that compare? What kind of headwinds are you facing on the productivity front there? Jeff Miller : Well, look, North America fantastic resource, fantastic market and a place where operators can implement technology in a fairly straightforward way. I would say that internationally, we're much further behind in terms of technology application. In fact, I would argue some are just moving into maturity in Argentina where we will start to see more and more. But the Middle East, for example, has worked to a point, but I think that the opportunity -- we'll actually see growth in terms of consumption of equipment well before we see efficiency cresting just because there's so much work to do. And I think what those markets get the benefit of, particularly with Halliburton is a lot of the technology that creates better wells. I mean, if you go back in time in the U.S., they're well designed, there are a lot of wells that we would like to go back and refrac. But today, armed with the technology that we have, I believe we'll make better wells. But to say that -- but to get specifically to your question, we're not even close to that point of efficiency, reducing demand internationally. In fact, we're at the opposite end of that. We're back like it looked in the U.S., early days, where add-add, let's do more. Hope that helps, Roger? Roger Read : Yes, it does. I'd say kind of what we look at, the evidence seems similar that way, but I just wanted to talk to the experts about it. The other question I had, one of the things we hear about is a way to potentially accelerate drilling speeds going forward in the U.S. might be greater expansion of rotary steerable type and other types of advanced drilling devices. You mentioned that in your introductory part of the call as something to roll out to Latin America. But I was just curious how that's -- how do you see that in North America in terms of additional penetration over the coming years? Jeff Miller : Yes. Thanks. Look, I'm crystal clear that this is a market that continues to grow in rotary steerables, just the efficiency, precision, the types of wells that are being drilled in terms of length, tortuosity, everything I see in North America says, over time, the trend is that rotary steerables are a bigger and bigger part of this market, both from the ability to execute the drilling in terms of the complexity and length, but also the speed in terms of curve lateral. And that's really where we're getting so much traction with our iCruise tools in North America has been the reliability around drilling that curve lateral. And I see the exact same thing internationally. In fact, we're already -- we've described the contract that we've won in the Middle East for Sperry, same type of thing. I would expect to see growth in really any unconventional market around the world that -- iCruise CX is a terrific tool. I mean it's the performance is what's causing the growth in and share. And so very pleased with where we are, but I also think we're in the right spot from a secular growth standpoint, in the sense that, that is directionally where the market has to go in order to continue to get better both in time, but also in terms of the types of wells and the lengths that are being drilled. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Neil Mehta : I had a couple of company-specific items here, which is around the cybersecurity incident what are, Jeff, lessons learned around that certainly something that all Fortune-500 companies are having to contend with. But how do you ensure protection of this going forward? And help us understand it sounds like, it could create some delays to the ERP system rollout. Can you talk a little bit about what those impacts were? Jeff Miller : Yes. Thanks. Look, I think from lessons learned standpoint, I cannot overemphasize the importance of preparedness in terms of desktop drills, contracting with the absolute best professionals in the industry. And I'm so appreciative of the companies have supported us, Mandiant and others. But I would say that is probably one of the most important things any company can do is be absolutely prepared in advance for that. Eric Carre : So, in terms of the SAP ERP rollout, Neil, there's really a couple of things. So, the first one is what relates directly to the cyber incidents. And there, obviously, once the incident started most of our IT folks went on to helping fix the problem, restore the systems and everything. They were unavailable, obviously, to continue to participate in the rollout. And when that was done and the systems were restored, what you had is the finance and procurement organization when you do a catch-up mode basically restoring in the system or of the transaction that were made when we were operating in a manual mode. The second impact from the incident was the fact that as we roll out a big system like this, we do what's called localization events, which when we go and roll out the system in a new country, we sent a team ahead of time to really understand the details of statutories differences, tax differences and everything so that we get ready for any particular specifics of a given country. And then in parallel to that, we had the rollout in our -- first country we rolled out the system in Canada that was successful. We closed the quarter on S4. We closed October on S4, but as we did all of that, we learned a few things around the structure of our training around what it means to manage processes in two different systems and everything. So, all of that resulted in a replanning of the rollout, which we think now is going to be about three to six months over the initial plan. So, we'll get into H1 2026. Neil Mehta : Okay. Great. I'm glad you guys navigated. The follow-up is just around the stock buybacks. Again, you did $250 million in March and then $250 million in June in this quarter, it was closer to $200 million, and you explained why. But is 250 the right run rate, all else equal, as we think about 2025 and given the pullback in the share price given the macro environment, is there an argument to really lean into the share repurchase and take it to another level and really drive that free cash flow per share? So, I'll turn it over to you guys on that. Eric Carre : Yes. So, to address first part of your question, that's what we plan ahead, guided to an average $250 million per quarter that would lead to something around $1 billion for the year, significantly up from 2023. So, what happened in Q3 is, I mean, the mechanism that we use to go and buy back share, we do it in two parallel ways. So, one, we filed a 10b5-1 plan; and two, we do open purchase in the market. So, when the cyber incident started, we basically were cautious and we stopped all the open purchases because we didn't want to end up in a situation where the investigation would lead to the discovery of MDI. So, we paused that continued with the 10b5 plan. So, all of that landed in a number that was below what we were targeted initially and as we said in the remarks, the intent is to catch up a bit on that in Q4. Directionally, on the second part of your question, we really view buybacks as a systematic mechanism to return cash to shareholders. We look at it through cycles. So, while there might be some short-term opportunities, to your point, around the current share prices, we tried not to be opportunistic per se, but view -- again, stock buyback more as a through cycle mechanism to return cash. So, we might weigh in a bit more, but directionally, we want to be fairly steady. And as we look into next year, while we haven't worked our plan through, the general view would be to up what we've done so far in 2024. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Saurabh Pant with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Saurabh Pant : Jeff, maybe I have a couple of questions, one on offshore, one on North America. Let me just start on the offshore side of things because that's one place where there is a lot of optimism and structural optimism, not just short-term optimism. I want to just come back to that I know in the past, you have talked about upside in '25, particularly in West Africa and Norway and obviously offshore in general. But amongst the conversation from the offshore drillers and delay in contracting, maybe some projects being delayed due to the macro supply chain delays, given all of those headlines on the offshore driller side of things, is there anything we should be mindful of for the offshore side of your business as we think about 2025? Jeff Miller : No. Look, we see stability in our biggest markets, whether the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, Guyana, Norway, Black Sea, as we described this morning, positive elements of those. From our perspective, we move equipment between rigs. And so, the actual -- we're not in the rig business. So, the rig contracted status of rigs is not really impactful to us. The key is operators focus on continuing to drill and develop offshore resources, which we see a lot of strength around that, whether it's 20,000 in the Gulf of Mexico, I mean, there's just a lot of foot, and so there's a lot of probably back and forth in the rig business in terms of contracting and gaps and managing timing, but that doesn't impact us. We're working with clients. They have rigs available and they are either executing work or planning work and really bought a bit of exciting work around the world and in the Gulf of Mexico. Saurabh Pant : Okay. Fantastic. No, that's good color, Jeff. And then just one quick clarification on, Jeff, I think you made the comment in your prepared remarks about 90% of your fleet committed for [indiscernible]. That's really impressive like I think [indiscernible] Q&A ask. But my follow-up is, do we know at least roughly what the pricing on those fleets are going to look like, right? So basically, do we have line of sight on the profitability as well versus just activity on those fleets? Jeff Miller : Look, yes, we do have some of that, but we obviously work through that as well. What I would say about without getting into details because I won't. We're sticking with our strategy, which is to stay out of the spot market size the fleet to the market that we see as we've described, and we've been successful in getting things to work. We obviously don't exist in a vacuum. But at the same time, I believe Halliburton, and I know Halliburton reflects the performance and the technology that we bring to the market, which puts us at the high end of the range, and I get told that every single day. So, I'm well aware of where we are from that perspective. But confident that our strategies in place, and we're executing on the strategy that's gotten us to hear. Saurabh Pant : Okay. No, fantastic. As a market leader, what do you do in that industry, obviously decides where the market goes? So, it's good to hear that. And if I may, Eric, very quick one. I know you're not guiding to '25 CapEx yet. But broad strokes, can we still think about 6% of revenue for next year? Eric Carre : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with Benchmark. Please go ahead. Kurt Hallead : Jeff, as you -- as we all know, right, you're in constant communication with your cohorts at the oil and gas companies, and there's been a lot of noise, right, concerns about oil demand growth, concerns about excess OPEC capacity. And obviously, in the broader markets, that's weighed on the price of crude, right? So, in the conversations that you've had of late, right, it sounds like there's a bit more optimism or a constructive outlook that your customer base has maybe relative to the commodity market or the equity market. So just hoping you can give us some insights on how you're assessing those conversations, what you've seen risk things to give that sense of optimism, and what you could potentially help translate to the people on this call? Jeff Miller : Certainly. Look, I think that some of this is around the types of players in the market today. And I mean, these are very serious, large, well-capitalized operators. And so, as part of the E&P consolidation, it's gone sort of as expected in the sense that customers clearly want technology and efficiency. These large players have a larger baseload of work, they're stable. They plan to work through the cycle. It does create more contractable opportunities for us in terms of Zeus fleet and Zeus platform. But I think some of the optimism that you hear is; a, these aren't customers that ever react to short swings in commodity pricing. These are operators that build a plan, execute a plan, and I'm so pleased to work with these customers because that kind of clarity helps us run our business. I think probably some of that optimism you hear is we are getting better at what we do. They see paths to be more productive and they've got capital to go do it. And the commodity price today is clearly well within a range that drives consistent activity. And so -- and I think that there'll be a lot of interest in keeping oil and gas in a range that creates profitability for our clients and profitability for us. And that this industry continues to grow and just get -- becoming more and more effective, productive, profitable industry. Kurt Hallead : Great. I always appreciate the color, Jeff. Now maybe a follow-up for Eric, just on that CapEx question, right? So, in the fourth quarter, if the math maps out correctly, it looks like you're going to be about $450 million in CapEx, which is about $100 million higher than what you had been for quarterly run rate. You mentioned a couple of new e-fleets. So can we connect the dots and suggests that the incremental CapEx is -- the bulk of that is going to go toward the e-fleet rollout. And then just as an extension to that, you referenced 6% of CapEx for next year. In that 6% of CapEx of revenue for next year, how many e-fleets or are you assuming any additional et additions? Jeff Miller : Yes, I'll take that. Let me take that in terms of e-fleets going forward. E-fleets, again, we look at that from a pull standpoint, not a push the endpoint. So, we do expect deliveries in 2025. We've got some of those already planned and expect to do that, and we've also -- anyway. So that's where we are. I think the CapEx, I'm going to hand the forecasting to Eric. Eric Carre : As I mentioned earlier, the CapEx still intended to be 6%. Look, it's going to be a little higher than 6% this year as we revised revenue compared to the projection we had at the beginning of the year, and we had a lot of equipment and flat. I mean, we're still dealing with lead time on big pieces of capital equipment between six months and over a year. But as we look into next year, it's 6%. It's a balance between CD&E balance between the projection that we have for revenue in North America and international and the overall ratios continue to evolve as our business evolves and becomes more and more internationally weighted. Operator : Thank you. And that is all the time we have for Q&A today. I will turn the call back to Jeff Miller for his final comments. Jeff Miller : Yes, Carmen, thank you. As we close out today's call, I just want to leave you with this. I see solid growth opportunities for Halliburton across our business lines and geographies. I'm confident in our international business and its strong technology portfolio, unique value proposition and clear strategy. In North America, we are widening the moat around our Zeus platform, and we expect to keep growing our drilling business services in North America. So, I look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And with that, we close today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Coleman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. David Coleman : Hello, and thank you for joining the Halliburton fourth quarter 2024 conference call. We will make the recording of today's webcast available for seven days on Halliburton's website after this call. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO; and Eric Carre, Executive Vice President and CFO. Some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly update any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included on our fourth quarter earnings release and in the quarterly results and presentations section of our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. 2024 was a solid year for Halliburton. Here are the full year highlights. We delivered full year total company revenue of $22.9 billion. Our international business grew for the fourth year in a row with 6% year-over-year revenue growth led by Middle East/Asia, which delivered an increase of 8%. Our North America business declined 8% year-over-year, but outperformed the rig count and completion activity. Halliburton generated $3.9 billion of cash from operations and $2.6 billion of free cash flow. Finally, we repurchased $1 billion of our common stock and paid $600 million of dividends to our shareholders, representing a 60% return of free cash flow. Before we move on, I would like to thank our employees for their extraordinary work this year, delivering record performance in both safety and service quality. You, our employees, are the ones that deliver our value proposition every day, to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. Thank you for your commitment and hard work. Let me begin with my outlook for the industry and for Halliburton. I expect energy will continue to play a critical role in economic growth and prosperity and per capita energy consumption to grow for decades to come. We see this trend today as oil and gas consumption reached record highs alongside growth in renewable energy. I believe the accessibility, affordability and dependability of oil and gas are simply too compelling to ignore. I'm confident that as we move forward, the attitudes and approaches to hydrocarbon development will be pragmatic rather than idealistic. I believe there is no way we meet the energy demands around the world without oil and gas in large quantities for a long time and that gives me great confidence. This is a great environment for Halliburton and we begin the second half of this decade in a strong position with a transformed balance sheet, leading returns and strong free cash flow. In the years ahead, I am confident Halliburton will strengthen its competitive advantage and financial position for three fundamental reasons. First, the depth of our technology portfolio, combined with our global reach make Halliburton a leader in the global services marketplace. We focus our investments in market segments where our unique strengths generate attractive returns and I expect our targeted technology developments and electrification, automation and digital solutions to further increase these advantages. Second, our unique value proposition aligns Halliburton with our customers to deliver leading results and maximize asset values. We see the value of this alignment demonstrated again and again in the deepening of our customer strategic alliances. Lastly, I see customer activity shifting towards drilling technology, unconventionals, well intervention and artificial lift, all of which are areas where Halliburton excels today and where we are uniquely positioned to outperform in the future. Turning to our results. I'll begin with the international markets where Halliburton delivered another year of profitable growth. Our full year international revenue grew 6% year-over-year, led by the Middle East/Asia region, which grew 8%. I am pleased with our performance and the growth of our international business. In 2025, we expect flat international revenues for Halliburton year-over-year with growth in most international markets offset by activity reduction in Mexico. Absent Mexico, we expect our international franchise will grow low to mid-single digits next year. Beyond 2025, I am confident in the long-term outlook for Halliburton, in particular the next five years based on the growth engines in our international business and the power of our customer alliances. These growth engines include Halliburton's drilling technologies, unconventionals, well intervention and artificial lift businesses. I believe these growth engines could collectively generate an additional $2.5 billion to $3 billion of annual revenue in three to five years. Even more exciting than the growth I see in these areas, is the trend I see of customers embracing our value proposition to work in increasingly more collaborative and innovative ways. They adopt this way of working because it has proven to consistently improve performance and create value for them. While the power of our collaborative value proposition has traction all around the world, it's most visible in Norway. Halliburton has a growing and profitable business in Norway built on strong customer alliances. These alliances apply leading technologies and collaborative work environments. Together with our customers, we have successfully pioneered several advances that have delivered significant improvements in performance and safety. Over time, I see the rest of our international business moving in the same direction. What is clear to me and equally so to a growing group of operators is that the future of performance lies in deep collaboration. For the last decade, we have made strategic choices in the development of our people, processes and technology to reinforce a culture that is highly collaborative and creates exceptional performance in these environments. I expect this change will create unique value for Halliburton and our customers. To summarize international markets, I expect our value proposition, driving deep collaboration will further differentiate us and create clear value for both Halliburton and our customers. And our growth engines will contribute meaningfully to our international business in the years to come. I'm excited about these opportunities and I believe Halliburton has a terrific platform to outperform the international services market in 2025 and beyond. In North America, our full year revenue of $9.6 billion was an 8% decrease from 2023. Fourth quarter 2024 revenues were 7% lower than third quarter 2024 due to seasonality and customer budget exhaustion. As we look to 2025, I expect our North America revenue to decrease low to mid-single digits from 2024 levels or approximately flat with the second half of 2024. This lower revenue for the year is driven in part by lower negotiated prices for a portion of our fleet and we expect to see the majority of the margin impact from these price revisions in our first quarter results. Despite pricing, I am confident our financial performance will widely outpace our competition. If I step back from the numbers for a minute, I'm excited about several things Halliburton is doing in North America this year. Let me tell you what's going on under the hood that has me so excited. First, we are sold out. All of our fleets are working under committed or contracted programs. Next, Zeus. We're extending and renewing contracts for existing fleets, making new Zeus deliveries and expect our market leading e-fleets will comprise 50% of our fleet by the end of 2025. Next, technology, Octiv Auto Frac and Sensori are being widely adopted by customers and delivering value. Next, directional drilling, iCruise rotary steerables are on a pace to capture about 30% of the North America rotary steerable business by year end. And finally, I believe the next catalyzing inflection for North America services will be up, not down. I believe the most pressing energy problem in North America today is the power shortage driven by electrification and power demand for AI. And this cannot be solved without significant amounts of natural gas. This is on top of the expected increases in LNG exports. These are all very good things for Halliburton in 2025. These are the bedrock of our North America franchise as we move into the second half of the decade. When I think about the North America market through this period, several themes are crystal clear to me. First, our customers rely on our technology, innovation and collaborative work processes to deliver leading performance and lower total well costs. I expect further adoption of these technologies as our customers fully integrate them into their workflows where they drive stable long-term work programs for Halliburton. Octiv Auto Frac is a great example of this. Launched last year, it is already used on over 50% of our Zeus spreads with more growth expected this quarter. Our Sensori fracture monitoring is another example. Customers are adopting this technology at scale to optimize well completion designs on multi-well pads. In the fourth quarter alone, Sensori was used on more than 2,500 Frac stages in North America. The second trend I expect to continue is the rising importance of North America and our large customers' development plans and budgets. I expect our large customers will continue the industrialization of unconventional resources and seek even greater efficiencies and productivity. I believe Halliburton is uniquely positioned to innovate and deliver these improvements at scale. A final trend I expect to see through the rest of the decade is the durability and strength of Halliburton's financial performance. I believe there is little doubt, that our margins and cash flow generation to-date have marked a step change from prior cycles. While markets and margins will fluctuate, I am confident Halliburton's strategy will deliver attractive financial results over the long-term. Let me close my remarks with this. I'm excited about both the year ahead and the long-term for Halliburton. We expect to execute our value proposition, deepen our technology portfolio and deliver incremental revenue through our growth engines, drilling technology, unconventionals, well intervention and artificial lift. Finally, we remain disciplined in our capital allocation, prioritizing cash flow and return of free cash flow to shareholders. In 2024, we returned $1.6 billion or about 60% of free cash flow to shareholders in stock repurchases and dividends, and I expect we will return at least $1.6 billion of cash in 2025. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric? Eric Carre : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Our Q4 reported net income per diluted share was $0.70. Total company revenue for Q4 '24 was $5.6 billion, a decrease of 2% sequentially. Operating income was $932 million and operating margin was 17%. Now turning to the segment's results. Beginning with our Completion and Production division, revenue in Q4 was $3.2 billion, a decrease of 4% sequentially. Operating income was $629 million, a decrease of 6% sequentially. Operating margin was 20%, a sequential decrease of 49 basis points. Revenues were primarily driven by lower stimulation activity in North America and decreased pressure pumping services in Latin America, partially offsetting these decreases were improved artificial lift activity in North America and increased stimulation activity in Africa and the Middle East. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in Q4 was $2.4 billion and operating income was $401 million, both flat sequentially. Operating margin was 16%, a sequential decrease of 44 basis points. Revenues were driven by increased fluid services in the Middle East and Europe/Africa and improved drilling related services in the North Sea, offset by decreased drilling services in the Middle East and Latin America. Now let's move on to geographic results. Our Q4 international revenue increased 3% sequentially. Latin America revenue in Q4 was $953 million, a decrease of 9% sequentially. This decrease was primarily due to lower activity across multiple product lines in Mexico, partially offsetting these decreases were higher activity across multiple product lines in Brazil. Europe/Africa revenue in Q4 was $795 million, an increase of 10% sequentially. This increase was primarily due to improved drilling related services in the North Sea, as well as increased pressure pumping services and higher fluid services in Africa. Partially offsetting these increases were lower cementing activity and decreased pipeline services in the North Sea. Middle East/Asia revenue in Q4 was $1.6 billion, an increase of 7% sequentially. This increase was primarily due to higher stimulation activity, fluid services and completion tool sales in the Middle East, partially offset by decreased drilling throughout Asia. In North America, Q4 revenue was $2.2 billion, a decrease of 7% sequentially. This decline was primarily driven by lower stimulation activity across the region, partially offset by higher artificial lift activity and increased completion tool sales. Moving on to other items. In Q4, our corporate and other expense was $65 million. We expect our first quarter 2025 corporate expenses to decrease slightly. In Q4, we spent $33 million or about $0.04 per diluted share on SAP S4 migration, which is included in our results. For Q1 2025, we expect SAP expenses to be about $25 million. For the full year '25, we expect SAP expenses to be approximately $100 million. Net interest expense for the quarter was $84 million. For Q1 2025, we expect net interest expense to be about $90 million. Other net expense for Q4 was $47 million, which was driven by unfavorable foreign exchange movements in multiple currencies. For Q1 2025, we expect this expense to be approximately $40 million. Our effective tax rate for Q4 was 22.6% and we expect our Q1 2025 effective tax rate to be approximately 23%. For the full year 2025, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 25.5%, an increase of 300 basis points over our 2024 effective tax rate. This increase is driven in equal parts by fewer anticipated discrete tax items, the implementation of Pillar Two taxes and the shift in geographic earnings mix. Importantly, I expect full year cash taxes to be approximately flat with 2024. Capital expenditure for Q4 were $426 million, which brought our full year CapEx total to $1.4 billion or about 6% of revenue. For the full year of 2025, we expect capital expenditures to remain approximately 6% of revenue. Our Q4 cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion, driven by exceptionally strong collections during the quarter. Our free cash flow in Q4 was $1.1 billion, bringing our full year free cash flow to $2.6 billion, a 16% increase over 2023. Now let me provide you with comments on our expectations for our divisions for Q1 2025. In our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to decline 3% to 5% and margins to decline 175 basis points to 225 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect sequential revenue to decline 8% to 10% and margins to be flat to down 50 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thanks, Eric. Here are the key points I would like you to take away from our discussion today. I am confident in the long-term outlook for oil and gas, and I am pleased with the shift towards a pragmatic development of hydrocarbon resources. In the international markets, we see long-term growth as a result of the broader adoption of our collaborative value proposition and our growth engines. In North America, we are sold out on our Frac capacity. We see strong adoption of both our Completions and Drilling technologies and I am confident our financial performance will widely outpace our competition. Finally, we had a strong year for cash returns to shareholders and expect to return at least $1.6 billion to shareholders in 2025. And now let's open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. You may proceed. David Anderson : Hi. Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Miller : Good morning, Dave. David Anderson : So this past year, you had North America revenue fell 8%, a bit worse than you expected, yet C&P margins held pretty flat compared to 2023. On pricing, I guess, can you maybe talk about a little bit kind of how you did that? Was it pricing, more resilient cost structure? Then secondarily, just talked about lower negotiated prices and we see C&P margins coming down this year. So what changed here? Can you talk about kind of what part of your fleet was renegotiated? Was it the Zeus pumps? Was it kind of something or was it certain customers? If you could provide a little color around that, please? Jeff Miller : Yeah. Thanks, David. Look, 2025 -- 2024, yeah, we were able to manage through a market that has been following actually for 18 months in 2024. And in 2025, we expect our outlook is down slightly. Yeah. I think it was the ability to introduce Zeus, it was our efficiencies. It was our -- where we create value in the marketplace. But to be clear, we're not immune to pricing. And so, as we think about that, as I look at '25, all of our fleets are contracted, which is a terrific place to be, number one. We've got great visibility. And there's no question we're at the high end of the range. We know we're at the high end of any range. But we really don't operate in a vacuum looking forward and so our plan is to stick with the strategy. The strategy didn't change in '23, '24 or '25. And I think what you're going to see are solid returns from our business in '25. David Anderson : So one of the things, a big topic out there is completion efficiencies around the E&Ps. It's continued to be kind of a story out there. And I think that topic for a lot of investors means it's deflationary to services, basically being able to do more with less. On the other hand, how about you're enabling a lot of these efficiencies through your Zeus pumps through Auto Frac. The question is, kind of, how do you get paid for these efficiencies? And is it enough to offset some of these deflationary trends? And if you could please just touch on the recent announcement you had with Coterra on Auto Frac and would you expect more of those agreements to be announced this coming year? Jeff Miller : Yeah, David. I mean, clearly our -- the efficiency, we want to be at the leading edge of that efficiency. In some ways, I would argue the opposite with you in the sense that what we are doing is at the leading edge and creating outsized value for us. So it clearly offsets the stability of pricing in '24 and quite frankly, the very muted impact of pricing in 2025 relative to what I expect the market is, is on the basis of driving that efficiency and creating more evolutions for Halliburton and the ability to create more value. And quite frankly, it requires investment in equipment and technology to achieve that. And so, look I'm pleased with where we are. And when I look at the market, things like the Coterra announcement are a great example of what that technology does. I mean that's precisely the type of performance and value that we're creating not only in efficiency, but ultimately pointed towards recovery. I mean, and I think that's when I think about our technology and where we sit in the marketplace, we're able to have a very different conversation with customers. Clearly, efficiency is part of that, but there's also a more important dialog to have around the answer products that we're able to achieve with our technology. And answer products are not typically something people talk about with respect to Frac equipment. And so this is not just Frac equipment, it is in fact a platform delivering real answers. And so -- and that's what gives me confidence as I even look ahead into 2025, I think that C&P looks a little bit softer than 2024, but I also expect margin in the second half to firm up relative to the first half. As we see the full impact of getting back to work and then more broadly, tool sales stabilize and then we see growth in interventions and other things. So look, I'm really confident in the business that we have and that the -- this technology is driving a differential outcome for Halliburton. David Anderson : Great. Thank you very much, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed. Roger Read : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. I'd like to follow-up, Jeff, if you can on your comments about more U.S. gas needed and how we should think about how Halliburton is positioned for that? Meaning, as Dave was asking about productivity and efficiency trends have been impressive, but a lot of it's also been above ground, not just below ground. So as we ultimately have to increase activity in gas areas, how do you think that works through for you and for the industry? Jeff Miller : Look, I think it tightens it meaningfully and quickly. I mean, I think from a availability of equipment, this market is always shrinking in effect to what's required or demanded at a point in time. And we've seen attrition, we talked even at Halliburton about how we have retired equipment rather than work-in the spot market, but that's broadly across the industry. And so I think you'll see a lot of tightness in Frac, for example, as we see gas activity pick up. Roger Read : And one of the -- probably also getting kind of at the question Dave was asking about making sure you get things priced properly, you get the right returns for your company and for shareholders. What's the right way for us to think about where pricing is today versus what you would consider more equitable or even theoretically advantaged situation for Halliburton? Just obviously, you've got pricing pressure now that's worked into the system. It's worked into expectations. But when things start to reverse, kind of where you -- maybe another way to ask a question, where do you think margins can go? Jeff Miller : Yeah. Look, I think margins can move up and I expect that what we had been seeing, I've always thought that in the right kind of market and that pricing would move up well above where we were even in 2024. And so, I don't think it takes a lot of tightness to see that. And when I think about the catalysts of North America, I think that we are more likely to move up than down. And so, the combination of gas activity and we don't talk enough about, but private operators getting back into the business is assets are divested. I'm quite aware of several groups that have raised money that are in the market looking for assets and that's going to drive activity as well. And so, as you described it, we're at a place in the cycle where, yes, we are not immune to pricing, but the reality is, we haven't changed our strategy around that and we expect that we create outsized value and expect to get paid for that. Roger Read : All right. I appreciate it. I\u2019ll turn it back. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Saurabh Pant with Bank of America. You may proceed. Saurabh Pant : Hi. Good morning, Jeff, Eric. Jeff Miller : Good morning. Eric Carre : Good morning. Saurabh Pant : Hey, Jeff. Maybe I want to touch on the four growth engines that you talked about on your call, drilling tech, unconventionals, intervention and then artificial lift. It's really interesting, I think, Jeff, correct me, if I'm wrong, but I think I heard you talking about $2.5 billion to $3 billion in additional revenue over the next, I think you said three to five years. Maybe talk to that a little bit and give us a little more color on which of those four growth engines you see the most opportunity and which ones you think are going to be the most powerful over the next couple of years? Jeff Miller : Well, I think all four of them are going to have meaningful impact. Let's start with unconventionals just internationally. We're a global leader today and we see that market growing. And we also see demand for the technology that we talked about in North America. That same demand for technology and better recovery is universal and so that's certainly not limited to the U.S. I'd also talk about intervention. And again, this is an area where we've developed technology. We continue to develop technology that is differentiated. For example, we talked about riserless coil last quarter, but there's a whole suite of power mechanical tools, our overall focus on execution. And we think that's just a market where we'll see more dollars spent and we'll probably see more of that in sooner rather than later. And then, lift in some ways just given our relative size internationally, we've seen growth, but we've got a lot more upside for Halliburton uniquely as we grow that business and really take the same leadership technology that we see in North America internationally. And so -- and then drilling technology, there's a lot that we're doing around our drilling offering, whether it's closed loop drilling and automation and that's really where we see outsized growth for Halliburton. And so again, I think there's real value to be created there and I think they're all right in our wheelhouse to go do. We're well positioned and have a great suite of technology. Saurabh Pant : Great. Now, that's a very helpful context, Jeff. And then maybe one -- a question on Mexico. Jeff, Eric, if I understood your guidance right, I think you said excluding Mexico, international, you expect to be up low to mid-single digit, right? And including Mexico, it's flat. If I'm doing the math right, I know I don't have all the numbers, right. But if I'm doing the rough math right, that implies Mexico maybe it's down like 25% year-over-year. First thing, can you maybe validate that kind of math? And then what's exactly the expectation for Mexico through 2025? Do you expect things to improve in the back half of the year or do we not have any visibility there? Jeff Miller : Look, I think that what we see in Mexico is a new administration, new management team for Pemex and a bit of an activity reset. I say all of that and that is our outlook today, but at the same time, oil and gas is hypercritical to the economy in Mexico. And so it's hard for me to imagine that they don't find their footing as we work through the year. And we have a fantastic market position in Mexico. One of the reasons it's important to us and we have a great team there. And so I'm quite confident Halliburton will execute well in that market. But I think it's more a question around timing in terms of as Pemex finds its footing. And that's certainly not clear today, but I expect that it happens. It has in the past and I expect it will again. Saurabh Pant : Okay. Perfect. I got that. Okay, Jeff, I'll turn it back. Thank you. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Eric Carre : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with J.P. Morgan Securities. You may proceed. Arun Jayaram : Yeah. Good morning, Jeff. I have a follow-up maybe to David's question. Could you give us a sense -- we understand in talking to E&Ps that the Octiv Auto Frac service can be deployed with different kind of configurations. So I was wondering maybe you could briefly describe how it works and if you do pair it with the Sensori Frac monitoring service, the different configurations and maybe just talk a little bit about the commercial model if you do it on a standalone basis again versus combining it with Sensori, because I think you mentioned it's now running on 50% of your e-fleets. Eric Carre : Yeah. Look, I'm -- effectively, it gives you perfect control over the fracking so that this is Octiv Auto Frac. And so the result is that the frac fleet is programmed to deliver, what is designed and because of the ability to control the horsepower, it can deliver what is designed. And so I think that is something that's never been done before in terms of having the confidence that precisely what is designed is in fact what is delivered. And then Sensori, in effect is the ability to verify where the sand is going at its core. And again, that's an answer product we've never had in hydraulic fracturing since its inception. As where did the sand go? I think of it not too different from an MWD log-in some ways. You wouldn't drill a well without an MWD log of where the well -- where the bit went, where the wellbore is. And quite frankly, why would you not want to know and how is that not part of the solution? Where did the sand go since that's the only really active ingredient in creating production. And so I think we have -- together you've created sort of the design, the delivery, the control and the verification around where did the sand go in the wellbore. And because of that, now when you can change design, that the change design actually got delivered as well. I think this is something we've never been able to know or control in the Frac business before. I hope that's helpful. Arun Jayaram : Yeah. And just maybe the commercial model on how you're pricing this kind of service? Jeff Miller : Yeah. It's priced for sure. I'm not going to get into the details here, but it's -- yes, it's a -- look, it's a valuable solution. It is, yes, standalone separate from the Frac service delivery and that's really all I'm going to say about that. Arun Jayaram : Fair enough. Jeff, my follow-up, I was wondering if you could give us some thoughts on what you're seeing offshore. I believe about 50% of your international business is tied to offshore markets. Obviously, some white space concerns in second half of the year. But any thoughts on how offshore revenues could trend industry wide in 2025 and how is -- how revenue would fare offshore in 2025? Jeff Miller : Yeah. Look, I will have a -- we have a strong business offshore as you described, and I think that from our perspective, we don't see white space. What we see are rigs that move from market-to-market, which is not too unusual. We see quite a few FIDs sort of in the hopper as we get into, well, early '25 and then even activity beginning even more so later in '25 into '26 and '27. So, solid pipeline of growth internationally. And part of that international growth that we see obviously will be tied to offshore. And so, look, I think we'll fare well. I think that's going to be an important component of our international growth, save Mexico. And so I wouldn't over worry about the white space because that sort of occurs all the time I think. Arun Jayaram : All right. Thanks a lot, Jeff. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with Benchmark. You may proceed. Kurt Hallead : Hey. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for the time here this morning. Got a question related to some of the dynamics at play. With respect to the opportunity related to the power generation sale of power in the Permian Basin, cut to the chase, right. You had one of your smaller competitors basically go out and buy some megawatts to sell power in the Permian. Is that something that's on your radar screen, Jeff? And if not specifically on your radar screen, how do you think that plays out and is there an opportunity for Halliburton to participate? Jeff Miller : Yeah. Certainly, it's on my radar screen and we are in that business today, with VoltaGrid and we have a front row seat. And so the exposure to that market through our participation investment in VoltaGrid is solid and we like the business a lot and fortunately, through VoltaGrid and sort of what we do, we are getting a view of this with what I would describe as a real player in that market, which is VoltaGrid. And so look, that's -- stay tuned, but that's an area that is attractive to us and very consistent with our core competencies at Halliburton. And we think we're aligned with and invested in far and away the largest player in that business today. Kurt Hallead : Okay. That's great. Appreciate that color. Now the follow-up as well, you referenced that you see an opportunity for Halliburton to generate an incremental, would you say, $2.5 billion to maybe $3 billion of revenue over the next couple of years predicated on three specific areas of focus. Can you just give us a sense as to, is that going to be with new products and technologies already in place? And then, with the adaptation or adoption of that, or is it going to be continued incremental evolution of those technologies over time or some combination of both? Just looking for a little bit of incremental color on how you see that evolving? Jeff Miller : Yeah. Fair enough. And I see that as a continued drumbeat of technology development and introduction along with we do bolt-on type M&A and we're doing that all of the time, but more targeted at these areas to create technology and integration of technology that I believe will be unique and continue to be unique in these spaces. And so it's -- we've talked about a few of them, we'll continue to talk about technology deliveries in this space. And we've been working at sort of the technology development for a few years. And so, I think we're set up with sort of waves of technology over the next two to three years that will give us better opportunity to outgrow the market. They are businesses that we are in today, but I think we have a -- we're positioned both technically and from a value proposition standpoint to deliver outsized growth. Kurt Hallead : Great. Always appreciate the color, Jeff. Thank you. Jeff Miller : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Becker with Capital One. You may proceed. Douglas Becker : Thank you. The first quarter revenue declined a little bit sharper than we've seen recently. Just want to get a little more color on which regions you see driving that decline. Granted, some of those are obvious and just how you see the revenue progression the rest of the year? It sounds like it will be a more gradual recovery over the course of the year rather than a sharp 2Q bump. Jeff Miller : Yeah, Doug. So the main drivers behind the reduction in revenue for Q1, I'll take it by division. It's probably clear if you look at it that way from a trend perspective. On the C&P side, it's primarily the roll-off of very strong completion tool sales, excuse me, in Q4, that's partially offset by pickup of activity in North America and then you have some seasonal mix around the world. So that's on the C&P side. On the D&E side, the biggest impact is coming from Mexico, which we discussed earlier. And then we had a particularly strong Q4 in D&E on the back of direct sales items of products. Some of it was in the Middle East, but in other regions as well. So these are the main drivers behind the revenue change Q1 over Q4. Douglas Becker : Thank you. And maybe another one for you, Eric. Just wanted to get a little more color on the D&E operating margin outlook. Last year up just a hair, had very strong margin improvement in 2023. You've had some product introductions that seem to be getting good traction. Is it reasonable to expect some margin improvement this year in the D&E segment versus last year? Eric Carre : Yeah. I mean the -- I think the way we're looking at the D&E margins for the year is basically fairly flat. So think about D&E margins in 2025 as being in the relative same zip code as we had in 2024 overall. That's how we're looking at it now. Douglas Becker : That makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. You may proceed. Stephen Gengaro : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Two from me. The one, and I know Kurt brought up the power generation question, but I had a question around the cost of power to the frac fleets. And I know your alignment with VoltaGrid, but is there any concern around the power gen being pulled out-of-the oil patch in any large ways and then increasing kind of the underlying price for power-to-power e-fleets and how that kind of impacts the business? Jeff Miller : Well, we've consciously stayed away from owning that power for our own fleets, partly because we do believe that's an arm\u2019s length transaction that may or may not fluctuate, but I think that operators will own that part of the business in terms of the contracting from an availability standpoint, we're in a very good place with our current contracting and relationship with VoltaGrid. So I feel quite confident in the availability of power to us through that mechanism. And so, no, I'm not particularly concerned about the power availability nor really the price of power. I think that the power is valuable and I think that the value created by the entire package is outsized. So as a result, I think we're in a good place strategically how we've gone about power as Halliburton. And I think from a market standpoint, if there is tightness in power, I think we will be protected from that based on really decisions we made early on about how we would align around power. Stephen Gengaro : Great. Thanks. And my follow-up, we've heard from the folks over at Kimberlite Research that the sort of preference for Frac fleets going forward is skewed towards dual fuel over electric with kind of this maybe, 20%, 25% of the respondents sort of talking about electric as sort of the go-to, which is sort of different than your mix. And I'm curious what you're hearing from customers and this is probably related to sort of your customer mix versus others. But I'm curious what you're seeing from customers as far as preference for dual fuel versus electric and how that kind of aligns with your mix of assets? Jeff Miller : Look, we have continued deliveries for 2025. We have deliveries. I suspect we'll be planning deliveries for 2026 and we're extending the fleets that we have. So -- and so I am quite confident in sort of the demand set for our solution and it's really the platform as much as obviously the substitution is important for dual fuel fleet from a cost perspective and then the increased value creation that we see with Auto Frac and Sensori, they really are becoming more and more important. Stephen Gengaro : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the call-back over to Jeff Miller for any closing remarks. Jeff Miller : Yeah. Thank you, Josh. As we close the call today, let me wrap up with this. I'm excited about both the year ahead and the long-term for Halliburton. We expect to execute our value proposition, deepen our leading and differentiated technology portfolio and deliver incremental revenue through our growth engines. I'm committed to prioritizing cash flow and I expect all of this results in a return of at least $1.6 billion of cash in 2025. Look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
