My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache Corporation First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Brady Parish, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead. Castlen Kennedy : Thank you, Jennifer. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us for Apache Corporation\u2019s first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. On today\u2019s call, we will have three speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. I will start by giving a brief summary of results and then we will hear from Steve Farris, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; followed by Alfonso Leon, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, joining us for the question-and-answer session are John Christmann, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of North America; and Tom Voytovich, Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer of International. We prepared our quarterly financial supplemental data package for your use, which also includes the reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss, such as adjusted earnings, or cash flow from operations. In addition, we have prepared an operations supplement which summarizes our activities and includes detailed well highlights across the various Apache operating regions. These can both be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com/financialinfo. Today\u2019s discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our website. This morning we reported first quarter 2014 earnings from continuing operations of $753 million or $1.90 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings, which excludes certain items that impact the comparability of results totaled $707 million or $1.78 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital totaled $2.2 billion during the quarter. During the first quarter, total reported net production averaged approximately 640,000 boe per day with liquids production constituting 58% of the total. Production during the first quarter was impacted by the sale of our operations in Argentina which closed March flow and were shown as discontinued operations on the income statement. Including discontinued operations from Argentina, our total production for the quarter was 672,000 boe per day. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Steve. Steve Farris : Good afternoon everyone and thank all of you for joining this afternoon. As you know, Apache has taken some significant steps to rebalance our portfolio and to focus our strategy on predictable production growth among North American onshore assets which are fuelled by our substantial cash flow that we generate from our international operation. As we reshape our portfolio for the last four years, we\u2019ve now shifted our focus to execution which has been a long core strength of Apache for a number of years. As Castlen pointed out, today we announced strong first quarter results generating $707 million of adjusted earnings, and $2.2 billion of cash flow from operation before changes in working capital. During the quarter, as Castlen pointed out, we experienced weather impacts in the North Sea as well as our central region where weather not only impacted our production but it also impacted our delay in our drilling schedule. Despite these significant disruptions, our first quarter production numbers were ahead of our internal plan. We remain on track to deliver within our previously stated production guidance for the year at 15% to 18% North American onshore liquids growth, and 5% to 8% global boe growth on our pro forma 2013 production of 537,000 barrels per day. During the quarter, our operational focus in our [indiscernible] acreage position across the number of hydrocarbon rich basins, allowed us to drive production growth in North American onshore liquids where we averaged 198,484 barrels per day which is up 6% or 11,600 barrels per day over the fourth quarter. North America onshore liquids represented 53% of our total worldwide liquids and 31% of our total overall production. You can read a number of details in our operational performance and the quarterly operations supplement. I am going to go over a few of the highlights. In the Permian, we got off to a strong start to the year, with production increasing nearly 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day or 12% quarter over quarter. This growth was a result of our continued strong performance relative to our tight curve and the ability to move some of our well forward. We continued to have exceptional results on the Wolfcamp where we drilled an additional $43 horizontal wells during the quarter and further delineating our potential in the southern Midland basin where we averaged 7 rigs .We also saw significant results in our Bone Springs play in the Delaware basin. In our Gulf Coast region we saw some very encouraging results from our Eagle Ford acreage. Earlier this year at our investor day we outlined our 400,000 gross acreage position in the northern part of this play. We\u2019re continuing to progress on stranding [ph] of the area despite nine additional wells during the quarter, our most recently completed well was McCullough-Wineman in Brazos county which 30- day IP averaged 1,455 barrels of oil equivalent a day well above our initial type curve. Based on this recent well result, and our overall understanding of the play, we plan to increase our rig count from four currently to eight by midyear. In the division we\u2019re driving costs down in the play and are currently working to reconfigure our wells to further enhance our returns. In Canada, quarter-over-quarter we grew liquids production by 10%. We experienced strong growing results in our new liquids rich area of the Duvernay and Montney. We have 3D wells with encouraging results but we don\u2019t plan to disclose further details at this time. Earlier this week we disclosed two recent field discoveries in Egypt, including a well in Matruh basin and Khalda Offset Concession which encountered pay in five separate formations and tested at combined rate of 49 million a day and 7,700 barrels of condensates per day. As you know we rigorously review our opportunity set and allocation of capital on a quarterly basis. Based on the strong results we\u2019ve seen in the Permian so far and the Eagle Ford and our Gulf Coast regions we are evaluating the programs with an eye towards reallocating capital for those regions. Looking ahead to production for the rest of the year, we anticipate strong second half growth as projects come on line in Australia and North Sea, a bit recovery from a very difficult winter. Let\u2019s turn now from operations to our continuing efforts to fine tune our overall portfolio. During the quarter we announced several additional divestments, in March we closed our previously announced sale of our operations in Argentina. In addition we announced the sale of non-core assets in Canada from Noel, Wapiti, and Ojay which did close on April 30. I am sure you saw this morning we announced the sale of our deepwater projects Lucius and Heidelberg and 11 primary term exploration blocks to Freeport-McMoRan for $1.4 million. We have retained all current production in deepwater as well as the 147 deepwater primary blocks. Based on the operator\u2019s current timeline for the estimated production contribution for Lucius, we\u2019re foregoing about 0.4% or approximately 2000 barrels of oil per day at gross for the year \u2013 both of this transaction. As I previously mentioned we remain confident in achieving our 2014 growth guidance. I also want to provide an update on the progress related to our two LNG projects Wheatstone and Kitimat. We are in advanced discussions and on track to decide on the most appropriate financing options in the near future and at Kitimat we have been working with our partner to reduce our 2014 capital spend given where we are in the project lifetime. Currently we anticipate reducing the budget by approximately 40% to around $600 million net as you recall that\u2019s down from an initial budget net (indiscernible). Also at Kitimat, we are currently in discussion with several interested parties as we look to right size the overall investment in this project. This is an ongoing process and one that we are focused on getting done in this calendar year. Finally I want to provide an update on our buyback program. Utilizing proceeds primarily from divestments during the quarter as we bought back an additional $485 million of stock, this brings our total, since the launch of the buyback program to the end of the first quarter to nearly $1.5 billion or 17 million shares. As a reminder our board authorized 30 million shares buyback program in early 2013 and we\u2019re continuing to believe that Apache shares are a compelling investment at this price. But on the first quarter conference call last year that we initially outlined our plans to redefine our global portfolio and bring greater focus to our expanded North American onshore asset base. We\u2019ve made significant progress over this past year. We emerged a leaner, a more North American onshore physical company. We believe our current portfolio gives Apache a tremendous foundation with sustained, predictable, repeatable and profitable growth for the foreseeable future. I would like to turn it over to Alfonso Leon. Alfonso Leon : Thanks, Steve. I am going to cover three areas today. Our balance sheet, reporting matters and earnings performance. As Steve indicated we continue to take important steps in pushing our portfolio for profitable growth. Within the first four months of the year we announced and completed the sale of our entire operation in Argentina and certain dry gas properties in Canada. Today\u2019s announcement of the monetization of our development stage projects at Lucius and Heidelberg represents yet another step forward in focusing us in our growth area while crystallizing value for shareholders. We continue to actively repurchase Apache\u2019s common shares. During the first quarter we bought back $485 million in stock bringing our total re-purchase in initiating our $2 billion buyback program last year to $1.5 billion through the end of the first quarter. We continue to view our shares as one of the most attractive options to capture cash flow, reserve value and portfolio debt. We recently allocated an additional $300 million of cash availability through incremental buybacks and now has a further near term optionality on this front with funds from Lucius and Heidelberg transactions. Of course, our balance sheet remains very strong and supports our deep opportunities for organic value growth. We ended the first quarter with $1.6 billion of cash and debt unchanged at $9.7 billion which puts us at 22% debt to cap. We have approximately $1.8 billion in new proceeds from our Canada and deepwater transactions coming our way now and we expect our E&P capital expenditure to be within our cash flow for the year. So our financial position is really very strong. Now, there are two balance sheet items in front of us. First is managing our interest in two integrated LNG projects for maximum shareholder value growth. Steve discussed this briefly but given the importance of this issue I want to touch on them as well. We have identified competitive alternatives to finance our remaining investment in Wheatstone LNG outside of our cash flow and expect to announce our decision over the next few months. In regard to Kitimat LNG, since our analyst day in February we have been working with our partner to reduce the proposed investment in 2014 by 40% to $600 million net to Apache. In addition we are in discussions with other potential partners to right size Apache\u2019s percentage interest in the project. Kitimat is one of the most strategic projects underway in the global energy industry. It will open Canada\u2019s gas exports to Asia. Kitimat has real pipeline solution in place, is backed by an unprecedented 100 TCFs of supply in the highest quality gas shale in Bakken in North America and can be delivered from the Art Well Pass [ph] producing up to 1 TCF each with minimal environmental impact. It\u2019s a good project. What we must do is right size Apache\u2019s participation and states the investment to build long term value while supporting our competitive per share performance today. The second balance sheet item to keep in mind is that most of our current cash is overseas and cannot come back to United States without tax consequences. This is the common issue for global corporations like Apace and yet one more reason why our monetization step announced today with Lucius and Heidelberg is important. This is U.S cash for Apache. Moving to financial reporting. In our first quarter earnings, our former business in Argentina is reported as discontinued operations under accounting rules for current and historical period. This is the only component of our nearly $10 billion of recent portfolio focusing steps that you will see reflected as discontinued operation and that is strictly a function of GAAP rule. [indiscernible] is based on continuing operation on the total I stated. A financial supplement posted on our website provides additional details regarding Argentina operation. I am now going to turn to results. Our performance for the quarter was driven by strong production and price realization and resulted in reported earnings from continuing operations of $753 million or $1.90 per share. Our results included a couple of non-cash items, including an unrealized after tax gain on our derivatives of $49 million and some deferred tax impact. When we remove these non-cash items for comparability purposes, our adjusted earnings were $707 million from continuing operations or $1.78 per share, up from $610 million or $1.52 in the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow was strong driven by the performance of our North American onshore base, we generated $2.2 billion of cash flow from operations before working capital items, up from $2 billion in the fourth quarter. Now I would like to provide a bit of line by line color on our financial expectations through the end of the year. Let me start with production. In February, we outlined 2013 performance production of 537,000 barrels equivalent per day. These represent before a gas production for 2013 minus all the divested properties, the each of non-controlling interest in Egypt tax barrels [ph]. This 2013 number provides the baseline for comparability. As outlined in detail in Page 4 of our operations supplement, the equivalent underlying production in the first quarter of 2014 was 548,000 barrels equivalent per day. We performed ahead of our expectations through the first quarter and remain on track to achieve our guidance for the year and in spite of the loss of production growth from Lucius and the weather impact in our central and northeast regions in the first quarter. Turning to realization, oil realizations averaged approximately $101 per barrel for the first quarter. Based on the current market outlook for differentials, we see our first quarter North American realization discount to WTI of $4.60 widening in the second quarter by approximately $2 or $3 and then falling back to first quarter levels by the end of the year. We see international oil and North America gas realizations at about the first quarter discount to benchmarks for remainder of the year. On NGLs, we currently expect to realize about 30% of WTI through 2014. Going to the expense side, LOE per boe was up a bit quarter over quarter to $10.37. We expect this for boe cost to increase 10% driven by general increases in labor and power costs and our divestments of dry gas properties for the rest of the year. DD&A per boe is expected to rise by as much as $2 by the end of the year driven by our capital focus in liquids projects, although this is subject to significant variability spending on timing of reserve bookings. We broadly see other per unit cost metrics relatively stable through the rest of the year from the first quarter levels. On income taxes, our first quarter effective tax rate was 40.4%. Going forward we expect our effective tax rate for the rest of the year to be in the range of 40% to 44%. Our deferred tax percentage in the first quarter was 28% in line with what we would expect for the remainder of 2014 absent nonrecurring items. Finally, through the end of the first quarter, our E&P capital is on track with our planning for the year. Overall and despite significant weather events it was a very strong quarter for Apache and we reported strong production results, earnings and cash flow. This concludes our prepared remarks. And I think we are now ready for any questions. Operator :  (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Co. Pearce Hammond \u2013 Simmons & Co.: Regarding capital allocation within the portfolio, does it make sense to dial back activity a little bit in the central region and redirect those dollars to higher rate of return plays like the Permian or Canada et cetera? I'm not sure if you were kind of touching on that a little bit in your prepared remarks at all, Steve. Steve Farris : Yes, we haven\u2019t made a final decision but I would suspect with the results that we\u2019ve gotten out of the Eagle Ford, and some of the really better results in our type curve in the Permian basin, you could see us allocate capital a little differently than we did going into the year. Pearce Hammond \u2013 Simmons & Co.: And would that the a decision that's more made at midyear? Steve Farris : Probably a decision will be made in the next couple of weeks, I would say. Pearce Hammond \u2013 Simmons & Co.: And then my follow-up is, given your tremendous success in growing volumes in the Permian, are you getting close to reaching a max operational limit for Apache and the region as it pertains to people, rig availability, procuring need of services, et cetera? Steve Farris : With respect to services and rigs, we\u2019re in very good shape, frankly. One good thing about having [indiscernible] rigs running that we have is we can\u2019t get rigs and frac those. Certainly I made this analogy before, it\u2019s a little bit like when you have a four month for 16 [ph], and you can add one more \u2013 it\u2019s 16, you\u2019ve got to add another 4. We can go up some, but we are not going to be able to go up some the way we\u2019re going at from 2011 to 2012 and from 2012 to 2013. But we have made [ph] in that account. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James. John Freeman \u2013 Raymond James : Alfonso, just following up on what you said about Wheatstone where you're looking at these competitive financing alternatives. I mean can you just kind of give us some ideas of what those alternatives are? Alfonso Leon : We need to get some decisions going our side but the basic principle is this is not going to come out of our cash flow, this is not going to come out of our existing assets. Where this is a project that is contracted and a project that can finance itself, so that we don\u2019t have to make any incremental investment in this project. And it can also be something that we\u2019re obviously looking Q4 value, we\u2019re going to do whatever adds in those value for our shareholders \u2013 John Freeman \u2013 Raymond James : And then other question, shifting gears on the central region when you discussed that the weather not only impacted your production, but also the drilling and completion schedule. Just for context, you drilled 44 net wells during the quarter. How many did you originally budget that you were going to drill and complete in the central region? Steve Farris : John Christmann who runs our North American company you got -- John Christmann : Yes, we had originally planned and kind of outlined at the February analyst day 418 plus which is about 100 wells a quarter. So it\u2019s a significant reduction in terms of what we were able to get on. Steve Farris : That is really a result of jut the backup testing when you have \u2013 we had two different weather at those and it really weathers the production as much as being able to get wells down and frac and volume production. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Charles Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice : I wanted to ask the other press release -- the other news that you guys have been talking about today is the sell or the sale rather of Lucius and Heidelberg. And I wondered if you can -- you made reference in that press release that you're continuing to pursue the sale of other prospects I believe was the word. So I wondered if you could just give a bit of the narrative back story on how the sale came about. Whether it was someone who came and knocked on your door, whether you guys had the for sale sign on those for a while given the mark that Anadarko put on them? Steve Farris : Well if you recall back in the beginning of 2013 even our yearend earnings call, we started unveiling what really had been planned for sometime but unveiling our goal to rebalance our North American portfolio make it a bigger chunk of it and we identified a number of assets internally that we were going to be on that risk, actually the deepwater was on that list at that time. The one thing I would tell you is that we made the conscious decision we would not sell any properties that we didn\u2019t think that we got a fair value for. So that probably answers that question. It hasn\u2019t been actively marketed but it has been in the market for sometime. Charles Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice : That does. And I wonder if I could turn to the Permian here. When I look at your operations report and I see that you look like you've had some of the best results you guys have had in the Wolfcamp. In northern Reagan and in Upton County I know that's a little bit different from where the bulk of your area -- bulk of your activity was in 2013. So maybe this is best for John, is that a fair read on the quarterly results out in the Permian? And what's got you excited now? John Christmann : I mean I think we continue to see improvement on all our wells, driven by completions, the things we are doing but we did run six rigs in the Mariam county, we may not track there, and continue to have outstanding results there. We have added 5 horizontal rigs that we started adding late last year and kind of started to hit our strides in most other counties, Midland, Upton and Reagan, so we\u2019ve got 5 rigs running there, two verticals, you will start to see some of those kick in. The thing about Wolfcamp is you\u2019ve got multiple beaches and we\u2019re still early in understanding exactly how many wells we can drill per section, how many laterals and that sort of thing. So I am excited about all of it \u2013 our whole portfolio in the Permian is we\u2019re having great results not just in Wolfcamp. So it\u2019s not about the whole but \u2013 Steve Farris : I might add, when John mentioned the number of wells per section, that number is not going to go down, that number is going to go up because we have identified that we may be able to downspace more than we are currently and we may have more batch of horizontals being able to go out, so the reverse per section certainly in that Wolfcamp area is not just in Barnett, but all through that play, we could see significant upwards. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Roe with PPH. Michael Roe \u2013 PPH: I was just wondering you mentioned earlier in your prepared comments that you're seeing on the LOE side a 10% increase in general increase in labor and power costs, for the rest of the year. Just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color around that please? Alfonso Leon : If you look across the industry and even if you look at the variance on our first quarter versus fourth quarter LOE per boe, those are the driving factors in terms of forward experience with the level of activity out there. Those are the two biggest drivers of our variance on a going forward basis within this year. Michael Roe \u2013 PPH: And then I guess just my follow-up question would be it sounds like you're planning on using the cash from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico sale for additional share buybacks. I'm just wondering is there anything else you were contemplating for that or just how you're thinking about allocating that cash flow infusion. Thank you. Alfonso Leon : We are going to a board meeting next week and that\u2019s the discussion that we still need to have internally. Just announced the transaction today, so we have to go through that. But we are very conscious obviously the value of opportunities that we are crystallizing right now through our buybacks in front of us. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of John Malone with Mizuho Securities. John Malone \u2013 Mizuho Securities : Just looking at Kitimat. Clearly it's been a drawn out process getting a partner. You've seen some potential partners go with competing projects. Is there anything you can say Steve about any differences in perception that you might have of potential partners, since it's late and just a longer process? Maybe on pricing or cost or environmental question in BC and can you talk just a little bit about the landscape in Asia LNG in general? Alfonso Leon : In terms of our partner strategy, we brought Chevron into the project just last year and that was in \u201913. We have been pursuing a very deliberate one step at the time of pros that brings value to this project \u2013 bringing Chevron in last year in 2013 was the very value added for us, it\u2019s a downstream operator to complement our upstream expertise at Apache. At this point as this project gathers further momentum, we have decided it is the right time to bring in additional partner into our group, if anything the momentum of the project had accelerated beyond our expectations, the pipeline is in very good stage, the facility is in a very good stage and Chevron is very keen and start to head with this project. So it\u2019s just the right time for Apache now to bring in another partner as we think about how much we had, and what project within our portfolio to maintain our balance. John Malone \u2013 Mizuho Securities : And just Alfonso, just one analogy as well some housekeeping. You haven't spent anything from a general cash flow in Wheatstone to date? Is that correct? Alfonso Leon : We have incurred capital expenditure year to date in the Wheatstone project. We have not affected our financing decision as it fits very welded and up until the date, within this year and which we implement that in anything transaction, we will be funding that capital expenditure either by all means. John Malone \u2013 Mizuho Securities : And one last one for me just on the North Sea, can you give me a sense of what you think the run rate could be there, net of any weather affects? I know you've got new wells coming on in hopefully the 40s in barrel how will that compare to or offset the natural declines? John Christmann : Well, as you are well aware, our strategy going into the year was that we were going to have growth regions and cash flow, so we measured the investment in the North Sea essentially deep flat. So we expect to meet that end of the year, I think that catch up from the weather event in the first quarter was already underway, and I would look for you to see that the production rate stabilized, where it was probably about in the fourth quarter. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram of Credit Suisse. Arun Jayaram \u2013 Credit Suisse : John, maybe starting with you. I was wanting to see if you could comment on how some of your initial well results have been doing on the horizontal side and the Delaware Basin? John Christmann : We\u2019ve got 3 rigs running over that whole area, and we have been very pleased, I mean we are predominantly growing in Bone Springs, and in Wolfcamp. And I think there is a couple volumes to be listed in the ops report and we are very pleased over there. We do have some acreage to the south that we are evaluating, and later in the year we will be looking at some of those areas but if I am looking the page 1, 1H and number 02H, both net, they\u2019re still playing on the 30 day IP, they came out over a thousand boe per day. And over 12 rigs and high pressures. Arun Jayaram \u2013 Credit Suisse : John, if you're going to put some incremental capital as it stands today, would you be looking more on the Midland side or the Delaware side? John Christmann : Right now we are probably running two-thirds of rigs running in Midland, that\u2019s the easiest place to add, and that\u2019s driven based on just where we can put in immediately. I think the economics are very comparable in both basin though \u2013 as the year unfolds, mostly it\u2019s getting more active in the Delaware. Arun Jayaram \u2013 Credit Suisse : My second question is, Steve, you reiterated your North American onshore liquids guidance. Obviously the Permian is ahead of plan as we stand today. Do you expect the central region to be able to make up some of the weather induced downtime they had in the first quarter? Steve Farris : I think it will make it up, some of it, I also think that we have opportunity set for day in the Eagle Ford and starting off the year based on what we have learned over the \u2013 really the last four months, we have an opportunity to ramp that up. I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re going to go to from four rigs to by the middle of the year to 8 rigs there \u2013 plenty of upside [ph] on that to be able to do that. Arun Jayaram \u2013 Credit Suisse : And my final question is for Alfonso. The CapEx number in the quarter came in a little bit of above, at least what I was modeling. Just wanted to see if you could give us a sense of -- your full-year CapEx at the analyst day for your E&P was I believe a $8.5 billion, how you're trending relative to that target. Alfonso Leon : We\u2019re exactly on plan, it\u2019s actually slightly under in some regions but all in all on plan for that target. When you look at the table in our supplemental financial disclosures I think there might be a bit confusion out there, when people are looking at those numbers and thinking about the 8.5, the numbers on that table include LNG CapEx within the relevant countries, that\u2019s something that we are going to look at for us coming quarters except \u2013 to provide better clarity so the people can actually see how we find those to the 8.5. You also have Argentina in there and you also have to keep in mind that, that table includes Egypt on a 100% basis, so it does now have our two-third interest economics interest in Egypt [indiscernible] in the 8.5. So we\u2019re going to work to make that a little bit clear for the next quarter but we are on plan with our CapEx. Steve Farris : I want to reiterate what Alfonso said, you have a 100% capital \u2013 in that line you have 100% capital for Egypt, and our equity interest is two thirds. So it takes a little work to get to the net numbers. So overall -- Operator : And your next question is from the line of Eric Otto with CLSA Americas. Eric Otto \u2013 CLSA Americas : Just a follow-up on Kitimat. Can you give us an update or color on discussions with customers? And related to that does your partner still require oil link pricing for them to move forward with FID? Steve Farris : I think starting with customers, the one thing I would say is that it\u2019s a very active marketing group right now. We are \u2013 we have had discussions with most everyone you would expect that you would market LNG to and those discussions we are ongoing. With respect to oil price, I think as a group, has been our partner, pretty good realization that it really doesn\u2019t matter how you make up that basket but you really have to bear \u2013 at a price at the end of the pipe that will make up an economic project with the project, and I think we are both on the same page there. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Societe Generale. John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale : Kitimat, is it easier having FID to seek partners or does it matter at all in terms of bringing someone in? Steve Farris : John, I don\u2019t \u2013 I think Alfonso put a pretty good focus on \u2013 we are moving the project forward and we have a lot of momentum right now, I think that\u2019s being hopefully recognized on the market side and in terms of FID, we would expect \u2013 we still have \u2013 final to do on the downstream, on the upstream it\u2019s not just about \u2013 all about just drilling wells, we got an awful of facilities with takeaways planned success \u2013 we are in pipelines that we have put in there. So we are involved in that FID right now, that FID should be done \u2013 upstream should be done by the middle of 2015 and likewise in terms of where Chevron is on the other side. But they are not contingent on each other let me put it that way. John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale : One for John Christmann. We're hearing a lot more about changing well designs and multiple launch for unconventional plays. Also the use of more ceramics. Are you changing your well completions designs at all in the Permian? John Christmann : We showed a slide at analyst day that showed early results relative to the new changes we have made. I think as we get in and drill more of these wells, and better understand the source that we are dealing in, and the spacing and the \u2013 we are getting better and you are seeing more sands, more stages, more zones, and finding ways to place it properly. So it\u2019s a combination of a lot of things. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy. Michael Hall \u2013 Heikkinen Energy : I'm just curious on the good result you've been seeing there in the Eagle Ford, what are the hydrocarbon mix splits on those wells? And do you think you're stimulating the chalk at all with those? And what are the cost running on them? Steve Farris : With respect to the mix, that well I mentioned made about 730 barrels for condensate for the rest of the year. So it\u2019s about 60 :40 liquids to gas. With respect to cost, I don\u2019t know \u2013 well costs, -- we\u2019ve just redesigned our Eagle Ford wells, we think we can take about $1.2 million off the well design that we\u2019ve got right now. I am hopeful we can take more than that out of it. As you go into pad drilling and you go into manufacturing mode, you can really bring your cost down, we have shown that at Bernhard [ph] area, we\u2019ve seen that honestly \u2013 we start off drilling wells $16 million and today they are under 7. So we expect those costs to come down significantly. Michael Hall \u2013 Heikkinen Energy : And then you highlighted in the commentary or on the balance sheet all the cash that's sitting in the international arena. Any plans to do -- what are your plans to do with that cash I guess? And how should we think about that? Alfonso Leon : As we go through the next few months in terms of getting to the way forward in our LNG projects, we have to get \u2013 good decisions where it did not represent any type of cost, in our cash flow and we have \u2013 lot of exposure to Kitimat. Once we have complete clarity [indiscernible] it is our objective to have over the next few months and we have some more at that, clearly at this very moment, we cannot bring that international cash to the United States without tax consequences. But that is something that we will have to continually looking at and figure out what we do about it. We do generate NOLs in the United States as we go along as that can give us path \u2013 as we find our way to bring that cash back. Michael Hall \u2013 Heikkinen Energy : And one more if I could sneak it in on -- just total capital cost, just kind of the outlook you're seeing, particularly in the Permian, as you rollover contracts for the end of the year and into 2015. Any commentary around any cost increases you're seeing on drilling or pumping? John Christmann : No, we just recently refrac tender and actually had a pumping services come down amazingly. So we see things pretty well, I mean there is pressure on the bigger rigs, 1500 horsepower rigs with top drives, there is more demand, for those will be just up a little bit, I think the big deal is with the efficiencies, the things we have been able to do, we have been able to maintain or lower our oil costs. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. Jeffrey Campbell \u2013 Tuohy Brothers : The first question I wanted to ask you was as I survey the Permian, the industry is moving towards stacked lateral moment on TAD. And when we see Apache horizontal success with the less than households name zones, Penn Shale [ph], Wichita, Albany, Strawn do those zones or that acreage have multi zone horizontal stag development potential? John Christmann : That just varies, I think what they show you is the diversity of our asset base. So we got acreage in place, so not everybody is, and so we\u2019ve got \u2013 and that\u2019s the nice thing about our portfolio. While there are some areas in there where you could put multiple laterals, if you get over to the edge though in the Heady count, but some of those are really low zone targets but the nice thing about the Permian is that you got other stack zones that are \u2013 the strata that work as well. So that you are seeing horizontal drilling really grape hold in the central platform, the wells in Delaware and Midland basins. Jeffrey Campbell \u2013 Tuohy Brothers : Going back to the Eagle Ford McCullough-Wineman well. Is that going to get more drilling near the Brazos-Burleson border or maybe push more into Burleson County? At the investment day, it looked like most of the drilling was taking place to the West. And I guess overall I'm asking what do you think is the direction of Eagle Ford delineation over the next several quarters? John Christmann : I think McCullough-Wineman well, that is running very high on, it\u2019s built in some things up and you will see us get very active in that area, Steve mentioned with Heady rigs, towards mid-year, as far as direction of where it goes, that\u2019s not something we comment on at this point. We are excited about it on our acreage. Jeffrey Campbell \u2013 Tuohy Brothers : And if I could sneak one quick one in on the use of cash. If the Montney and the Duvernay continue to create some excitement over time, could those programs become home for some of the international cash later on? Steve Farris : We didn\u2019t announce our results but I would say they were \u2013 we drilled two Montney wells now, we drilled two Duvernay wells, both of them are stellar walls. And we have quite a bit of acreage both in Montney and the Duvernay. We are drilling up right now to look at \u2013 when we talk about capital allocation because we are in the sober [ph] month in Canada, we will have a plan going in for our winter drilling starting at about August September that will probably look a little stronger in the Duvernay and Montney. Operator : And your next question is from the line of James Sullivan with Alembic. James Sullivan \u2013 Alembic: Just wanted to go back to the East Eagle Ford for a second. And you guys talked about the McCullough-Wineman well was a nice result. But I think you had a couple of wells drilling in the Reveille -- at least next to where you had the well -- the older well that you guys had talked about the 8, 9, and 10. Did you guys have results on that yet? Steve Farris : We do not at this point, we [indiscernible] well there and so we are stacking some things up, that will be completed in the near future. James Sullivan \u2013 Alembic: And then could you -- obviously you guys are sounding pretty high on the play based on the McCullough-Wineman results and that was over on the other side of the county there. But can you talk just a little bit about the geology there? I mean obviously you've discussed the launch at the analyst day, but I mean is it -- are you guys feeling it's quite repeatable across the acreage in terms of how continuous the section is and all that? Steve Farris : It\u2019s very practical as you go across, I think the thing we have seen in the area is the QRs go up little bit which is helping you, so little higher gas rate with it, which is a good thing. So we\u2019re very encouraged \u2013 got more energy in the system \u2013 James Sullivan \u2013 Alembic: If I could just switch over for a second to the Permian. I -- and let's see if I can express this question in a way that makes sense. But obviously you guys have an enormous vertical program that's transitioning over now into horizontal program. So in a sense the ramp in horizontal activity -- it's not coming in, in a vacuum you've got human capacity there for the vertical program and in logistics and so forth. Can you just characterize -- I mean actually you guys went down up by four vertical rigs and up by one in the horizontal. Is that, I know it's a little crude to think of it that way, but is that not a bad sense of scale in terms of how -- what you take from one program to give to the other in terms of capacity? If that makes sense? John Christmann : It\u2019s a good question. That is not how we think about it. I mean we look at the baseline, we really look at how the plays work on an economic basis and we have been shifting as we have been building the horizontals, you will see a little bit of continued trend as we add rigs, there will be likely to be horizontals. I think we\u2019ve got a baseload program out there, really high graded projected with the verticals that we like to keep, I mean the nice thing about the verticals is we get on quick, the competitive rates of return and you don\u2019t have to wait on pads and those things, so you will see us run a baseload of vertical rigs and then continue to grow the horizontal rig count. Steve Farris : When you are setting your base, sort of when you confirm a vertical wells, I don\u2019t decline likely horizontal wells, you kind of match vertical wells and get the base going up. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Leo Mariani with RBC. Leo Mariani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Hey guys. Can you speak a little bit to how much acreage you have in the Permian and Upton and Reagan County's? It looks like you just start getting after that with some strong results there. John Christmann : In terms of the acreage there, I mean we\u2019ve got \u2013 we showed that at the analyst day those 3 counties I think couple hundreds, hundred thousand acreage, I need to check that exact number. Just a second. Leo Mariani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : While you're checking on the, you guys just mention the ability to sort of keep the vertical rig count consistent and add horizontal rigs over time. Could you give us a sense of where you think that number could go to? What is the current horizontal rig count today in the Permian? And I'm sure you guys have a plan over the next couple of years to ramp that up, could you maybe put some numbers around that? John Christmann : Your first question, we got 292,000 acres in those 3 counties and 232,000 net. You got significant Wolfcamp exposure in and \u2013 when we look at our plan for the year, we plan on 39 rigs \u2013 total rigs, we plan on 26 horizontals and 13 verticals, so almost 2 in 1 horizontal and vertical ratio, that\u2019s probably a pretty good ratio for where we are today, right now there is capacity growth \u2013 to put couple in there but as Steve alluded to, it\u2019s about just people and execution. Leo Mariani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : I guess just talking to about asset sales here, I guess obviously you guys just announced the deepwater. I guess I thought it was a bit surprising. On previous calls you said there weren't a lot of big deals left in terms of selling assets. So I guess anything else we should expect on the asset sales side later this year? Steve Farris : Well I tried to answer that earlier, when \u2013 the year end analyst call last year, we talked about portfolio of baskets that we were going to sell and we identified a number of candidates and quite frankly the deepwater was more of those candidates. The other thing we had decided is we went from stalled properties to something less than we thought the value to look for, so that assets it\u2019s been on the list for over a year. We are going to make sure we got what we call we get value for that asset and it\u2019s really \u2013 from our standpoint it wasn\u2019t a surprise, we talked about order of magnitude, we have always indicated that we were moving out the deepwater, we still have about 900,000 barrels, 95,00 barrels today in the deepwater, we continue to reduce that. We are not going to sell it unless we find someone is willing to pay what we think is, and I mean what is worth, but in terms of our, really in the deepwater we will have done that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis with Capital One. Richard Tullis \u2013 Capital One : Steve, in today's press release announcing the sale of the deepwater, it sounds like the Company's planning to get a decent amount more active among the Gulf Coast. Could you give a little more detail there and maybe what activity could look like over the next year or two? John Christmann : Well, as you are ware, a year or so ago, we went into effect the strategy to reposition ourselves in the Gulf of Mexico to become to be able to generate meaningful organic production growth on the shale. Now as the shale of course is when we had interest in about 500 blocks, 125 of those operated and most of which have never experienced any deep exploration. So it\u2019s also where we transition our very experienced technical team out of deepwater with your advanced techniques for deepwater to similar geology on the shale and basically we are focusing on exactly the same horizons on the shale that we have been in deepwater for years. This is something that hasn\u2019t experienced a lot of activity in the past. There is lot of advances to be in over the shelf, there is a lot of room for liquids rich and oil growth, there is a much shorter concept to realization times and when compared to the deepwater, and we can certainly leverage existing infrastructure to cut the time and the cost on this process. So it\u2019s where \u2013 prospects can also better compete with the risk of our pretty robust global portfolio and that\u2019s something that really for the last couple of years the deepwater has been able to do. So in short, we are going to move our technical talent, out of the deepwater and merge that with a much more sensible resources that are available on the shale. You may want to think about this as especially 2014 is a year of inventory builds, and we would expect to come out of the blocks in 2015 with a nice drilling line. I think we will hear our first real prospects and [rig count generated] realized in 2015. Richard Tullis \u2013 Capital One : And just as a follow-up, does your partner Fieldwood have any activity currently along -- that you're involved in along the coast? Well results that we should look for near-term? John Christmann : The only well that \u2013 really is the easing out with 136 which is put out in the first quarter, I think about 6 million a day and a few hundred barrels oil, I mean 300 barrels of oil, other than that, I don\u2019t see any additional activity in the near term. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Doug Leggate with BofA Merrill Lynch. Doug Leggate \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch : Thanks good afternoon guys thanks for taking my questions. Steve in the Gulf of Mexico there the sale of Lucius and Heidelberg, what does that mean for the remaining interest you have in the deepwater in terms of your commitment to that area? In other words could they be for sale at some point? Steve Farris : Let me answer that, I think maybe you didn\u2019t hear me or maybe you can\u2019t hear, I understand, maybe [indiscernible]. We still have about 96,00 barrels a day in the deepwater, it would have been nice to be part of a package that we sell. As I mentioned earlier, we made a decision about a year and a half ago that we weren\u2019t going to sell anything under a value that we thought it was worth. So we are going to continue to operate those, we have 147 deepwater blocks, but you will see us migrate out of the deepwater either through producing that out and then abandoning it or if someone was interested in it, we certainly think it was worth for [ph]. But we have moved, that team \u2013 we moved that team to the shale where we have a significant acreage and I think the real opportunity to have more organic growth there. Doug Leggate \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch : Sorry I wasn't reading between the lines. So I'm guessing you originally had tried to sell that together with Lucius and Heidelberg and decided not to -- is that how we should think about it? Steve Farris : Sorry, I didn\u2019t quite catch up you. Doug Leggate \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch : Sorry, so just reading between the lines, should we assume that you tried to sell the entire package and decided against it -- decided to hang onto those assets? So they were for sale in other words? Steve Farris : You bet. Doug Leggate \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch : Thanks for that. My follow-up is onshore and hopefully it's not too convoluted. But just comparing the operating report to last operating report, there seems to be a fair amount of movement in your acreage positions. And the one that jumps out is the Marmaton. It's dropped from 512,000 to 395,000 net acres. So I'm just wondering what's going on there? Is there active sort of high grading process going on or is this acreage expiry or what's causing the moving parts? And I'll leave it there. Thanks. Steve Farris : I can\u2019t comment. John? John Christmann : We got two rigs in the Marmaton in the first quarter, 26 we have working in the Anadarko basin. Steve Farris : Yeah one other things -- we\u2019re completely, we got an upper Marmaton and we\u2019ve got a lower Marmaton. And I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in that book but it depends on if you are in that lower Marmaton, which is more gassy but it comes on like gangbusters for the upper Marmaton. So we need to reconcile that. I don\u2019t know what those numbers, but I am sure as the total both upper and lower is probably the same number, I think we probably set up a lower Marmaton, we\u2019ve got listed in there which is just subset of the total Marmaton. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Harry Mateer with Barclays. Harry Mateer \u2013 Barclays Capital : Hi guys. Just a question for me on the balance sheet. Can you just give us an update on where you think the debt balance should be? Are you happy with your debt levels now or should we anticipate potential use of proceeds going forward to be further debt reduction? Alfonso Leon : Clearly the strong position we don\u2019t have any immediate need for any debt run up or debt reduction, we are in a very comfortable position and the most important question is what do we do with the cash coming out our way and what do we do once we complete will be pursuing on our LGN projects. Harry Mateer \u2013 Barclays Capital : Okay. It\u2019s fair to say it sounds like investing in the business and potential returns to shareholders are going to take priority over debt reduction at this point? Steve Farris : I think what he said is, we don\u2019t feel we need to pay down any debt. We just need to make sure we will be able to cover the things that we are liable for, and we are going to look at obviously certainly share buybacks at our current pledge or on the table. Operator : And we have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to our presenters. Castlen Kennedy : Great, that concludes our call for today. Once again we want to thank you for joining us and if you have any additional questions, feel free to reach out to investor relations. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call and you may now disconnect.",

Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Sia and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache Corporation Second Quarter Earnings 2014 Conference. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you, at this time I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Castlen Kennedy. Please go ahead ma\u2019am. Castlen Kennedy :  Thank you, Sia. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us for Apache Corporation\u2019s second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. On today\u2019s call, we will have three speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. I will start by giving a brief summary of results and then we will hear from Steve Farris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and President; followed by Alfonso Leon, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, joining us for the question-and-answer session are John Christmann, Executive Vice President and COO of North America; and Tom Voytovich, Executive Vice President and COO of International. We prepared our quarterly financial supplement for your use, which includes the reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss such as adjusted earnings or cash flow from operations. In addition, we have prepared our quarterly operation supplement which summarizes our activities and includes detailed well highlights across the various Apache operating region. These can both be found on our website at apachecorp.com/financialdata. Today\u2019s discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to defer materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. This morning we reported second quarter 2014 earnings from continuing operations of $505 million or $1.31per diluted share. Adjusted earnings which excludes certain items that impact the comparability of results, totaled $644 million or $1.67 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital totaled $2.2 billion during the quarter. Total reported net production averaged 635,814 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with liquids production constituting 59% of the total. On a pro forma basis, adjusting for recent sales and excluding the non-controlling interest and tax barrels from Egypt second quarter production was 550,357 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with liquids production constituting 60% of the total. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Steve. G. Steven Farris :  Thank you, Castlen and good afternoon, everyone and thank you all for joining us. I want to apologize everyone, I\u2019ve got somewhat of a summer cold, so I sound a little \u2013 my sounds a little deeper than it usually does I apologize. Our second quarter results provided I think additional evidence of our strong North America position, and our ability to continue to profitability grow our production. And before I jump into the details of the quarter, I want to provide an update on Apache\u2019s ongoing repositioning of profitable and repeatable North American onshore growth. Over the last five years Apache has greatly enlarged and enhanced its North American onshore resource base and I believe that it is capable of driving our growth and performance over the next several years. During the last 18 months, we\u2019ve been increasing the focus on our North American onshore business, by divesting of around $10 billion of property. In addition, we\u2019ve launched an aggressive stock repurchase program and we\u2019ve also made it clear there are no sacred cows and our efforts continue. There has been recent discussion regard Apache\u2019s potential future steps and focusing our portfolio, and today\u2019s call gives me an opportunity to provide an update to our shareholders on our direction and the work that it\u2019s been underway. First, let me state at the outset, the Apache\u2019s future will be centered on our tremendous North American onshore resource base. Second, I\u2019d like to make it clear, that Apache intends to completely access the Wheatstone and Kitimat LNG project. And third, in light of our expanding opportunity set in North American onshore, we are evaluating our international assets and are exploring multiple opportunities including the potential for separation of some or all of them through the capital markets. And one additional note regarding our North American onshore portfolio, over the past year, we deepened our understanding of our North American properties. We\u2019ve elevated our capabilities in advanced emerging plays and in that regard this fall we intend to hold an update presentation on North American onshore highlighting our $1.7 million net acres in the Permian basin. So, with that out of the way, let me move to the details of our performance in the second quarter. This morning we announced second quarter results of $644 million or $1.67 per share of adjusted earnings, and $2.2 billion of cash flow from operations before changes in working capital. During the quarter our operational focus in extensive acreage position across our best hydrocarbon region rich basins allowed us to drive production growth in North American onshore liquids. On a pro forma basis, we averaged 201,000, 395,000 barrels of oil per day, which is up 18% year-over-year. North American onshore liquids represented nearly 61% of our total worldwide liquids production and 37% of our overall production. A corner stone of our North American onshore success has been the outstanding performance in the Permian basin. And through the first half of the year, the Permian region\u2019s performance is ahead of our plan. In fact we surpassed the significant milestone earlier this year as we celebrated reaching 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent and a day net. We have come a long way since we launched the regions just over four years ago. And have grown production nearly 200% since that time. In fact, we have grown production 17 out of the last 18 quarters, and the last 11 quarters consecutively. Cash flow from the region is coming in ahead of plan. And we anticipate the region will fully fund its capital program for the year. We expect to deliver over 23% liquids growth and more than 20% Boe growth for the year. And this performance demonstrates our focus on operational excellence and are driving out of cost from the system. And it underscores Apache\u2019s leading position in the Permian. In the Anadarko Basin, our Central Region has experienced several challenges over the last couple of quarters. And as a result production growth has been disappointing. Our total wells drilled to-date for the year is 26% behind plan due to weather slowdowns as well as mechanical difficulties in both drilling and completion. We\u2019re retooling the region in addition to recently making personnel changes or scaling back the Anadarko Basin activity and reducing capital and rigs. We continue to believe in the growth opportunities in the Anadarko Basin, we just need to slowdown and assure our selves we\u2019re making good investment decisions over the long term. We do intend to ramp up our drilling activity in our Central Region Canyon mine play and Oldham and Potter County of Texas Panhandle. And I\u2019ll touch on this in more detail a little later. As we said in the past, we view North American onshore business as one large resource comprised of several different plays and we will allocate capital and resources to the best opportunities within that portfolio. Despite the challenges we had in the Anadarko Basin, I want to reiterate our 15% to 18% North American onshore liquids guidance. And I also want to reiterate our 5% to 8% increase in our production, overall production guidance. We have a significant opportunity before us in North American onshore and the ability and expertise to continue to execute and deliver growth in the years to come. I\u2019d like to specifically mention a few highlights from the quarter and share some of the results we are most excited about. I want to start in North American onshore Permian Basin, we have averaged 37 rigs, 24 of which were horizontal, and we grew production 4% over the previous quarter. Year-over-year we\u2019re seeing total production growth of an impressive 26%. We had a strong Wolfcamp shale results in Regan County in Southern Midland Basin. For example, our SRH 1335 had a 24-hour rates of 1,184 barrels of oil equivalent a day. We also had impressive results in the Bone Spring of the Delaware Basin, with several new wells coming on in Reeves and Loving County, including the Robin 8 with 24-hour rate of nearly 1,200 barrels of oil per day. And our East Texas Eagle Ford play in Brazos and Burleson counties, we continue to be very excited about our opportunity in this emerging play. We\u2019d recently added additional acreage and now hold over 2,000 net acres in the play. We\u2019re shifting to more of an appraisal mode in our drilling from pads to further reduce cost and enhance returns. We have spud 26 wells during the quarter, with most scheduled to come on line frankly in the third quarter, the Reveille 8H was completed during the second quarter in a 24-hour IP of 987 barrels of oil equivalent a day. We also have early test on wells coming on in first part of the third quarter, including the nearby Reveille 10H and 14H which had 24-hour IPs of 906 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 1,220 barrels of oil equivalent per day, respectively. With these strong results and our tremendous land position we decided to further ramp our activity up and should be running 10 rigs by year-end in this play. In the Canyon Lime play in the Texas Panhandle, we also have seen strong results, specifically our most recent well the Bivins 94-1H at a 30-day IP of 1,718 barrels of oil equivalent a day. We hold approximately 100,000 net contiguous acres in this play and are planning to drill a total of six wells this year to further delineate the play and we should have four rigs running active in this play by year end. Turning to Canada, in our first quarter call, we disclosed that we had drilled the Duverney and Montney wells. The initial production rates has been encouraging. For an example, in the Duverney in the first quarter we completed well 24-hour rate of 1,963 barrels of oil equivalent a day. And in the Montney our first well was completed in the first quarter, had a 30 day IP of 926 barrels of oil equivalent a day. And with these positive results, we\u2019re looking to increase activities in these plays and plan to spud 10 wells in the Duverney and two wells in the Montney by year-end 2014. We\u2019ve also been adding to our acreage position in both these plays, we now have 146,000 net acres in the Montney and 177,000 net acres in the Duverney. I want to take a second and shift to our international region. Production was in line with expectations as we held it flat over the previous quarter. We remain on track to generate significant free cash flow for the year from our international regions. In the North Sea second quarter production was up 7% quarter-over-quarter, as we recovered from a difficult winter. We drilled eight new wells during the second quarter including a new well in the Beryl field that achieved 30-day IP of 4,500 barrels of oil equivalent a day. And our (indiscernible) well that achieved an average 30-day IP of 1,500 barrels of oil per day. During the quarter in Egypt, we had additional exploration success, we had notable tests in the AEB, Safa, and Paleozoic reservoirs as well as the horizontal test in Upper Bahariya. Following Phase I of our (indiscernible) development project the field is now producing at peak productions and we\u2019ve also seen record oil and gas production from successful work on the BP acquired call to two properties at Abu Gharadig and Razak. And finally, in Australia we continue to make progress on several of our new projects. Our Balnaves project is expected to come online in the third quarter, in fact we expect first of all in the next few weeks. I want to point out our Coniston development project which is originally scheduled for first oil during the third quarter of 2014 is now going to be delayed until early 2015. Our FPSO, the Ningaloo Vision were delivered to the shipyard in Singapore early part of this year to undergo process upgrades and capacity expansion, which will require to bring on our new Coniston wells. During a deep hole inspection coincident with the upgrade, it was discovered that it had significant structural steel replacement problem that was necessary to ensure its long-term safety and integrity of production up time for this FPSO. The repair work is well underway; it should start up later than initially planned. However, and this delayed start up does not, but I want to point out this delayed start up does not impact our overall production guidance. As I mentioned earlier, we are on track to deliver our production guidance for 15% to 18% North American onshore liquids growth and our global BOE expected growth of 5% to 18%, based on our 2013 production on a pro forma basis. Finally, before I turn the call over to Alfonso, I want to briefly touch on our buyback program, utilizing proceeds primarily from divestments during the quarter Apache bought back an additional $780 million worth of stock. This brings our total expense the launch of our buyback program through the end of the second quarter to nearly $2.3 billion or 26 million shares. As a reminder during the second quarter our Board increased our authorization by 10 million shares to 40 million shares. And we continue to be Apache shares at compelling value at current prices. With that, I would like the turn the call over to Alfonso Alfonso Leon :  Thank you, Steve. I\u2019m going to cover some balance sheet highlights and provide production and financial expectations for the remainder of the year. First, with respect to our balance sheet, during the second quarter we completed three significant portfolio focusing steps. The monetization of our major deepwater development projects, the divestment of dry gas properties in Canada, and the focusing of our asset base in south Texas. These three things actions close during the quarter yielding $1.8 billion of cash proceeds. This brings the total cash proceeds generate before portfolio focusing steps over the last year to $10 billion. As Steve mentioned, we continue to actively repurchase Apache common shares during the quarter. In the second quarter we bought back $780 million in stock. To put that number in context I should note that the $1.4 billion proceeds from our deepwater divestment were only received on the very last day of the quarter, 30th of June. Our balance sheet remained strong, our total cash position as of June 30 is nearly $1.9 billion. Debt remains unchanged at $9 billion which puts us at 22% debt to cap. Now I\u2019m going to make some comments regarding your expectations for the remainder of the year, starting with production. As Steve said, we remain on track to deliver our production growth expectations for the year, consistent with our 15% to 18% North American onshore liquids growth expectations, and the third and fourth quarters we anticipate 2% to 4% sequential North American onshore liquids growth, driven by our horizontal development, programs continuing to build on their momentum. In line with our 5% to 8% global BOE production growth, we anticipate our global gas production to drop 1% to 2% sequentially in the third quarter. And for global BOE production to be flat to 1% up sequentially for the quarter. This is driven primarily by our regularly scheduled third quarter maintenance turnaround in the North Sea, where production is expected to be 12% to 14% down sequentially in the third quarter with that production returning in the fourth quarter. As a final production note we currently expect Australia production to rise 6,000 to 8,000 BOEs per day sequentially in each of the third and fourth quarters, driven by oil from Balnaves ramping up. Going to turn now to realizations. We currently expect North American oil realization discounts to WTI of $5 to $8 barrel. On the international oil side we expect to shift to a realization discount to Brent of $1 to $2 per barrel as our mix of production evolves with Australia ramping up. We continue to expect North American natural gas realization discounts to NYMEX for the full year in line with first quarter or a $0.40 per Mcf discount. And we now see global NGL realizations at 28% to 30% of WTI for the remainder of the year, which is slightly lower than our previous expectation, driven by North America now being expected to be at 25% to 27% of WTI. Now I'm going to move to the expense side. Starting with LOE. Second quarter unit LOE was up sequentially to $10.59, this is in line with expectations we set out in our previous call, of an increase form first quarter levels by 10% through year-end, driven by the ongoing shift in our portfolio balance and general cost increases. Going now to DD & A, unit recurring DD & A was up $0.70 sequentially in the second quarter. This is in line with our expectations to see it rise this year by as much $2 per BOE from first quarter numbers, as we focus our capital on liquids projects. Going to taxes other than income, we expect an increase for the remainder of the year primarily driven by the initiation of Australia PRRT expense. Based on current strip prices, we currently expect taxes other than income to increase sequentially by $40 million to $70 million in the third quarter. Going to G&A, second quarter G&A expense reflected the timing of third-party reimbursements, we expect a sequential increase of $20 million to $40 million in G&A expense in the third quarter. And finally, on the Income Statement, going to income taxes, our adjusted income tax rate was 40.3% in the second quarter, which is in line with our expectations of 40% to 44% for the year. On an adjusted basis, our deferred tax percentage was 30% which is broadly in line with our previously stated expectations for the year. Finally, capital for the first half of 2014 was in line with our plan for the year. We have updated the format of our capital table on Page 10 of financial supplement to facilitate the tracking of our investment. This concludes our prepared remarks. I think we\u2019re now ready for questions. Operator :  (Operator Instructions) Please note that during the Q&A portion of the call, you are allotted one question and one follow-up question. Please hold for the first question. First question will come from Bob Bracket with Sanford Bernstein. Robert Brackett \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC: Hi, good afternoon. Question on this international asset separation, and it has two parts. In terms of Egypt, does the JV partner have any preemption rights or any ability to restrict what you might do there? And the second is you talk about North America growth as opposed to U.S. growth. What\u2019s the role of Canada in the portfolio, and is it a target for the international asset separation? G. Steven Farris : Well, let\u2019s start with the international certainly the way that we are looking at it, we would just spend out or set up a company that was not was above any of the relationships Apache had at the joint venture level. So that would not require votes of other parties. With respect to Canada, we have said for some time that Canada was a part of our North American onshore portfolio, certainly we have two businesses up there. I think we have a business which is a big business that we have with respect to Duvernay Shale, the Montney Shale and some of the other things that we are working on there and then we also have Kitimat, Horn River, Leard. Kitimat, Horn River, Leard is part of our LNG projects that we indicated and re-indicated today that we intend to exit. Robert Brackett \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC: And then a follow-up on the East Texas Eagle Ford, if you\u2019re ramping the 10 rigs, does that you\u2019ve de-risked it and this is a commercial project that competes for capital. G. Steven Farris :  We feel very comfortable we\u2019d de-risk and it also is going to compete with capital and today what we are trying to do is refine it and it increase the rate of return and the EURs and lower the cost. Robert Brackett \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC: Great, thanks. Operator : The next question will come from Michael Roe with PPH. Michael Roe \u2013 PPH:  Yes, good afternoon. I just had a quick question on the central region. So I know you all picked up some rigs in Q2 to try to catch up based on your slowdown in Q1. So I was wondering when you\u2019re decelerating in that region this year, are there particular zones that we will see less capital relative to others? John J. Christmann, IV: This is John. Yes, I mean we are planning to drop some rigs and slowdown and retool in the central region so we will dropping some capital back half of the year. G. Steven Farris : I apologize because you were very almost inaudible on this end but \u2013 right now we got two parts of the central region, we got the Anadarko Basin, which we are going to drop some rigs on and we also got the Canyon Lime down in Texas Panhandle, we are going to be increasing but net-net we\u2019ll be reducing our capital in the overall program for the central region. Michael Roe \u2013 PPH:  Okay, yes, so my question didn\u2019t come through clearly, I was just curious, if there is any specific zone in the Anadarko Basin that will see less capital unlike is it the Cleveland or the Granite Wash, they will see less capital or will it just be kind of uniform across the board. G. Steven Farris : In general, we still remained very bullish or excited about the basin we just need to slowdown and we\u2019ve had good wells in all those zones. We just need to kind slowdown take a deep breath and pause and regroup. Michael Roe \u2013 PPH: Okay, great, and then I guess just shifting really quick to the Permian Basin, looks like the well results you all had in the Bone Spring look pretty strong in the Pecos Bend area. I was wondering if you could help provide color on how much acreage you have in Reeves, Loving and Ward Counties of the Delaware Basin? Just trying to get a sense of your running room there. John J. Christmann, IV:  When you look at our Delaware basin acreage we\u2019ve got over 500,000 gross for that 215,000 net. So we\u2019ve got good running room in all three of those counties. But I don\u2019t have a break down specifically just to those three. But that is how you kind of look at the whole Delaware basin. Michael Roe \u2013 PPH: Okay, thanks for the color. Operator : The next question will come from David Tameron with Wells Fargo. David your line is open. Can you hear me your line is open. Castlen Kennedy : You can go ahead and move to the next question, please. Operator : The next question will come from Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Co. Pearce W. Hammond \u2013 Simmons & Co.:  Hi, good afternoon guys. G. Steven Farris : Good afternoon. Pearce W. Hammond \u2013 Simmons & Co.:  Regarding potential international divestitures, how do you balance the need to simplify the company and placate some shareholders in the near term versus the challenges of receiving fair value for those international assets and what is best for the company in the long-term. G. Steven Farris : Well I think number one if you look at what we\u2019ve done over the last five years and what we\u2019ve said today they are consistent we \u2013 in the past we haven\u2019t said what we\u2019re going to today, we thought like we \u2013 with all the discussion out there we felt like we had to discuss some of this. With respect to what we have sold in the past and the way I feel about the future is, I think we\u2019ve have gotten very fair prices from what we have sold and frankly they are like Heidelberg and Lucius, we started selling that over a year and what we ended up selling it for, because we weren\u2019t going to sell it at prices that don\u2019t make sense. And that\u2019s the way I feel about our international assets. But I do think there is a potential for a capital market solution for a number of these assets and we\u2019re working on that, have been working on that for some time. Pearce W. Hammond \u2013 Simmons & Co.: Thank you, Steve and then my follow up relates to Kitimat. Does the sale of Kitimat impact the value of the Leard and Horn River assets. Or do you \u2013 if you\u2019re going to sell down your interest in Kitimat, do you in turn sell down the Leard and Horn River so that goes with that package and does it stay with the Canadian assets that might be at a part of your onshore North America go forward company? G. Steven Farris : Yeah, I have to honestly say I don\u2019t think the complete exit by Apache has a impact on the value of Kitimat going forward one way or the other. I said frankly whether we\u2019re in it or not is a world class project with world class reserves and frankly Chevron and Apache at this point are a way head of anybody else in that arena. So, and we\u2019ve always been in a position frankly that we felt like we could not be in these LNG projects. And I just think it\u2019s important that we stayed back. Pearce W. Hammond \u2013 Simmons & Co.: Thank you, Steve. Operator : The next question will come from Joe Allman with JPMorgan. Joseph David Allman \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC :  Thank you. In terms of Apache post these transactions, what\u2019s your hope in terms of, say a growth rate, what do you think is an appropriate growth rate for a North America onshore focused Apache? What kind of growth rate would you think is competitive? How would you see spending, would you think you would be free cash flow positive, or free cash flow neutral, or would you accelerate and actually be deficit spending? And then also what kind of returns would you be looking forward in the post-transaction Apache? G. Steven Farris : Well, I think if you look at, frankly if you look at what our growth rate is today, and you compare it with most of the companies of size, our long term forecast is 5% to 9%. Regardless of whether we say that is our forecast, that is competitive in the market, I think our liquids growth are competitive in the market at 15% to 18%. With respect, do we live within our cash flow? I think we have been very open over the last several quarters about what our view of our capital structure is. Our capital structure should be in a position that is competitive in the market, and gives us flexibility in the financial arena, so that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to comment about that. I think we have the potential frankly with the asset base that we have, and the expertise that we are building the capabilities for, frankly. Really have the potential to have significant growth over the next several years. Joseph David Allman \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC :  Got you. And then a follow-up, so just a follow-up to that question, and then another one. So just in terms of returns, do you think that the post-Apache or the post-transaction Apache will yield better returns than the existing Apache? And then off question is, like what\u2019s your thinking behind the sale of international and what kind of iterations have you thought about, have you thought about spinning out the Permian for example, or have you thought about spinning and selling everything except keeping Egypt and North Sea, which currently generate free cash flow, and also keeping the Permian, but selling everything else. So just trying to think about what iterations have you thought about, and what does selling international really do for you? G. Steven Farris :  Well, we thought about a number of reiterations. I don\u2019t know that I could mark off each one of the ones you went through in terms of the consideration. I see North American onshore sales as a different business than what we are doing internationally. They take different expertise, they take different time frames, they take different really scientific skill sets. And I think that it is important for us to recognize that, and recognize if we\u2019re going to be the best we can be, we need to concentrate on the things that we have the most of, and I think has the highest \u2013 the greatest growth future. Joseph David Allman \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC :  Got you. And just on returns do you think, you'll have higher returns post transaction or is there\u2026 G. Steven Farris :  Yes, I do. I think overall when you say returns, I\u2019m talking about future returns on invested dollars. As we look at our discretionary spend going forward, where we can spend dollars for the highest rates of return. I think what we\u2019re doing now, certainly in the Permian what we\u2019re doing in Eagle Ford compete with anything else we\u2019re doing investing across the Company. Certainly Egypt is a great rate of return, but we also got to recognize that it\u2019s a situation that fits into international portfolio also. Joseph David Allman \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC :  Got you. Very helpful. Steve, thank you. Operator : The next question will come from John Herrlin with Societe Generale. John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale :  Yes, hi. Two quick ones for me, Steve. What was the condensate yield out of the Duvernay well you mentioned? G. Steven Farris : John, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t\u2026 John J. Christmann, IV:  Yes, John. Hang on just a second here. On our Duverney well, the 734-barrels of oil a day, 200 barrels are condensate and about $4.4 million. Those are actually 30-day average. John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale : Great. Thank you. With respect to the international spin, Steve, what about tax efficiency? Is it easier to do a spin versus an outright sale? How could you shield your basis for a lot of the sales proceeds? Alfonso Leon : John. Hi, it\u2019s Alfonso. We have been working on this for quite sometime now. Based on our work to-date, we believe that we can effect the separation of our international business in a tax efficient manner. We still have obviously significant work ahead of us as we move this forward. So based on everything that we have seen thus far, we believe we can get this done efficiently? John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale : Okay, great. Thank you, very much. Operator :  The next question will come from Doug Leggate with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Thanks everybody for getting me on. Steve, Egypt when you sold it last year, I think one of the arguments for keeping the two thirds that you retained was about, you may get a better option to see a recovery in the political environment there, and obviously you took a fairly hefty discount on it. I\u2019m just curious therefore, is a separation via a spin preferred to trying to take cash out of Egypt, because obviously you'd end up suffering the same fate I imagine? And if so, would you be thinking an international listing for the international business or would you be thinking about two U.S. listed companies, I know it\u2019s a bit conceptual, but just trying to get understanding how you\u2019re thinking about it, I\u2019ve got a follow-up, please? G. Steven Farris :  Well, certainly if we do it in the capitals market, we spin it, certain of our shareholders will still own it. I mean, and they have the benefit of it. And maybe Alfonso, I didn\u2019t understand the complete question frankly. Alfonso Leon :  Hey, Doug. Look, we are looking at all alternatives, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve outlined that we are evaluating a number of different alternatives. We need to get to the best possible outcome, the one that maximizes value for our shareholders. So we are progressing different alternatives. Now, when you look at the profile, the profitability the competitive position of our international businesses, they are each of them the leader in their respective competitive space. So obviously, they have a very attractive profile for a portfolio capital markets positioning. So that\u2019s certainly a very compelling opportunity. Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So my follow-up, maybe it\u2019s just for you, Alfonso, but the value of your onshore resources obviously going to be depended on the pace of drilling, and Wheatstone for sure, and certainly North Sea in each of \u2013 would have generated on both \u2013 currently generated substantial free cash flow. So how do we think about giving that up in terms of the ability to accelerate the onshore using that international free cash flow as you did separate businesses, and I\u2019ll leave it at that. Thank you. G. Steven Farris : Let me just start with respect to \u2013 you\u2019re not really taking it away, let\u2019s assume that we \u2013 if we were to divest of it, obviously, we\u2019d also \u2013 we\u2019d just bring in the value forward. If we do spin it, we also have debt associated with those assets that are spun out, so in either way you\u2019re not giving up that assets, you\u2019re just separating them. Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So Steve would we expect then to \u2013 Apache has always kind of talked about living within cash flow, so in that situation, are you seeing you reduce your balance sheet to accelerate the growing in the lower 48? G. Steven Farris :  Well, I think what I\u2019ve said, and I'll say it again, and because I said it earlier. We look at our financial position based on what we think is a competitive in the market, and also in such \u2013 in a position that we can continue to grow. We're in a different space than we were in when we were acquiring and exploiting. We're in a different space in terms of what our go-forward opportunities are. So how we look at our balance sheet is going to change a little bit. Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it, understood. Thanks very much fellows. Operator : The next question will come from Brian Singer with Goldman, Sachs. Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman, Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good afternoon. A question on the Permian. Relative to your Analyst Meeting in late February, what is evolving in your Permian strategy or assumptions, and how are you looking at potential and drilling opportunities in your central Midland Basin position in Midland, Martin and Howard Counties? John J. Christmann, IV:  Well, I mean what we laid out, we\u2019re pretty much in line. We\u2019ve run six to seven rigs at Barnhard. We\u2019ve been taking those learnings and applying them. We\u2019ve now got 18 rigs running horizontally in the Midland Basin. So we\u2019re starting to announce some results in our Scottish rights and our pile area and so forth. So we\u2019re taking those learnings that we\u2019ve had in Barnhard. In general, though, we\u2019re still working. I mean, when you look at what we\u2019re doing right now on the completion side, we\u2019re looking at more clusters, more stages, more sand loading per linear foot, all of those things and I think it\u2019s helping wells holdup longer and so forth. So we continue to take those learnings that we\u2019ve had and progress them into other areas as well as into the Eagle Ford and those things. Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thanks. And then, what is the timing for a greater decision on the separation of the international assets? Is there a specific time you expect to have that, and does that decision need to be made prior to selling Wheatstone, Kitimat, or other international assets individually? Alfonso Leon : Brian, we haven\u2019t set a specific timeline. We are working on a number of different opportunities and have been working on them for quite some time at the moment. Each of them has a different timeline associated with it, and we will make decisions as we get to decision points. Specifically on the separation workflow, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re very familiar with, those are multi core processes. So that is not something that is executed on an imminent basis. The work has been underway, but there is still significant work ahead of us. Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Michael Hall \u2013 Heikkinen Energy Advisors :  Thank you. A number of mine have been asked on the portfolio repositioning, so I\u2019ll leave that be, but on the Permian, just a couple questions. The oil growth in the quarter kind of slowed a bit on a quarter on quarter basis. Anything in particular driving that, and is this kind of a timing issue or how should we think about that going forward? John J. Christmann, IV: It\u2019s clearly timing issue. We pulled a few pads forward into the first quarter. That\u2019s why you had bigger first quarter numbers relative to second quarter. So it\u2019s an issue on the timing and so forth. But we remain optimistic and encouraged with our asset base. Michael Hall \u2013 Heikkinen Energy Advisors :  Okay. And I guess in that context, are there any surface constraints that you\u2019re working through at present that might help restructure? John J. Christmann, IV: We don\u2019t have anything backed up right now. I mean, that\u2019s the nice thing about our portfolio is we plan our schedule, we plan our completion timing, we stay ahead on the facilities. So that\u2019s the big advantage we\u2019ve got, which has really let us have such a track record, 17 out of 18 quarters up. So we remained executing the plan we\u2019ve got out there. Michael Hall \u2013 Heikkinen Energy Advisors : Great, and then just as a reminder, can you remind me what your protection on differentials looks like out of the Permian Basin and in the context the royalty revenues coming from the mineral ownership you have in the basin? John J. Christmann, IV: In terms of our volumes we do have the ability to take Gulf Coast pricing or WTI or NYMEX. We\u2019ve got protection on the differentials. We have not disclosed anything on our mineral royalties out there. We do have a nice position, but a lot of that is future acreage to be developed and it\u2019s not something that\u2019s contributing a great percentage right now. Michael Hall \u2013 Heikkinen Energy Advisors : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles A. Meade \u2013 Johnson & Rice Company L.L.C.:  Good afternoon, everybody. I want to go back to the issue of the international assets. It seems to me that a lot of the conversation questions contain the assumption that all of the assets or the whole set of international operations will all go out in one transaction. I wanted to test that assumption a bit because it seems to me that some of the assets would have a better reception in the capital markets and then others maybe belong with you or belong in some other international company\u2019s portfolio. So can you may be shed a little light on whether there\u2019s going to be multiple transactions or just one? Thomas E. Voytovich:  That\u2019s a very good question. Honestly, we truthfully have been working on a number of opportunities. One is a complete capital market solution. But we also have other solutions that you point out that could take place and could take place quicker than a complete capital market\u2019s exit. So, yes, it could be some combination of each one of those. Charles A. Meade \u2013 Johnson & Rice Company L.L.C.:  Great, thank you, Tom. And then going back to the Permian, I know you guys have fielded a lot of questions on your royalty position in the last month or so. And I wonder if you could give anymore breakdown of maybe by Midland Basin, central Basin platform, Delaware Basin or by county on where those royalty acres lie. John J. Christmann, IV:  They\u2019re scattered. We\u2019ve got a big position in the very, very southern portion of the Delaware is where a big chunk of it sits, which is really below where the activity has been, but we think it could ultimately move there. But that\u2019s where a lion\u2019s share of it sits. We\u2019ve also got some gains, but nothing that we\u2019ve lined out is in an area right now that we\u2019re going crazy with on the development side. Charles A. Meade \u2013 Johnson & Rice Company L.L.C.:  Got it. That\u2019s helpful detail. Thank you, John. Operator :  The next question will come from Arun Jayaram with Credit Suisse. Arun Jayaram \u2013 Credit Suisse :  Good afternoon. Alfonso, Steve, understanding you\u2019re still evaluating the potential separation of international. It seems like the comments today suggest that you believe strategically a complete separation of the two makes the most sense. So, is that a fair characterization strategically? G. Steven Farris :  I think it\u2019s a fair characterization that they are \u2013 we recognize and we have recognized that there really are two different businesses and I think how we accomplish that recognition in the end will probably end up a majority of those assets being in another vehicle, if you understand what I\u2019m saying. What that vehicle is if it\u2019s a capital structure solution or for an outright sale. Arun Jayaram \u2013 Credit Suisse : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for clarifying that. Second question just goes along with the Anadarko Basin. Steve, this has been an area that I know you focused on post the Cordillera transaction. Can you just give us a little bit more detail on why the growth rate is coming in a little bit lower than you had thought initially? G. Steven Farris : I think I\u2019ll let John comment on the details. I think our biggest issue is, I think I\u2019ve pointed out in my prepared remarks, we are 26% behind in terms of getting wells on compared with our plan. Regardless of the results of those wells, 26% is, and honestly the majority of those had some kind of mechanical issue either sidetrack, or casing, or completion problems. We just took our eye off the ball frankly and we got to get our eye back on the ball. John J. Christmann, IV: And, Arun, just a little color there. We\u2019re 43 wells short of what we plan to have on through the first half of the year, which is huge when you had a program of 163 for the plan. And then when you look at a lot of what\u2019s lead to that we\u2019ve had over 27 wells that sidetrack in. So when you look at that, I mean, that\u2019s big, big portion of where we are. I will say we\u2019ve had good results in all of the play. So we aren\u2019t saying none of them are working. We\u2019ve just got to kind of get refocused and get back to doing it how we approach, how we used to do it. Arun Jayaram \u2013 Credit Suisse : Okay. John J. Christmann, IV: And with new technology too. Arun Jayaram \u2013 Credit Suisse : Okay. And then just my final quick question, you guys reiterated your volume guidance despite the timing in Australia at Coniston plus perhaps a slower growth rate from the central. Where is this going to be made up, Permian and East Texas? John J. Christmann, IV: Your Permian, your East Texas, Eagle Ford as well as Bivens play, Canada remains ahead of schedule as well. Arun Jayaram \u2013 Credit Suisse : Okay. Thank you for that detail. Operator : The next question will come from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. Jeffrey Campbell \u2013 Tuohy Brothers :  Good afternoon. I think I\u2019ve got some, John, questions here. Can you give some color on the current DNC costs and the K-bob Duvernay and what you think these costs can look like over the next 18 months? John J. Christmann, IV: Well, right now we\u2019ve got two wells down and they were not done off of pads and so not really in a position to steer off of where we\u2019ve been. As we work on the program this fall, we plan to spud six more Duvernay wells and I think we\u2019ll see cost come down significantly. But our first couple wells were science wells. And, so they\u2019re not representative of where we\u2019ll be in the future with our program up there. Jeffrey Campbell \u2013 Tuohy Brothers : The next question was the Hector County Kline well was a very strong result. Can you contrast the extra Kline from the Kline wells you\u2019ve been drilling in the East and Glasscock? Are there any noteworthy differences in geology or mix or cost? John J. Christmann, IV:  Well, just like the Midland Basin, you get a little bit deeper in the basin. So you get a little bit pressure or little different oil makeup. So that area, we\u2019re very excited about. But geology is a little different and obviously the fluid property as well. Jeffrey Campbell \u2013 Tuohy Brothers : Okay. If I can sneak one last one in. You said in the first quarter 2014 when you were talking about the East Texas Eagle Ford, you were targeting getting some wells up to 10,000 feet laterals. I was just wondering have you drilled any of that long yet? And can you disclose what the lateral lengths were of the two Reveille wells you highlighted in the second quarter supplement? John J. Christmann, IV: Those Reveille wells have been in the 6,000 to 7,000 foot range and we have not drilled one up to 10,000. I think we had one about 8,000 was one earlier. So we do think we\u2019ll be able to continue to drill longer laterals. A lot of that\u2019s just driven by how we led the units down in the land position. Jeffrey Campbell \u2013 Tuohy Brothers :  Okay, great. Thanks very much. Operator : The next question will come from Leo Mariani with RBC. Leo Mariani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Just a question on the Kitimat disposal here. Can you talk a little bit more about the motivation for this? Is this based on the fact that it\u2019s going to be a significant CapEx burden for a number of years for the company and you wouldn\u2019t see any cash flow out many years? Is that one of the motivating factors behind the disposition? And given how that\u2019s a very early stage project, would you expect to get a material amount of cash for that on the short-term? John J. Christmann, IV:  Well, in terms of the decision process, obviously if you look at where we are going on our base business and you think about the priority of capital and the time frame associated with LNG projects and specifically Kitimat frankly, it makes sense for someone else to own it that has a different time horizon than we do. And in terms of the order of magnitude of the capital, cash, we\u2019ll have to see. Leo Mariani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Okay. That\u2019s all I had. Thanks. Operator : The next question will come from Richard Tullis with Capital One. Richard Tullis \u2013 Capital One : Thanks. Good afternoon. Just a couple quick questions. Steve, what were the average well costs in the second quarter for your Permian, Wolfcamp and Bone Spring wells? G. Steven Farris : Our Wolfcamp wells have been running around $7 million roughly, which is kind of an average. One thing we\u2019ve seen is we\u2019ve gone with little harsh sand loadings, some have creeped up, $7 million is probably a pretty good number and our Bone Spring wells have come down a little bit and they\u2019re probably in that same range. Richard Tullis \u2013 Capital One : Okay. Given this, what could be even in more focused onshore North America assets than say at the time of the Analyst Meeting, how does the Gulf of Mexico shelf fit into that portfolio? Would you still plan to be active there in 2015/2016? Thomas E. Voytovich: This is Tom. Gulf shelf remains an area of focus for us, but we are in an inventory building mode now. There\u2019s no capital committed for 2014. We would anticipate some expenditures in 2015 provided of course that that opportunity is competitive with other things in the portfolio.  I will say that inventory building is well underway. We have pretty impressive list of prospects. And I will also say though that there\u2019s no pressure to execute on these right now. The only decision making component here is whether or not these prospects are competitive with what we\u2019re doing in North America onshore. And if they are, they\u2019ll get consideration for capital. Richard Tullis \u2013 Capital One : Okay. And then just lastly, how much has been spent to date on Kitimat on a net basis? Thomas E. Voytovich: I think IR will have to come back to you on that number. Richard Tullis \u2013 Capital One : Okay that\u2019s fine. Thomas E. Voytovich: I don't have that number yet. Richard Tullis \u2013 Capital One : All right. Thank you. I appreciate it. Operator : The final question will come from Joe Magner with Macquarie Joseph Patrick Magner \u2013 Macquarie Capital Inc.: Thanks for getting me on here. Just want to go back to the portfolio of repositioning topic here for a bit. I guess I'm still not clear on what actually is driving the moves now, what's driven the recognition that the domestic business or the North American business is different and should be separate from the international and LNG businesses. And it's only a few months ago that you all had laid out sort of the longer term view with all of the moves that it made last year and there was a lot of hope that perhaps that work was behind you. And now we've got one, two potentially a number of additional transactions to be on the look out for over the coming quarters. What really, I mean aside from the recent announcements about some increased interest from some potential shareholders, some certain shareholders, I guess that's what I'm trying to get a better handle on. It seem like you were comfortable and had made comments in the past, but the moves that have been made were the moves that you had in sort of in mind and thought that was going to be enough. And now we've got another change here, so could spend a little more time on that? G. Steven Farris : Certainly. Let me start off with talking about from late 2009. And I thank most of our shareholders and (indiscernible) most have that chart because what I showed is that we made a strategic decision to get back into North America. And if you look at what we did over that timeframe, I think, we brought $16 billion worth of properties and 85% of were with North America onshore. And if you look at about what we were about after 2012, first part of 2013, I think at our year-end analyst call we said we were going to sell $1 billion worth of properties at that time. In the second quarter we came out and announced we were going to sell $4 billion worth of properties and end up now of selling $10 billion worth of properties. I think the overriding thing that we take from this is that number one; we started out being on the forefront of coming back to North America. And I think what you\u2019re seeing is, what does it take to get North America onshore to center part of this company? And if you look at what we\u2019ve been able to do, it's getting us a long way there. If you look at what we got in front of us in terms of these LNG projects and the long term nature of them, the amount of capital it takes to invest in them. I think that\u2019s an easy decision. I think the difference what we come to the conclusion of frankly in our North American versus international is they are two different businesses, and if you look at the way that you go about doing them in workflows, et cetera, they are two different businesses. So, in our opinion it makes sense that we continue to reduce the size of our international assets because we made a decision long time ago, we\u2019re going to be North American onshore. So that\u2019s, honestly that is and we\u2019ve had some recent discussion about that, among lots of folks and I think it\u2019s important that we state our case and that is our case. Joseph Patrick Magner \u2013 Macquarie Capital Inc.: Okay, we will stay tuned for additional updates, thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Castlen Kennedy : Great thank you so much. We appreciate you all participating in our call today and as always feel free to reach out to IR with follow-up questions. Thank you all and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Gary Clark : Thank you, Jennifer. Good afternoon, everybody. And thank you for joining us for Apache\u2019s third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. On today\u2019s call, we will have three speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. I will start by giving a brief summary of results and then we will hear from Steve Farris, our Chairman, CEO and President; followed by Anthony Lannie, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Also joining us for the question-and-answer session are John Christmann, Executive Vice President and COO of North America; and Tom Voytovich, Executive Vice President and COO of International. Please note that we have streamlined our supplemental earnings disclosures this quarter. We are replacing our financial supplement and our operation supplement with a single quarterly earnings supplement. Most of the financial disclosures previously found in the financial supplement can now be found in the tables attached to our earnings release, as well as the 10-Q. Our new streamlined earnings supplement will continue to summarize our operational activities for the quarter and include well heights across various Apache operating regions. The supplement also includes information on E&P capital expenditures and the visual graphic to illustrate cash sources and uses that reconcile changes in net debt quarter-over-quarter. Our earnings release accompanying the financial tables and non-GAAP reconciliations, and our new quarterly supplement can all be found on our website at apachecorp.com/financialdata. Today\u2019s discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discussed today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. This morning we reported a third quarter 2014 loss of $1.3 billion or $3.50 per diluted share, adjusted earnings, which excludes certain items that impact the comparability of results totaled $528 million or $1.38 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital totaled $2.1 billion during the quarter. Worldwide reported net production averaged 637,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with liquids production constituting 60% of that total. On a pro forma basis, adjusting for recent assets sales and excluding the non-controlling interest and tax bills from Egypt, our second quarter worldwide production was 562,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This represents a 2% increase from the second quarter and a 6% increase from the same period a year ago. I will now call -- turn the call over to Steve. Steve Farris : Thank you, Gary, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank everybody for joining us. During the third quarter, Apache continued to make progress on our transition to becoming a premier North American resource company, delivering another quarter of strong production growth. Our North American drilling program delivered on-shore liquids production growth of 5% sequentially and 15% year-over-year, when adjusted for our asset divestitures. We had strong performance in the Permian and it continues to drive North American results. I want to go back, if you recall during our February 2014 Investor Day, we provided guidance for our Permian production growth from 12% to 15% for the year. Through the nine months ending September 30, our production increased 25%, nearly doubling our February guidance. This increase growth is a result of mix shift to more horizontal drilling. For example, our horizontal well count is up 50% and our vertical count is down 40% through the first nine months of this year compared to same period last year. The biggest drivers of growth in the Permian were our Wolfcamp horizontals in the Southern Midland Basin, our Yeso program in the Northwest shelf and our horizontal Bone Springs wells in the Delaware Basin. A particular note, our Pecos Bend area in Reeves County completed four very strong Bone Springs wells during the quarter. The average 30-day IP of these new wells was over a 1,000 barrels equivalent per day. In our Eagle Ford play, we\u2019ve ramped up activity throughout the year and we are now running 10 rigs there. Strong results coupled with our relentless focus on lowering well costs are allowing this play to compete very well for capital within Apache\u2019s capital program. During the quarter, we spud 29 wells, including wells on four separate pads and brought on our first two pads online in the Reveille area Williston County with an average 30-day IP of 609 barrels of oil equivalent a day. The success of our Eagle Ford program to-date coupled with our expectations for lower well costs and higher rates of return have prompted us to allocate more capital to this play in 2014 than we originally budgeted. Turning to the central region, we have retooled the organization, we have significantly reduced our rig count, we have made numerous process improvements and reprioritized our focus following our challenging first half 2014. We are scaling back our traditional Granite Wash and Tonkawa plays in the Anadarko Basin and we are focusing more on our drilling program in the Canyon Lime play in Oldham and Potter County in Texas Panhandle. As of this morning, we had 16 rigs running in the Anadarko Basin and four in the promising Canyon Lime. In our Duverney and Montney plays in Canada, we ran three rigs total and spud initial wells at the Duverney seventh well pad and drilled the first well at our Montney two well pad. The Duverney and the Montney offer some of the best reservoir rock in North America and we are looking forward to these plays driving our strong production growth once we have optimized our well costs and our completions. We are continuing to high-grade our North American asset base through the addition of leasehold in key growth areas and the sale of non-core acreage. During the quarter, we invested $520 million primarily in leasehold in the sweet spots of our key growth areas. This opportunistic investment was the big driver of the capital cost increase you see in our financial table. We plan to fund our increased investment primarily through the sale of non-core North American assets which we currently have in the market. We\u2019re looking forward to sharing these details in our acreage purchases as well as providing an update on perspective asset sales on November 20th. Looking ahead, we\u2019re confident that our 2014 North American liquids production growth will come in at the higher end of our 15% to 18% guidance range which led predominantly by better-than-expected production out of our Permian region. To sum it up, we are encouraged by the progress we're making in North America, both in our ability to drive cost out of the system as well as improve our well performance. And we are looking forward to providing a lot more detail in the next few weeks when we visit New York City. Turning to our international operations, all three of our regions, North Sea, Egypt and Australia delivered profitable production growth and remain on track to generate significant free cash flow per year. As a result, third quarter worldwide volumes came in slightly above the second quarter at 637,000 barrel equivalent per day, which is right in line with our internal expectations. In the North Sea, we completed our annual third quarter maintenance turnaround with no material delays. Production losses from scheduled downtime was partially offset by strong drilling results at Forties in our first well from The Forties Alpha Satellite Platform. In Egypt, we executed on a very active exploration and development program. During the quarter, we drilled eight new well discoveries in a call to concession. One of the most notable of which was Meghar-08 which IPed at nearly 3200 barrels oil equivalent a day. And yesterday, we tested our [Matruh] (ph) number one exploration well on Western Shushan Basin for over 7000 barrels of oil per day. Operations and production in Egypt continued with no material disruptions during the quarter. And finally in Australia, we made headway on several projects. Our Balnaves\u2019 FPSO came online at the end of August and is currently producing at 18,000 barrels of oil per day net to our interest. We continue to progress our Coniston oil development and remain on track for first oil during the first half of 2015. In closing, I want to reemphasize the strategic direction we laid out on our second quarter earnings call. We remain committed to exiting our two LNG projects, Wheatstone and Kitimat. And we are continuing to evaluate the separation of our international assets through either strategic transactions or the capital markets. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Anthony Lannie. Anthony Lannie : Thanks Steve. As mentioned earlier, we believe our North American onshore resource base is capable of driving strong growth and returns over the foreseeable future. And we continue to take important steps in that direction and allocate resources accordingly. In tandem with our strategic shift towards our North American onshore assets, we took the following two steps during the quarter. We determined that the undistributed earnings in our Australia, Egypt and North Sea regions should no longer be considered permanently reinvested in our foreign operations. This change in policy results in a non-cash charge to U.S. deferred income tax expense of $814 million on those regions for undistributed earnings. In addition, we repatriated $1.9 billion of cash from our Egypt region during the third quarter for which we recognized an associated non-cash U.S. tax expense of $249 million. Bringing this cash back to the U.S. will provide us additional balance sheet flexibility and liquidity as we delineate several promising onshore plays and expand our acreage holdings while at the same time repurchasing Apache\u2019s stock. Turning to the income statement. As Gary noted at the outset, we reported a quarterly loss of $1.3 billion or $3.50 per share, which was driven by two significant items. The first is the $1.1 billion of income tax related charges that I just mentioned, in which reflect the change in our permanent reinvestment policy and repatriation of foreign earnings to the U.S. The second item is an approximate $1 billion after-tax non-cash ceiling test write down primarily related to lower oil and NGL price realizations and the impact of unamortized deepwater costs that remained in our full cost pool following the sale of our Lucius and Heidelberg projects at the end of the second quarter. When excluding these items, along with other more typical non-cash items such as mark-to-market derivatives and foreign currency exchanges, our adjusted earnings were $528 million or $1.38 per share, down from $644 million or $1.67 per share in the second quarter. Operating cash flow remains strong, driven by performance of our North American onshore base. We generated $2.1 billion of cash flow from operations before working capital items, which was down slightly from $2.2 billion in each of the first two quarters of 2014. Despite strong production numbers, our bottom line results were impacted by lower commodity prices. In North America, our oil price realizations averaged $94.69 per barrel in the third quarter, down 9%, compared to the second quarter. Gas price realizations averaged $3.88 per Mcf, down 7% from the second quarter, but still 9% higher than the comparable 2013 period. We ended the third quarter with just over $1 billion of restricted and unrestricted cash on our balance sheet, bringing our total -- our net debt to $9.9 billion. Year-to-date, we have invested $7.5 billion in our drilling programs, of which approximately $626 million is related to opportunistic acreage and leasehold acquisitions onshore North America. Our strong free cash flow from foreign operations and low debt-to-cap ratio of 25% provides Apache the liquidity to support both our North American growth and share repurchase program. On the expense side, LOE per Boe was up 5% quarter-over-quarter to $11.13. This is in line with the expectations we set on the first quarter call. The increase is driven by general increases in labor and power costs and our divestment of lower-cost dry gas properties. Turning to income taxes, our third quarter effective tax rate reflects the impact of the aforementioned change in our foreign earnings reinvestment policy, along with the full cost ceiling test write downs as well as other non-recurring items. Absent these items, our adjusted effective tax rate would have been 43.5%, which is in line with previous guidance. Our adjusted earnings and adjusted effective tax rate recalculations can be found in our supplemental financial information attached to this morning's press release. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo. David Tameron - Wells Fargo : Good morning. I guess it\u2019s good afternoon. Lot of moving pieces, but can you talk about where Canada fits in big picture going forward? Steve Farris : What I think you\u2019ve seen from 2014 -- I mean, 2013 and 2014, we\u2019ve really high-graded our portfolio up there. We basically have two real major plays up there, which is the Duvernay and the Montney. Right now that is going to be our growth drivers for going forward. David Tameron - Wells Fargo : Okay. I don\u2019t what you say ahead of the North American update? But if I think about the Permian, production -- can you just talk about how you see production? It look like it\u2019s slowed a little bit in the quarter but I mean, that could just be noise and timing or completion, et cetera. But can you talk about that growth trajectory over the next 12 to 18 months? John Christmann : I mean, the first key is we are having a great year. When you look at the well count over the first three quarters of last year, our horizantals were up 50%, as we kind of shifted our program. We are currently running 41 rigs. You\u2019ve seen us dropping the verticals as well. So actually, we are working quite a bit ahead where you had guided to 12 to 15% and we are looking at year-end numbers. We are going to put you twice the lower end. So we feel really strong about that. I think going into next year, we'll get into that on the November 20th, but a lot of that will depend on the commodity price forecast and how much cash we want to invest there. The big deal is, I think we feel good about the projects and we have a lot of flexibility with the rig count. So we are in a good spot going into next year. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate - Bank of America : Thank you. Good afternoon everybody. Steve, the step-up in the East Eagle Ford, obviously that\u2019s a newer play for you. I guess, we are going to hear more about that at the end of the month. But I\u2019m just kind of curios, if you could help right for us in this oil price environment, how that play would stack up against your Wolfcamp assets and in particular, how would you allocate capital or prioritize your allocation of capital towards the central areas and more gassy areas in the portfolio and I have a follow-up, please? Steve Farris : Yeah. Thank you. Honestly, we are tremendously pleased and excited about the future of the Eagle Ford and I don\u2019t want to steal our guys thunder for November 20th. But we\u2019ve seen our latest wells continue to get better and we are driving quite a bit of cost out of the system. Our view is that\u2019s going to be a major play for us going forward, especially in 2015, 2016 and beyond. And some of that acreage that we talk about and we will show you this more on November 20th. We\u2019ve increased -- basically that acreage is made up of two parts. One is we\u2019ve increased the acreage in our interest and our existing acreage by buying some of our partners out and the other one is aggregating acreage right around what we think the sweet spot is. So, John, you might want to comment? John Christmann : I mean, I think, directionally, when you look at where we are, we dropped our rig count in the Anadarko. Steve mentioned, we are down to 20 rigs now. So you see that drop in conjunction with the Eagle Ford ramp-up and that will continue going into next year. So that directionally tells you where they are and we\u2019re looking at the portfolio, things that migrate to the top quick, they are going to be the Eagle Ford, the Canyon Lime and the Permian and lots of plays there. So it\u2019s going to compete very, very well. Doug Leggate - Bank of America : I appreciate. My follow-up is really more about -- I guess you don't talk too much about the restructuring, but the issue around -- the subtlety of the issue around the international cash or free cash flow, which I guess is previously accelerating the drilling program to some extent in the Lower 48. With the separation of the international business and the lower oil price, how does that impact your -- I guess your willingness to spend outside of cash flow to bring forward the volumes to some of these newer plays? So I guess I am really trying to understand is operating cost flow, is that still a limiter for spending in the Lower 48 or the standalone company? Or should be expected to use the balance sheet and I will leave it there? Thank you. Steve Farris : Yeah. I might make a general comment. I think we -- over the last two months we\u2019ve seen a $20 move in oil prices. I think all of us have to look at that. We certainly are looking at it in terms of making sure we\u2019re prudent and what our capital program is going forward. I will tell you from an investment opportunity standpoint, we are better off right now and we have been in Lower 48 over the last two or three years. We have tremendous inventory right now, good inventory. I doubt if you see us until we understand where this price is going be really bullish on overspending our cash flow going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from line of John Freeman with Raymond James. John Freeman - Raymond James : Good afternoon. The Canyon Lime is the one area in the central region that you all are increasing activity on and it seems like each quarter the commentary is more bullish. I think now you are kind of ranking as one of your three best North American areas since that Bivens well that you had. And I just want to make sure that I\u2019ve got on the right numbers. When you entered the year that was about 100,000 net acres that was prospective for either the Canyon Wash or the Canyon Lime, is that still a good number to use? I mean, you\u2019ve obviously been busy buying acreage across North America. Steve Farris : We are going to show a lot more of that on November 20. We have more acreage than -- we have more acreage today than we have in the past. John Freeman - Raymond James : Okay. I want still (indiscernible). I will wait on that. And then just my follow-up question. On Egypt you mentioned that there was the sequential production decline was due primarily to some technical challenges as well as some partial shutdowns on a shale operated gas plant. Can you just kind of give maybe an update on that status? Steve Farris : I will let Tom Voytovich who really got the details on that to answer that question. Tom Voytovich : Well to directly answer the technical challenges, there is a gas plant, the old biogas plant which has been rife with problems with the Benfield system and they have shale operated gas plant. It\u2019s the only outside operated plant that we participate in. And as a result of that, out takes have gone down materially 30 million to 50 million cubic feet a day and that really accelerated here in the latter part of the third quarter. We think that this is going to continue through the rest of the year, but we will be making up for it in other ways. Steve Farris : Now the only caveat I would give that is, is in the Egypt 88% of our revenues come from our oil. Gases is percentage wise a bigger chunk of our production on a Boe basis, but 88% of our revenues come from the oil side. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs : Thank you. Good afternoon. Following up on the earlier question on free cash flow. In a lower oil price environment, if you are committed for Apache to stay within cash flow, is there any change to how you're thinking about the strategic nature of some of your free cash generative businesses like the North Sea and Egypt? Is there a case that perhaps you keep that as part of Apache for longer and use that free cash flow? If not, do you see yourself potentially having to cut back on activities in areas that you may rank in your top 3 plays like the Eagle Ford, Canyon Lime or Permian? Steve Farris : Brian, I think the statement that we made in our second quarter earnings call and I reiterated today, we are committed to exiting the LNG facilities and truthfully we are -- we\u2019ve got lots of people working on those projects to do just that. In terms of evaluating our international assets for possible transactions or spends, that\u2019s an ongoing process and we continue to look at it everyday. Certainly I think our -- truthfully I think our North American business today and I probably wouldn\u2019t have said this a year ago or year and half ago is very capable of standing on its own. I mean, I think we\u2019ve got the inventory and I think what you\u2019re going to see in November 20 is we now have the capabilities and the leadership in the regions to be able to do that. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Joe Allman with JPMorgan. Joe Allman - JPMorgan: Thank you, Operator. Hi, everybody. Steve, could you just clarify your strategic direction? So we understand that you plan on exiting the LNG business. But, do you plan to exit the international business? And has there been any even nuisance change just based on data or thinking more deeply about things, about whether to exit the international business? Steve Farris : No, I don\u2019t think so. I think, our plan, our strategic vision is to separate our North American form our international business. I mean, no -- nobody else, I mean when I say think, it\u2019s just -- we have the same thinking today that we have in the past. Joe Allman - JPMorgan: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then onshore North America activity, on a net basis are you in the process of ramping up the North America drilling activity and spending, or are you keeping things flat or you actually on the net basis reducing activity and spending over the next several months? Steve Farris : Well, I think, I guess I will reiterate the answer I gave a little early or the fact of the matter is, we\u2019ve had by anybody\u2019s calculations we\u2019ve got a real sea change in oil prices. I think we\u2019re all going to have a look at how we run businesses at $80 oil in North America and without blowing out your balance sheet. So depending on what happens to oil prices, we\u2019re running a number of different cases, but we\u2019re going to -- our capital program is going to be somewhere around what our cash flow is going into 2015. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rowe from TPH. Michael Rowe - TPH: Yes. I have a quick question on the Anadarko. So I guess you\u2019re down to 20 rigs now versus 30 or so that we\u2019re averaging Q3 and you specifically highlighted the Granite Wash and Tonkawa two intervals that you are hitting activity. I was wondering is that purely driven by tribal economics given where commodities prices are. Or was there I guess something else unique going on there operationally that cause those two specific targets to see less drilling? John Christmann : As we mentioned or Steve mentioned in the script, I mean, we retooled and even on the last call we\u2019ve changed out our entire leadership in our central region. So we\u2019ve addressed the region VP as well as the Op. So the good news is in all of our plays, we still got good wells and good things there. We have shifted the rig count a little bit. We pared back as Steve said in the script and the talk on the Granite Wash. We\u2019ve got a few more running in the Cleveland and the Cottage Grove, where we\u2019re having some good results. And we\u2019re also shifting to the Canyon Lime. But I think when you look at that portfolio and the mix, you\u2019ll see a shift towards the Eagle Ford and the Permian and the Canyon Lime as we look at next year. Michael Rowe - TPH: Okay, great. And then just lastly on the $520 million spend for leasehold and property acquisitions in Q3. Is this part of a broader effort to I guess increase M&A activity relative to drilling given where commodity prices are now, just curious to see, if you are all thinking about easing capital for M&A has been changed versus prior expectations? Steve Farris : Gary, do you want on the Rockies then I handle. Gary Clark : Yeah. I mean, we have really seen an opportunistic -- opportunity this year to add some exceptional acreage in our key growth areas and so we\u2019ve taken advantage of that. I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s necessarily a sea change and how we view acreage acquisition and M&A, but the reality is we need to high-grade the portfolio. And as we\u2019ve matured our key plays and demonstrated a lot of confidence and what we can accomplish there, we have seen a interesting opportunity to beep up in the sweet spots of those key plays. And at the same, we will divest and are divesting some of our areas where that are not going to attract capital and that are not on the growth track and they have lower rates of return. So what you all seen is our spending in the third quarter, what\u2019s pending is the divestitures that will cover a lot of that spending. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Societe Generale. John Herrlin - Societe Generale : Yeah. Hi. Three quick ones. With respect to the asset packages, can you give us a ballpark on associated volumes with them? Steve Farris : Well, we\u2019re going to do that November 20th. We have got a -- I will say, we\u2019ve got a package related to that we\u2019re keen on. We\u2019ve got a package in South Louisiana, our South Louisiana stuff its legacy, we\u2019ve had for sometime. And we\u2019ve also got some properties in central region that are gassy and we\u2019re not spending money on. So you\u2019ll see what that looks like in -- on November 20th. John Herrlin - Societe Generale : Okay. Thanks, Steve. How much does your typical Eagle Ford well run on a complete well cost basis? John Christmann : John, we\u2019ll get into that on November 20th, but they\u2019re going to come in under $8 million Eagle Ford well cost. Gary Clark : We told you $8.3 in February and we\u2019re doing better than that now and we\u2019ve got our site set lower but we\u2019ll share more on the 20th. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles Meade - Johnson Rice : Yes. Good afternoon, everybody. Steve, if I could go back to maybe try to tie two questions together. As we look at or as I look at your debt trajectory, you had been on a trajectory down with debt, not every quarter, but generally over the last six quarters. But you have had tick up this quarter. And I\u2019m wondering if perhaps that might be tied into a view that you are more likely to actually have an outright sale of some assets, whether it would be Wheatstone or maybe some of your conventional, all assets in Australia and that might be a source of funds to get that debt back down or alternatively if you're comfortable with debt in that $10 million to $11 million range going forward? Steve Farris : Well, I think the absolute debt is not as important as what we consider what our debt structure should be overall. In terms of our debt going up a little bit this year, I mean, this quarter, I think Gary has pointed out and I think, I pointed out earlier. We made some strategic buys of undeveloped acreage and what you\u2019re seeing is you got a timing difference between we\u2019re selling non-core assets, which should come in the fourth quarter. And the acreage acquisitions that we\u2019ve seen in the third quarter, so those two should balance out over the year. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Michael Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors : Thanks. Well, one of my have been addressed. I guess, just one on East Texas, I\u2019m just curious on those wells and maybe, I might have to wait but I figure I\u2019ll ask. What the hydrocarbon splits look like on those wells, on average and then maybe high and low case splits? John Christmann : I mean, we\u2019ll get into that in detail when we -- we\u2019ll show some data on November 20th but they really -- I mean, we mentioned the first couple pads have come on in the Reveille of average 690 Boes a day and that\u2019s in a lower GOR area. One thing across our acreage that GOR does move, so it just depends on the area but we\u2019ll go through that in detail on November 20th. Michael Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors : Okay. Steve. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers Investment Research. Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research : Good afternoon. A little while go you called out the Montney and the Duvernay, but I found it interesting that you have three rigs devoted to the Bluesky formations in the Kaybob. And could you provide a little color here? Is it vertical or is it horizontal, is it developmental or expiration? Why is Bluesky attracting this rig? John Christmann : Jeff, they\u2019re just economics, they\u2019re good wells, they are all horizontals and the economics are fantastic on them. So we can get the rigs in there and we\u2019ve got three elements there. They\u2019re cheaper, they are not as expensive and they help the program so. But the economics are very compelling. Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research : Okay. Kind of staying on this sort of theme. We\u2019ve had earlier discussions of the pan shale as more of a standalone horizontal target. But this quarter you showed us three highlight vertical wells that featured the 10 combination with the Strawn and the Wolfcamp. Were these expirations wells preparing for later horizontal drilling, or does this vertical drilling have legs of its own? John Christmann : No, that\u2019s another area. I mean, you\u2019ve got to look across the counties and we\u2019ve got some areas where we are drilling horizontally in the Pan and the Strawn and we will show little bit of that on November 20th. In this particular area, we highlighted some wells that are North of Odessa and the [Gustav Bay] (ph) area and some vertical wells that we can stack those and they are also very compelling. We saw fantastic rates from those so. It shows you the variety in the Permian and you\u2019ve got lots of zones, lots of area and different plays but they are very economic. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis of Capital One. Richard Tullis - Capital One : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Steve, I don\u2019t think this area has been touched on. How does the remaining Gulf of Mexico shelf assets fit into your strategy going forward in this lower oil price environment. I know in the past you\u2019ve mentioned that you expect it to perhaps begin drilling some of the deeper shelf targets in 2015? Steve Farris : Yeah. Right now, we are building inventory. I might point for those listening we have --we kept half of the deep rights when we sold our shelf. And we have about 500 blocks of deep rights under our existing shelf acreage that we sold. And truthfully that\u2019s -- if we have a very good idea there, we\u2019ll fund it otherwise that we will continue to build inventory. Richard Tullis - Capital One : Okay. And just as a follow up, what sort of price is required to -- oil price to generate expectable rate of return in the shelf for the type of well as you anticipate drilling? Steve Farris : Actually the shelf rates of return are very, very strong. And especially if you are drilling them, the reason we kept the deep rights is we sold 700 platforms. And so most of the deep rights are in and around the existing infrastructure. So you time back quicker and you can get them on quicker. And you don\u2019t have the infrastructure cost that you do when you are under deepwater going out and doing expiration. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John Herrlin of Societe Generale. John Herrlin - Societe Generale : Yeah. Hi last one for me. With the ceiling test, how much of it was the unamortized deepwater cost and was that all a U.S. pull or was there some Canada in there as well? Anthony Lannie : It was about 50-50. And it was all in the U.S. John Herrlin - Societe Generale : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Leo Mariani with RBC. Leo Mariani - RBC: Hey, with respect to your 2015 budget, trying to get a sense of when we would get a look at that? And I guess would we get a sense of spending on November 20th in terms of your North American on throughput? Steve Farris : Yeah. We are going to roll out what our 2015 and then our forward plan is, what our outlook is over the next several years. And our capital budget for 2015 will be part of that. Leo Mariani - RBC: All right, that\u2019s helpful. And I guess just in terms of the international sales. I guess, it\u2019s an ongoing process here. Clearly, I guess, we are in position now where oil prices have come in. Just trying to gauge your apatite in terms of spinning things off versus sales here? Steve Farris : I think they are both viable. I will tell you the one thing we\u2019ve said and I think we\u2019ve constantly done, we are not going to sell something just to get rid of it. And ultimately the separation will partly be, I am sure a span of some of our assets. Operator : And we have no further question in queue at this time. Gary Clark : That concludes the call. Thank you all for joining us and we\u2019ll talk to you on November 20th. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the 2014 Fourth Quarter and Year-End Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Gary T. Clark: Great. Thank you, Kelly. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us for Apache Corporations fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today\u2019s call will be Apache CEO and President, John Christmann; and Interim CFO, Anthony Lannie. Also joining us in the room are Tom Voytovich, Executive Vice President and COO of International and Steve Riney, who will officially take over as Apache's new CFO later this month. We are delighted to have Steve on Board and look forward to hearing from him on next quarter\u2019s conference call. In conjunction with this morning\u2019s press release I hope you've had the opportunity to review our quarterly earnings supplement which summarizes our operational activities and well highlights across various Apache operating regions. The supplement also includes information on our capital expenditures for the quarter, as well as a chart that illustrates cash sources and uses and reconciles Apache's change in net debt during 2014. Our earnings release, the accompanying financial tables and non-GAAP reconciliations and our quarterly earnings supplement can all be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com. I'd like to remind everybody that today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discussed today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. This morning we reported a fourth quarter 2014 loss of $4.8 billion or $12.78 per diluted share. These results contain several non-cash charges primarily related to the impact of declining oil and gas prices, acreage impairments, the announced disposition of our LNG assets and changes in foreign tax estimates and assumptions. Adjusted earnings, which excludes certain items that impact the comparability of results totaled $404 million or $1.07 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital totaled $2.1 billion during the quarter. Worldwide reported net production averaged 673,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with liquids production constituting 62% of that total. On a pro forma basis, which excludes assets that have been divested, non-controlling interests, and tax barrels in Egypt, our fourth quarter worldwide production was 609,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This represents an 8% increase from the third quarter and a 12% increase from the same period a year ago. I would now like to turn the call over to John Christmann. John J. Christmann: Thank you, Gary. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I would like to start by saying a few words about our long-time Chairman, CEO and President, Steve Farris. Steve announced last month that he would be retiring from Apache following more than two decades of leadership. During his tenure he helped grow the Company to one of the largest and most successful independents in the world. I would like to personally thank Steve for his service and am honored to be his successor as the new CEO and President of Apache. In 2010, Steve initiated a strategic repositioning to bring Apache's primary focus back to North America. As we showed you at our November North American update, 2014 was a milestone year for this transformation. We streamlined and enhanced our North American portfolio and we added significant new unconventional capabilities. We now have a deeper and more predictable inventory of economic locations in North America than at any time in Apache's history. Our drilling production and inventory is oil prone and located in areas with multiple stack pay horizons, which we believe creates a significant long-term competitive advantage. We have the right teams, processes, and science in place to efficiently develop our existing Resource and to build future opportunities. In response to the rapid drop in oil price, we have purposely taken quick and decisive action to reduce our drilling activity, well costs, G&A and lease operating expenses. This will position us more favorably and make us a more efficient Operator in the future. A top strategic priority for Apache during 2014 was to sell our Wheatstone and Kitimat LNG assets. I am pleased to note that the sale of these assets, which we announced in December is on track to close by the end of the first quarter. Including capital cost reimbursement, estimated proceeds from this transaction will be approximately $3.7 billion, which we will use initially to pay down debt. Our operations in Egypt and the North Sea provide a very nice complement to our North American production and cash flow. Cash flow from Egypt and the North Sea has less than 50% of the downside sensitivity to oil prices as our North American operations. Importantly, both regions are still expected to generate free cash flow in 2015 at current strip pricing. Apache\u2019s Egypt and North Sea operations offer steady, high rate of return projects, and the portfolio diversification benefits of these regions becomes evident during oil price downturns like the one we are currently experiencing. While we always leave open the option to adjust any part of our portfolio in response to changing conditions, we are not currently proceeding with a sale or spinoff of Egypt or the North Sea. With regard to Australia, we are taking a close look at the potential monetization of our remaining non-LNG assets. The value of these assets is generally underpinned by long-term fixed price natural gas contracts, which we believe increases the universe of buyers and the potential valuation, even in this depressed oil price environment. In summary, our portfolio is well positioned to weather the low oil price storm and I'm excited to have the opportunity set that lies before us today. Before we go to the fourth quarter results and outlook for 2015, I'll make a few comments about oil prices and the actions we have taken thus far in this fast moving price environment. We cannot predict nor control the length or depth of this oil price correction, or the timing and extent of the rebound. We have therefore acted quickly and decisively regarding the things we can control. Our activity levels and cost structure. During the third quarter of 2014, we operated 91 rigs onshore in North America. By the end of this month, we will have reduced our rig count to 27. On the pressure pumping side our frac crews are down more than 50% over the same time frame. In some instances we are choosing to lay down rigs that were under longer-term contract at day rates reflective of $100 oil price environment. As a result, we expect to pay some modest early termination penalties totaling approximately $50 million. We are also delaying the completion of some wells in backlog until pressure pumping costs reset to levels that better reflect the current commodity price environment. Corporate cash flow is the main constraint on our 2015 drilling plans. We would consider using our balance sheet only to capitalize on lower acreage costs and other potential opportunities that may occur, rather than to drill wells and chase production in a depressed and volatile oil price environment. Importantly, once we achieve the full benefit of lower well costs, our returns will be competitive at $50 per barrel of oil to those represented in our November North American update at $80 per barrel. The key difference is that we will simply have less cash flow to work with and will accordingly drill fewer wells. Additionally, we are diligently working through a dynamic scenario planning process that will allow us to quickly adapt our business and activity levels under a variety of potential commodity price case scenarios. During the robust and relatively stable oil price environment over the last four years Apache was one of the most active drillers in North America. We grew our Permian Basin production by more total barrels at a faster rate than any of our peers. I\u2019m highly confident that when oil prices begin to recover and stabilize at higher levels we will efficiently ramp up our drilling programs in the Permian, Eagle Ford and Canyon Lime to deliver top-tier production and cash flow growth. The recent oil price decline has been dramatic and almost unprecedented, but we believe that it will create a once in a decade opportunity for those of us that have moved aggressively. For Apache the oil price drop and subsequent industry slowdown has several positive aspects that we believe enhanced our ability to generate strong long-term shareholder returns. The slowdown provides an opportunity for us to be come a more efficient company through focused initiatives such as realigning our North American incentive program to reward continuous improvement and cost discipline, creating medium and longer term field development plans and high grading and improving our drilling inventory, rationalizing and consolidating our acreage position, leveraging our surface operations infrastructure and scale, adding key acreage while there is less competition and at lower prices, and reducing our North American base production decline. Regardless of how long oil prices remain depressed we plan to emerge in this downturn as a top-tier resource company in terms of drilling inventory, operational efficiency, cost structure and balance sheet strength. Now let's talk about Apache\u2019s full-year 2014 results. Worldwide production on a pro forma basis grew 6.5% in 2014 which was right in the middle of our 5% to 8% guidance range. Absent some timing delays on the startup of our two large offshore Australian oil projects worldwide production would have been at the high end of our guidance range for 2014. Onshore North American liquids production grew 18.6%which exceeded the high end of our 15% to 18% guidance range provided back in February of 2014. This strong performance was possible, because our high quality extensive drilling inventory in the Permian region enabled us to accelerate activity levels and production while at the same time we were seeing slower than expected growth and were recalibrating our capital program in the central region. As a result North American liquids growth was driven by the Permian where production increased 25% from the prior year or approximately double the midpoint of the guidance we provided back in February. In the central region growth was essentially flat for the year, but despite a difficult first half played by weather and operational problems we were able to reduce our drilling programs significantly in the second half of the year while maintaining steady to slightly increasing production. The North Sea and Egypt were ahead of plan, while Australia was a little behind plan due to timing delays Balnaves and Coniston oil projects. It was a good year for us internationally and we generated very strong free cash flow ex LNG spending. Turning to our 2015 capital budget and production outlook, based on the midpoint of our capital guidance range we anticipate spending a total of $3.8 billion in 2015, which excludes potential lease hold purchases or acquisitions. Compared to 2014, this represents a 60% decrease in our capital spending. We expect our pro forma onshore North American production to be roughly flat and our pro forma international and offshore production to be slightly up in 2015. Our Companywide 2015 pro forma production should be relatively unchanged from 2014. We believe this is a pretty good outcome given the extent we are reducing the capital program. Turning to the fourth quarter regional review and our planned activity levels for 2015. I was very pleased our drilling results across the entire company. We had success in every region during the fourth quarter. Onshore North America delivered liquids production growth of 5% sequentially and 20% year-over-year when adjusted for asset divestitures. The Permian was once again our biggest growth driver and we exited the year with record production. We ran 42 rigs during the fourth quarter and we expect to have this down approximately 15 by the end of the month. In 2015, we plan to average 10 to 12 rigs in the Permian approximately five of which will be in the Midland Basin, four in the Delaware Basin, and two rigs will be drilling high rate of return vertical and horizontal wells on the Central Basin platform in Northwest Shelf. In the Central Region net production grew 3% sequentially during the quarter as we completed 72 gross wells in various legacy Anadarko Basin formations. You can see the results from some of these wells in our quarterly supplement where we highlight a few key contributors from the Granite Wash, Cottage Grove and Cleveland and Lower Marmaton. As a result of taking a more measured approach in these legacy plays, we are seeing better-than-average well performance, better returns, and much better capital efficiency. During most of 2015, we plan to keep one rig running in the Anadarko Basin. In the Canyon Lime, no new wells were brought online during the fourth quarter; however we just started to flow back our first four well pad in the Canyon Lime and will have some flow rates to report there in the near future. In the Eagle Ford, our rig count peaked at 12 in December and by end of this month will be down to four. By mid-year we plan to have one to two rigs working in the Eagle Ford and are prepared to ramp back up quickly if oil prices allow. The Eagle Ford is an excellent example of our cost initiatives driving positive returns in this depressed price environment. Our initial wells in Area B of the play were running in excess of $8 million. If you'll recall back in our November North American update, we projected 2015 well costs would average around $7 million. With lower service costs and further design improvements, we think we'll have these wells down closer to $6 million within a few months, which depending on their oil cut, they can deliver solid economics and strip prices. In Area A, where we should generally have better economics, we have a backlog of 20 or so wells that we will be bringing on over the course of the year. Apache is progressing its understanding of the Eagle Ford petroleum system and will update you later this year as we gather more data. We plan to continue consolidating acreage around our core position. To sum it up, we're drilling better wells at lower cost and continue to expand our understanding of this compelling play. In Canada, we are finishing up a three-rig drilling program in the Duverney and Montney plays this spring and will release the rigs for the remainder of the year. We plan to complete a seven-well pad in the Duverney in the third quarter and in the Montney we continue to develop a long term solution to process future Montney gas production. We are making progress reducing drilling and completion costs in Canada. Canadian production averaged 72,300 BOEs a day during the fourth quarter, which is a decrease of 1% sequentially from the third quarter. Given minimal planned activity during 2015, we anticipate that production will decline from fourth quarter levels. Turning to our international operations, all three of our regions, the North Sea, Egypt and Australia, delivered profitable production growth and remain on track to generate significant free cash flow for the year. In Egypt, we made two oil discoveries during the quarter. While additional appraisal work is under way, the Ptah and Berenice field discoveries appear to be two of Apache's largest oil field discoveries in Egypt over the last 15 years. On a gross basis we expect Egypt will decline modestly in 2015, but our cost recovery mechanism there will result in a fairly significant increase in our net barrels. In the North Sea we delivered the strongest production numbers in the history of the region with a great rebound from the third quarter turnaround season. Coming off this high watermark and given the significant reduction in capital investments, we are starting to see natural declines kick in. With the program we have planned we do expect North see will decline slightly in 2015 beginning in the first quarter. Lastly in Australia, we continue to make progress towards first oil at Coniston, which is expected to be online mid year. I would now like to turn the call over to our interim CFO, Anthony Lannie, who will discuss in further detail our fourth-quarter non-cash earnings charges and provide guidance around first quarter 2015 North American production and CapEx. P. Anthony Lannie : Thank you, John, and good afternoon. I would like to begin by providing some detail around our fourth quarter non-cash charges. As noted in this morning's press release, we reported an after-tax loss of $4.8 billion or $12.78 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014 as a result of several key non-recurring items. We incurred $2 billion in after-tax non- cash property write-downs related to full-cost ceiling impairments in the U.S. and North Sea. Under full-cost accounting we are required to use trailing 12 month oil prices to calculate the PV-10 value of our reserves each quarter. Approximately half of the charges associated with the Company's full-cost ceiling test were driven by an impairment of acreage that we do not intend to drill. We recorded a $1.3 billion impairment of goodwill in the fourth quarter related to our U.S., North Sea and Canada reporting units. This is a function of prior-year acquisition values being valued under today's lower commodity price deck. If oil prices do not recover materially from the current futures market price indication, the Company expects further impairments of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties throughout the remainder of 2015. The Company does not, however anticipate significant additional acreage or goodwill impairments in 2015. In December 2014, we announced the sale of Apache's interest in the Kitimat and Wheatstone LNG projects along with associated upstream oil and gas assets, to Woodside Petroleum for $2.75 billion plus recovery of Apache's net expenditures made between June 30, 2014 and closing. Assets associated with the sale of our LNG facilities are classified as held-for-sale on the balance sheet. Accounting rules require us to evaluate assets held-for-sale for impairment. Accordingly an impairment analysis was performed on these assets and an after-tax loss of $753 million was recognized in earnings. The full-cost upstream assets associated with this sale are excluded from held-for-sale accounting and no impairment was recorded, however. We do expect a non-cash charge upon closing of the sale. Lastly, we incurred approximately $1 billion in non-cash deferred tax adjustments for the fourth quarter, primarily related to the U.S. GAAP rules pertaining to the measurement of income taxes on undistributed earnings in our international regions that we no longer consider to be permanently reinvested. The announced sale of our interest in the Kitimat and Wheatstone LNG projects and associated upstream assets was a key step in refocusing our portfolio and giving us more flexibility with capital allocation. Additionally, during 2014 we completed the sale of our Argentina region, our deepwater Gulf of Mexico interest and several non-core assets across North America. In total for the year, we completed or announced sales of approximately $7 billion of assets worldwide, we intend to use the proceeds of the remaining sales to pay down debt and strengthen our balance sheet in this low price environment. I would like to leave you with some guidance for our North American onshore operations in the 2015 first quarter. We currently project that quarter one North America onshore production will average between 300,000 and 305,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day which is down slightly from our record fourth quarter 2014 levels when adjusted for asset sales. This slight decrease is attributable to the plan deferral of completions which John spoke about earlier couple with the impact of severe weather conditions during January. In the Permian region alone we experienced abnormal weather related down time of approximately 14-days in the first half of January. The estimated impact of this down time when spread across the quarter is roughly 3700 barrels of oil per day. From a CapEx standpoint, we anticipate spending roughly $800 million in onshore North America during the first quarter which represent approximately 36% of our full year onshore North America budget. I should also note that our first quarter and full-year 2015 capital budget excludes approximately $300 million of estimated spending for LNG which we anticipate being reimbursed upon closing of the LNG sales this quarter. Our financial strategy for 2015 is to maintain a strong balance sheet and live within our cash flow in order to take advantage of opportunities quickly and efficiently once prices begin to recover. I will now turn the call back over to the operator for question-and-answers. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David R. Tameron of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. David R. Tameron: Hi, good morning. John, can you talk about \u2013 when we start thinking about the rig efficiency, obviously I know you\u2019re going to say everything you drill is good but some has got to be better than the others. So when I start thinking about productivity per rig and those type of metrics, what type of up lift do you think you'll see on the scale back? John J. Christmann: Well I mean it\u2019s hard to put the percentage as an actual percentage, but clearly about slowing down on high grading, we will focus on our best wells, additionally we're going to be drilling wells, only wells that we really need to drill right now and the nice thing is a lot of our acreage is held, we don\u2019t have lease obligations we're worried about. So it\u2019s all about reducing the cost structure and improving the economics before we really speed up, but there is going to be efficiencies dialed in, I think that kind of goes into what the capital reduction that we've shown and where we are given guidance on the production levels. David R. Tameron: Okay, one more for me and I'll let somebody else jump on. When I start thinking about the toggle and what you guys are looking for mid year, obviously you want service cost reductions. And you mentioned this, you alluded to this that your 2015 is more captive, your capital program is more constrained by your cash flow. What should we look for? What metrics should we be looking for on our end to try to guess when and if you decide to ramp? John J. Christmann: Well, I mean the easy thing is we'll signal because we'll pick up rigs when we start to ramp, so but I mean there\u2019s two things. There\u2019s two parts that equation, one is a commodity price, but the bigger deal right now is cost structure and we made the decision to consciously and aggressively drop rigs, because the cost structure needs to come down for this price environment and we can always ramp back up, I mean you look at our depth of our portfolio in the Permian we showed we delivered 25% year-over-year growth, we got very, very deep high graded inventory. So it\u2019s going to easy to scale up, but the big deal as we've got to drive the cost structure down to reflect this current price environment. David R. Tameron: Okay, thank you. I'll let somebody else jump on. I appreciate it. John J. Christmann: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond of Simmons & Company. Your line is open. Pearce W. Hammond: Good afternoon, guys. John J. Christmann: Hello. Pearce W. Hammond: Hey, John, I was curious how you can reduce your North American rig count so sharply, yet keep production flat. Touching on the earlier question, is this due to greater efficiencies or well productivity? Or is it a backlog of drilled but not completed wells that you can work through this year? And then, if you stayed at an average of 17 rigs into 2016, do you think you'd keep production flat there? Or would it start to decline? John J. Christmann: Well, I mean clearly we are able to drop quickly because we did not have a lot of committed contract or required location we had to drill. So we are able to scale back very quickly. We will come into 15 with a pretty deep backlog of wells and we have pushed a lot of those completions back, because quite honestly, we've got to get the completion cost to come in line as well. So we are going to very methodically push those back. If I can defer those, see the benefits of lower completion costs and then bring those back on and potential higher price environment and later there is a big win there. As for what 16 looks like a lot of that\u2019s going to depend on where we are mid-year and what the program does. So we\u2019ve got the benefit this year of having a backlog of completions and we can spread those out and it's kind of how we planned it. Pearce W. Hammond: And then, John, I know this question I'm about to ask is tied into what the cost structure is, but at what oil price would you be willing to accelerate the drill bit again? John J. Christmann: Right now, the wells we're drilling are economic because we've been aggressively attacking the cost structure. As I mentioned in the script, our limitation is cash flow and we're wanting to put it, our cash flow to work in the best places, we don't feel right now that tapping the balance sheet to drill wells that we don't have to drill in this price environment or cost structure makes sense, so I think we've got a deep inventory and when the economics and more cash becomes available we will ramp back up. Pearce W. Hammond: Great, and one last quick one for me. What level of service cost concessions are you currently experiencing? And how much do you think you can capture this year on a percentage basis? John J. Christmann: I mean I'd say in general, if you look at our Eagle Ford and I alluded to that in the script, we showed cost in our November update of around $7 million, we're early last year we were North of eight, I can tell you we\u2019ve already reflective of old service costs, we just TD'd a well in the 6.5 range. We feel like we can get those well under six so we're already down 10% to 15%. We got now some things dialing in that's going to help our numbers go further, so with the drop in oil price being where it is I know a lot of our competitors are talking about just seeing 10% well cost reductions that's going to have to be more than that. We're seeing more than that. Pearce W. Hammond: Thank you, very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Arun Jayaram : Good afternoon, John. I first wanted to ask you a little bit about the shape of the production profile in 2015. I guess you guided to 300,000 to 305,000 BOE. That suggests you'll stay relatively flat all year. Is that how we should think about it? Because what we don't know is how you plan to time the completions throughout the year? John J. Christmann: Yes, Arun, with where Anthony alluded to first quarter being and where we\u2019re going to exit where we average it's pretty good assumption on how we are got it dialed in right now. Obviously first quarter is being impacted by the significant down time we've had already. First two weeks of January were very rough in the Permian and central so that's part of why you see more of a flat look because we've had a lot of down time early but we do have a lot of completions that we'll be able to bring on and obviously drilling better wells with the rigs we\u2019re going to be running too so I think that's probably a pretty reasonable view of how we\u2019d look at right now. Arun Jayaram : Okay, the only thing that wasn't quite intuitive, you guys talked about spending $800 million in Q1 which is about 36% of your budget yet you're deferring completions, could you just maybe reconcile that a little bit, the timing of the spend? P. Anthony Lannie : Sure. It's just simply we're coming in hot, plus we've got the LNG spend too that when that closes so you've got a combination, but you don't go from running 90 rigs to down to levels we're going to be and not have a hot spend early. Arun Jayaram : Makes sense. Just a couple other quick ones. John, you alluded to $800 million of acreage acquisition costs in Q4. Can you give us some details on where you added the acreage? John J. Christmann: We touched on that in November. I mean it was predominantly in our key areas. A lot of that was Eagle Ford and Canyon Lime and Permian and really within our core areas. Arun Jayaram : Okay, and then my final one is on the international. In the slides, when you do the pro forma adjustment, you talk about the Australia asset sales and North Sea. I believe Australia's Balnaves. Can you give us some numbers around the magnitude of the sales at Balnaves and in the North Sea? John J. Christmann: Well, I let Gary answer that one, Arun. Gary T. Clark: Arun, we can say that the Scott, Telford and the Balnaves you are going to be in the 10,000 sort of type barrel range. Arun Jayaram : Okay, thanks a lot Gary. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett of Bernstein. Your line is open. Bob Brackett : Hey, question on the status of the split of the international assets. Is that on ice in a low-price environment? Is that still something that's a strategic priority? John J. Christmann: Right now in this price environment a lot changes a $100 price environment to $50, so right now as I stated in the prepared comments, we are not proceeding with anything on the spinoff of Egypt or North Sea. We are looking at possibly still monetizing or the non-LNG assets of Australia, but at this point in this price environment I think you're seeing strength of our international assets complement our North American portfolio. Bob Brackett : And can you talk about where your hedges stand for 2015 now, and what your hedging strategy this year and next might be? John J. Christmann: Right now, we\u2019ve got very little hedges 415 and that is one of the things we're going to be looking at is was what type we've gone through a major transformation as we started thinking about 15 the world changed and that's something we'll be looking at early part of this year is what type of hedging strategy we would use in the future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rowe from TPH. Your line is open. Michael J. Rowe: Hi, good afternoon. I was wondering if you could maybe provide a little bit of context around your backlog at the end of the year, of your $2.2 billion mid-point budget for North America onshore. How much of that is actually just blowing through and completing drilled but uncompleted wells versus actually going and drilling new wells to add to the production base? John J. Christmann: Well I\u2019ll say we haven\u2019t provided a lot of color there, we are coming into the year with a couple of harder wells, so it is a portion of that budget, but we are going spread it out over the year. Michael J. Rowe: Okay, that's fine. And then, switching to one specific region, the Eagle Ford, that has a pretty sharp rig count drop down to about one maybe two rigs in 2015. You mentioned getting the cost structure down to $6 million per well, so what exactly needs to happen to get there to make that asset more competitive? And if we see a rebound in crude oil prices, do you expect that cost structure to come back up? How should we think about that specific asset and the drilling economics there? John J. Christmann: Well the answer there is when you look at our cash flow, still the lion share of our capital is going to go into our bread and butter Permian which has been driving our performance. So we're going to be down to one rig - one to two rigs in Eagle Ford, one to two rigs in the Canyon Lime, those are both areas where we are advancing deep inventory of economic wells, but in terms of how they stack out right now, the Delaware Basin and so our step in the Permian is going to little bit slightly higher, but I do not see some of the efficiencies we are driving into those well costs, a lot of those are utilizing 3D avoiding drilling hazards or efficiency, there is more to this than just service cost. So I don\u2019t envision any of those coming back in even if prices rebound. So that\u2019s the nice thing about slowing down is this is going to really give us a chance to when we speed back up to do it a lot more efficiently in a lot better later, because a lot of the changes are not just come out of service side, they are out of our end and designs and other efficiencies. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani of RBC. Your line is open. Leo Mariani : Hey guys, I was hoping you could speak a little bit about the improvement you saw in results in the Central Basin, particularly some of these Lower Marmaton wells looked really massive. Could you speak a little about to some of the well costs you're seeing in Central? I know it's a bit different by some of these formations and where you're going to be targeting most of the capital in 2015 there? John J. Christmann: Well we are really going to have one rig around it, so what we\u2019ve shown though is by taking a very measured and disciplined approach which we made a lot of operational changes you know management changes last summer in Tulsa, and you're seeing fruit of that really start to come through. It's more conventional reservoirs. We've got to do more homework up front. It shows the depth and quality of the acreage up there but really when you look at this year it will be a very small program just based on the commodity mix and so forth. Leo Mariani : Okay, so is there any particular zone that you guys focus on? Or is it still multiple horizons in terms of how you tackle this? John J. Christmann: It will high graded list of all wells there, so we do have a couple hundred acres in the Woodford that will be active there, about 50,000 net in the ops report, there will be lower Marmaton and then we got some nice Cottage Grove and Cleveland and big kind of small assortment of all the best projects we have from all those formations. Leo Mariani : Okay, that's helpful. And in terms of your guidance here for the first quarter in North America, your 300,000 to 305,000 BOE, does that exclude production that you're selling as part of the LNG divestiture? Some of the Kitimat properties? Or is that included in those numbers? And are those going to be discontinued or how does that work? John J. Christmann: There is actually with what\u2019s being sold with Kitimat there's not any production would be dialed into those numbers. So that is an adjusted number that you would expect to see from us post sales. Operator : Your next question come from the line of Harry Mateer of Barclays. Your line is open. Harry Mateer : Hi, good afternoon. The first question, so you've mentioned that you plan to initially use asset sale proceeds to pay down debt. First, can you just tell us how much CP and/or credit facility borrowings you had at the end of the year? And then can you talk about how you plan to pay down the debt? Are you considering more liability management actions like you did in late 2013 to take out long term debt? Or are you just looking to take down short-term borrowings? John J. Christmann: I'll have Anthony answer that question. P. Anthony Lannie : Just short-term borrowing, but we had $11.2 billion of debt at the end of the year with $800,000 million of cash on the balance sheet for net debt position of 10.4. We\u2019ve increased our CP line of credit and $3 billion to $5 billion in December. So we have about almost $4 billion of available credit line. Harry Mateer : Okay, and then second, can you just update us on your balance sheet and credit rating priorities in general? So any sense for what credit ratings you're trying to target for Apache, given the current commodity price environment and your view that you're no longer looking to spin Egypt or North Sea? And are there any targeted leverage metrics we can be thinking about or what is the right debt balance for the company? P. Anthony Lannie : We are still working with the credit rating agencies on what our credit rating will be but we intend to pay down debt and have a very strong balance sheet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Freeman of Raymond James. Your line is open. John A. Freeman: Afternoon. I was looking at the rig count kind of break down if I wrote it down correctly, John, when you were going over the rigs in the Permian. And it looks like the Delaware Basin is about the only place in your whole portfolio where the rig count's not really changing from the November update. And obviously it makes sense, given at that time you all said that was the highest net present value per well. I'm just trying to get a sense of how you all think about the capital allocation, the Permian where trying to balance the fact the Delaware Basin is your highest NPV, but you're still running rigs in some of these other areas of the Permian. John J. Christmann: The issue there is you correctly picked up that rig count did not change and our governors in the Delaware right now are more driven by infrastructure, take away capacity in those things. So you are exactly right. That is not a piece, it is at the top of the food chain. And it didn\u2019t change. The others had to compete with the Permian and that's why when you look at we\u2019ve got the lion share of our capital there, so Permian still will be getting 60% of our total North American capital and which is about in line with what we showed at the November update. John A. Freeman: Okay and then last one for me, just thinking about these delayed completions, can you give just kind of a rough number on where your backlog of uncompleted wells stands in the Permian? John J. Christmann: We\u2019re kind of couple hundred total. Where the rig count's been, a lion's share of those would be in the Permian. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Sullivan of Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is open. James Sullivan : Hey good afternoon, guys. I wonder if you could just - we've been dancing around this a little bit - but just give us a Q4 fully-adjusted volume number. You guys gave the full-year number which is helpful for both international and North America. But just net of the LNG upstream, net of the North American packages, net of Australia and net of North Sea, that whole thing. Gary T. Clark: Yes, hey. This is Gary. We are looking at about 319,000 a day as your pro forma Q4 number in North America. And about 225 international and offshore. James Sullivan : Perfect, thank you very much for that. The other thing I had was, you guys gave some color which was a little bit distinct in your release, about completion costs. And it sounds like - you're the only guys that I've really heard saying that you're thinking about delaying completions, not just overall activity, into the second half of the year. With the thought, perhaps, that you'd capture a little bit more savings on the completion side, maybe. Could you speak to what you've seen in the market in terms of differential deflation rates on the drilling side, say the rig side and drilling versus fracking and completing the wells and whether that's driving your thinking? Or am I reading too much into your comments there? John J. Christmann: Well, I mean I think the simple answer is we need to get the costs down in line with the oil price environment and when you look at 60% to 65% of your total well cost is in the completions, a lot of folks were assuming you'd just move through the backlog and keep completing the wells, but I mean that's some of the best things we can do right now to push those back because up front, significant savings there lets us drill other wells, so we're seeing substantial numbers on both the rig rates and then with what we've done basically by setting down most of the rigs, we're able to come in now and contract what prices should be in a $50 price environment and the same thing applies on the frac crews. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin of Societe Generale. Your line is open. John P. Herrlin: Yes, thank you. John, since you've taken the helm, have you had any other leadership team changes other than the addition of Mr. Riney? John J. Christmann: At this point given where we are John, we are taking a hard look at everything. I\u2019ve taken a pretty measured approach of stepping in and had a lot of things to get knocked out off in early. I really want to think about what we have North America look like. I've got Tom in place on the international side and I'm going to take a very measured approach and think through what this thing ought to look like for the long-term and come out with something at a later day. John P. Herrlin: Okay, thanks. On a pro forma basis for the U.S., what's your average decline rate now? John J. Christmann: Right now if you look at our just in the U.S. our PDP decline is across all products. Oil is about 26%, our total streams around 24% in North America and that's just on a PDP basis. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Allman from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Joseph D. Allman: Thank you, operator. Hi, everybody. So just to recount in North America, what's that rig count in the fourth quarter of 2015? And then, I know you answered this a little bit earlier, but if it's as low as I think it is, I would assume that going into 2016 it's going to be hard to keep production flat. And do you exhaust the wells waiting on completion? Do you exhaust those by the end of 2015? John J. Christmann: All right. What I would say about that Joe is it will just depend on where we are and where prices are. I mean clearly if we are under $50 it will be lower than the average for the year considerably come in hot, but we are going to kind of let things dictate what we say going into the third and fourth quarter kind of based on where the market conditions are and also where the cost structure is. I mean that\u2019s the other piece, we get cost down we would be able to pick up too so. Joseph D. Allman: Okay, so second question, again, following up from the first. Do you exhaust the inventory of wells waiting on completion by year-end? And separate question, the $2 billion ceiling test write-down that you described, North Sea. You described US. You talked about some acreage that you're not going to drill. Could you give us more details on that please? John J. Christmann: Well in terms of completion backlog we\u2019ve got \u2013 that\u2019s kind of at our disposal as to when we would complete those wells and obviously if we're an under 50 and prices have come on down and we will probably get some of those on and may choose to wait and see an increase in price when we go ahead and complete some of those wells. For the write down of the charges, I\u2019m going to let Anthony handle that question. P. Anthony Lannie : Yes, we haven\u2019t provided any details in terms of split out between North America and North Sea at this point, but the total is $2 billion for the ceiling test and another $1.3 for the balance, for the impairment. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Doug Leggate : Thanks, good afternoon, John, and congratulations on your appointment. John, I wonder if I could ask you about the organizational capability from going from 80-plus rigs to 17 rigs. What does that do to you? If you were to look into being able to ramp that up again in the event of an oil price recovery, do you intend on keeping the organization static? Will you see some headcount reduction and cost reduction at the corporate level? Can you walk us through how you think about that and how patient you're prepared to be until the oil price recovers if you choose to do nothing? John J. Christmann: Well Doug we have been looking at G&A, looking at it pretty hard in terms of ways to reduce it, we did announce we had some reductions in January about 5% worldwide when you look at the numbers, clearly we had an organization in place its capable of running 90 plus rigs in North America which at this point its less than that. So we will continue to look at things, one thing we are doing is we're taking some of our young engineers and we are putting them in the field which is allowing us to replace some contract folks so we\u2019re being pretty smart about how to leverage folks, get some good experience and also puts us in a better position, in fact I have got a lot of good reports on the savings and some of the benefits that we\u2019re having about putting those guys out in the field. So we are going be pretty prudent, in terms of what we do we will continue to look at what is the best organization for North America in terms of where things are going and do not worry about being over ramp up, I mean its easy to ramp up after you\u2019ve been there before, I mean we\u2019ve got great capabilities in the Permian and our other regions and it will not be hard to ramp up. And in fact I\u2019ve got a lot of ways thankful because its gives us a chance to really look at our processes, our efficiencies, our inventory and really spend some time, high grading that and I will promise you will do it when we ramp up differently then would have been do it right now. Doug Leggate : I know it's not an easy question to answer, so I appreciate the answer. I wonder if for my follow-up if I can go back to Bob's question earlier about the international strategy. I really just want to get clarification on this because for the past year, I guess there's been an expectation that the international business would be spun off completely. Is this a temporary situation? Is it now strategic? Can you help us understand what has flipped the Board's view on this? Because clearly it's a massive turnaround to decide to keep it. And will it compete for capital? I'm just trying to understand is this now \u2013 does the new Apache this time include Egypt and North Sea as go-forward assets? Or is this a stay of execution? I'll leave it there. John J. Christmann: There\u2019s a couple things. One of our key strategic objectives was to sell the LNG and that will close in the end of the first quarter. Secondly, we are looking at our conventional business in Australia, Egypt in the North Sea are different businesses then what we are doing in North America, but the thing you are going to look as generate free cash flow they always have had higher rate of return projects which complement our portfolio and clearly in this price environment it would not make sense to monetize them and they complete things very nicely. So at this point, there is no plans to sell or spin and they fit nicely with the portfolio when we ramp back up we will grow North America at faster rate. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brian Singer : Thank you, good afternoon. Apache has a number of different opportunities within North America onshore to ramp up investment when the time is right. Based on what you're seeing now, what is the best way to do that? Do you see concentrating more in specific areas among the Delaware Basin versus Midland Basin versus East Texas, Eagle Ford to gain greater scale when you do want to ramp up and efficiencies? Or should we expect a gradual ramp up everywhere when the time is right? John J. Christmann: A lot of that's going to depend on a lot of the strategic testing and the things we're doing in these plays right now. We're learning things each day. We've got the rig we're running in the Eagle Ford will be telling us very critical things as well as the Canyon Lime as well as the Permian so the good news is we've got a deep inventory and I'm confident we're going to have plenty of economic projects. We've got more right now than cash flow to spend at these levels so a lot of that Brian will just depend on how we see each of those plays at that time. One place is one of the questions earlier we have not slowed down in the Delaware and we will continue to try to expand that and then I think we're going to be in a position to we've gone from 12 rigs down to, we will be at four and down to one to two in the Eagle Ford. We can ramp that back up very quickly. The Canyon Lime we can put up at five or six in there and the neat thing is we're high grading a lot of prospects and a lot of acreage and we'll have a lot of choices to choose from. Brian Singer : Thanks, and as my follow-up, and it actually follows up on a couple of questions earlier, and as well as your response here just now. You say you want your costs to come down, you want prices to go up. Your returns are strong from the portfolio today. But is what you're saying that every well that the 64 rigs you have dropped, or are planning to drop, achieve attractive returns at today's oil prices. But simply you've dropped them to stay within cash flow? Or are there areas where you need costs to come down to meet your return threshold? And if so, can you provide specifics? John J. Christmann: It's a combination. There are a lot of those projects on the lower end that need prices down to where we want to drill them right now. But I can tell you where we made the cut based on our current cash flow I have more capabilities right now of economic projects we were electing to defer because we don't have to drill them. I mean the point is why drill them in this price environment when things are going to improve? So it's a combination. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis from Capital One Securities. Your line is open. Richard Tullis : Thanks, good afternoon, everyone. John, following with the rate of return line there, so we saw the rates of return associated with your portfolio at the November meeting based on $80 oil, $4 gas. What do you think the impact is on the portfolio in general, using current commodities and the reductions you've seen in well costs to date? John J. Christmann: Well there's no doubt that they drop. You go from 80 and 4 and you go to 50, and call it 50 and 290, apples-to-apples they have dropped. Now we are working on the cost side and we still have very attractive returns in the place where we are active, so but there's no doubt right now, the returns are costs haven't come down to put the returns in line with what we showed you and $80 a barrel in November. Richard Tullis : Okay. And looking at the Eagle Ford A area, back in November it looked like you were going to be quite active there in 2015, running as many as 10 rigs with a fairly high rate of return. Why the significant change down to one rig now? And I'm not sure if that's going to be in the A or the B area? Has your thinking on that play changed any? Or is it more just a rate of return thing right now? John J. Christmann: It\u2019s neither its cash flow in the portfolio of what the dollar amount is so it's simply cash flow. We got more - there is lot\u2019s of wells we could drill in the Eagle Ford right now, but it\u2019s purely just a function of we aren't going to tap our balance sheet to develop production. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell from Tuohy Brothers Investment Research. Your line is open. Jeffrey L. Campbell: Hi, John. I'd like to second the congratulations on your new CEO role. First, I want to ask about Canada. I noticed you're going to stop drilling in March 2015. I just wondering will the completions be delayed there as you were talking about doing elsewhere? Because in November you made it clear this is an emergent play, so was just wondering if maybe the desire to see results would be a part of the calculus. John J. Christmann: Well, Jeff, thank you. Two things. Number one, we do have excellent results and high hopes for Canada, and but there's two things. Montney wells we are going to be completing. There are little more dashing than the Duverney, and the Duverney wells have great economics, we will be completing the - we got a seven well pad there it\u2019s testing two different spacings. We will be completing those in the third quarter of this year. It\u2019s simply a function of cash flow in Canada is limiting how much we're spending in Canada so that's why and obviously with the winter drilling season we've come in very hot in Canada and actually Canada is going to be a slight out spend versus cash flow. So it\u2019s purely same answer again. It\u2019s cash flow driven is what's causing us to do that and the good news is after these two wells we had to hold acreage in the Montney we don't have any acreage problems in Canada this fall. And obviously if prices change going in third or fourth quarter you could see us decide to step back up. But we will right now, the plan would be not to do anything. Jeffrey L. Campbell: Okay thanks and to ask a little bit different question. In Egypt we're reading a lot about the government trying to procure pipeline nat gas Israel as well as floating LNG. Is there any financial incentive to try to increase the natural gas production into the Egyptian market, because I notice your highlight wells are very high oil cuts. John J. Christmann: Yes, I\u2019m going to have Tom handle this one. Thomas E. Voytovich: The answer is that the Egyption government has kept the gas price artificially low for 12 to 13 years now, 14 years and there is no indication that they have the willingness or desire to increase the domestic production gas price and as such, we continue to focus on oil and drill sufficient gas wells to keep our infrastructure full primarily by focusing on higher condensate yield reservoirs so that we could also increase liquids productions at the same time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hall from Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is open. Michael A. Hall: Thanks, appreciate the questions. I guess you provided the rig counts going forward for 2015. Maybe circling around this weighted uncompletion question in a little different way. How many wells do you anticipate to put on production regionally in 2015? And then how much of the, you said 200 or so in backlog, so I'm just trying to think through the organic program underlying that is... John J. Christmann: Yes I would \u2013 we have not disclosed the well counts in terms of lay that much detail out in terms of the plan. We kind of hit on rigs and we have a couple hundred wells in addition to those and I mean, if we want to get back with them later Gary or something on details. Gary T. Clark: Yes Michael, we can follow-up with you there, but we really haven\u2019t kind of put anything out there on the specific well counts you know I just... Michael A. Hall: Okay, but if -- relative to the Analyst Day in November, you cut the rigs probably 50% or more, or not quite. But is it fair to say then you're only taking the well count down by a quarter or so or is that simple math? John J. Christmann: You can do it, you can probably do the math on the rigs, but the other factor is there costs are coming down, so it\u2019s not straight linear math. Michael A. Hall: Fair enough. And then you provided the PDP declines, that's helpful. How did that vary regionally? John J. Christmann: That\u2019s another things, I don\u2019t have that detail for you. I\u2019m just giving you a general on North America. Michael A. Hall: That's fair and that's helpful. And then final one of mine, just housekeeping, on the budget for 2015, does that include capitalized interest? And if not, roughly do you all know what that might look like? John J. Christmann: It does. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Wolff from Jefferies. Your line is open. Jonathan D. Wolff: Afternoon, guys. I'm just looking at the numbers and intuitively spending about 36% of your budget in the first quarter and looking for exit rate that's similar. It just feels like there's a contemplated CapEx increase in here in the second half of the year, based on being able to achieve that type of momentum with the base decline rates that you've laid out. I'm just trying to get to the math. Is there a contemplated CapEx increase coming in May-June timeframe? John J. Christmann: Not in this budget at all. Jonathan D. Wolff: Can you give a little intuition on how you only have two-thirds of the budget left to spend in the last three quarters? It should be down dramatically in terms of the spending versus 2014. Is it a assumption that oil service costs are down 20%, 25%? Is it the expectation that oil prices are up $10? We're just having a hard time getting anywhere near the math on the domestic production. John J. Christmann: Well it works fine on our end. I mean basically it's a function of how we spread the completions out. We've come in hot. We've got with Canada having completed it, you're not going to be completing those Duvernay wells until the third quarter. The math works. It's just a function of we pushed a lot of completions back and we'll bring them on at the appropriate time. But there's nothing baked in beyond, there's no capital increase. There's no oil price increase, you know we wouldn't be very smart to do that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani from RBC. Your line is open. Leo Mariani : Hey guys, I just wanted to ask you a little about the M&A landscape. It sounds like in your prepared comments you spoke about rather buying acreage and maybe securing more assets as opposed to drilling. Can you talk about what you see out there that might be available? And what type of size of purchases are we talking about? John J. Christmann: I mean I think the point is we would be opportunistic. I mean we see a potentially if things stay where they are there's a lot of folks that are significantly out spending. There is a lot of clocks on acreage. We're seeing things pop-up right now and for drilling a well we can earn pretty big acreage blocks. I think there's just a lot of opportunity that could surface and we would expect to surface. Leo Mariani : All right. And moving over to your international guidance for 2015, you guys talked about 207,000 barrels a day, which I guess is after subtracting out final tax, working interest barrels and some tax barrels. Do you guys have that guidance numbers kind of prior to those subtractions? Because I know you guys reported that way in your financial just to keep it apples-to-apples for the financials? John J. Christmann: I\u2019ll let Gary. Gary T. Clark: I\u2019ll tell you what. Why don't we do this and follow-up because we've gone over the top of the hour. Why don\u2019t we follow-up with offline on those, on that reconciliation. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin from Societe Generale. Your line is open. John P. Herrlin: Yes, hi, just one quick follow-up. Obviously there's been a lot of questions regarding oil field services costs, completion costs, et cetera. On a going-forward basis, do you think the services providers will be more willing to index so you avoid kind of this boom-bust type pricing? Or will it just be business as always? John J. Christmann: John I mean that\u2019s one of the things we\u2019ve looked very heavily at and we think it makes a lot of sands and quite frankly we should have done it a while back. So we would like to think that you can do that. John P. Herrlin: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And your last question comes from the line of James Sullivan from Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is open. James Sullivan : Hey guys, thanks for running this call real quick, do a little follow-up. Can you guys talk a little bit about what you're doing in Central Oklahoma? You guys did put the Woodford wells up on the ops report, but are you guys targeting some of the multi-lateral areas there with the Springer and the Merrimac and other stuff? Just get a little detail on that. John J. Christmann: Yes, I mean as I mentioned we are going to have one rig pretty much dedicated. We will be drilling some Woodford wells. We've got about 200,000 acres gross 50,000 net so we will be active there with that and we\u2019ve also got some really look in economic prospects in some of our other plays. So its juts simply budgeting our capital there, but you will see some more Woodford wells from us. James Sullivan : Great, and just a quick follow-up to that. Is that one of the areas you guys talked in the leasehold work you've been doing. I think East Eagle Ford probably got some of that money and some of the other areas, but are you working there as well with the leasehold? John J. Christmann: We have been working to fill in and bolter on our position, but that\u2019s relevant for all of our key areas where we would be active drilling. End of Q& A Operator : This concludes today's Q&A session. I now turn the call back over the Mr. Clark. Gary T. Clark: Well thank you everybody for joining us and please follow-up with myself or my team in IR if we can handle any of the other details that we didn\u2019t get to on the call today and we look forward to speaking to you all next quarter. Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Fia and I will be the conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache Corporation First Quarter Earnings 2015 Conference. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gary Clark. Sir, you may begin. Gary T. Clark - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann; and CFO, Steve Riney. Also joining in the room today is Tom Voytovich, Executive Vice President and COO of International. In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our quarterly earnings supplement, which summarizes our operational activities and well highlights across various Apache operating regions. The supplement also includes information on our capital expenditures for the quarter, as well as a chart that illustrates cash sources and uses, and reconciles Apache's change in net debt during the first quarter of 2015. Our earnings release, the accompanying financial tables and non-GAAP reconciliations, and our quarterly earnings supplement can all be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com. I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. This morning, we reported a first quarter 2015 loss of $4.7 billion or $12.34 per diluted share, which includes an after-tax ceiling-test write down of $4.7 billion, primarily related to the impact of declining oil and gas prices. When adjusted for certain items that impact the comparability of results, the first-quarter loss totaled $139 million or $0.37 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital totaled $900 million during the quarter. Worldwide reported net production averaged 601,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with liquids production constituting 62% of the total. I would now like to turn the call over to John. John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Gary. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a successful first quarter on several fronts. Operationally, we executed a very rapid and efficient downsizing of our drilling program. On a go-forward basis, our reduced program better aligns capital expenditures with cash flow in this depressed oil and gas price environment. Specifically, we decreased our North American rig count by 77%, from 65 rigs on December 31 to 15 rigs by the end of the first quarter. We are highly focused on reducing all elements of our cost structure. On the capital side, we were fortunate to enter this downturn with minimal long-term rig contracts and very few acreage exploration issues. As a result, we were able to quickly adjust our costs, and now project that total drilling and completion costs will ultimately be down between 20% and 40% in 2015 from the levels we disclosed for our key plays at our North American update in November. And compared to 2014, we are on track to achieve an overall 25% reduction in average drilling and completion costs. As the year progresses, we anticipate capturing potentially more savings. With regard to G&A, over the past 18 months Apache has divested a substantial number of operated properties and exited several operational areas. Our smaller footprint now requires less overhead and a more prudent approach to spending. Every dollar we save in corporate overhead can be recycled into our asset base to generate a return for our shareholders. We are structuring Apache's organization, planning functions and operational teams to provide maximum flexibility to respond to commodity price changes and cash flow availability. We have budgeted conservatively at $50 WTI for the year. And while first quarter oil prices came in a little below that level, the second quarter is off to a good start. Should oil prices stabilize at these higher levels and cash flow increase accordingly, we are well-positioned to ramp up the drilling program in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Despite a significant reduction in drilling and completion activity, we were able to minimize our first quarter production decline in North America from record fourth quarter levels. We also encountered some significant weather challenges in our Permian and Central regions during the quarter. However, North American onshore production still exceeded the high end of our guidance range. On the international side, Egypt and the North Sea both outperformed our expectations during the quarter, primarily on the strength of successful delineation drilling and better than expected well performance. Australian operations were generally on track in Q1. However, production was adversely impacted by two cyclones that hit late in the quarter. Turning to our capital spending; during the quarter, capital expenditures before LNG, capitalized interest and Egypt's minority interest was $1.3 billion. This represents approximately 36% of our full-year 2015 capital budget, the midpoint of which has been reduced to $3.65 billion. CapEx was in line with our expectations for the quarter and consistent with our commentary on last quarter's call that we were coming into 2015 hot on activity and capital. Given the magnitude and success of our first quarter activity and spending ramp down, we remain confident in our 2015 CapEx guidance. Also, despite our significantly lower activity levels for the rest of the year, we remain comfortable with our pro forma North American onshore production guidance of relatively flat compared to 2014. In summary, it was a very good quarter both domestically and internationally. And I'll provide a little more detail on the regions in a moment. Since the last earnings call, we have made excellent progress on our portfolio repositioning initiatives. In April, we announced the closing of our Wheatstone and Kitimat LNG assets along with a definitive agreement to sell the remainder of our Australian oil and gas assets. We expect to close the Australian asset sale around mid-year and our updated capital and production guidance provided in this morning's press release takes into account this assumption. In his prepared remarks, Steve Riney will discuss how we plan to utilize the $5.8 billion of proceeds from these transactions. I'd like to now make some comments about our operating regions and also provide some color on our projected year-end horizontal well backlog. As I noted earlier, we substantially reduced our drilling and completion activity during the first quarter. In North America, we completed 42% fewer total wells compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. More importantly, we deferred our scheduled horizontal completion count in anticipation of better pressure pumping pricing from our third-party vendors. For example, we completed only 84 operated horizontal wells in North America during the first quarter compared to 153 operated horizontals during the fourth quarter of 2014. Despite these activity reductions, our first quarter North American production averaged 307,000 BOEs per day and exceeded our guidance range of 300,000 BOEs per day to 305,000 BOEs per day. In our Permian region, production grew 6% compared to the first quarter of 2014, but decreased by roughly 10,000 BOEs per day or approximately 6% from record levels in the fourth quarter of 2014. The majority of this sequential quarterly decrease of approximately 7,800 BOEs per day is attributable to severe winter weather-related downturn. In fact, had we not encountered weather-related shut-ins during the quarter, our oil volumes in the Permian would have been roughly flat compared to the fourth quarter. Assuming no change from our currently budget activity levels, we anticipate the Permian oil production will increase gradually for the remainder of the year, while natural gas production should remain relatively flat. The Permian production increase in 2015 will be driven by the Delaware Basin, where we anticipate generating significant volume growth from 28 wells scheduled for completion in the second and the fourth quarter. Key Permian Basin well completions during the quarter included two very strong Delaware Basin horizontal wells; the Condor 205H and 206H in our Pecos Bend area and three solid horizontal wells with relatively short laterals at our Powell-Miller area of the Southern Midland Basin. On a lateral adjusted foot basis, all of these wells produced at 30-day average IP rates above the representative tight curves, which were presented at our November update. In particular, the Condor wells in Delaware Basin, which have been online for just over two months are substantially outperforming expectations. We look forward to drilling more wells in both of these areas during 2015 and reporting results in the coming quarters. We are making good progress in reducing drilling and completion costs, particularly in the Delaware Basin, where we plan to be the most active this year. The previously mentioned Condor wells were drilled and completed for around $6 million. This represents a 25% reduction from the $8 million well costs we provided in our November update. On the Central Basin Platform, we completed a large number of very economic vertical wells from our 2014 backlog and completed two exceptional horizontal wells in our North Monahans area that produced a 30-day average IPs in excess of 1,000 BOEs per day. In April, we completed our highest IP well ever in our Barnhart area, the Scott Sugg West Unit H11U, which is producing more than 1,000 BOEs per day. Also in April, we put on production our first four Midland County wells in the Wildfire area along with our first well in the Azalea area near the Midland-Glasscock County line. Early results from these core Midland County wells look very encouraging, and it's fair to say that this activity has positioned us well for a good start in the second quarter in the Permian. Turning to the Central region, production was down 2% sequentially from the fourth quarter after adjusting for asset sales. This was expected following our significant reduction in activity. During the first quarter, we completed only 24 gross operated wells compared to 51 gross operated wells during the fourth quarter. Apache's primary focuses today in the Central region are the Canyon Lime and the Woodford plays. The Canyon Lime is a tremendous source rock with significant oil in place, but due to the recent drop in oil prices, we have slowed our drilling pace and turned our attention to optimizing our approach and reducing costs in the area. We have made some significant breakthroughs on the cost side in the Canyon Lime. Drilling costs in our two most recent wells came in around $4.25 million. Completion costs on these well should be roughly $2.75 million each, which means that all in, we believe we can develop this play for about $7 million per well excluding facilities costs. This is also almost 20% lower than the $8.5 million well costs that we showed at our November update. We brought online our 93H pad during the first quarter and the flow back has been somewhat limited as a result of an extended third-party plant outage. Regardless, these wells appear to be tracking in line with their type curve. We have various tests underway in the Canyon Lime that will help optimize the play and prepare for future rig ramp up. Under the improved cost structure I noted above, our Canyon Lime inventory starts to become economic at around $60 or $65 per barrel, and we believe there is significant opportunity to improve the economics as we advance the play. That said, the Canyon Lime will still need to compete for capital on an NPV and rate of return basis with our other plays. To-date, we have drilled 14 wells in the lower Canyon Lime, 12 of which are online and producing. As of March 31, we had a backlog of four wells drilled but uncompleted in the play. In the Anadarko Basin, we are currently acquiring seismic and delineating roughly 50,000 net acres in the Woodford Springer play, also referred to industry as the SCOOP. We're currently drilling a two-well pad in Grady County and are planning to drill and complete a few additional Woodford wells later in the year. A tremendous amount of science and testing is also underway in our Eagle Ford play. To-date, we have drilled in four primary operating areas; Reveille, Ferguson Crossing, Remington and Brazos Riverside and have materially advanced our understanding of this intricate resource play. We have now drilled a total of 86 wells in the Eagle Ford, 45 of which are online and producing. Lithology and hydrocarbon phases change fairly significantly in Northern Eagle Ford. We're continuing to test optimal drilling and completion methods, frac designs and well spacing. Each of these inputs can vary materially depending on the hydrocarbon phase window and clay count of the area. In Area A, which is generally characterized by higher gas/oil ratios, the drilling is a bit more complex and expensive due to depletion in the chalk above the Eagle Ford. Our current drilling and completion cost target is around $6.5 million, which is down more than 20% from the $8.4 million we cited back in November. In Area B, which is a bit shallower, we estimate drilling and completion costs will be around $6 million per well, which is down roughly 15% from previous estimates. We have a large backlog of wells to complete in the Eagle Ford, and while we may not get to all of them this year, we can expect this play will contribute to our North American oil growth in 2015 and 2016. Like the Canyon Lime, we anticipate becoming a more active driller in the Eagle Ford when oil price approaches the $65 per barrel level. In Canada, we had a good quarter. Weather-related downtime was minimal, and production decreased only modestly from the fourth quarter 2014 levels, despite reduced completion activity. During the quarter, we generated positive results in a new lower-cost oil-rich area of the Montney, which we call Ante Creek. We have some running room there; however, more infrastructure will be needed to bring these wells online. We also successfully tested the very thick lower Montney formation for the first time in our Wapiti area and believe it will have minimal communication with the currently productive horizons in the upper Montney. In the Duvernay, we just completed drilling our first seven-well pad in the Kaybob area and look forward to completing those wells and bringing on some significant volumes during the quarter. Turning to our international operations; in Australia, our production averaged 59,400 BOEs per day, which was down from the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we had unanticipated production shut-ins for approximately 2,600 BOEs per day due to the impact of two cyclones that hit the region. Otherwise, the ramp up of our Coniston and Van Gogh fields remains on schedule, as does the planned sale of all of our Australian oil and gas assets by mid-year. In Egypt, the successful delineation of our Ptah and Berenice fields has led to a recent gross production rate of more than 19,600 barrels of oil per day from seven wells. This month, we plan to place one more delineation well online and increase production to approximately 22,000 barrels of oil per day. Several other new field discoveries have been made across multiple concession areas subsequent to quarter-end. As a result, Egypt is tracking very well against our production outlook from February 12. Apache's production in the North Sea decreased as expected from a record high in the fourth quarter of 2014, but was up 5% relative to the first quarter of 2014. One of the two main electrical transformers failed on our Beryl Alpha platform, resulting in two weeks of unplanned downtime. This translated into a 2,600 BOE per day net production hit for the first quarter. Our North Sea team responded quickly and commendably to this incident and managed to keep our production tracking in line with plan. Subsequent to quarter-end, we logged significant pay at new wells in both the Beryls and Forties areas, and there's a high degree of confidence in our 2015 North Sea production outlook, after adjusting for the sale of our non-op interest in the Scott and Telford fields. We're excited about our recently processed 700 square mile 3D seismic survey covering the Beryl field complex and adjoining area. This is the first seismic survey conducted over this field since 1997. From the higher resolution of the extensive data set, a number of interesting features have surfaced in terms of potentially material exploration targets and lower risk in field drilling opportunities. We look forward to testing these later in the year and in 2016. Since our fourth quarter call back in February, we've received a lot of questions about our inventory work off in 2015 and our projected drilled but uncompleted well inventory going into 2016. Let me quickly provide you a few numbers that may be helpful for modeling purposes. We entered 2015 with 207 drilled but uncompleted wells at our North American onshore backlog, 80% of which were horizontals. Based on our current plan, we expect to exit 2015 with between 80 and 100 drilled but uncompleted wells, essentially all of which will be horizontals. I would stress that this assumes that we do not add any additional rigs in the second half of the year. During this period of depressed oil and gas prices, Apache is not standing still. Though, we have reduced our rig count, we continue to move forward on multiple initiatives that will strengthen the company. I believe these initiatives will help transform our operational and financial results and ultimately drive incremental shareholder value. I mentioned them last quarter and would like to close by reiterating them here again today. We are realigning our North American incentive program to reward continuous improvement and cost discipline. We are developing detailed medium and longer term field development plans and continue to high grade and build our drilling inventory at multiple price scenarios. We are continuing to invest heavily in seismic acquisition, processing, and other technical services to provide a more thorough understanding of our acreage and optimize our drilling and completion techniques. We are focused on quick payout, high return work over and re-completion projects that protect our North American production base, and we're consolidating and enhancing our portfolio through opportunistic acreage additions, where there is less competition and lower prices. I have confidence in the positive impact of these initiatives and I'm excited about our people, our acreage, and our strategy. Despite the commodity price challenges the entire industry faces, I believe Apache will finish this year as a much stronger company then when we began it. I will now turn the call over to our new CFO, Steve Riney, who I am very pleased to have on board. He has only been here a few short months, but has already made a significant impact on our organizational capabilities. Steve? Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, John, and good afternoon. It's great to be a member of the Apache team. And I have to say, it's everything I hoped it would be and more. In my three months in the role, I have spent most of my time getting to know the business and the people and understanding how we do things. I have been very impressed with our team. They're dedicated to always doing the right thing and to growing value for our shareholders. We also have a terrific set of assets that are more than capable of delivering on that same goal of growing value. Before I dive into the first quarter performance discussion, I thought I would share some of my emerging views on top priorities with respect to the role of finance at Apache. There are two particular areas where I am focusing my near- term attention : planning and capital allocation. I have a firm belief that finance plays a key role in stewarding the value proposition for our shareholders. We don't do this alone. There are many others who lead very important elements, but finance plays a vital role in bringing a dispassionate view into the planning process and the capital allocation process. In planning, we're working to pull together a high-quality view of the next five years as well as to develop a dynamic planning process. Planning is where opportunity and expectations become aligned. Shareholders have expectations with respect to operational performance, financial delivery, and growth. So, there is an element of what we must deliver in the planning process. Our portfolio presents our current opportunity set. This is where planning addresses the question of what can we deliver. Getting these two views aligned builds confidence that long-term delivery is on track, and this is what we're trying to accomplish. We're working the plan with three price scenarios in mind : a low case of flat $50 WTI; a high case of a rise to $80 WTI, and then flat; and a base case of the five-year strip. Recent oil price volatility reminds us we have little control over the price environment and underscores the importance of being prepared to take any necessary steps to correct our course. We are redesigning the planning process to significantly improve our visibility into the potential impacts of price movements across the portfolio, so we are prepared to rebalance the activity set accordingly. Of course, price does not move in a vacuum, and we will take into account that costs move in tandem with prices, and may do so in very different ways for the various pieces of our portfolio. In some places, costs can move very quickly with price movements, potentially providing a natural hedge. In other places, the cost reaction could move much slower. The capital allocation process is how the plan gets implemented. We have a tremendous variety of opportunities in our global portfolio, and we are working to improve our understanding of how the economics of every element of the portfolio work. It can be more complicated than it is sometimes portrayed and an appropriate depth of understanding gives confidence that the best opportunities are getting funded, and they are truly adding value for our shareholders. We're also working to establish a strong linkage between the investment economics view of the portfolio and the long-term plan view. It is not enough to understand the depth of economic opportunities in the portfolio. We need to understand how that depth changes in different price environments. And finally, the various price assumptions in the plan and the corresponding cash flow generation will establish the pace at which the portfolio of opportunities can actually be funded. So, we have a lot of important work to do, but we are already on our way and we have a plan for taking this forward. Now, let me turn to some of the details of our first quarter results. John and Gary reviewed our earnings and key operational drivers for the quarter, so I'll make a few comments about our ceiling-test write down, planned use of proceeds from recent asset sales, and our 2015 capital spending outlook. I'll then finish up with some directional guidance for the year on a few other items. As noted in this morning's press release, we reported an after-tax ceiling-test write down of $4.7 billion or $12.48 per share for the first quarter of 2015. This is a result of the current commodity price environment. Under full cost accounting, our upstream assets are carried at historical cost. Each quarter, we compare this cost basis to a calculated PV-10 value. To the extent the net book value exceeds the PV-10 valuation, the result is a ceiling-test write down. The ceiling-test employs a methodology prescribed by the SEC, which uses trailing 12-month average oil and gas prices. The PV-10 calculation assumes these average prices are held flat into perpetuity. The prices for the last two quarters have dramatically reduced our PV-10 calculation. In addition, since today's trailing 12-month prices still reflects several months of higher prices from last year. If prices do not recover materially, you can expect further impairments during the remainder of 2015. In terms of our planned use of asset divestment proceeds, in April we received $3.7 billion of proceeds from our LNG transaction with Woodside, and approximately $560 million of U.S. income taxes has become payable as a result of repatriating these funds. Of the remaining $3.1 billion, $2.6 billion were used in April to pay off commercial paper in short-term bank loans, which you will see on the balance sheet at the end of the first quarter. Around mid-year, we anticipate receiving an additional $2.1 billion, subject to customary post-closing adjustments, upon closing the sale of our remaining Australian oil and gas assets. We plan to use these proceeds in combination of further debt reduction and cash retention. On page three of our earnings supplement, we provide a net debt reconciliation for the first quarter. On that same page, we present a pro forma view of our actual net debt at March 31 to reflect the asset sale proceeds expected in the second quarter. With this pro forma view, you'll see that our net debt is less than $7 billion, which is less than two times our projected 2015 EBITDA, assuming $50 WTI and $53 Brent. Turning to capital spending; we continue to anticipate North American CapEx, excluding LNG, to be in a range of $2.1 billion to 2.3 billion. We have no current intentions to expand the planned activity set in North America during 2015. However, if rising oil prices and continued capital efficiency result in 2015 cash flow significantly above plan levels, this may change, and as John indicated, we'll be prepared to respond. Our anticipated spending levels in the North Sea and Egypt remain unchanged. As we noted in this morning's press release, we're reducing our full-year international capital budget by $150 million as a result of the pending sale of our remaining oil and gas assets in Australia. Accordingly, our revised guidance for international and Gulf of Mexico capital spending is between $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion. On the cost side, both LOE and G&A are experiencing downward pressure in 2015. These operating expenses came in at just under $10 per BOE during the first quarter, which is 5% lower than 2014 actuals. For G&A, as John indicated, with the reduction in the scale of the portfolio and reduced activities around the globe, overhead costs should be coming down and they are being specifically targeted for reductions. Some of this has already been accomplished, but there is more to do. Following the closing of our Australian sales, we will prevent present a more in-depth view of our cost-cutting efforts, especially in the area of G&A spend. Interest expense for the year is projected to be around $460 million. Approximately 50% to 60% of this will be capitalized. On the tax side, we anticipate our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in 2015 will be between 25% and 30%. Note that this does not include the one-off benefit in deferred taxes for the recently enacted UK tax rate change, which we expect to be a little over $600 million. Operationally, you'll see on page two of the first quarter earnings supplement, our North America onshore production guidance is unchanged and is expected to be relatively flat compared to 2014. You'll also see in the earnings supplement that we have updated our pro forma production guidance for the Gulf of Mexico and international operations to be slightly up from 2014. Please note this guidance now excludes Australia production volumes entirely. I'd like to close by echoing what John said in his remarks. Our goal for the remainder of 2015 is to maintain a strong balance sheet, to live within our cash flow, and to prepare the organization for an efficient ramp up in activity, when the cash flows dictate. We will also continue to be opportunistic, but highly disciplined in evaluating new opportunities that may unfold in this challenging price environment. I am very excited to be a part of the Apache team, and I look forward to meeting with many of you down the road. I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A. Operator : We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. The first question will come from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. John, I wonder if I could take the activity step-up question, if I may, and it's not so much about \u2013 you've laid out what oil price, I think, you would start to go back to work, but you still have a fairly intricate portfolio. You've got a lot of opportunities. How would you think about the incremental allocation of capital? For example, you're running more rigs in the Eagle Ford right now, but if you did go back to work, what would be the first call on spending? And I've got a follow-up on the international, please. John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Well, Doug, thank you. We have actually worked hard to be in this position to get our activity levels adjusted and obviously address the cost structure. So, it puts us in the position now where we can be opportunistic. Obviously, prices on the strip right are now running ahead of where we planned, so it puts us in a position to make some choices. The first and easiest thing, obviously, to do would be to put a couple of frack crews in and recomplete some of our drilled but uncompleted wells, but we want to be very prudent, we want to be opportunistic, we're starting to see some acreage things that pop up that might be very additive to long-term shareholder value, so, Doug, we want to be very prudent, because we worked hard to get into this position, and want to kind of monitor that as the second half of the year unfolds. We're working through a detailed planning process right now, as Steve lined out, with three price scenarios, and one at $50 flat on the low side, the other one at $80 bracketed, and then the strip, and so that will help us give some guidance in terms of those directions. Clearly, when I look at the portfolio, the Delaware Basin is an area, and the Permian is an area that we can go in quickly with cash flow in terms of additional activity as we plan to run quite a few more rigs there. And then also both the Canyon Lime and the Eagle Ford at higher prices, we'd scale in there. But, we've got lots of opportunity in front of us, and we want to be opportunistic and very careful on where we go forward. Doug Leggate - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch : Just to qualify, John, is the backlog concentrated in one particular area? Or is it pretty much spread around? John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer : It's spread around. The lion's share that we mentioned, we came into the year with 207, and 80% of it was horizontal. We will work off the vertical backlog, which was predominantly in the Permian, by year-end. And we said, we'd come in \u2013 exit right now, our plan would be to exit the year with between 80 and the 100 uncompleted wells. A big chunk of those will remain in the Permian, and obviously we've got some in the Eagle Ford and then the other areas. Doug Leggate - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch : Okay. My follow-up, John, is on the North Sea. Obviously, you had some interruptions this quarter, but in the absence of exploration success, what is the production prognosis for the North Sea? And maybe if you could just frame into that how you see your backlog of opportunities to hold production flat? I'll leave it there. Thank you. John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, we're very excited about what we've been able to accomplish in the North Sea. We're coming off of a Q4 record high for us of over 80,000 BOEs a day. We've got a deep inventory there. As part of our capital reductions, we did scale back in the North Sea as well. We've got over 200 identified prospects and locations. We've got deep inventory. And for the year, Doug, from where we are right now, we would envision it being relatively flat on a go-forward basis. Doug Leggate - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks a lot. I'll leave it there, John. Operator : The next question will come from David Tameron with Wells Fargo. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, John. I guess afternoon. What's changed as far as the Delaware? Can you just give a little more detail what you're seeing, why you're getting more aggressive there, and why is the remainder of the Permian program going to be focused there? John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, we'll be focused in two areas. Obviously, the Delaware, even if you go back to our November update, we're planning to run four to five rigs there. That's where we were maintained today, and honestly, right now the economics there are just slightly higher. We've also got some testing we're doing there, which we think can be differential. Right now, we've only brought on two wells this year. We plan to drill another, or actually complete another 28 wells for the rest of the year. So, we're excited about our position there, and we see lots of opportunity. But, we will also be active in the Midland Basin as well as our Central Basin Platform. About half of our Permian rigs will be in the Delaware and the other half are going to be spread out. But, we're moving into the Midland County, Southern Midland Basin area, our Wildfire area, Powell, Miller. We're excited about those. We'll actually be doing a Spraberry test later this year in the Wildfire area, and we've also been drilling great wells on the Central Basin Platform. So, it's just part of our portfolio, and right now the economics over there are slightly better than they'd be in the other areas. But, we're excited about all the areas. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And just as a follow-up, if I think about the Delaware, it looks like the couple of wells that you highlighted during the quarter in the supplement were in the third Bone spring. Can you give us any color as to where you plan to focus \u2013 those four rigs? Is there any zone in particular standing out? Can give us any color on that? John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, it really depends on the area. If you look at our Pecos Bend area, where the two Condor wells are, we drilled 31 wells to-date. 21 of those have been in the third Bone springs. We've had six in the Wolfcamp and four in the second Bone springs. Right now, we're kind of dialed in on the third Bone springs, and there's a couple landing zones in there. You move into the other areas, and that's the nice thing about the Delaware is you've got multiple targets, anywhere from the Avalon to the first, second, or third Bone springs or down to the Wolfcamp and some other zones. So, the nice thing is it kind of depends on the area you're in, but with where those rigs are focused. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. Thanks. Operator : The next question will come from Leo Mariani with RBC Capital Markets. Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. You guys came out in your prepared comments and talked about having a position at 50,000 acres, kind of in the Woodford Springer area. I'm just trying to get a sense if this was a legacy position in the portfolio or something that you guys leased recently. And maybe if you can just provide a little bit more color regarding your comments about some leasing opportunities that have been picking up here? John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, I'll start out with the Woodford. It is predominantly legacy acreage. Last year, we did sprinkle in some sections around there. And we have been blocking that up as we have been most of our key core areas. Currently we've got one well, the Ellis 14-4-6 number 1Hs, it's right now on completion. We've got two rigs out there and we're drilling two wells, the Ellis 14 number 2H and the Truman well. So we've got three wells we'll be bringing on in the very near future. We're very excited about the rates. We've got about 200,000 acres there gross and about 50,000 net, and it's a nice little position that can be very material for us. In general, obviously, we're seeing some opportunities in all of our core areas. And that where we're busy trying to core up acreage, prep things, and be prepared for when we allocate more capital to some of the high-value areas. Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : All right. And I guess you guys obviously spoke about some really nice cost reductions here that you've seen here recently on your wells. And a lot of that was focused in the Permian with some of the costs coming down. I wanted to get a sense if you guys are also not only seeing cost reductions, but are you seeing improvements in the wells, just better efficiency as you guys tweak frac design, and you're seeing the wells in the Permian get better here of late. Maybe you can speak to that? John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I mean, the first thing is we did a very detailed dive on the EURs in the plays in November. And since that time, we've brought on some wells, but not many. You look at the Delaware, we brought on two wells. They are outperforming our type curve, so we're doing some things there technically which we think can improve those. But with two wells on, they've only been on 60 days, I'm not in a position right now to be updating type curves. And the same is pretty much true in our other areas. Our Canyon Lime wells are coming on relative to type curves. In the Eagle Ford, we've got some slightly above, some under. So, we feel really good about those areas. We are seeing cost, we've kind of dialed in 10% to 15% on the last call when we talked about the plan for 2015. Clearly, we said that they're going to range from 20% to 40% right now. We're seeing on average about 25%. A lot of that's attributable to the service side. But, a lot of it's just more people now focused on ways to drive cost out and doing a better job planning our wells. And clearly, if prices remain where they are, we're going to see costs further align and come down for the rest of 2015. Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : I guess, previously you folks had spoken in the past, predominantly last year, about separating North American business from the rest of the international properties. I just wanted to see, if there's any kind of status update on that or if you've got kind of a new way of thinking about any type of separation of the business lines. John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, we addressed that on the first quarter call. But the key objectives with us on our international portfolio were two. One, unload our LNG, which we have done, signed, closed. And then we announced the sale of Australia. I think that leaves us with a portfolio now that we plan to stick with, we're excited to have. We're 60% to 70% North America. If you look at our North Sea and our Egypt operations, we've got world-class people there as well as leading positions. And the nice thing about both the international assets, they complement our North American portfolio, they're Brent pricing. And the other thing is the way the PSCs and the tax regimes work, you've actually got less sensitivity to lower oil prices in terms of after tax cash flow. So, going forward, we're going to, as we work through our planning process, we're working through North America, we're also working through Egypt and the North Sea, and we will be outlining longer-term plans. But, we're very happy with the portfolio as it stands today. Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question will come from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Question on that impairment, the $4.7 billion. Can you give some detail what assets were involved there? Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Bob. So, the primary assets that were involved there were the U.S., Canada and the North Sea. There was about a $7.2 billion gross impairment. You'll see in the 10-Q, it'll be released later today, that $5.2 billion of that was in the U.S., $1.4 billion of that was in Canada, and about $600 million of that was in the North Sea. All of that's on a pre-tax basis. Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And the U.S. assets how would those split? Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, we're not providing a breakdown of that into the U.S. Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And then a follow-up, on the net proceeds, what's the ultimate use of those net proceeds that you've collected from Australia? Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, we collected $3.7 billion pre-tax proceeds. We've got about a $600 million tax liability that will get paid later this year, so the $3.1 billion net, $2.6 billion of that went in the month of April to pay down the debt, the short-term debt that existed on the balance sheet at the end of 1Q. The $2.1 billion that will be coming in sometime right around midyear for the second Australia transaction, that $2.1 billion will be used as a combination of debt pay down and some cash retention. We haven't decided exactly the ratio of that yet, but I would say the majority of that will be going to debt pay down. Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Arun Jayaram from Credit Suisse. Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good afternoon, John and Steve. My first question regards the new planning process that's under way. I think you articulated maybe three different pricing scenarios that you would look at. I was just wondering if you could give us a sense of when this planning process is completed, what will be \u2013 will there be a new set of targets that you'll communicate to the Street, and could this potentially impact your views on 2015 production and capital? John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Arun, at this point we're working through that. Obviously, we've got early looks, but we're taking a really deep dive at the portfolio and one of the keys is, it's an iterative process as you have to try to really synchronize cost with price environment for each of those. So, what we're really trying to do is put some sidebars on the world we'll be operating in as we start to take a longer-term view. I don't envision anything impacting 2015 from where we sit today for how we budgeted it. And so, we feel good about where we are, but we'll be working through that, and over the next several months we'll get to where we have an internal view as we start to think about how we react going into 2016. Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Great. Obviously, John, the balance sheet is in a different place, or will be once you complete the transactions. You commented in the press release about potentially being opportunistic yet disciplined. Historically, Apache has been a counter-cyclical investor, so where is your head at in thinking about potential acquisitions, and would you be focused in on your core area, or look for new areas? John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, Arun, where my head is right now is delivering value for the shareholders and trying to maximize that. And I think we have positioned ourselves very nicely. The nice thing is we have high-quality assets and deep inventory, but we also are always opportunistic and always in looking at opportunities, so if there was something that we thought made sense and incrementally might add value, then we might be willing to move forward on it. But, in general, we're happy with our asset base and we're going to be very selective, but clearly we're in a position where we have a lot of flexibility, and you'd never know what might present itself. Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Just my final question, as you think about capital allocation to the Permian this year, could you give us a sense of what percentage of your CapEx, perhaps ballpark, is going for Midland versus Delaware and how that could shift over time given your comments on the Delaware today? John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, I mean, when we look at where we sit right now, kind of like even like what we lined out in November, about 60% of our CapEx on North America is in the Permian. When you look at what we've done with the price environment, we've slowed down much more so than we had planned in the Eagle Ford and the Canyon Lime, and even Canada. So, for the bulk of the year, the majority of our capital is going to be going into the Permian. I would say that in terms of, if we were to add incrementally, the Southern Midland Basin would be an area we've got the best \u2013 most flexibility and things ready to drill that we could move quicker on. We had kind of planned even in higher capital and prices to run the number of rigs we're running in the Delaware. So, we like our pace right there given our asset base, so I would say incrementally we'd probably add first in the Delaware or we might choose to accelerate in the Delaware or add in the Midland Basin. Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thanks a lot, John. Operator : The next question will come from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, John, and to the rest of your team there. If I could ask a question about those Wildfire wells that you just mentioned in your operations report. Presumably, if you were ready to share already you would have put it in there. But, you did I believe say that the early flow back was very favorable on those four wells, so I wonder if you could perhaps condition us a bit on \u2013 give us a background on, did you batch drill and batch complete those four wells? Did they just come on in the last week or so, and what is it? Is it the total fluid volume that's being moved that has you feeling it's favorable? John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, Charles, what I'll say is, I'll go ahead and give a little bit of color. We've got four, roughly 7,500 foot Wolfcamp B wells that are in what we call the Lynch Unit. All four wells were completed in late March. We've got all of them on in less than three weeks, so we're not ready to talk about 30-day rates, they're going to be second quarter wells. But they've been encouraging. In general, we've had an average kind of peak IP of around 1,400 BOEs a day, they're 70% to 80% oil. So, we're very excited about them, and we're flowing them back very conservatively. So, we're very, very encouraged. Additionally, we've got about three wells there, we'll drill in 2015 and delineate and optimize and test our fracs, and then it sets us up for quite a drilling program there going forward when we decided to scale up. We also plan to test a Spraberry shale well there, probably in the third or fourth quarter of this year. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Got it. Got it. That's great additional detail, John. And then, if I could ask another question. This goes back to the drilled uncompleted count that you expect to have at year-end 2015. I think you said it was 80 to 100. Perhaps you could tell me, if I'm thinking about this the right way, but if you're running 15 rigs, and just to make the math easy, let's say, your average drill time or drill and complete time is \u2013 I guess spud to rig release would be the appropriate thing, is 30-days, that would imply kind of a six-month backlog there. And if you cut it in half and say, okay, well our spud to rig release is 15 days, it gets down to about a three-month backlog. So, both of those seem sort of high to me, and it makes me wonder if you plan to continue to work down that backlog as you go into 2016, and could you tell me, is that the right way to look at that? John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, what I'll say is, what it tells you is we're going to carry. We're not just aggressively moving through our backlog. And that's a function of cash flow and being very disciplined. Clearly, we could go complete a lot of wells today, if we wanted to. We're going to take a very measured approach. We're being very careful with how we allocate our capital and how we handle it this year, but it puts us in a position where we will enter 2016 with a lot of flexibility, just like we entered 2015. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Got it. That's what I was after. Thanks a lot, John. Operator : The next question will come from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. I was just wondering, you've talked about cost improvement and performance improvement. Around these oil prices, with this level of spending, where would you anticipate your volumes to be growing or not growing in 2016? And is there a price of oil that you can share with us, where you feel that if we saw that price, you would start to reaccelerate the activity? Thanks. John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, good questions, Paul. What I'd say is, number one, it's cash flow for us that matters. I don't worry as much about oil price. What I'll say is, we're taking a very hard look right now and going through a very rigorous planning process, which kind of brackets some scenarios. And we're looking at a range, which we would mirror \u2013 kind of mirror the cost structure to those oil prices and look at that. So, as we get further into the year, into the next quarter, and we get closer to 2016 and things crystallize, we'll start to be more candid on where we are for 2016. Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Right. So, I was just wondering if we could get a sense, given the way performance is improving, let's say for example, you held your CapEx at these levels, how would you anticipate your performance in volumes to be next year? John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer : What I'll say is, clearly, if we're in a low price environment, capital in 2016's going to go further than it went in 2015, because costs are going to be lower, we're seeing efficiencies. Additionally, with the G&A reductions and things we're targeting, we will be able to put more dollars in. So, through the efficiencies and that sort of thing, it's going to take less in 2016 to deliver than we have in 2015, but beyond that, we're working through a rigorous process, we're going to stay committed to bracketing kind of the environment we're in and then communicating that at a later date. Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Understood. I can kind of sense that you're in the process, so it's hard to talk about, but I'll just try one more. Could you just put some numbers around the cost savings that you've achieved, and maybe where you think we may be by the end of the year? And I'll leave it there, thanks. John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, we outlined in February a 15% reductions from our November levels on our well-by-well basis. If you look at it today, I've said today we'd be at least 25%. So, the one thing is we came into the 2015 hot. We spent a lot of our capital, so if you look at our go-forward capital for 2015, we're seeing down 25% on average from the levels that we had in November 20. Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And you think there's more to come? John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer : Absolutely. Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : All right. Thanks. Operator : The next question will come from Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Co. Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Co. International: Yeah. Good afternoon, John. Thank you for taking my questions. John, just following up on Paul's question there, just to clarify, so if you were to hold CapEx flat in 2016 versus 2015, in North America, do you think you'd be able to grow production? John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer : Pearce, we're early. I don't want to give you overall numbers, because we're working through planning. I'm just \u2013 my point was, if I hold CapEx flat, I'm going to get more out of it in 2016 than I got out of it in 2015. Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Co. International: Okay. Great. And then on Egypt, it seems like the political environment has become more stable. You had some \u2013 the permits that you got on the concessions were faster, it looked like, this most recent round. Is the arrow pointed up in Egypt? And if so, could you end up allocating more capital there? John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I think clearly the investment area there is improving, and if you go back, even though the Arab Spring, we've never skipped a beat. So, it's in general, the investment has always been good for us. We've got a great relationship with the Egyptian government, and we did set record times and bring in Ptah and Berenice on, but we've been that way in the past. So, lot of advantages. It's, clearly the sentiment is turning, and like the rest of our business we're excited about it, and that's one of the options we'll have on the table as we start to think about if we have incremental cash flow, where would we put it. Operator : The next question will come from James Sullivan with Alembic Global Advisors. James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Hey, good afternoon, folks. I just want to go back for a second to the Condor wells in the Delaware. Just want to see \u2013 the 30-day IP you gave of those was not, is not normalized for lateral and the short lateral length, is that right? John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer : That is correct. James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Okay. Great. So, that's a good number. Just to follow-up on that, your position out in the Delaware seems to consist more of the smaller lease configurations. What is the appetite? You guys have talked about bolt-ons and leasehold. What's your appetite or can you describe the environment for trying to block up your acreage? Obviously, I'm sure there's always appetite to do it, but with firming up in prices are the bid asks just too tough, and would you migrate over the river into Reeves to try to do that, and where you might get a better pricing? John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, I mean, I think we're obviously very high in the Delaware. We've got lots of room to build off of, and we've got inventory for many years on our existing acreage position. It's one of the areas that clearly that if we felt like we could add something at attractive prices that we'd look at. James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Okay. Sounds good. Just to go to the international piece. Obviously, since you guys are thinking about the North Sea and Egypt as a retained part of the portfolio, could you just remind me, this is probably something I should know, but could you just tell me what the challenges are associated with the cycling that free cash flow back to the U.S. under kind of a normal retained asset accounting? I know that those should be free cash flowing generally, if you think about a normalized price environment, so the idea that feeding the U.S. will be a positive thing, but just want to see what the tax implications would be of that? Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, James. We don't see any significant issues with cycling cash back to the U.S. now, especially with eliminating the election to permanently reinvest earnings overseas, and we'll be able to do that with a significant amount of foreign tax credits as well going forward. Operator : The next question will come from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers Investment Research. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Howdy? John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Jim. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Hi, John, I wanted to ask you first a broad question, and then a specific one. You mentioned a couple of times on the call today that $65 a barrel was an encouraging number, let's say. I'm just wondering, do we mean that you're looking at it as something that you have an ability to hedge at $65, or do you have a certain amount of time you want to see stability around $65 a barrel, before you begin to start pulling levers? John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer : What I would say is right now, we're not hedged. Our best hedge is our activity levels, which we are able to mirror. Clearly, we would look at \u2013 hedging is a tool that we could use before we started to make some longer-term commitments in terms of activity levels as we went into these plays. The point is, for the Canyon Lime and the Eagle Ford, when you get into the $60 to $65 range, that's an area where they become very attractive for us to put capital back to work. But as I said in my prepared notes, they'd have to compete with the other opportunity set. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Right. And the other question I wanted to ask was about the Eagle Ford itself. I think you gave a little bit more color, or at least maybe I noticed it this time, a little more color and complexity in the play. Now you've got a lot of 3D seismic covers. And I also remember last quarter, you said sometimes it's not such a bad thing to be forced to slow down a little bit. And I'm wondering if the path forward here for a little while is to use this 3D, to try to figure out the better places to not only \u2013 better ways to complete your wells, but maybe even thinking about better places to drill preparatory to the time when you return rigs there? John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, actually, would you look at the Eagle Ford, we're dealing with four phases across our acreage position. We've got black oil, we've got volatile oil, we've got wet gas, and we've got obviously dry gas, which we're not obviously focused on. As you look across those three areas, you've got 38 wells to complete, Jeff, 17 in Area A, as we lined out back in November and 21 in Area B. We've been focused on our cost side. I think we have made significant progress on the drilling side. So, it's just optimizing completions and working on improving the economics. So, we'll be working on that and providing updates later in the year. Operator : The final question will come from Michael Rowe with Tudor, Pickering. Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Thanks for squeezing me in here. I just had one quick question on the Permian. Can you talk a little bit more about the growth in oil volumes for the rest of the year, while gas stays flat? Is that a function of the weather impact reversing itself here, or is it that you're leading on your completion backlog? How should we think about the growth there in oil, with the reduced capital spending? John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, there's two things. Number one, obviously, from where we are first quarter, we did have weather impacts. So, there's a piece of that. The other thing is, though, we only brought on two Delaware Basin wells. So, we've got pretty good inventory ahead of us. In fact, if you go back to our Q4, we did not bring on a lot. So, we're sitting with some nice things coming on and as you get into the second quarter and into the summer months, we've got some key pads and some things we'll be bringing on which are going to help drive the liquids in the Permian coming forward. So, we've just got a lot of our stuff in front of us. We've moved into the Southern Midland Basin Wolfcamp, so we've got a lot of exciting things to bring on, even at the reduced activity levels in the Permian. And then I can't underscore our base decline. We've got 25%, 26% across North America, and a nice thing about us relative to our peers is having a big Central Basin Platform position where our decline rates and the water floods, we've got 45 water floods, we've got seven CO2 floods, having a lot of that low decline base really helps in terms of our volumes out there. Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: That's helpful. Appreciate the detail there, and then one quick question on the North Sea. Was curious about the 3D seismic survey that you're doing there at the Beryl field, because you're working on some drilling plans. And subject to more capital availability, you would maybe consider drilling some more wells there. Does that savings of $150 million from selling Australia, does that kind of give you the capital availability to potentially put a few more North Sea wells in the 2015 program, or is that more planning for 2016 drilling? John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer : I would say we've got a plan right now. We've got brand-new 3D there which we're excited about. The 150 comes out of Australia reductions. So clearly, anything we decide to add anywhere is going to be a function of future generation off our existing base. But, there is opportunity in the North Sea. We've got some exciting things we will be testing later this year and well into 2016 and beyond. So, it gets back to the depth and the opportunity to generate value over the long haul. The thing I would add about the North Sea that's differential for us is in both of our big complexes, we have made significant investments in our infrastructure that pushes our abandonment timeframe way out into the 2030 range. And we've spent over $1 billion at Forties, which gives us long, long runway there. And the same thing at Beryls, we've spent $300 million there over the last few years, which gives us lots of runway in time, and we're very excited about the opportunity set. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Suzy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome, everyone, to the Apache Corporation 2015 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Clark, you may begin your conference. Gary T. Clark - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann; and CFO, Steve Riney. Also joining us in the room is Tom Voytovich, Executive Vice President of International and Offshore; as well as Tim Sullivan, Senior Vice President of Operations. In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our quarterly earnings supplement, which summarizes our operational activities and well highlights across various Apache operating regions. The supplement also includes information on our revised full-year guidance, capital expenditures for the quarter, as well as a chart that illustrates cash sources and uses and reconciles Apache's change in net debt during the second quarter of 2015. Our earnings release, the accompanying financial tables, and non-GAAP reconciliations, and our quarterly earnings supplement can all be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com. I'd like to remind, everyone, that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. And I would now like to turn the call over to John. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Gary. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm very pleased with our second quarter results and the tremendous amount of progress we have made refocusing our asset base, strengthening our balance sheet, and restructuring our operational organization. Importantly, we are continuing to deliver on our cost initiatives, and we are exceeding our previously established production goals. During the quarter, we closed on the sales of our LNG business and remaining oil and gas assets in Australia, which served to more strategically align our portfolio with our core competencies. In doing so, we greatly enhanced our balance sheet strength and liquidity position. Additionally, we reduced our drilling and completion activities and overall spending to a level that is more in line with the current commodity price environment. We also realigned our management and regional operating structure to drive greater efficiencies, and we implemented meaningful new initiatives to reduce overall G&A costs. Finally, we delivered strong production both domestically and internationally, which is prompting us to raise our 2015 production guidance. Looking ahead, we anticipate having strong production momentum as we exit 2015 and believe that we will have the flexibility to live within 2016 cash flow, while maintaining relatively stable year-over-year production levels. Now I'd like to review our operational results in greater detail. During the second quarter, onshore North American production averaged 317,000 BOEs per day and once again came in ahead of our expectations. This was driven by strong operational performance across the entire portfolio and in particular from new well contributions in the Permian and the Eagle Ford. Our performance internationally was also impressive. Excluding Australia, pro forma production from international and Gulf of Mexico was 172,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Egypt was a significant driver during the quarter as delineation of the Ptah and Berenice oil fields continued to drive gross production sequentially higher. In the North Sea, our production declined modestly from the first quarter as a result of two seasonal platform maintenance turnarounds, but was still above internal expectations due to production efficiencies. We have also had recent drilling success in the North Sea, which I will discuss in a few minutes. Our performance on the capital side, during the quarter, was in line with our expectations. Expenditures on continuing operations before leasehold acquisitions, capitalized interest, and non-controlling interest were $857 million, which was down 28% from the first quarter. In addition to realizing service cost reductions, Apache is delivering solid drilling and completion efficiency gains, which is critical in this low oil price environment. At the beginning of the year, we took aggressive steps to address our cost structure and established a plan to reduce drilling and completion costs by at least (5:30) levels. Year-to-date we have already achieved the 15% reduction and are on a run rate for an approximate 25% reduction for the remainder of the year. We now believe that there are potentially even more cost savings over and above the 25% if oil prices remain at current levels. Our lease operating expenditures per BOE were down 13% year-over-year in the second quarter, and our G&A run rate is following quickly as a result of the overhead initiatives that we are pursuing on multiple fronts. Steve Riney will provide some more details in a few minutes on those items, as well as some forward-looking guidance. As noted in our press release this morning, we raised our full-year 2015 onshore North American production guidance to between 305,000 BOE to 308,000 BOEs per day, the midpoint of which is up approximately 5,000 BOEs per day from our prior implied guidance. We are also effectively raising our international guidance, as we now see production in Egypt and the North Sea up 5% to 8% this year on a pro forma basis, which is a notable increase from our previous guidance of up slightly. Looking at our onshore North American production profile for the remainder of the year, we expect third quarter production will be down sequentially from the second quarter. This is due primarily to monthly well completion timing, planned downtime associated with offset fracing operations, and planned facility and plant maintenance in the Permian. In the fourth quarter, however, we expect a strong production rebound and project that December will be our highest production month in the fourth quarter, absent any adverse weather events. Overall, we feel very good about our performance to date and our projected production momentum as we enter 2016. It is important to note that we are in the process of developing our initial 2016 plan, as well as our five-year plan. This will put us in a better position to provide more thoughts around next year's production and capital outlook on our third quarter call. I'd like to now discuss some of our key operational areas and activity plans for the remainder of the year. During the second quarter, we operated an average of 34 rigs company-wide with 15 rigs in North America, 12 rigs in Egypt, and 7 rigs in the North Sea. In North America, we completed 63 gross operated wells during the quarter, which was a 51% decrease from the first quarter. Despite the significant drop in completion activity, our onshore North American production grew by 9300 barrels of oil equivalent per day sequentially. The majority of this increase was driven by the Permian Basin where we delivered strong new well results and experienced a bounce back from the tough first quarter weather conditions and shut-ins. We consider our Permian Basin to be advantaged in this current environment due to a relatively low base decline rate of approximately 22%. This is aided by our Central Basin Platform and North West Shelf assets, which represent approximately half of our gross production from the Permian and have a decline rate of roughly 14%. We have several production enhancement initiatives under way, including various water flood activities, and ESP installations that serve to protect our base decline rate at a fairly low capital cost. In the Delaware Basin, we saw a strong oil performance in the Pecos Bend area and generated positive results from our delineation and target testing. Drilling at our 7-well Osprey pad confirmed good performance from 660 foot down-spaced wells and also helped to confirm an additional landing zone in the third Bone Spring formation, which appears to be performing as well as our primary target in the third Bone Spring. In the Waha area, we placed our first two wells online during the last week of June. Initial results look encouraging, and we will update you on this area next quarter. At our North American update on November 20 of last year, we shared an average well cost for the Delaware Basin of $8 million. Today, we are drilling those wells in the mid to upper $5 million range, and our target is to get down closer to $5 million, which would represent an approximate 35% reduction from November 20. In the Midland Basin, we ran three rigs during the second quarter, with one in our Wildfire area, one in Powell-Miller, and one at Azalea. Our first four wells at Wildfire in Midland County showed strong 30-day average IP rates of 1,090 BOEs per day in the middle Wolfcamp. We plan to complete an additional eight wells in this area during the second half of the year, three of which will be drilled to the lower Spraberry. During the second half of the year, we will be completing 11 wells in the Powell-Miller and Azalea areas, which we anticipate will contribute solid results. Lastly, at Barnhart, we brought on four wells during the quarter, which exhibited some of the strongest results we have seen to-date across the field. In the Central Basin Platform and North West Shelf, we see numerous opportunities across our acreage position to continue drilling wells with high rates of return. We are currently focusing on areas such as the Cedar Lake Yeso play and the Seth Campbell Clearfork play, which are highlighted in our quarterly supplement. These plays offer relatively inexpensive drilling and completion cost, thus yielding very attractive rates of return in today's low commodity price environment. Turning to the Eagle Ford. During the second quarter, we made important progress in optimizing our completion techniques and significantly improving flow rates on the four new wells we brought online. Our current focus in the Eagle Ford has primarily been in Area A at Ferguson Crossing in Brazos County. During the second quarter, we brought online four key wells, two on our Walker pad and two on our Rae pad. The 30-day average IP of the two Walker wells was 1,935 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which significantly exceeds Apache's Area A type curve and represents our highest flow rates in the Eagle Ford play to-date. Based on these results, we plan to add a rig back into the Eagle Ford at Ferguson Crossing, during the second half of 2015, which will help us continue optimization and delineation of this highly prospective area. In the Midcontinent, which was formerly our Central region, production was down 7% sequentially from the first quarter, as a result of natural declines and reduced activity. During the second quarter, we completed only six wells compared to 24 wells during the first quarter. Apache's primary focus in the Midcontinent is delineating our Woodford/SCOOP acreage and continued testing of the Canyon Lime play. In the Woodford, we have one rig drilling and delineating our 50,000 plus net acres, primarily in Grady County, and we plan to add another rig in the fourth quarter of 2015. We recently brought online our first Woodford well of 2015, with very good initial results. The Truman 28-6-6 #1H, a 16-stage 4,400 foot lateral, tested at a peak rate of 392 barrels of oil and 6.9 million cubic feet of gas per day on a 20/64-inch choke. We plan to complete at least three more Woodford wells this year, including a two-well pad that is waiting on completion and another well which is currently drilling. In Canada, we had very little drilling and completion activity during the quarter. However, our production declined less than expected due to minimal weather-related downtime. The next significant activity scheduled is the completion of our seven-well Duvernay pad in the fourth quarter of this year. Turning to our international operations. In Egypt, Apache's continued exploration and development success is driving better-than-expected production volumes year-to-date. As noted in our press release, we experienced positive results during the quarter at our Ptah and Berenice oil fields in the Faghur Basin. We now have nine wells online at these new fields producing a combined gross rate of more than 23,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. During the second quarter, the Ptah-5X exploration well appraised the northeast flank of the Ptah field and is flowing at a restricted rate of 3,000 barrels of oil per day. We also drilled and completed our first development well, which flowed at a 30-day average IP rate of more than 3,000 barrels of oil per day. Apache has five wells drilled in the Ptah field, all of which are currently producing. In the Berenice field, Apache drilled an additional development well during the quarter that logged 93 feet of pay and is now online. This marks the fifth well drilled to-date in the Berenice field, four of which are currently producing. Our current 2P reserve estimate for the Ptah and Berenice fields is approximately 50 million barrels, which we believe will require a total of 20 wells to 25 wells to fully develop. During the quarter, Apache achieved an exploration success rate in Egypt of 78%, which is significantly above the company's historical average. In the North Sea, two seasonal platform maintenance turnarounds reduced output by approximately 3,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day, but production still exceeded our internal plan. We anticipate a strong second half of the year, which has minimal scheduled maintenance downtime. As a result, we now project that pro forma North Sea production will be flat year-over-year, compared to our previous expectation of down slightly. In the Beryl field area, we made a significant exploration discovery with the 9/19 B/K well, which we refer to as the K prospect. The well encountered 235 feet of net pay in two Jurassic-age sandstone reservoirs. Apache's pre-drill mean unrisked reserve estimate for the K prospect was approximately 7 million barrels of oil equivalent and, given our initial test results, we believe recoverable reserves are likely to significantly exceed this estimate. The field will be developed as a subsea tie-back into existing infrastructure. The K prospect well was our first exploration well and only our tenth well drilled in the Beryl area since acquiring the field in 2011. We look forward to demonstrating the future reserve and production growth potential at Beryl. Also in the Beryl area, Apache brought its first subsea development well on production at the Nevis Central field. The S67 well encountered 114 feet of net pay and achieved an initial production rate of approximately 11,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Egypt and the North Sea continued to provide excellent diversification to the Apache portfolio and reduced the overall volatility of our cash flow profile in this low oil price environment. Returns at $50 oil in these regions are very economic. And we plan to provide more detail around the portfolio depth and quality of these two businesses in the future. At the beginning of 2015, we established a conservative budget that assumed a $50 WTI and $53 Brent oil prices. Although prices came in above these levels in the first half of the year, the recent retreat in oil prices underscores the importance of our conservative budget and capital spending approach. As we enter the back half of 2015, Apache is achieving efficiency gains and cost reductions that are enabling us to increase our planned drilling and completion activities. In North America, we are now planning to run an average of 16 rigs in the second half of the year, 13 rigs of which will be in the Permian Basin, one will be in the Eagle Ford, and two will be drilling in the Woodford/SCOOP play. We now expect to reach total depth on approximately 40 wells to 50 more wells than our original 2015 plan, and to complete approximately 30 wells to 35 more wells than originally planned. Internationally, we plan to average 17 rigs in the second half of the year, which is down slightly from second quarter levels. However, we plan to complete approximately 15 wells to 20 more wells than previously planned, most of which are in Egypt. This incremental activity will positively impact our production trajectory as we enter 2016, while having only a minimal impact on our full-year 2015 production volumes. In conjunction with this activity increase, we are tightening our capital expenditure guidance range to between $3.6 billion and $3.9 billion. Apache is staying within our dramatically reduced capital spending budget, while at the same time exceeding our production goals for the year. Our strategy in this low oil and gas price environment is to continue working on our cost structure, continue investing in acreage and 3D seismic, and continue key play delineation and target testing such that when it is time to ramp up our drilling program, we will be doing so in the most efficient manner possible, which will maximize program rates of return and net present value. To sum up, we made very good progress in the second quarter. We completed our major asset sales and put our balance sheet in excellent shape. We reduced our drilling and completion program to levels that are appropriately aligned with the current commodity price environment. We realigned our regional operation structure to drive greater efficiency and technical collaboration. We made significant reductions in our run rate G&A and overhead costs. And we delivered strong production both domestically and internationally, which resulted in an increase to our 2015 guidance. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Steve Riney. Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, John, and good afternoon. As John said, we had a very good first half 2015 and we are very well positioned, even if the current low oil price environment persists. I would like to take some time to highlight the financial positioning of Apache and what we have accomplished in terms of driving down our cost structure consistent with the current price environment, utilizing divestment proceeds to reduce debt and to improve near-term liquidity, extending our credit facility to ensure liquidity through to June 2020, and aggressively adjusting our activity level to live within our means on an ongoing cash flow basis. But first, let me highlight the second quarter financial results. As noted in this morning's press release, Apache reported a GAAP loss of $5.6 billion or $14.83 per common share. This includes after-tax charges for a ceiling-test impairment of $3.7 billion, as well as $1.9 billion of other items, mostly after-tax losses and tax expense associated with the company's assets sold during the quarter. Our earnings for the quarter adjusted for these items were $82 million or $0.22 per share. As in the prior two quarters, we experienced a ceiling-test impairment in second quarter resulting from the continuing low price environment. Under full cost accounting, our upstream assets are carried at historical costs. Each quarter we compare this cost basis to a PV-10 value, calculated using trailing 12-month average oil and gas prices, held flat into perpetuity. To the extent the net book value exceeds the PV-10 valuation, the result is a ceiling-test write-down. We expect further ceiling-test impairments in the second half of 2015. As outlined in more detail in our 10-Q, based on June 30, 2015 forward strip prices. For the remainder of this year, we would expect to incur an additional $3.5 billion post-tax impairment. One notable impact of the ceiling-test impairments on our financial results going forward will be a reduction to our unit DD&A rate. For example, our DD&A per BOE during the second quarter was 20% lower than it otherwise would have been as a result of impairments taken in 4Q 2014 and 1Q 2015. Forward-looking impacts are uncertain as they will depend on many factors beyond just ongoing impairments. Let me now turn to costs. The following oil price environment and subsequent activity reduction across the industry has resulted in significant downward pressure on service costs, and we are generally seeing lower trends in most major cost categories. More specifically for Apache, much of the improvement in our cost structure is being driven by our belief that we should prepare ourselves for an extended period of lower prices. Accordingly, we have put considerable effort into poring over every aspect of our cost structure. Since the end of 2014, we have reduced head count by approximately 20%, consolidated certain regional offices, and streamlined the organizational structure. These actions are generating significant savings in our overhead cost structure. The measurement of overhead costs can be complex from an accounting perspective. A good proxy for our overhead cost structure is the gross cash spend for everything above the field. At the end of 2014, these costs were running approximately $1 billion annually. The combined effect of our portfolio changes and extensive efficiency efforts across the organization will bring our current run rate to below $750 million. Our goal is to enter 2016 at a run rate around $700 million. These overhead cost show up in our financial statements in various places. On average, about 20% typically appears in lease operating expense, 45% in expensed G&A, and 35% in capitalized G&A. Thus, these savings will manifest in many different ways. The bottom line, though, is it represents cash savings of about $300 million per year, which can now be better utilized to create shareholder value. On the lease operating expense side, our second quarter LOE was just over $9 per BOE, which is 13% lower than second quarter 2014. As John indicated, we believe in this price environment there will be continued downward pressure on all costs, and this includes lease operating expenses. Next, I would like to make a few comments regarding our balance sheet position and liquidity. While we've certainly accomplished a lot in terms of focusing our portfolio, we have also improved our overall financial strength. In particular, we have reduced debt levels, extended our credit facilities and we are now eliminating certain nearer-term debt maturities. Our proceeds from divestments enabled us to pay off $2.7 billion of short-term debt in the second quarter. We ended the quarter with long-term debt of $9.7 billion, and nearly $3 billion of cash, and have recently initiated steps to pay off $900 million of outstanding 2017 bonds. Following this, we will have no long-term debt maturing prior to 2018. As mentioned in our 1Q call, the sale of our foreign assets and the repatriation of the proceeds triggered a U.S. income tax payable of $560 million. Actual cash payment of this liability will occur in the second half of 2015, so I would like to point out that our current net debt of $6.7 billion should be considered as being closer to $7.3 billion. As of June 30, 2015, Apache held access to an undrawn commercial paper program backed by our $3.5 billion credit facility, which was recently extended through to June 2020. Combined with our current cash position and the maturity profile of our long-term debt, our liquidity is in very good shape. Having established this position, we are also working hard to protect it. As John has indicated many times, we are aggressively working to live within our means on a cash-flow basis. Obviously that was a difficult task for the first half of the year as prices declined rapidly and activity took time to ramp down. John spoke previously about our activity level for the second half of 2015. We are positioning our second half exploration and development activity at a pace that, if continued, would target cash flow neutrality for 2016. Our goal has been and continues to be to live within our means on a cash-flow basis. We have taken significant actions to achieve this and it has proven to be the prudent course. However, we want to balance these efforts with continued investment in an inventory of high quality opportunities that still work in this price environment. We have made great strides to position the company to be successful in a low-commodity-price environment. We knew that if we could be successful at $50 oil, we would certainly be successful at higher prices. The company is in a solid foundation with a healthy balance sheet, substantial liquidity and improving cost structure commensurate with the price environment, and a capital activity plan to live within our means as we enter 2016. We will remain opportunistic, but highly disciplined in the manner that we allocate capital in this challenging environment. I look forward to a successful second half of the year. And we'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Dave Tameron of Wells Fargo. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Congrats on a good quarter. John, how do you think about the price level here when you're at $45, versus $50, versus $40? And at what level would you see yourselves going the other way and pulling back a little bit? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, Dave, I mean, I think the first thing is we took a more conservative approach earlier in the year when we kind of carved out a $50 budget back in February. So it's put us in a position where we've been counting the \u2013 trying to get our heads around what $50 means and working hard on our cost structure. You know, I think clearly with the \u2013 when you look at the activity increase, while we're adding back three rigs in North America, it's really going to be just one rig increase over what we ran in the second quarter. So we're trying to kind of streamline our activity with where we envision things would be in that price range, as you mentioned. I think the good news is we've got flexibility and as we're working on our plans for 2016 right now, we'll work on it even harder, but we've got flexibility to move up or down from this point. So the first thing was, was to kind of synchronize to this price environment and we'll maintain flexibility that we could ratchet down or ratchet up a little bit if necessary. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then just as a follow-up circling back to 2016, you mentioned within cash flow, you could show some, I think you said modest growth or you keep your production level, I guess, where it's at. Are you assuming the current strip? And then kind of, what framework, what metrics should we think about for 2016? Is it going to be within cash flow? Is that the driver there? Can you just talk more about that? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think that first of all, we've got a deep inventory, projects that work at low prices, so we feel good about the inventory. I think the key is, we do and we've said from the get-go this year we had a heavy outspend Q1. I think we did an excellent job of getting in line in Q2. So as we start to think about 2016, we do want to be in line within cash flow and kind of living within our means. We're working through our planning process right now in great detail, and as that becomes a little bit more clear and we think about it, as we work through it, we'll be able to give a little bit more color on the next call. But in general, I think the important thing is, we've proven what we can do this year on a much lower decreased CapEx budget. We've proven that our costs \u2013 our dollars are going further. And I think with the initiatives we have and the way the cost structure, the G&A, we're going to be able to do more with even less capital in 2016 if necessary. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani of RBC. Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys. Just, I wanted to see if I can get some comments on the current kind of M&A market. I know you guys had talked previously in the year about trying to grab more acreage and looking at acquisition opportunities. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Leo, two things. Number one, I think when you look at the acreage market out there, there's stuff off the beaten path that I think we'd be interested in. And we don't budget for that, but we're clearly always looking for things that work in low price environment. I think when you step back and look at the bigger picture M&A market right now, some of the price decks that have been used to justify some of those transactions I think have been relatively high. And I think if you go back to our portfolio, at $80 we've got a lot of inventory that works. And so from my standpoint, we would look at things incrementally. The good news is we've taken the steps to put our balance sheet in great shape, so we've got capacity, we've got a credit facility in place and we've aligned our cost structure and our activity levels to current so we've got lots of flexibility. And I think the key is, is we've got a good portfolio and it would have to be something that made sense incrementally to what we have in terms of what we could add. So I think in general, the market's been a little pricey. These last transactions have been using a higher deck than I think what's bearing out right now. Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And I guess just thinking about your most resilient assets and where you have the deeper inventory in the low oil price environment here, should we continue to think Egypt and Permian get the lion's share of capital as you work your way into 2016? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: As we look at the back half of the year, we'll run approximately 16 rigs in North America. 13 rigs of those will be in the Permian. We'll have five in the Delaware, like we maintained all year. You'll have the other eight in our Midland Basin and Central Basin Platform/Northwest Shelf. You'll see us sprinkle a few more rigs into the Midland Basin second half of the year. You'll also see one rigs to two rigs from us in the Woodford, which is working quite well in the low price environment. And with the results that we mentioned on our Walker wells in the Eagle Ford, we're pretty excited about that as well. So when I look at North America, you'll see most of the work being in the Permian. Internationally, quite frankly, both Egypt and the North Sea compete very well and have great rates of return in terms of those projects. So we've scaled back there this year like we did in all the other areas, but we've got good inventory there. Look at what we're doing with Ptah and Berenice. I mean, we've now got 10 wells on, producing more than 23,000 barrels a day and that's constrained with facilities, there's room for that number to go higher and it's going higher as we speak. So I think we've got a lot of inventory at low prices that's going to keep us busy for a long time. Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to focus on the Eagle Ford that you've spoken in the past about, some geologic complexities in this part of the Eagle Ford. With the results that you're reporting in Area A, do you feel like you've cracked a code there? Is there a code to be cracked? Can you talk to the well costs and where this play stands and ranks relative to some of your other opportunities? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Brian. I mean, it is a little more complex. You've got, as I've mentioned in the past, your geologic setting is critical as well as your fluid. I mean, you've got everything from a dry gas to a black oil. You've got a wet gas, a volatile oil in there. There is higher clay content. It's a little thinner. So I think one of the key areas we have been able to make some progress on our completion procedures. And the latest four wells we brought on, the two Walkers and the two Raes, I think if you look at the two Walker wells, those wells in a little over three months have produced 83,000 barrels and 80,000 barrels of just oil alone. So we're pretty excited about those results. Well costs are in the low $7 million range and we feel really good about the economics. So, I mean, I think we've definitely made some progress. We're still working spacing. We will put a rig back to work there and continue to highlight the fairway there. But a big breakthrough for us technically on the fracking side. Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks. And then I wanted to shift to the Midland Basin and the Wildfire area in Midland County is an area you reported some good results. Can you talk about the running room there at Wildfire? And then if we look outside Barnhart at your Midland position, is this the area that has the greatest running room that you're most excited about, or would you highlight other parts of the portfolio within the Midland Basin? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: If you go back, the best place to go back and look at our portfolio there would be our November 20 update. We kind of circled the four counties. We showed around 200,000 acres as I recall. In addition to Wildfire, we've got our Powell-Miller area, we've got our Azalea area. We've got a lot of running room in there. We've really just had a rig or two working. So we're very encouraged. It's an area we've got room to add. If you go back to our November update, we were planning to run eight to ten rigs. We'll probably have two to four or five rigs in there roughly this back half of this year. So we've got a lot of running room and we're very encouraged by the results. We're also taking a pretty measured approach on our flow backs. We've been experimenting with the frac procedures. We've taken some of those up to 3,000 pounds per foot. So we're making headway in there and feel good about the inventory. Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of John Freeman of Raymond James. John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good afternoon. Just some questions on the backlog that you all laid out. You said at the end of the year you'd have roughly 80 to 100 drilled uncompleted wells. I think you ended last year around 200 wells. And I'm just trying to get a sense, would you consider kind of a normal backlog at somewhere around two wells to three wells per rig? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That would be a little high. What we'd say a normal backlog. You know, when we were blowing and going, we were down to maybe 1.5 wells per rig. Some of the pads, you'll get a few more. If you go back to, we actually came into 2015 with 216 wells in backlog, and I think about 45 wells of those were verticals. So when you look at our horizontal backlog, it was in the 160 to 170 range. I think the number was 166 wells. We've kind of guided to 80 to 100. And that number may creep up, but we feel good about that range. So it's going to be a little higher, and that's just a function of still keeping an eye on prices and keeping a handle on our CapEx spend in this low price environment. John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then just my one follow up along those same lines. I was a little surprised in the Permian that uncompleted backlog on the horizontal wells, it basically stayed flat despite going from 15 rigs to 10 rigs. Is there anything unusual that maybe caused that? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, when we backed off for the first part of the year, the completion costs hadn't come down yet. And right now we've currently got two frac crews in the northern portion of that and we've got two in the south, and we're just going at it very methodically. And so there's clearly room to accelerate, but we don't see any reason. And obviously in hindsight, with this recent drop in prices, we've been prudent not to do that. John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks, John. Good quarter. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Herrlin of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : Yeah, hey, John. In your ops report regarding the Delaware, you talked about doing different completions at Pecos Bend and Waha to eliminate water. What are you doing and how much could that save you on a cost basis going forward? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, John, one of the things that's not talked about a lot, we hear about the oil rates, we hear about the gas rates in the Delaware, we don't get a lot from other companies on the water rates. These wells are high pressure. The Delaware is characterized by very high pressure and you will get some very, very high water rates. And so we've been going in and really understanding our geology, using our 3D seismic, trying to understand how we want to complete these and buffer around areas where we can eliminate some of the water production. If we can take those water cuts down just a few percentage points, it makes a big difference, one on your cost, your LOE, because you're having to handle the water, not to mention your ultimate recoveries and that sort of thing. So we're trying to move the needle and produce these wells at higher ultimate oil cuts, and we're really trying to understand the geologic system and the framework to how to complete them. John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : Great. Then in terms of restructuring your organization, where are your technical operational centers is based? I mean, you have one obviously in San Antonio, but where else? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we've got an unconventional center in San Antonio. We've got our regions now. We've maintained a really three super regions as we have called them. Permian we have a big presence out there, which is handling our Midland Basin and Central Basin Platform/North West Shelf, our San Antonio has our Delaware Basin and our unconventional technology center. In the Houston region now, we've consolidated by closing Tulsa and collapsed our central region properties in with our Gulf Coast and actually Canada now reports into that. And we also have a technology center here in Houston that does a lot of support around the world on kind of our EP technology. So not to mention our Corporate Reservoir Engineering Group here, our enhanced recovery, and some other things. So really Houston, San Antonio, and then our regional offices. And then our international, we still maintain our presence in Cairo for Egypt and Aberdeen for the North Sea. John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, John. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Doug. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : We'll go with something more exotic than normal, but that's fine. A couple questions, if I may. First of all, if I could jump back to the Eagle Ford, the wells results continue to be pretty strong there. I just wonder if you could help us understand the relative attractiveness of pulling wells or pulling rigs out of the Eagle Ford in favor of some of the other areas as opposed to continuing with Eagle Ford activity. And in your answer maybe you could hit the HBP question as well, if you've got any issues there. And I've got a follow-up, please. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I mean I think the important thing there is we had to really focus in on the completion procedures and the geologic settings. And so actually backing down those rigs was a blessing for us. It's let us really spend some time. We've had a frac crew out there and we've done some work, and like I said, the last four wells we reported, we've made some significant progress in understanding the complexities geologically and what's going on in the Eagle Ford. When we start to look at the numbers today, it competes extremely well, which is why we're going to put a rig back in there. But we have got Woodford that competes very well as well as Permian, as well as some of our other areas. So we've got a deep inventory and a lot of areas competing for capital. And we're glad to be able to put it back to work in the Eagle Ford. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Are there any HBP issues in the Eagle Ford, John, that we should be aware of? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would say the acreage that we want HBP, will have HBP. So clearly the fair way there is we're understanding that. I mentioned that it is not a blanket fluid system, and so it's important to understand your system. But the acreage, we're not worried about losing acreage that we'd want to hang onto. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. My follow up is on (43:43). Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond of Simmons & Company. Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International : Good afternoon, John. Thank you for taking my questions. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome, Pearce. Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International : The first question is looking at your portfolio, I know this is hard to answer, but what do you think your base decline percentage is as kind of a whole company? And what do you think the maintenance CapEx is for the company to keep production flat? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I mean, if you look at our overall portfolio decline, we're in the 25% range. I mean, we highlighted in my prepared remarks today our Permian is around 22%. It's helped by our Central Basin Platform/North West Shelf. We're working through our planning process right now. And the one thing I would say is that if you look at 2015 relative to 2014, we now are going to show growth in North America on a significantly reduced CapEx program, but we're not in a position to give you guidance in terms of what would be \"maintenance\" in terms of \u2013 if you're asking maintaining flat production or that sort of thing. Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International : Okay. Thank you. And then my follow-up: service costs, you've done a great job of bringing those down. Looking at the Ford strip, it sounds like your expectation as service costs move lower, but a lot of the service companies right now negative cash margin. Do you think that service costs continuing to come down is realistic at this point? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I mean, I think there's two things. Number one, we were probably the earliest out there on the service side, and if you look at our savings today to the 25%, there's probably more than half of that is operational things and logistics and things we've done to get better. My conversations with the service companies have moved to, this has never been about margin, we're just asking them, they've got to make the margin to have a healthy business. It's been, though, we've got to sit down and figure out how to work together and how they get smarter, and how we can take costs out of the system that don't need to be passed through. So bottom-line on, it is in a low price environment, it doesn't matter if you're operating at negative margin, you're going to have to find a way to get more creative and get your cost structure down. And I think it's a matter of us rolling up our sleeves, working with them, and finding creative ways to take costs out of the system, which is what we do and that's what's we'll \u2013 that's what's happening right now across the industry, and that's what we'll continue to do in the future. I mean, when you look at the numbers second quarter, the market had pretty well baked in recovery into the mid-$60s on oil price back half of the year. And clearly that's not \u2013 it doesn't look like that's the case, and so as a result, the cost side's going to have to come down and we're going to have to work together and get in the trenches and figure out how to lower them. Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett of Sanford Bernstein. Bob A. Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yeah, a question on your realizations in the international assets. North Sea and Egypt looked pretty strong. Is that a seasonal effect, or what's driving that? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I don't know if Steve, wants to add something. I think it's just a function of having Brent pricing and predominantly oil-driven revenues. And Tom Voytovich has another comment too. Thomas E. Voytovich - EVP-International & Offshore Region : We get a pretty good gas price in the North Sea too, and our gas rates are up this year, so that's contributing to it as well. Bob A. Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And another would be, what's your exit rate for December 31 of this year? Do you have a sense of what that might be? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, what we said is, if you look at our fourth quarter, December's going to be our highest month. So we're not in a position to give that number at this point. If you take our North American guidance, we gave numbers in terms of we got actuals first quarter, second quarter, 307,000 BOEs, 317,000 BOEs, gets you to 312,000 BOEs for the first half average. Our midpoint of our guidance range would be 307,000 BOE for the year, which means you average 302,000 BOE the back half. We've said third quarter is going to be under that and fourth quarter we're going to see a nice rebound, so and I think there's room in those numbers. So with that, it's about all I'll say at this point. And we guided to kind of 164,000 BOE to 168,000 BOE on our international. And it's going to be probably relatively flat. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors : Thanks. Good morning. I guess I wanted to follow-up a little bit on your comment about keeping production relatively stable within cash flow for 2016. Is that intended to mean stable year-on-year 2015 \u2013 or 2016 versus 2015, or stable from the exit rate in 2015? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I mean that clearly we're not giving full color. I think what we've looked at and if you look at how we've been able to stretch capital this year, with where our cost structures are and the quality of our inventory, we feel like we can be relatively stable, and it would be more year-over-year. But we'll come out with something more definitive at the appropriate time. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors : Okay. Great. And then as a follow-up, you've done some great jobs on the overhead cost reductions. I appreciate all that extra granularity. Just curious, as you guys are looking at 2016 and beyond, you had a much larger rig count obviously, and activity level in 2015 \u2013 or sorry, 2014. What sort of activity level are you gearing the company for, or sizing the company for from an overhead perspective? I don't know if you put that in terms of rigs or what, but I'm just kind of trying to think through if there are more overhead reductions to come in 2016, or is it kind of already been done, and at what sort of activity level can it support? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we've been gearing our cost structure to a $50 price environment. The thing I would say though is, with the efficiencies and things we're doing today, it will not take the number of rigs in the future in a higher price environment, so I mean, I think we've got \u2013 we've set this thing up to where it's kind of an accordion that can take on a lot more activity, but we tried to gear it towards the low price environment because what I can't do is be wasting dollars in terms of G&A that I should be putting in the ground that can be generating results. And so we've tried to get real frugal on where we need to be, and then in typical Apache fashion, we feel pretty good. We've got a footprint in place that will expand fairly significantly because I think what we've done this year has been really healthy. We needed \u2013 as Apache and quite frankly as an industry \u2013 to look at our overall cost structure, even in a high-price environment. And we feel real good about where we are and how we've geared it and that we're definitely prepared for lower prices. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Yes. Good afternoon, John, to you, and your team there. If I could go back to a question that you touched on before, in your operations report, you mentioned that you had 70 horizontal wells in the Permian drilled and completed here at mid-year. Does that \u2013 how does that interact? Or how does that drilled and completed count progress as we go through the back half of the year? I guess what I'm really after is, are you really planning on working that down in late 3Q, early 4Q. And that's why we're going to see the bump-up? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'm going to let Tim Sullivan, who I have not let him handle a question yet. But I'll let Tim, jump in and talk through those numbers a little bit for you. Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President- Operations Support : Okay. For the Permian Basin, for our drilled and uncompleted wells, we're at about 40 right now. And as we work through the back half of the year and with our rig activity, we're going to exit the year at down to about 25 to 30 throughout the year, at the end of the year. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Got it. And you said you're 40 \u2013 you're at 40 right now, you said? Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President- Operations Support : In the Permian Basin... John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: About 45. We're at 45. Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President- Operations Support : We're at 45, right now. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Okay. Got it. All right. Thank you for that, Tim. And then if I could go back to some of Steve's comments... John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let me back up there. We're at, like, 70 right now. We'll end the year at about 45 with total Permian. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Got it. And so that includes \u2013 when you say total Permian, that's vertical and horizontal? Or what's the distinction there? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: 43 \u2013 it's going to be 50. We're roughly \u2013 we're projecting about 52, if you add verticals and horizontals for combined Permian. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Thank you, John. And then shifting over to more of balance sheet philosophy sort of question, and this might be for Steve, Steve, I appreciate you giving us the forecast of what's going to happen with the balance sheet here in the back half of the year, and I know that all of you guys there have worked really hard to put the balance sheet in the good shape it's in right now. But philosophically as you \u2013 you talked about \u2013 you're working on a \u2013 you're working in a $50 world, philosophically, what kind of constraints do you want to keep on your balance sheet, whether it's in terms of debt-to-EBITDA or some other relevant metric? And what are the circumstances that you'd have to see that would make either one lever up? Or use your balance sheet for a transaction? Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Charles. I think at this point and in this environment as of today, I think that the balance sheet in the shape that we've got it right now is probably pretty good. And I'd prefer \u2013 my philosophy would be, at this point in time we just keep it where it is. We may look at paying down some further debt. We'll look at that as we go through the second half, look at what the price environment is doing. And we get a really solid view of 2016 as we round out the planning. But right now I think the best thing to do is for us to sit on the balance sheet that we have. It's a good strong one. It's highly liquid and it's one that would allow us to be opportunistic if we felt like the compelling opportunity came along. I think John hit the nail on the head a few minutes ago, and that is that the opportunities that we've seen and we've seen some other people jump at, we wouldn't have put those under the column called, compelling, at this point in time. And it's just not something that we would be willing to sacrifice the balance sheet for in any material way. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Mike Kelly of Global Hunter Securities. Michael Kelly, CFA - Global Hunter Securities : Hi, guys. I was hoping you could maybe give us a bit of a preview of what's to come with this capital allocation review that you're going to unveil next quarter. And I'm really trying to get a sense of whether we should expect potential major strategy shift with this, the portfolio get shaken up quite a bit? Or is this more modest alterations around the edges? Thanks. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I would say in general, if you look at where we are today, you look at the rig count we're running and you look at the price environment, I don't have a crystal ball out there what's going to look like in a couple of months, but it's probably pretty similar, I mean we've done a good job this year. We're really drilling the things we want to drill. We don't have an area where we are in what I'd call development mode, with the exception of maybe our Ptah and Berenice area in Egypt. So as you start to think about going forward, I think capital is going to go to the best places, but we've got it in those projects that are working the best right now. And as you think about the incremental capital back half of the year, we're putting a little bit back to work in the Eagle Ford. We're putting a little bit back to work in the Woodford and obviously in the Permian in conjunction with our international. Michael Kelly, CFA - Global Hunter Securities : Okay. Great. If I go over to the Permian and the Delaware. It was good to hear that the Delaware well cost down 35%. If you go back to that November 20 presentation, you guys had 100% IRRs out there but a much higher oil price. Just wondering if you could talk about kind of mark-to-market today, lower costs, lower oil price, what project return you could be looking at right now? And then just the scale of the inventory there, the opportunity set that's really core Delaware. Thanks. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll let Tim Sullivan jump in on this one. Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President- Operations Support : Yeah, with the well costs we're seeing out there, about $5.8 million. And the IPs that we're currently seeing, we're well above our type curves. And even at the $50 oil price, we're seeing above 40% rate of returns out of the Pecos Bend area. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of James Sullivan of Alembic Global Advisors. James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Just sticking with the Permian for a second. There was a comment in the prepared remarks about a second landing zone in the third Bone Spring. Is that an option for stack development? And can you speak to how prevalent that appears to be? It may be early days on it, but any detail you might have. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Right now we're looking at them as individual zones, just another well that can be drilled from the pads. And the good news is we've got a full pad in and they're pretty compelling. And we're not in communication. And the second zone is performing really in line with the primary zone. James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Okay. Sounds great. So just maybe pulling back a little bit on the question of science work. And I did notice you guys pulled the rig out of Canyon. That might have been part of the plan that you guys were working on. But just in terms of high-grading the portfolio, how do you guys manage the balance between trying to allocate capital to areas that are going to be sure bets in terms of delivering program rate of return cash flows and doing more experimental work like in the Canyon and elsewhere, where you've got stuff you don't know yet and maybe costs that needs to come down, just philosophically? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, you've got to look at the areas where you think you've got the most impact or running room. And the real driver is you can't lower costs if you don't put a rig in there. And a lot of what we're doing this year is strategic testing, like the second landing zone in the third Bone Spring. We've just got to look at those and see how they stack up and see how many and then we'll go to work on that. But very few places right now in North America are we parking rigs on pads and trying to develop things. I think it's a function of right now setting up opportunities and really continuing to line our cost structure and get our returns at the levels we want before we'd go back to work with major development programs. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Edward Westlake of Credit Suisse. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks for squeezing me in at the top of the hour here. Just on the last comment you made about getting into development mode. No one has focused on this today, but say the oil price does go back up to the sort of $65 range that I think you referenced on the last call for some of the plays. How aggressive could you be in terms of the number of rigs that you could add over the next two years to three years? That's my first question and I have a quick follow-up. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, in terms of the number of rigs, I think we could add as many as we wanted to. We were running 93 last fall. So that's not hard. It will all come down to cash flow and economics and where's the cost structure. So what will be the driver \u2013 and we've been real consistent on that theme all year, is it takes the cash flow from our operations to be able to drive our programs. Over the long haul, we can go to the balance sheet from time to time if we felt like there was an opportunity. But in general, we want to be balanced and living within our means. And so it will be a function of the cash flow that we have to reinvest versus what other opportunities are out there. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And then follow on is on the international CapEx. I mean, it's still running something like $650 million in Egypt on an annual basis, if I just annualize your first half and $800 million in the North Sea. Any opportunity to get some deflation or activity cycling as you go forward to get some savings there in the CapEx program? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We are seeing savings there. The one thing in Egypt, you really never had the run up from 2009 on the rigs that you had in the service side in North America. So dollars go further, which is why we've been running a number of rigs in Egypt. When you look at the North Sea, we've had a lot of success. The one thing we haven't talked about is we sanctioned a project that's pretty critical to us. It's Aviat. It's a $200 million project over two years. It's in the numbers now this year. We're going to spend about $100 million. But the big deal on that is we're going to convert the field to field gas from diesel. And it's a very economic project, it makes great rate of return. But the big deal is is it's going to be safer, it's going to be environmentally friendly and it's going to give us field gas supply where we're not having to bunker diesel to well into a 2030 timeframe. So it's an important project. It's about $100 million. That's part of what's in that North Sea number this year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rowe of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Yes. Good afternoon. You mentioned earlier a balanced CapEx program. Do you think the capital spent on North America onshore versus international offshore this year, which is roughly 60/40, is that balanced enough? And does that really change depending on what part of the commodity cycle we're in? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, clearly we look at the opportunities, we look at the running room and we look at the economics of the projects. And the good news is we've got a great inventory in general. The international portfolio is less sensitive to the drop in prices, so it's a little more buffered on the returns. And then on the North America side, you can generate in some areas a little bit more NPV. So it's a balanced approach. We like where our mix is right now. We're generating cash, cash out of both Egypt and the North Sea. And that's kind of directionally where we want to stay. But right now we like that mix, and think it's serving us very well. Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just a quick question on the Mid-continent program. You're spending some capital in the Woodford/SCOOP area, but not much in the context of the whole portfolio. So I was just wondering if you can comment on the 50,000 net acres you've got there today, and just maybe provide some context around how sustainable you think that is for a company of Apache's size. Thanks. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, number one it's, we've got about 50,000 net acres that's predominantly Grady County. We've got a rig in there, we're going to put another one in, the economics work very well. Yeah, it's material, and it's material to that portion of our portfolio. Most of the acreage has been purchased in there, but we've got some nice positions that are clearly very economic at low prices, and clearly, we've got a lot of running room to develop on that acreage position. So it's not something we're looking to scale up necessarily, just because most of it has already been gotten, but we've got really economic projects in there and it can make an impact. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I just wanted to hear it one more time. Sorry. Guys, I had a follow-up that I don't think \u2013 I think that your operator thought that my follow-up was a clarification point. Anyway, Egypt, John. Obviously at the beginning of the year, you decided that this was going to be a core part of the portfolio. So I'm just kind of trying to understand this step-up in exploration activities. Is that something that has been a deliberate change in reallocating capital? I'm thinking with the PSC, you get the money back fairly quickly. And if so, what is the exploration or drilling backlog look like for Egypt on the go-forward plan? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, Doug, it's really more driven off of technology. I mean, we've got the seismic 3D interpretations and so forth. Our success rate, we're drilling fewer wells than we drilled last year, but we announced a 78% success rate and it's really just a function of the quality, the technical work we're undoing in unlocking the basin, and a lot of these stratigraphic areas and traps with the 3D seismic, we're just getting better, and we've got a better handle on the system. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And so is Egypt cash flow positive in the current environment? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Absolutely. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great stuff. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis of Capital One Securities. Richard M. Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon, John. Quick question : looking at the Delaware Basin, I noticed the Bone Spring completions during the second quarter. While it's solid, it looked to be a little bit lower in oil cut and productivity per lateral foot than those Condor wells that you reported in the first quarter. Anything done differently drilling those Condor wells, or was it just a particularly sweet spot? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I mean, I think it's going to be spacing and just the area that you're in within that Bone Spring. They're completed very similarly. So it's just a function of the area where you are. Richard M. Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.: And how much acreage does Apache have in that Pecos Bend area? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Pecos Bend is actually pretty small. I mean, you'd have to go back and look at our ops report. I think we're in the 7,000 acres to 8,000 acres in there. It's not a very big area, but it shows you how many landing zones we've got in a really nice little development area right there. Richard M. Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.: All right. That's it for me. Thank you. Operator : And our next question and our last question, I should say, comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Good afternoon. My fist question is just broadly looking throughout the various plays, your Permian 30 day rates look pretty strong. I was just wondering, are you practicing any rate restriction in any of the portions of the Permian? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Actually, Jeff, we are. I mean, we have gone to some managed chokes and we're doing some things there right now that are helping us. And we have also been very focused on our completions and sand concentrations and so forth. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then kind of taking Tom's remarks about the UK gas market in mind, the high rate S67 well, is that predominantly a nat-gas well and does it de-risk other potential similar locations? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Tom? Thomas E. Voytovich - EVP-International & Offshore Region : Indeed it does. It is a high rate gas well. In fact it's making about $50 million a day right now which is at the gas price we're getting, that's pretty much parity with oil right now on a BOE basis. There are other opportunities out there. We're just now getting started with our exploitation and exploration program of the recent 3D seismic, but there are more opportunities just like this in the field pays. These are individual fault blocks that were heretofore unseen or untouched at least. Operator : And there are no further questions in the queue. Gary T. Clark - Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay. Well, thank you, everybody. We look forward to speaking with you all on the next quarter conference call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache's Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. And Mr. Gary Clark, you may begin your conference. Gary T. Clark - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you and good afternoon. Welcome to Apache Corporation's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann; and CFO, Steve Riney. Also joining us in the room is Tom Voytovich, Executive Vice President of International and Offshore; and Tim Sullivan, Senior Vice President of Operations. In conjunction with this morning's press, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our quarterly earnings supplement, which summarizes Apache's regional operating activities and well highlights. The supplement also includes our revised full-year 2015 guidance, details of our capital expenditures in the quarter, as well as a chart that illustrates cash sources and uses and reconciles Apache's change in net debt during the third quarter of 2015. Our earnings release, the accompanying financial tables and non-GAAP reconciliations and our quarterly earnings supplement can all be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com. I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. Also, please note that in this morning's press we have consolidated our production and pricing information for the Midcontinent and Gulf Coast regions, which is were reported separately. I would now like to turn the call over to John. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Gary. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Before I dive into our results for the quarter I would like to take a step back to highlight the progress we have made so far this year. We have significantly streamlined and high graded our portfolio. The result is a focused North American onshore position with significant visibility and an international portfolio, which delivers tremendous free cash flow and very good exploration upside, as evidenced by our announcement last week regarding recent discoveries in the North Sea, along with our consistent exploration success in Egypt. We have strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity. We used the proceeds from asset sales to pay down debt and to increase our cash position. During this time, we also refreshed and extended our credit facility. Apache's balance sheet is now a leader amongst our peers, which we have accomplished without issuing new equity. Over the last third quarters, we reduced our drilling and completion program to a level that is appropriately aligned with the current commodity price environment. Notably, we generated a cash flow to CapEx surplus in the second quarter and would have maintained a surplus in the third quarter if commodity prices hadn't further eroded. This need for spending discipline is something that many in the industry are just beginning to realize and pursue. We have now achieved a nearly 30% reduction in our average well cost compared to a year ago. We have relentlessly pursued cost reductions both through supply chain efficiencies, as well as self-help through such things as improving wellbore and completion design. We made significant reductions in our run rate for both LOE and G&A costs, and we are taking steps to realize additional savings through the fourth quarter and into 2016 and beyond. We have delivered production growth both domestically and internationally, despite a dramatically reduced activity level. This result has been supported by our low underlying base decline, and today, we are again increasing our 2015 production guidance. And lastly, we continue to leverage our technical expertise and experience to seek out potentially high impact, new resource plays by consolidating acreage and expanding our footprint within our existing operational basins. We remain highly disciplined in this effort. And it is important to note that we are not paying the high prices for acreage that are common in the high profile resource plays. Now let me turn to our third quarter results. The third quarter was another good one for Apache as we delivered on our operational and financial guidance, made excellent progress on our cost reduction initiatives, and had tremendous success with the drill bit, most notably in the Permian Basin, Egypt and in the North Sea. As a result, we are increasing our 2015 production guidance range for both North American onshore and our international and offshore regions. During the third quarter, WTI oil prices deteriorated to an average of $46 per barrel, which was a 20% decrease from the second quarter average. However, the impact on our capital program for the quarter was relatively small as we had the foresight to pace our spending based on a $50 WTI plan price for 2015. As we indicated on our second quarter earnings call, our North American onshore production decreased sequentially in the third quarter, but the drop was less than anticipated. The decrease was primarily driven by facility downtime in the Permian, natural decline rates and the timing of well completions. We continue to expect North American onshore production volumes to increase for the fourth quarter, and we should exit the year with solid production momentum. Currently expect to finish the year at the high end of our upwardly-revised North American onshore production guidance range of 307,000 boe to 309,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which reflects normal fourth quarter weather-related downtime. Should we experience unusually severe or extended weather disruptions, production may potentially move to the middle or low end of our new guidance range. As I mentioned earlier, both Egypt and the North Sea have been performing very well this year. Production from our international and offshore regions averaged 180,000 boes per day during the third quarter. The key factors contributing to this strong performance were excellent production efficiency or uptime, strong sustained production from existing wells and significantly better-than-expected contributions from new wells completed during the quarter. As a result, we have increased our 2015 international and offshore guidance range, which Steve Riney will discuss along with other updated guidance items shortly. Our CapEx in the third quarter, before leasehold, capitalized interest and non-controlling interest, was $762 million. This is down 16% from the second quarter and 38% from the first quarter and puts us well within our full-year guidance for 2015. Across all of our regions, we are continuing to pursue and deliver substantial capital cost improvements. For example, in the third quarter, our North American onshore well costs were down approximately 30% from a year ago, which represents an improvement from the 25% decrease we cited last quarter. Now I'd like to turn to some of our key regional highlights for the quarter. During the quarter, we operated an average of 28 rigs companywide, 12 in North America, 10 in Egypt and six in the North Sea, which represents a decrease of six rigs from the second quarter. For the last two quarters, we have essentially been running our business at an activity level where cash flow was roughly equal to CapEx under a $50 WTI oil price deck. Given the decrease in oil price during the third quarter, we elected to defer the addition of two rigs in the Permian and one of our two planned rig additions in the Eagle Ford. As a result, we are decreasing the high end of our 2015 capital spending guidance range by $100 million to $3.8 billion. The deferral of these three rigs will not materially impact our 2015 production, but will result in a lower drilled-but-uncompleted well count at the end of 2015 than we previously expected. In the Permian Basin, our production was 170,000 boes per day, down 2,100 boes per day from the second quarter. This was driven by a combination of facilities downtime and the timing of well completions. Despite these factors, our Permian production remained strong. This underscores the importance of our relatively low base decline rate of 22%. Some notable activity during the third quarter came from new completions on our Condor lease at Pecos Bend in the Delaware Basin. We completed four wells that materially exceeded our type curve on a per lateral foot basis in their first 30 days. Returns in the Delaware remain very strong, as we have achieved average well cost reductions of approximately 40% since 2014. In the Midland Basin, we brought our first well pad online at Azalea in Western Glasscock County and are seeing encouraging early results. This area has the potential for multiple landing zones, including upper and middle Wolfcamp and lower Spraberry targets. We also brought online four good wells in our Powell-Miller area, three with an average 30-day IP of more than 800 boes per day, and another with a 24-hour test rate in excess of 1,600 boes per day. In the Central Basin Platform and Northwest Shelf, we are continuing to see excellent results from our horizontal Yeso play at Cedar Lake, which is delivering very attractive returns at these low oil prices. We have also dedicated resources to our water flood effort and other low-decline EOR opportunities. We have a significant low decline base in the Central Basin Platform, which helps underpin our lower underlying decline rate that I referenced earlier. While our overall Permian activity levels are down substantially from 2014, we remain committed to testing the resource potential of several new areas across our significant acreage position and to identifying and unlocking additional resource for the long term. Turning to the Eagle Ford. We brought eight wells online during the quarter in our Ferguson Crossing area with an average 30-day IP of 1,545 boes per day. We have made great progress in optimizing the completion design and increasing the productive capacity of these wells, while at the same time, continuing to drive down costs. We have one rig working in the Eagle Ford for the remainder of 2015. In the Woodford/SCOOP, we are in the early stages of delineating our approximately 200,000 acres gross and 50,000 net acres. During the third quarter, we brought online the Truman 28-6-6 #1H, which recorded a strong average 30-day IP rate of 1,949 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We have two rigs running in the Woodford/SCOOP for the remainder of 2015 to continue delineation and to advance our understanding of this attractive acreage position. In Canada, we put our seven-well Duvernay pad online in late October. Completion and connection of the pad came in under budget and the flow results we have seen to-date are very encouraging. The team is doing an excellent job with costs in Canada and we plan to drill another Duvernay pad during the upcoming winter season. On our Montney acreage in the Wapiti area, we have received substantial interest from third parties regarding a potential joint venture with Apache and we are advancing these discussions. Our objective for the JV is to fund early-stage drilling and infrastructure. This will enable us to jump-start the investment program and begin to generate cash flow without having to divert our capital dollars from other areas of the portfolio. Turning to our international operations; during the third quarter, Apache became the largest oil and gas producer in Egypt on a gross operated basis. We are very proud of this achievement and the fact that our gross production has returned to peak levels established back in 2011 and 2012. The key here is that while production is at peak levels, our percentage of oil and our margins are now considerably higher when normalized for commodity prices. It should be noted that these production levels have been achieved despite a 35% reduction in capital spending year-to-date compared to 2014. This highlights the operational success for our teams and our ability to do more even in a reduced capital environment. Our strategy in Egypt is to target primarily oil and liquids reservoirs and to keep our production profiles as stable as possible. Our late 2014 discoveries of the Ptah and Berenice fields have helped advance this goal in 2015. During the third quarter, gross production from these two fields peaked at over 26,000 barrels of oil per day. Our objective is to sustain production from Ptah and Berenice at a high rate for as long as possible through the drilling of additional development wells. In addition to Ptah and Berenice, we have seen new discoveries across multiple concessions this year, which will continue to support our production and free cash flow generation in Egypt. In the North Sea, we had a strong third quarter as our sequential production grew more than 4,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day from the second quarter. We set a new production efficiency record of 92% uptime in the third quarter as we experienced minimal platform maintenance downtime. We also benefited from better-than-expected performance from new wells drilled in both the Forties and Beryl fields. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, I should point out that we are likely to experience more weather-related downtime, some of which has already occurred in late October and early November. On October 30, we issued a press release, which announced three significant discoveries at our K, Corona and Seagull prospects, along with two high-rate development wells in the North Sea. While still early in the development phase, the ultimate reserve potential of the three discoveries combined could be greater than 70 million barrels of oil equivalent net to Apache. This represents a potential 50% increase over the 145 million barrels of total booked proved reserves for the North Sea at the end of 2014. For more information on these discoveries and a review of our extensive North Sea exploration and development inventory, please join us for our North Sea Region Update webcast on November 17 at 9 a.m. Central Time. Similar to my comments on Egypt, it's important to note that the outperformance in the North Sea has been accomplished despite an approximate 25% reduction in capital spend year-to-date compared to 2014. In closing, as we look to 2016 and beyond, our organization and our balance sheet are well prepared for the possibility of lower for longer oil and gas prices. We have in place the planning, capital allocation and operational structure and focus that will enhance shareholder value, despite the challenging commodity price environment. Our singular focus is to optimize the growth of our enterprise, while improving returns. We have made great progress so far; recognize that we have more to do. We are now working from a position of strength. We have a premium acreage position in North America and we have the people and the technology to grow it. We have best-in-class businesses running in the North Sea and in Egypt. These are prolific hydrocarbon basins with many years of exploration and development ahead of them. We have invested heavily in infrastructure in these regions over the last decade, and keeping this infrastructure full by its nature leads to very high rate of return projects. We have right-sized our activity level and we have driven efficiency improvements relentlessly on both capital and expense. We have a strong balance sheet and good long-term liquidity. And most importantly, all of these improvements are starting to show up with strong results for 2015 and good momentum as we look forward to 2016. We will remain focused on driving the expansion of our North American portfolio, as it is our primary growth engine for the future. However, our international businesses have a demonstrated track record of delivering very high rates of return, along with the ability to sustain production volumes through time and provide significant free cash flow back to the corporation. These are franchises that we will continue to invest in for the long term. I will now turn the call over to Steve Riney. Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, John, and good afternoon. As John indicated, Apache had a very good third quarter. We have made excellent progress on both operational and financial fronts. We also still have much more to do. Today, I will highlight Apache's financial progress, which will include our financial results for the quarter, the results so far from our relentless focus on costs, a review of our balance sheet strength and liquidity position, our outlook for the remainder of 2015, and an update on our strategic planning process along with some very preliminary thoughts on 2016. So let's begin with the third quarter financial results. As noted in our press release, Apache reported a GAAP loss of $5.7 billion or $14.95 per common share. Our results for the quarter include a number of items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published estimates. The most significant of those items is a ceiling test write-down of our oil and gas properties totaling $3.7 billion after tax. As in prior periods, the write-down in the third quarter resulted from the continued low commodity price environment. Under full cost accounting, our upstream assets are carried at historical costs. Each quarter, we compare this cost basis to discounted after-tax future net cash flows, which are calculated using trailing 12-month average oil and gas prices with those prices and period-end costs held flat into perpetuity. To the extent the net book value of the assets exceeds this amount the result is a ceiling test write down. Based on strip prices as of September 30, we anticipate a further ceiling test write-down in the fourth quarter. This expectation is detailed in our 10-Q. In addition to the ceiling test write-down, other unusual charges during third quarter included a $1.5 billion charge for an increase in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, primarily due to a price environment which is unlikely to allow the realization of those tax assets for the next several years. And $446 million of other items, consisting primarily of $148 million for the impairment of our investment in the Australian fertilizer plant, $146 million for mostly price-induced impairments for gathering transportation and processing facilities, and $95 million of trailing tax effects associated with our previously-discontinued operations. Our earnings for the quarter adjusted for these items totaled a loss of $21 million, or $0.05 per share. Offsetting the low-price environment were positive results on the operational side, including strong delivery of production volumes across all regions, continued improvement in costs as our extensive efforts to reduce G&A and operating costs are showing through to actual results, and great progress in capital efficiency, as we are getting more from every dollar invested. Let me now turn to costs. The low oil price environment and reduced activity across the industry are continuing to result in downward pressure on costs. As oil and gas prices began to soften late last year, Apache moved decisively to ensure a leading-edge position to capitalize on cost deflation in the oil service industry. Since that time, we have made continual progress reducing both capital and operating costs. Capital spending year-to-date continues to track in line with our expectations. We have invested $3.8 billion through the first nine months of the year. As we have stated in the past, our guidance on capital spending excludes capital attributable to our one-third partner then Egypt, capitalized interest, leasehold purchases and capital associated with divested LNG and associated operations. Excluding these items, we have spent $2.9 billion through the first nine months of 2015. This level of spending is tracking in line with our prior guidance. On the lease operating expense side, our third quarter LOE was $9.03 per boe, which is 18% lower than the third quarter of 2014. On a year-to-date basis, we are averaging $9.33 per boe, which is 12% lower than the same period last year. So we continue to make significant progress on bringing down operating costs. On our second quarter conference call, we reported a 25% decline in our run rate of gross G&A costs. At that time, we stated our goal was to enter 2016 with a gross G&A run rate of approximately $700 million, representing a decrease of over 30% from our run rate of more than $1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014. As we further refine our 2016 budget, we continue to find additional G&A reduction opportunities and are now tracking slightly ahead of our goal. We will discuss this in more detail when we announce our formal 2016 budget in February. Next, I would like to make a few comments regarding our balance sheet and liquidity position. Over the past year, we implemented a number of measures, which has significantly improved our overall financial strength. Today our balance sheet and liquidity are amongst the strongest in the industry and we have accomplished this without issuing additional equity. We have made tremendous progress in a very short period of time and I believe this will serve us well as we continue through a difficult and unpredictable industry environment. So far in 2015, we have paid down $2.5 billion of debt. Currently our net debt is less than two times annualized 2015 adjusted EBITDA. We have extended our nearest long-term debt maturity to 2018, with only $700 million maturing prior to 2021. We have restructured and refreshed our current credit facility at $3.5 billion, which now matures in June 2020. And we have retained $1.7 billion of cash liquidity. And to ensure that we sustain this strong position, we have reduced our activity to a level where we can attain cash neutrality in the current price environment. I would like to remind everyone that as previously discussed, the repatriation of proceeds from some of our foreign asset sales has triggered a U.S. income tax payable of approximately $560 million. Actual cash payment of this liability will occur in the fourth quarter of this year, thus some might consider our net debt of $7.1 billion at the end of the third quarter as closer to $7.7 billion. However, so far in fourth quarter, we have signed agreements for the sale of non-upstream assets, which will bring in approximately $500 million in cash proceeds. $391 million of this is for our interest in the Australian fertilizer plant, which we have already closed and proceeds have been received. The remainder is associated with various non-core assets with no associated reserves or production. We expect to close those transactions in the fourth quarter or early 2016. In total, the proceeds from non-core asset sales largely offset the impact of the previously-mentioned tax payment on our net debt the end of the third quarter. Apache's strong balance sheet and liquidity position provide both security for the near-term, as well as tremendous flexibility for the long-term. We can comfortably fund the highest-quality projects across the portfolio, as well as our exploration, strategic tests and new play programs. We can do this within our continued cash flow from operations, while retaining significant flexibility for any strategic opportunities, which may arise in the future. We anticipate a successful finish to 2015, as Apache continues to deliver strong operational results. Therefore today, we are increasing our production guidance and decreasing our capital guidance for 2015. We are increasing our full-year guidance for 2015 North American onshore production to a range of 307,000 boe to 309,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. On a pro forma basis, this represents more than 2% year-over-year growth, despite significantly-reduced capital spending. John highlighted the extensive drilling and operating success we are enjoying internationally as well. Accordingly, we are raising our full-year 2015 international and offshore production guidance to 172,000 boe to 174,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 6,000 boe from our previous guidance of 164,000 boe to 168,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. On a pro forma basis, this represents year-over-year growth of 10% to 12%, despite significantly reduced capital spending and demonstrates the quality of our international portfolio. With regard to our 2015 capital spending, we are lowering the top end of our guidance range to $3.8 billion from $3.9 billion. This reflects our decision not to pick up three rigs in the onshore U.S. during the back half of the year, which John spoke about in his prepared remarks. In the planning front, Apache has taken significant steps towards achieving our objectives of enhancing returns, while living within our mean on a cash flow basis. As we refine our plan for 2016 and beyond, we will continue to make further progress. Our plan includes a rigorous process for capital allocation to our highest-quality opportunities, while achieving an appropriate balance between short, medium and long-term capital investment horizons. This is particularly important considering the price environment we are in today and the outlook for the future. As we look specifically at 2016, we are actively evaluating multiple scenarios with respect to commodity pricing and capital allocation. We are not in a position to provide guidance ranges for 2016 as our review is still underway. I will share, though, that the plan will be based on a few key things, which we have established this year. Notably, we will plan a capital program, which we believe will keep us cash flow neutral for the year. We will not attempt to balance cash flow within each quarter, but instead to level-load activity for the year. We will fund the capital program from operating cash flows; we will not use asset sales. We have not yet finalized the capital allocation plan for 2016 and are not prepared to provide a view on production volumes. However, we are prioritizing capital to projects providing the best combination of highest rates of returns, greatest value for the future, and a bias toward near-term production and earnings. We will provide more specific guidance, including our production outlook in February, when we discuss the 2016 plan in more detail. Finally, I would like to address one of our accounting methodologies, which we are examining for a possible change. In order to more closely align our financial reporting and to create more comparability with our large cap E&P peers, we are evaluating a conversion from full-cost accounting to the successful efforts accounting method. The primary reasons we are contemplating the change is because successful efforts is more commonly used by our comparable peers, creates less long-term price-related volatility on the balance sheet, and more accurately reflects the matching of expenses within the period in which they are incurred, especially as it relates to exploration expense. We'll have more to say about this in coming quarters. In closing, as we plan for the future, we are not idly waiting for commodity prices to recover. We have already taken calculated steps consistent with today's environment. As a result, we are well positioned to continue to profitably grow Apache, through an actively managed investment program in a potentially lower-for-longer commodity cycle. I look forward to a successful conclusion to 2015 and would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions and answers. Operator : Our first question comes from Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Company. Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International : Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just to follow-up on the commentary just now about matching cash flow with CapEx, would that include the dividend or would the dividend be upside of that? Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. For 2016, our goal would be to match that including the dividend. So it would be cash flow neutral. Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International : Including the dividend. Okay, great. And then I know you're working through this still, but could you provide any color on what you think maintenance CapEx might be to hold exit rate 2015 production flat through 2016? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Pearce, this is John. What I would say is the best thing to do is look at 2015 right now. I mean, we've guided to $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion of CapEx spend. As you will recall in February, we guided to relatively flat North American production and slight growth internationally. When you look at the CapEx levels, we had $1 billion outspend in the first quarter alone for this year. When you look at the capital numbers, clearly now, with the updated ranges today, at 307,000 boe to 309,000 boe on North America and 172,000 boe to 174,000 boe on international, we're showing 2% plus growth in North America and 10% to 12% growth on the international side on that type of capital program. I think the best thing we can do given this price environment; the commodity price is going be a big driver. As Steve mentioned, we're going to live within cash flow. And so as we start to pour that plan, that's a big key. And I'd say, looking into 2016 with the reductions we've had on the cost structure side, specifically on the costs we have in the house at this point at 30% down, capital's going to continue to go further. I can also tell you that a lot of that CapEx this year was spent early in the year when we had higher costs. And we see things even now that are going to point to lower costs going forward. So, the best thing to do is look at what we've done this year and kind of translate off of that. Operator : Your next question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, guys. Maybe just a follow-up on that, the 2016 budget parameters. I mean you say that living within cash flow excludes asset sales and includes the dividends. So, do asset sales then just create a buffer on your balance sheet? How do you contemplate the redeployment of those proceeds such as the $500 million announced in the quarter? I mean it's been a relatively sizable program and just curious how you think about that capital coming back into the business. Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I'll let John comment on this as well. But I think at this point in time, the right answer to that question is the fact that we're not contemplating any material asset sales in 2016. And therefore, we're not planning to spend the proceeds on any of those. And therefore, cash flow neutrality needs to be on an operating basis. Now, that's \u2013 I'd just caution all of that with the fact that we're not going to get dogmatic about being cash flow neutral. And we reserve the right to not be cash flow neutral. But it's going to be \u2013 it's a prudent assumption going into the year at this point in time. And then 2016, I have no doubt, will be just as exciting as 2015 has been. And we'll, no doubt, adjust plans as we go through the year. But I think the prudent thing to do at this point in time is to go into the year planning on being cash flow neutral. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it, I would agree. Maybe my second, if I could, following up on the comments on the JV process, the positive progress there and then the plans to run three rigs in Canada next year versus zero today. Can you discuss the cost environment in Canada and how you kind of see those returns stacking up against the rest of your portfolio? I presume that the JV details could also augment those returns for you. If you could. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: In general, Evan, we want to remain cash flow neutral in Canada. I mean what I don't want to do is take cash flow from our Lower 48 properties and spend that in Canada. So that's the main reason why we are looking at and are making progress on a JV in the Montney. And the way that would be structured is we would be using other capital to get that program kicked off. In terms of how the Montney and the Duvernay compete in terms of \u2013 they compete very nicely with the portfolio. And I'm going ask Tim Sullivan to dig in a little bit on the cost structure we're seeing on the Duvernay at this point. Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President- Operations Support : Yes. As John mentioned, we just put on the first Duvernay pad that we drilled. This was a seven well pad. It was a spacing test. Half of the section was designed to test eight wells per section; the other half to test six wells per section. We're going through a third party facility. So, we're a little bit curtailed, we only have four of the wells online. But those four wells are doing just under 13 million boe (34:50) a day and 3,350 barrels of condensate per day. Again those are curtailed with the flowing tubing pressure of over 3,300 pounds. Next week we hope to have that facility up and running and we'll be able to bring the other three wells online. And we should have everything flowing at capacity on December 1. Now to the cost structure question, last year we spent about $18.1 million drilling one-off wells out there. We went to pad operations. This year where we had two walking rigs and we batch drilled each section of the well. We were able to reduce our well cost by 36%, 8% of that savings was due to foreign exchange, but the rest of it was primarily due to cost savings and operational efficiencies. And most of those operational efficiencies were made up on the completion side. In those seven laterals we did 124 different frac stages and we pumped that in just six days. We averaged 7.9 fracs per day, with only 34 minutes between stages. And we got down to as low as 6 minutes between two of the stages. So we were pumping 82% of the time when we had the equipment on location. And really the Canadian team there, we're really leveraging the learnings that we had from the Horn River drilling that we've done in the past. And we see future costs there as we get our water facility in place even going down further and we think we can get these costs down to $8.5 million to $9 million per well. Operator : Your next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, good afternoon, everybody. John, I appreciate the disclosure I guess on the pursuit of a joint venture. If I could just have a quick follow-up. If we look at your position up there, it seems that, if I'm not mistaken, the bulk of your locations is in the area where you have the lowest working interest. And the highest working interest I guess you've got about half the number of locations, so I'm thinking Duvernay being the one with the small working interest. So when you think about structuring a joint venture and I guess getting someone to fund you or carry you, is that the kind of structure we should think about? In which case, what kind of working interest would you anticipate getting to and how would you think about that? I've got a follow-up, please. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, Doug, I got to be a little bit careful. We're talking about the Montney and it's an area we have 100%. So we do not have partners. We're not at this point looking at the Duvernay. The area you're talking about, the current wells we've got about 37.5%. We're in there with Chevron and, of course, their joint venture partner. So, we're really talking about an area in the Montney where we have 100%. And that is the area we're looking at and I don't want to get into too much color because we're in the heat of battle of negotiations. But it would be structured where we would obviously be able to keep the majority and would get significant carry upfront, and which would unease our infrastructure and costs going, over the next couple years. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I appreciate that. I don't know if I missed that earlier. That would make perfect sense given your working interest there. Thank you for that. My follow-up is really about \u2013 I realize you don't want to give production guidance, but if you look at the spend level in the third quarter \u2013 and obviously there's a lot of moving parts on production declines and so on. But if you continue to spend at the third-quarter level, based on what we saw in Q3, what would you say your underlying decline rate would look like? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I mean in terms of our decline rate, if I take North America, we're still running about a 25% overall decline, our Permian's about 22%. I do anticipate those numbers coming down as we start to look at the pace because we just haven't drilled as many new wells this year as we have historically. So I think those numbers will be dropping slightly, but it's early. We're still working through those planned numbers. The one thing I would say about the back half of the year, as we alluded to on the call, with the drop in prices we held off picking up three rigs, two in the Permian and one in the Eagle Ford. And it's going to have very minimal impact; we're still in a position to raise guidance on our North American position. So, we feel good about our properties, we feel good about how we're executing and we're really starting to see efficiencies drive into the numbers. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great stuff. I will jump back in queue. Thanks, John. Operator : And your next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good afternoon. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Brian. Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: How are you thinking about the role of the international assets here, particularly in light of some of the positives you reported on in Egypt and the North Sea? Are there any changes in, A, how these areas are competing for capital relative to the rest of the portfolio, and B, the strategic thoughts on retaining versus divesting? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, Brian, I think at this point, when we look into the future, our primary growth is going to come from North America. I think you have to recognize the benefit of the portfolio. And we came out with that early in the year with the drop in prices, and the international both are less sensitive to the drop in oil price and you've seen that come through in cash flow from both those operations. Secondly, if you take Egypt and take Ptah and Berenice, tell me how many places in the world you can have a discovery and within seven, eight months you're producing from two handfuls of wells to 26,000 barrels of oil a day? So we've got quick tie-in, quick infrastructure to those things, so very high rates of return. In the North Sea, there's a couple of things there. Number one, we've invested in the infrastructure. We spent $1.3 billion over the last decade at Forties and that infrastructure is in really good shape. That's why we can operate at 92%. In our Beryl area we spent over $300 million on the infrastructure there. So, I don't want to steal the thunder from our November 17 update on the North Sea, but with those three discoveries, one of them is a little longer cycle time, Seagull, but the other two, I think you'll be surprised at how quickly we can bring those projects on through tie-backs to the infrastructure that's already in place. So, we look at it as a portfolio. Our long-term growth is going to come from North America clearly, but in this price environment right now I've got a lot of optionality in the international and a lot of very high rate of return projects that bring immediate volumes that compete extremely well that we can tie in and complement. I think we've also proven through the exploration success that both of the international assets, those franchises have a lot of running room. And we'll get into more color on the North Sea here in just less than two weeks. Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thanks. And my follow-up shifts to the Permian Basin. I believe you said in the ops update here there are no rigs currently in the Barnhart area, which had been a source of your development. As you've shifted more towards the other parts of the Permian, can you talk about how we should look at execution and growth relative to when you were a bit more Barnhart-focused, and what you see as differentiating or we should expect as differentiating Apache's Permian position relative to others who are in the region? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I mean I think the first and foremost thing, Brian, is we've got a very strong position across all the basins and that gives us lots of flexibility and optionality. Right now in the Permian we're really not in development mode, we are still doing a lot of strategic tests. We're in the process right now of drilling our three Spraberry shale wells that we're very excited about. So I think as we moved into the deeper parts of the basin, we've seen better results in the Midland Basin and I think the Delaware, we've got strong results in the area we've been active there, Pecos Bend and our Waha. So I think what you'll see is we know how to execute, we've been in position where we've done a lot of pad drilling, and so we know what that means and our asset quality is just as good as anybody's. We just happen to be spread out across the multiple basins. So as we look at 2016, we won't be, and it depends on the price environment we're in as to how much development dollars we shift into Permian, but the big thing we're going be focused on right now is trying to mirror our cost structure to that price environment. And we're making headway there. And I think the one thing that you can look to is just our results on some of the plays. And I think we stand up well with anybody. Operator : Your next question comes from Bob Morris with Citi. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you. John, in the Permian and pulling back two rigs you originally intended to add, does that mean you're going to ramp up now to only 16 rigs by year-end? And where are you right now? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Right now, we're at 14 rigs, Bob. I think we really just deferred. And all that's really done for us is we will end the year with fewer drilled-but-uncompleted wells. But we felt like that's the prudent thing to do right now based on where oil prices are and trying to feather our programs going into 2016, living within cash flow. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And so the two rigs you won't add, where had you intended to add those rigs in the Permian? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: They were going to be predominantly Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then the drilled-but-uncompleted inventory you ran, where is that? And is that steady-state or is that an inventory that you can draw down further in 2016? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I mean first and foremost, we had guided to on the last quarter a range in the 80 to 100 range of drilled-but-uncompleted horizontals in North America. We now see that number ending the year around 60 plus. And it's not that during the quarter we consumed a lot of drill \u2013 picked up our completion pace. We just elected to wait. And the main reason is we've got visibility on costs coming down further. We've got a few drilling rigs that some term is rolling off in the next 30 days. And we're going to see those rig rates drop 37%, 38%. So we made a decision over this last quarter not to, in fact, we lowered the top end of our capital guidance range by $100 million. We decided not to spend that $100 million now, and we can wait and spend those in the future. Operator : And your next question comes from John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Generale. John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : Yes. Hi. Not trying to preempt the North Sea discussion that you will have in two weeks, but is it fair to say that you may dedicate a little bit more CapEx in 2016 to the North Sea? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: John, I wouldn't see, mix is changing too much. I mean, we've had, if you look at our capital this year, North Sea actually is down 25% over last year. So I don't see a major shift. You're not going to see us shift a ton of money by any means. But I think you're going to see we've got a lot more running room. And we've got some very material things that could come on that can be very impactful. John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, John. Regarding the switch to successful efforts, any kind of a ballpark sense about what kind of a balance sheet hit it would be? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll let Steve jump in on that one. Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I was hoping you'd answer that, John. No, I think it's too early to say. We've got in the 10-Q what we believe the fourth quarter hit to the balance sheet will be because of staying on full cost accounting and further softness in the commodity prices. But it's too early to say at this point in time what will happen if and when we switch to successful efforts to the balance sheet. Operator : And your next question comes from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks for taking the question. Just coming back to the Midland. Obviously the industry has had success delineating various different zones in the Delaware. I mean you've got some very good wells out at the Pecos Bend. You've got a lot of wells or you've got some acreage, Wildfire, Azalea, Powell-Miller, over on the Midland. I'm just wondering if you are able to give us, having had more time working with the acreage, some kind of, as others do, inventory that works at say $50 in terms of well locations and then $60, $70. So some un-risked sense of the inventories in those two particular areas. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: What I would say, Ed, is we have not done a \u2013 I mean, obviously we're working those areas. We continue to test lots of zones. You look in the Midland Basin, we've got multiple zones in there we're testing. As I mentioned, we're about to drill or in the process of drilling Spraberry shale wells. You look at our Pecos Bend area; we've gone in now and added a second landing zone within the 3rd Bone Springs. So, we continue to make progress. We continue to test zones and really scope opportunities and work on the cost structure so that when we get to a position where we feel like it makes sense to put more rigs and more capital to work, we're ready to do that. In terms of counts, we have not come out with a bunch of updated numbers. Really, the best look would be going back to what we did a year ago where we did a very deep look at North America on November 20, 2014. And obviously, we've got areas where things have, you know, we've drilled some things and things have expanded, but we haven't really come out with any major announcements or counts at this point. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): I guess the issue was the oil price was a lot higher and the cost structure is very different today, so I was just trying to get an update on that. But maybe switching to break-evens, I mean the Seagull discovery, I mean have you \u2013 I don't want to \u2013 again steal thunder from what's coming in a few weeks, but what sort of oil price do you think it would take to get that hooked back into infrastructure? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Not going to really get into that right now, but I can tell you the nice thing about the North Sea is the deliverabilities and the high rates those rocks bring. They're very forgiving; tremendous rock. We announced in the press release a very substantial test rate on a very, very low drawdown. So the deliverability is going be fantastic there, but I'm not in a position today to disclose F&D. That will be a longer \u2013 a little longer-range project. It's four miles kind of south of our Forties area, but we will have some color on November 17. Operator : And your next question comes from John Freeman with Raymond James. John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So nice well results in the Delaware Basin, but what really jumped out at me in particular was you completed 22 wells in the area versus 12 last quarter, despite still using just the one frac crew. And so I'm trying to get an idea of \u2013 you completing nearly twice as many wells with the same number of frac crews. Is that all huge efficiency gains or is there some other moving parts that doesn't make the quarters comparable? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, I think, number one, is just the pace at which we had them, but number two, we are making tremendous headway on efficiencies everywhere. We also are getting wells drilled significantly faster as well as getting more wells fracked. Tim gave you some color on the Duvernay pad, how quickly those went off. We're seeing tremendous success operationally everywhere, and that's just a function of it doesn't take as much equipment to go as far as it did a year ago. John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. And then on Egypt you disclosed that you've initiated this large seismic reprocessing project that you hope to have done by the end of the year. I guess I'm just curious sort of what kind of took place in the field that kind of drove the decision to have it; what you hope to kind of get out of that shoot or reprocessing? Excuse me. Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President- Operations Support : Reprocessing? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: In Egypt. Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President- Operations Support : Yeah. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: In Egypt. Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President- Operations Support : And where is it, or? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: He asked the scope and what we thought we could get from it with the large reprocessing in Egypt. Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President- Operations Support : Well, as you're well aware, the whole basis of our success in Egypt is that 3D seismic, and with continued technological advances, improved processing and basically combining previous shoots, adding new data, we just get a more clear picture of the same areas we've been working for years. So, all this is going to do is help us identify previously unseen prospects and continue to deliver inventory in future years. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And two perfect examples are Ptah and Berenice. I mean they're right there at our Khalda Offset area, right near our existing stuff. So, it's just a function of taking the technology up that can quantify and get really solid ties and \u2013 to the \u2013 some of the plays out there. Operator : Our next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, guys. John, last quarter you and Steve spent some time laying out your new planning process where you guys were running scenarios at three different price points for WTI, or for oil I should say. I was wondering if you could give us an update if you've moved where those prices are in your scenarios. And perhaps more broadly, as you've been working that process over the last several months, if you're finding any areas that are surprising to you either in terms of their rigidity or new areas of flexibility you've discovered. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Charles, we did move those. I mean we started the year with a \u2013 kind of a $50, $65 and $80, and we planned on $50 at the start, and then in April, May timeframe when things ran up into the mid-$60s we were using those decks. Clearly, we've moved those down. In the last call we talked kind of $45, $55, $65. We're not too far off of those cases as we think about things today. The one thing I would say is the resiliency of the projects moves a little bit. The bigger tie is what are you doing with gas prices and how does that link in with some of these plays that we've got that have a little higher GOR and gas rates? But in general, we're seeing projects and wells in every play that works very well and it's really a function of the cash flow that comes off of those scenarios and the cost structure assumptions are the biggest variables we're trying to get pinned down right now. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Got it, that's helpful. And that's also kind of a good lead in to my next question where I wanted to ask about the Eagle Ford, where you guys have turned in really some really good-looking rates there. But one of the things that I attuned to there is that you have 80% liquids and a lot of times that can include NGLs, which are kind of actually the lowest molecule on the totem pole right now. So can you \u2013 and I know the oil, gas, and maybe the NGL mix varies a bit as you go up and down dip in this play, but these most recent wells you've had in your Area A \u2013 the Eagle Ford, the Lambert and (54:58) where do those fall on the percentage of black oil? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll have Tim give you that exact number. I still think we're in the 55% range roughly in terms of black oil. The Area A wells, those are still within our Ferguson Crossing area. So if you go back to our November 20 update a year ago and you look at that type curve Area A, Charles, they're going to layer right in on those \u2013 on that type curve, which I think we gave those numbers specifically there. I'm looking over here if we've got the percentages from that type curve, but I know we disclosed those. Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President- Operations Support : Yes, we can get back with you on those, Charles. We've got those numbers for that area. Operator : Your next question is from Leo Mariani with RBC. Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys. Just a question around the acreage acquisitions that you all were talking about. Looks like you did a healthy portion. You guys commented that you're sort of paying prices which were a lot less than some of these hot high-profile deals we've seen recently. Can you guys just let us know where are you concentrating the acreage acquisitions? Is it sort of Delaware, Midland, or Midcon? Can you just help us with where you're looking to buy? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Number one, we're within our core areas. Number two, we are looking at some things that would be significantly lower than what I'd call the retail prices that are being paid. And it's where we're applying technology and science and we think we've got some things that could be material. It is new ventures acreage, so there's always risk with that and that's why we wouldn't want to talk about it now. But we're talking significant multiples lower in terms of what that acreage might be viewed as and what it potentially could be worth. And I think that's the zip-code that we feel like makes the most sense in this price environment because we can pick it up and we can work the science and you can have something that could be material. Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. I guess jumping over to Egypt; you obviously had good performance in terms of your increases in gross production in the third quarter. I noticed that the net production, though, went down a fair bit in 3Q versus 2Q, despite lower commodity prices. What's driving that and how should we think about that going forward? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's the tax barrels. I'm going let Steve Riney give you the exact color on that. Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Leo. As you said, rightfully, so gross production in the third quarter was about 3.5% above second quarter. And actually net entitlement to the venture owners, us and Sinopec, was also up about a little over 3%, about 3.5%. The issue is around tax barrels and tax barrels on a three-thirds basis for the PSC owners, tax barrels were down 20,000 barrels a day between oil and gas. And the reason for that, there's no economic effect of that. It's the in-quarter reimbursement of taxes associated with income taxable in Egypt. And the bottom line issue is in the third quarter, prices had declined to a point where there was practically no taxable income. As a matter of fact, in one month I think we had a negative tax barrel effect. And so therefore both the tax, income tax expense and the barrels associated with reimbursing that income tax expense were much lower. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors : A lot of mine have been answered, but I guess just curious on the longer-range outlook. You guys have talked about providing that in the past. Should we expect to hear about that in February as well, or what sort of I guess timeframe in your current thinking; when we will hear about that? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, Michael, we obviously will give you a full-year 2016 update in February, and we'll see how things look at that point. So, clearly we're working multi-year plans. But obviously with the volatility and the uncertainty around the prices right now, we're going to continue working that. Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors : Okay. And then just looking at the mix of production in North America; got a bit more NGL relative to our expectations in gas. Is there anything driving that from an infrastructure standpoint or is that more the focus of the capital program from a reservoir perspective? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, I mean actually I think when you look at our numbers, and you look at 2014 and 2015, and our percent oil in 2014 averaged about 52.7% for the year, we'll be 52.5%. We're right in line. In fact if you add our NGLs in 2014 and 2015, 65%. So you step back, big picture there's virtually no change in our mix. And we have the luxury of being more liquids rich and heavy than a lot of others. I will say you see some small swings when we've ramped our programs down to some of the GORs and some of the programs. For example, last quarter we brought on some gas here, Area A, Eagle Ford wells. If you look at our North Sea production, we've shifted more to the Beryl area where we've got a little higher GOR than we do at Forties, but I should say we get a very premium gas price up there, over $7. When you look at the Permian right now, we've had as a percentage more in the Delaware. Those wells had the luxury of having very flat GORs, but they come on at higher levels. So it's just a function of the portfolio, but in general, if you step back and take a big picture look, it's virtually where it's been historically. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: The first question I wanted to ask is if we could talk about the Canyon Lime upper interval. You highlighted shallower declines. I was wondering, are you doing anything to influence the decline? And while we're at it, how pervasive do you think the upper interval is throughout your acreage? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, I'm going to \u2013 I'll let Tim Sullivan comment on the Quanah well on the Canyon Lime. Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President- Operations Support : The Quanah well is a new landing zone. It's the only well that we've got in that landing zone. It's been producing about 2.5 months. The IP 30 on that was about 1,662 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In that 2.5 months it's cumed already 91,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and is still doing just under a 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. So, it is a standalone well, but it's just a function of getting the spacing right. We have not been curtailing production or anything. It's just a shallower decline and we're excited about that zone. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay, thank you. And I wanted to just ask another broader question. Not too long ago there was talk about revived industry interest in vertical Permian drilling based on returns. I was just wondering have you increased your vertical drilling any on that basis? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Jeff, we haven't. But I think, one thing I'll say we've got the luxury of having about 60 water floods and seven CO2 floods in the Permian. And we have a ton of vertical locations; infill locations that do make economic sense. And right now we do not have any vertical rigs running. That's an option that we could have for next year. But we have not made any decision at this point yet. Operator : Our final question for today comes from David Tameron with Wells Fargo. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, glad I got in. John, can you \u2013 if I think about the Permian and just obviously the slowdown in the rig count and look at production quarter-over-quarter down-ticking a little bit, gas up, oil down, when should we anticipate that inflection point as far as when we see stabilization and then move higher? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I mean I think that really comes down to when we feel like it's time to go back to work with more rigs. And so I mean that's just a function of how much capital we want to spend and we made a decision not to add two more rigs here within the last quarter. We'll go and do 16 and see, but I mean that's all going to hinge off of cash flow and investable projects. I mean we've got a ton of inventory that they're chomping at the bit to drill, but it's just a function of trying to go back to our guiding principles of living within cash flow, focusing on our returns, focusing on the cost structure and growing value for our shareholders. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right, everything else has been asked. Thanks, appreciate it. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Gary T. Clark - Vice President- Investor Relations : Jennifer, thanks. We're going to wrap it up there. We're well past the top of the hour. We had a long queue today, so if we didn't get to your call please give the IR team a call. Otherwise, we look forward to speaking with you in February. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call and you may now disconnect.",

My name is Kim and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache Corporation Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Gary Clark, Vice President, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference, sir. Gary T. Clark - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann, and CFO, Steve Riney. Also joining us in the room is Tim Sullivan, Executive Vice President of Operations. In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you've had the opportunity to review our quarterly earnings supplement, which summarizes key financial and operational data for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, along with details regarding our 2016 production and capital spending outlook. We have revised and streamlined the structure and content of our earnings supplement and believe you will find it more useful. Also, please note that we've changed our capital expenditure guidance convention to reflect a more comprehensive picture of our spending. Specifically, the 2016 capital spending range we provided in this morning's press release includes all exploration, development, gathering, transportation and processing expenditures. It also includes budgeted leasehold acquisition costs and capitalized interest and capitalized G&A. The only element of our 2016 program that our guidance will continue to exclude is capital attributable to our minority interest partner in Egypt. As a result of this guidance change, references made on today's call to 2015 and 2016 capital spending may not be directly comparable. Our earnings release, the accompanying financial tables, and non-GAAP reconciliations, along with our quarterly earnings supplement can all be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com/financial data. We also plan to post on our website a section which contains responses to any questions that arise on today's call for which we do not have readily available information to answer. I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable explanations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to materially differ from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. And I would now like to turn the call over to John. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Think you, Gary. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'd like to begin with a recap of the significant progress Apache made in 2015. I will then provide some highlights from our fourth quarter and full year results and conclude with some specific thoughts on what to expect for 2016. Apache underwent a significant transition in 2015. While the external environment remains challenging, we entered 2016 better positioned to operate and thrive in a lower-for-longer commodity price environment. In addition to completing an extensive refocusing of the portfolio, we have taken other decisive actions to position Apache for an extended low price environment, which included aligning our capital spending with cash flows, attacking the cost structure, continuing to high-grade and build an inventory of attractive opportunities that will deliver strong returns under a low oil price environment, and strengthening our financial position and liquidity. While we have made tremendous progress, we are not yet finished with these efforts. We streamlined our portfolio, exiting Argentina, Australia, much of the Gulf of Mexico and two world scale LNG projects. We are now focused on three principal areas, a substantial onshore North American acreage position with an abundant inventory of high-value growth opportunities, anchored by our extensive Permian footprint, and sustainable free cash flow generators in our higher cash margin North Sea and Egypt businesses, each with many years of low risk drilling opportunities and significant exploration potential still ahead. In the current low oil price environment, our more conventional international assets continue to generate strong cash flows and better rates of return than many of our operations in North America. In the North Sea, we are uniquely positioned. We have two large-scale hydrocarbon accumulations in Forties and Beryl, available high-quality platform and pipeline infrastructure and per unit cash operating costs that are one-half the industry average. These advantages make tiebacks to existing infrastructure very economic even at current oil prices. In Egypt, we benefit from the cost recovery aspect of our production-sharing contracts such that they help to mitigate the impact of declining oil prices on our cash flows. Our international positions clearly differentiate our portfolio, play to Apache's long-standing strengths and remain economically attractive in this low oil price environment. A year ago, Apache took more decisive action than many of our peers and reduced activity levels in pursuit of cash flow neutrality. We anticipated the lower-for-longer oil price scenario and recognized the importance of protecting value through more disciplined investment. Accordingly, we reduced capital by more than 60% in 2015 from 2014 levels and focused on bringing cost into alignment with the current oil price environment. Specifically, this time last year on our fourth quarter 2014 conference call, I stated that \"We would consider using our balance sheet only to capitalize on lower acreage cost and other potential opportunities that may occur, rather than to drill wells and chase production in a depressed and volatile oil price environment\". We stuck to that view throughout 2015 and continue to do so today one year later. At the same time, we instituted an even more rigorous capital allocation process through which we continually monitor the delivery of the capital programs and reallocate capital as value maximization demands. Motivated by the deteriorating oil price environment and a goal to achieve cash flow neutrality, we attacked our cost structure in 2015 with a thorough review of G&A, LOE and capital costs. Specifically, we rationalized our entire organizational structure, eliminating layers of management and consolidating office locations. And we reduced staffing levels to more closely align with forward-looking activity levels. As a result, today, our run rate gross G&A costs are more than 30% below where they were in the fourth quarter of 2014, and we're a much more streamlined and efficient organization. Our lease operating costs, on a per boe basis, were down approximately 10% year-over-year when excluding the tax barrel impact of our Egyptian impairment charges. Our lease operating costs, on a per boe basis, were down approximately 10% year over year when excluding the tax barrel impact of our Egyptian impairment charges. Our average drilled and completed well costs in North America were down 35% from fourth quarter of 2014 to fourth quarter of 2015. Furthermore, we strengthened our financial position and liquidity in 2015. A portion of our asset divestment proceeds were used to reduce debt by $2.5 billion and to build our cash balance. Apache began 2016 with approximately $5 billion of liquidity, including nearly $1.5 billion in cash. We value this position highly and we'll be very thoughtful in this price environment as to when and how we utilize it. One of our primary operational objectives both last year and in 2016 is to assess, refine, optimize and add to our extensive inventory of captured drilling locations in North America in the context of lower-for-longer oil prices. This is a comprehensive process that involves acreage delineation, wellbore redesign, completion optimization, spacing and landing zone tests, acreage swaps, purchases and sales and the creation of full field development plans. In addition to these activities, extensive science and testing continues on our new play concepts which could lead to significant growth opportunities down the road. The goal of this work is to fully define and prioritize the highest rate of return, highest growth and most efficient North American opportunities to leverage in a better investment environment. Apache is now very well positioned for whatever lies ahead. We are living within our means and anticipate being cash flow neutral in 2016 and beyond, until such time that the price environment warrants higher investment levels. We have a very competitive cost structure and continue to drive overhead, LOE and capital costs lower. We are building high-quality drilling and exploratory inventory for the future. We have the financial strength and liquidity to sustain us through a prolonged period of potentially lower oil prices and to propel us into a better investment environment. Our sound decisions and decisive actions in 2015 leave us much better positioned today. We have improved our financial position without raising equity and without reducing or eliminating the dividend. At this time, we plan to be cash flow neutral in 2016 and to invest primarily to enhance our long-term prospects for future growth. Maintaining strong credit quality through disciplined capital allocation is a prudent approach in this environment, thus we re targeting either unchanged or lower net debt levels by the end of this year. Now I'd like to turn to the fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. We are very pleased with our delivery around items that were within our control. We exceeded our production goals across all of our regions in both the fourth quarter and for the full year 2015. We accomplished this on a capital program of $3.6 billion, which was at the low-end of the original guidance range we established on our earnings call a year ago. During the fourth quarter, North America Onshore production averaged 308,000 boes per day, which, as expected, was a sequential increase from the third quarter production of 306,000 boes per day. The increase was primarily due to the timing of completions and solid well performance. In the Permian Basin, despite some fairly significant weather downtime in December, our fourth quarter production achieved an all-time quarterly high of 174,000 boes per day, up 2% sequentially from the third quarter. Growth was driven by the Delaware Basin, where we completed 13 new wells, primarily targeting the Bone Springs formation at Pecos Bend. In the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform and Northwest Shelf, we completed 61 new wells and delivered very good results in the Wildfire area, with our first three lower Spraberry tests as well as three strong wells in the Wolfcamp on our June Tippett pad. We also drilled some excellent wells on the Northwest Shelf at our prolific Cedar Lake Yeso play. Please refer to our quarterly earnings supplement for details on some of these key wells. As we look ahead to 2016, our Permian rig count will fall from 10 at the beginning of January to four by mid-year. Permian well completions are expected to be down 75% year-over-year. These actions clearly demonstrate that we are willing to let our Permian production decline until we are in a better investment environment. Turning to the North Sea, volumes were approximately 72,000 boes per day in the fourth quarter, a 2% decline sequentially from third quarter production levels. We brought three new development wells online during the fourth quarter at very good rates, but these were offset by a maintenance turnaround at the Beryl Bravo platform. 2015 was an excellent year for Apache with the drill bit in the North Sea. We brought online 19 new development wells with an average drilling success rate of 83%. We also confirmed three significant new exploratory successes with the previously disclosed Callater or K, Corona and Seagull discoveries, which we expect will contribute very material reserve and production adds in the coming years. In 2016, we are significantly curtailing our North Sea development drilling program and plan to employ no platform rigs during the second half of the year. As a result, North Sea production will decline slightly in 2016 compared to 2015 production of just over 71,000 boes per day. In Egypt, gross production declined roughly 3% sequentially from the third quarter. Total liquids volumes declined 2%, while downtime and bottlenecks at certain gas processing facilities reduced our natural gas volumes by 5%. On a net basis, excluding Sinopec's minority interest and the effect of tax barrels, production actually increased 5% sequentially to 102,000 boes per day. This a function of the significant oil price decline from third quarter to fourth quarter, which resulted in Apache receiving more cost-recovery barrels under our production-sharing contract agreements. The key driver in Egypt during 2015 was the tremendous success of our drilling program and production ramp-up at Ptah and Berenice. As of year-end, we had 12 wells producing in these prolific low GOR oilfields. Since November 2014, Ptah and Berenice have produced more than 8 million barrels of oil. In 2016, we plan to stabilize gross production from these fields near 30,000 boes per day. Overall, our gross production volumes are expected to decline in Egypt this year. However, net volumes should increase as falling oil prices drive an increase in cost recovery barrels per our PSCs. On the cost side, I noted earlier that our average North American Onshore well costs were down approximately 35% from a year ago. We are continuously improving on this front and continue to see significant well cost decreases since the beginning of the year. Some of the key plays where we are seeing exceptionally low drilling and completion costs include : the Delaware Basin, where we have visibility to Bone Springs and Wolfcamp wells of approximately $4.5 million; the Midland Basin, where horizontal Wolfcamp and lower Spraberry wells are projected to be drilled and completed for less than $4 million; the horizontal Yeso play on the Northwest Shelf in the Permian, where our well costs are trending below $2.3 million; and the Woodford/SCOOP, where our latest pacesetter was drilled and completed for only $7.5 million. In 2015, we reinvigorated Apache's culture of cost and returns discipline. While we have made great progress on costs, they are not yet fully aligned with the current price environment. Further reductions are planned for 2016 and it is imperative that we remain relentless in our efforts to drive costs down further. To achieve this, we will foster innovation and utilize technology that redefines the cost structure of both Apache and the industry. The key takeaway is that these are not just belt-tightening efforts in response to price weakness. Apache is implementing structural changes that will continue to accrue to our bottom line, regardless of where oil prices and service costs go in the future. To that end, we believe that approximately one-half of the well cost reductions achieved over the past year are permanent, while the other half will fluctuate with future service cost changes. Regardless, Apache will always focus intently on controlling what we can control and remaining highly disciplined through the cycle. As we turn our focus to 2016, strip oil prices are now roughly 30% to 35% below where they were a year ago. This underscores the importance of continuing to foster a new mindset and approach to capital allocation and managing our cost structure. Similar to our approach in 2015, we are using a conservative price deck for 2016 budgeting that reduces the risk of inadvertently putting ourselves in the position of a material outspend and helps to sustain our credit quality. Our capital allocation process for 2016 is built around four key themes : living within our means and achieving cash flow neutrality for the year at $35 oil, focusing capital spending on protecting the asset base and optimizing and building inventory, maintaining a relentless focus on both capital costs and operational expenses and remaining flexible, opportunistic and ready to react as conditions change. With this in mind, we announced in this morning's press release a 2016 capital budget of $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion, the midpoint of which represents over a 60% decrease from 2015 and over an 80% decrease from 2014 levels. In our North American Onshore portfolio, Apache is fortunate to have the vast majority of our high-value leasehold already held by production and only four rigs under longer-term higher day rate contracts. As a result, our obligation spending is relatively limited this year. At $35 oil, we do not believe spending on development wells and attempting to maintain production levels is a prudent or economic use of our precious capital dollars. We would rather leave those barrels in the ground and come back to them in a higher price environment or as drilling and completion costs become more aligned with oil prices. The majority of our capital spending in these onshore regions will focus on strategic testing and delineating our vast acreage position, such that we optimize our growth potential and efficiencies when it is appropriate to put more rigs back into the field. In light of these considerations, our capital allocation to North American Onshore plays is approximately $700 million or 45% of our total capital budget. At this level of investment, we anticipate a pro forma production decline of 12% to 15% in North America Onshore compared to 2015. Our decision to reduce North American Onshore investment by more than 70% and to allow production to decline in 2016 is simply due to our desire to preserve our financial position in the current investment environment. It is not indicative of our asset depth or quality. We are confident that our North American asset base can withstand this reduction in investment without any deterioration of the future opportunity set or impact our ability to arrest the decline and begin to grow again at the appropriate time in the future. To provide some context around the sustainability of our onshore North American asset base, we estimate that, in the current price environment, it would require a spending level of approximately $1.6 billion or an incremental $900 million of capital above our planned 2016 program in order to hold North America Onshore flat with the 2015 average of 309,000 boes per day. This $900 million dollars of incremental capital is roughly equivalent to the amount of incremental cash flow Apache generates annually with a $10 per barrel increase in oil prices. This implies, with an average oil price of $45 per barrel, Apache's North American production base could be held flat with 2015 levels. At current drilling and completion costs, this maintenance spend would equate to an incremental annual average program of approximately 20 rigs in North America. I mentioned earlier that Apache is looking for a better investment environment before we materially increase our capital program, let alone, consider outspending cash flow on an annual basis. We have the luxury of waiting for an environment in which oil prices and service costs are fully synchronized such that fully burdened and full-cycle economics in our North American drilling programs achieve double-digit rates of return. It is not enough to deliver the 15% to 30% unburdened wellhead returns at $35 per barrel oil that are routinely quoted in industry presentations. At Apache, we have elevated our standard for investment of shareholders' capital. Our drilling programs must deliver full-cycle fully burdened rates of return in the mid-to-high double-digits in order to deliver an acceptable return on capital employed for the shareholder. That said, we are thoroughly assessing our entire North American footprint and will be prepared to put rig lines back into each of the Pecos Bend, Evergreen and Waha areas of the Delaware Basin and our high rate of return horizontal Yeso play in the Northwest Shelf. We could add several incremental rigs in our Midland Basin, Wolfcamp and lower Spraberry plays, where we have 200,000-plus net acres in four core counties. Our Woodford/SCOOP position will support an incremental drilling program for several years to come, and we have numerous high-volume multi-well development pad locations ready to go in the Duvernay and Montney in Canada. When oil prices rally further, our Eagle Ford and Canyon Lime will come back into play and contribute to North American growth. On the international side, Egypt and the North Sea continue to deliver projects with solid rates of return and strong net present values. Because both are economically advantaged under our assumed $35 oil price, we are allocating approximately $800 million or 50% of our 2016 capital budget to these regions. We project pro forma production from our international and offshore regions this year will be relatively flat compared to 2015. The budget I just described is based on specific oil price and service cost assumptions. If oil prices recover or if average well costs decline such that our cash flow is higher than we have budgeted, we anticipate directing the majority of the incremental dollars to onshore North America. This could in turn mitigate a portion of the decline implied by our guidance. Before I conclude, I would like to outline some of Apache's potential future growth drivers as we look beyond 2016. With higher oil prices and access to more internally generated cash flow, our North American Onshore production will stabilize and return to growth. This growth will come from lower cost wells that generate better returns than Apache's historical North American programs. High-graded plays with years of running room across our 3.3 million gross legacy acres in the Permian will drive growth from the Bone Springs, Wolfcamp, lower Spraberry, Yeso and other formations. This would be supplemented by the Woodford/SCOOP, Montney and Duvernay post 2016. Additionally, we have acquired a substantial amount of relatively low cost acreage since early 2015 that could be incremental to the growth potential that resides in our legacy Permian and Anadarko positions. In the North Sea, we also see excellent growth potential. In mid-2017, we plan to bring our Callater Discovery online at a 30-day IP rate of approximately 15,000 boes per day, net to Apache. Following that, in mid-2018, we anticipate bringing online our first tertiary injectite discovery, Corona, at a rate of 5,000 to 10,000 boes per day net. Looking out a bit longer term, Corona has de-risked a string of exploration prospects that will be drilled in the future. Over this same timeframe, we will conduct exploration activities on our 2.3 gross million acres offshore Suriname. While it is still early, we're excited about the potential for this area, which lies in the newly confirmed oil province. We have included a map of our Suriname position in our quarterly earnings supplement for your information. In closing, Apache is well-prepared for a lower-for-even longer oil price environment. As experts debate when or if oil prices will increase and to what levels, Apache will continue to focus on the things we can control. Our primary strategic objectives in 2016 are : manage to cash flow neutrality after dividends and end the year with unchanged or lower net debt levels; preserve our strong financial position; protect our asset base; and optimize and expand our high-quality inventory of growth opportunities through strategic testing and exploration. Our goal is to emerge from this commodity price downturn with top-tier financial strength, a robust inventory of high rate of return drilling opportunities in North America and a sustained capacity to generate free cash flow from our international assets in Egypt and the North Sea. While we don't know when prices will recover, we do know that the prudent choices we're making today will enhance our long-term success. Quite often, it is during downturns like these that the choices companies make can either set them up for long-term success or set them back. I believe we have significantly strengthened Apache Corporation despite the challenging price environment and we are positioning ourselves to succeed through the recovery. I will now turn the call over to Steve Riney. Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, John, and good afternoon. As John indicated, Apache had a very good year in 2015. We made outstanding progress high-grading the portfolio, driving down costs, aligning capital programs with cash flows and proactively strengthening our financial position. We entered 2016 well-positioned for the challenges our industry will face. Today, I will highlight Apache's financial progress, which includes our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, progress with our ongoing cost reduction efforts, a review of our financial strength and liquidity, and our outlook for 2016 production and capital spending. So, let's begin with the fourth quarter financial results. As noted in our press release, under generally accepted accounting principles Apache reported a loss of $7.2 billion or $19.07 per common share. Our results for the quarter include a number of items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates, the most significant of which are ceiling test write-downs, impairments and tax adjustments associated with these items. As in prior periods, these write-downs resulted from the continued low commodity price environment. Our loss for the quarter adjusted for these items was $24 million or $0.06 per share. Before I turn to other items, I'd like to comment on our reported production volumes, which include a significant downward adjustment related to the Egyptian tax barrels. The terms of our Egyptian PSCs provide that the payment of income taxes attributable to our entitlement will be made by EGPC from their share of production. We then gross up our results for these taxes which are paid on our behalf. Egyptian income taxes are calculated based on book income and are recorded as tax expense with an equal and offsetting amount in oil and gas revenues. Thus, there is no impact on net income as the revenues and tax expense we record each quarter offset one another. The revenue effect of this gross up is also recorded as production volume in our operating results. These are referred to as Egypt tax barrels. In the first three quarters of 2015, we recognized book income, tax expense and, thus, tax barrel production volumes. In the fourth quarter, we incurred a $1.3 billion charge related to impairments and write-downs in Egypt, driven by the continued fall in oil prices, which resulted in a significant loss for the quarter. This loss has the effect of offsetting nearly all of the previously reported tax expense and tax barrels in the first three quarters, thereby, resulting in a large negative income tax expense and negative tax barrel production in the fourth quarter. The total impact of the impairment is a loss of 38,280 barrels of oil equivalent per day of volumes in the fourth quarter or 9,649 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year 2015. Because the Egypt tax barrel volumes have no economic impact to Apache and, as we see in the fourth quarter, can fluctuate materially from quarter-to-quarter, our pro forma production guidance always excludes tax barrels. We believe this non-GAAP view of production is more reflective of underlying economic production volumes. Now, let me turn to capital expenditures and costs. In 2015, Apache's intense focus on driving internal efficiencies along with the significant downward pressure on third-party service costs resulted in substantial efficiency gains in both capital and operating costs. Capital spending came in at $678 million for the fourth quarter and $3.6 billion for the full year. This was at the low-end of our original guidance range. As a reminder, our 2015 capital spending guidance excluded capital attributable to our one-third partner in Egypt, capitalized interest, opportunistic leasehold purchases and capital associated with divested LNG and associated operations. As Gary noted at the outset of this call, we are changing our CapEx guidance convention in 2016. Our guidance now includes all anticipated capital spending categories, except capital attributable to our minority partner in Egypt. This should make it easier to track our capital spending plans for the year. On the lease operating expense side, our fourth quarter LOE was $10.04 per boe, which is 3% higher than the fourth quarter of 2014. For the year, LOE average $9.49 per boe, which is 9% lower than 2014. Underlying improvement in these metrics is masked by the negative Egypt tax barrel volumes in the fourth quarter. On a like-for-like basis, excluding this impact, our lease operating expenses were down 4% and 10% per boe, respectively, in the fourth quarter and full year 2015. We have also spoken to you about progress on our G&A costs. As a reminder we consider G&A to be our gross cash expenditures for all costs above field operations. The stated goal was to exit 2015 with a G&A run rate of $700 million, a decrease of over 30% from our run rate in the fourth quarter of 2014. I'm happy to say we achieved this goal. As we look ahead to 2016 we continue to find overhead efficiencies and we are reducing our G&A cost estimate for this year to a range of $650 million to $700 million. Next, I would like to make a few comments regarding our financial strength and liquidity position. In 2015, we reduced our debt levels from year-end 2014 by $2.5 billion, ending the year with $8.8 billion of total debt. We retained $1.5 billion of cash, which we may utilize to further pay down debt. We ended the year with net debt of $7.3 billion. Our latest 12-month net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio as of December 31, 2015 was just under two times. Apache's nearest long-term debt maturity is in 2018 and only $700 million or 8% of our total debt portfolio matures prior to 2021. We restructured and refreshed our $3.5 billion credit facility, which now matures in June 2020, and combined with our cash position, we now have total liquidity of approximately $5 billion. At this time, our financial condition and liquidity are very strong, and we have accomplished this without issuing equity, without reducing the dividend and without selling core strategic assets. And to ensure that we sustain this strong position, we have chosen to reduce our capital spending this year to a level where we can attain cash flow neutrality at $35 oil. Both John and I have mentioned the term cash flow neutrality a few times in reference to our overarching goals, so let me be clear what we mean by this. Cash flow neutrality means the capital program, debt service and the dividend are all funded through cash from operations, with little or no underpinning from financing or portfolio actions. Cash from operations includes all operating costs, including corporate overhead, and includes movements in working capital. At this time, we anticipate only small, non-core, non-producing asset sales will be necessary to achieve cash flow neutrality in 2016 assuming $35 oil prices. We could choose to spend more capital. But as John outlined, we believe that preserving our strong financial position and our credit quality through cash flow neutrality is the best approach for our shareholders in this price environment. In the event prices improve during the year, we stand prepared to ramp-up our investment activity within the constraint of cash flow neutrality. Now I'd like to provide some more detail on our 2016 capital program. As John discussed, our budget of $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion is the product of a $35 oil price assumption for the year. Since we are in a very volatile price environment and our overarching goal is for cash flow neutrality, the capital budget will flex up or down with price movements. Capital in 2016 will be allocated on a prioritized basis to protect the asset base, further optimize and build high-quality inventory for the future, conduct certain longer-cycle high-impact exploration activities and to pursue higher-return development activities which remain economically very attractive at these low prices. There are two types of spend required to protect the asset base. First, we have to maintain the assets and keep them running efficiently. This includes workovers, recompletions and maintenance, and will represent approximately 30% of our capital program. Second, in some places, we have to engage in activity to maintain ownership of the mineral rights or to preserve leases. This includes continuous drilling activity or lease-holding production maintenance and will represent approximately 5% of our capital program. We will allocate roughly 30% of our capital to key exploration activities and new play tests to continue building and high-grading our drilling inventory for the future. This will include continuing our highly successful North Sea exploration program, key play tests on some of our existing acreage in the Permian and Anadarko Basins and seismic commitments in offshore Suriname. The remaining 35% of our capital program will go to development activity. Most of this will be allocated to the North Sea and Egypt, where we continue to see development opportunities that work very well at low oil prices. This is primarily due to contract structures and tax regimes that provide favorable capital recovery mechanisms and higher average cash margins. We suggest our investors review our earnings supplement for additional detail regarding region-by-region netbacks. We also have a number of onshore North America drilling locations in the Permian Basin and Woodford/SCOOP that remain economically attractive. However, these areas will receive less allocated capital due to the capital budget being constrained by cash flow. While we have reduced development activity on these assets, the leases are preserved and development will ramp back up in these assets and several other areas when oil prices and costs are better aligned to deliver more attractive returns. Our reduced 2016 capital spending level is appropriate and prudent for a $35 oil environment. The end result is that we expect our total pro forma production to be in a range of 433,000 to 453,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This will represent a decline of 7% to 11% from a comparative pro forma volume of 486,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015. These volumes exclude Egypt minority interest, Egypt tax barrels and the effect of divested volumes from the 2015 base. If prices rise allowing more capital to be deployed, we anticipate most incremental investment would be directed to onshore North America and this would offset some of this anticipated decline. In 2016 we will continue to optimize LOE, but given our expected production decline and a mix shift to slightly higher-cost international production, we do not anticipate materially lower operating costs on a per barrel of oil equivalent basis. In terms of 2016 income taxes, we expect our adjusted earnings global effective tax rate to currently be in a range of 15% to 20%. Obviously, lower than what we would typically expect, our effective tax rate is being driven primarily by an expectation of very low book income. Going forward, we will be able to provide updates to this rate as the year progresses. Also, we can provide some guidance around expected cash tax payments. We will pay the remainder of the income tax accrued for repatriating 2015 foreign sales proceeds of $85 million in the first quarter. Given the low commodity price environment, we currently believe that our cash tax payments in 2016, including cash taxes associated with the Petroleum Revenue Tax in the UK, will be minimal. For the first quarter, we are providing pro forma production guidance for North American onshore of 290,000 to 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our international and offshore production is guided to 180,000 to 185,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which excludes Egypt tax barrels and the Egypt minority interest. Our projected capital spend in the first quarter is $500 million to $550 million, or approximately one-third of our full-year 2016 budget. In closing, our prudent approach in 2015 has put us on firm ground and helps ensure resiliency in this difficult and unpredictable environment. As a result, we are prepared to endure a potentially lower for even longer commodity cycle while retaining our ability to dynamically manage our activity levels up or down as commodity prices and service costs dictate. Through all of this, our primary goals will remain unchanged. We will live within our means, maintain our strong financial position, build quality development inventory for the future and invest to improve returns and grow value for our shareholders. We look forward to a successful 2016. And I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : And your first question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Company. Your line is open. Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International : Good afternoon. John, does the Egyptian government help drive your thinking regarding capital allocation among your different regions? I assume the Egyptian government wants you to produce as much oil and gas as possible to bolster both domestic energy security as well as the Egyptian treasury. And so just curious if it limits your capital allocation flexibility in any ways. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Pearce, clearly they would like us to invest more money, but like everything else, we decide where we put the investments in place, so it has not had an impact. We are going to generate cash flow in both Egypt and the North Sea, and they understand that. And it obviously will flow with our budget as we're flexible. Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International : Great. And then my follow-up around the offshore Suriname blocks, if this is a legacy position from when Apache had a more defined exploration program like in New Zealand, Cook Inlet and places like that, is this a bit more of a one-off or is this a type of business that you want to build over the next few years? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think it is something \u2013 it fits with our international portfolio. Actually, we've got a lot of questions about that position, Pearce. We felt like it was important to go ahead and get a map out there. We drilled the well this year, our Popokai well, and we actually had picked up the other block prior to either Exxon drilling there Liza well or our well going down. So, we've got those two blocks there, not a huge capital commitment. We're going to be shooting seismic over block 58 this year, and we'll go from there. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good afternoon. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hello, Brian. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: With regards to the CapEx and activity reductions, when we think about your cost base and your lowered cost, including on the SG&A side, when it's time to ramp back up, what is your operational and scale flexibility to do this? And what flexibility, if any, may be reduced, at least, temporarily? I mean, in other words, if you wanted to take the Permian and bring it back to a 10 or 15 or 20 rig count again, would this require re-staffing and the passage of time to make that happen? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Brian, with the way we've done our staffing, we strategically designed this organization for a $50 plus world. So, we do not envision needing to add a lot of staff to be able to flex back up. Clearly, I think if you get into a significantly lower time period where you've got lower prices, 24 months, 36 months out at that point you'd probably reduce further. But, we've maintained the flexibility so we can ramp up our capital programs when appropriate. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks so much. My follow-up is actually a follow-up to Pearce's question on exploration. You made a couple of references to adding exploration opportunities. Was that specifically the Suriname reference that you've already kind of spoken to here or are there other opportunities including the onshore that you're pursuing from a more exploratory perspective? And can you give us more color beyond Suriname if the answer is yes to that? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I mean, it obviously includes Suriname. We did a good job of highlighting our North Sea exploration program last November, so we've got some exploration wells to drill in the North Sea. We brought on two discoveries late-2014 in Egypt in Ptah and Berenice, so we have active exploration programs both North Sea, both Egypt, Suriname and then obviously in North America. We have acknowledged that we acquired some acreage last year at some low prices that we think can be prospective. And while we've shut down for the most part our development drilling in North America, we will be doing some strategic testing in and around our existing asset base, and on some acreage that we've picked up. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, guys. I appreciate the color and added disclosure. My first question, you guys cut CapEx, I think, deeper than expectations to get within cash flow post-dividend and avoided, at least, so far, some moves made by peers. And maybe you alluded to this in your opening comments. Yet to be clear, on the strip, do think that these moves mitigate the risk of needing to issue equity or losing your IG rating at Moody's? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Clearly, at this point, we took actions and we're very aggressive last year. So you look back to 2015 and 2016, we've had a track record of reducing activity and really trying to gear our business and mirror our activities to the price environment we're in. We've done that, we worked hard last year to improve our financial position, which we demonstrated we did. If you look back over second quarter, third quarter of last year we had an outspend of approximately 14% which was significantly lower than most of our peer group. So it put us in a position where we have been working to gear our spending levels to a lower price environment. So, clearly, we worked on that, and we do have cash on hand this year. Obviously, we're making a conscious decision again in 2016 to live within the current price environment and within cash flow here such that we end the year with flat net debt. So it puts us in a position where we would anticipate not having to do some of those things at this point. And obviously protecting our investment grade rating is important to us, and it's something that we take seriously. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. And I guess \u2013 go ahead. Sorry. Oh, that's me echoing. Sorry. I, in my second question, follow-up, I mean, while not the case currently on your credit rating, but how should we or how do you think about potential impact to operations inside, outside the U.S. working capital levels if you either did see one or more non-IG credit rating? Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Thanks, Evan. So, this is Steve. We're not going to really deal with the types of hypotheticals of what would happen if this happen, what would you do if the credit rating went down multiple notches. We're doing everything that we can to prudently run the company financially as John outlined. We've taken a number of steps to protect the financial position of the company. And we think we're actually in pretty good shape. We've done a lot of stuff in 2015 in the last year to strengthen the financial position, build liquidity, make sure that we don't have a lot of refinance risk. And so, S&P has already come out with their rating, BBB, a downgrade to BBB and stable. Fitch continues to have us at BBB+, and we're waiting on Moody's. And I think we've done the things that we need to do and we'll continue to do the things that we need to do to remain investment grade. And we've got $1.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. And if we need to use some of that, as I said in my script, to pay down a little bit of debt in order to protect that, then we would certainly be willing to do that. So, we obviously think about what we would do and what we would be required to do because we need to be prepared and prudent about that. We don't spend a lot of time worried about that. We worry about protecting the investment grade rating. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Your line is open. John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : Two quick ones. For Suriname, when will you get the bird stack in on the seismic? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: John, we will be shooting that later this year. So, it will be a summer program. John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, John. With respect to your unconventional activity that you have planned, is this all going to be internal science done by Apache or are you going to be interfacing with the industry or what? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Clearly, it'd be internal programs that we'd be doing on our own. So, I mean, we participate in some wells in some areas and we learn from what we can and we've got partners in some places, but clearly, the work we are doing is all internally generated, and for the most part, it's done on our behalf for 100%. John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : Okay. Last one for me. Historically, you've made a lot of acquisitions; not of late, but a lot of people are experiencing some pain. Will you be more opportunistic in terms of property front in terms of buying things beyond what you have done? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I mean, John, we always are aware of what's out there and look at things carefully. The thing I would say, we find ourselves today in a very enviable position and we're opportunity-rich. With where we've scaled our capital back, there are a lot of excellent opportunities that we are choosing not to fund and that we think we would pursue at a higher price environment. So, as we think about things, they would have to be something that would be incrementally additive to our current inventory and portfolio. And so, I mean, it'd be a pretty high bar to be able to \u2013 something that we would want to bring into the door. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy. Your line is open. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Thanks. Was just curious going back to Egypt a little bit, is there anything \u2013 any feature within the PSC that kind of limits your downside flexibility around spending? I'm just trying to think through if there's any sort of reduced cost-recovery barrels or anything along those lines if you cut too much. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, Michael, there really isn't. The nice thing about what you're seeing on the international portfolio is a lot of these PSCs and so forth were designed for lower price environments. And quite frankly, the way they work, the government takes a greater percentage in higher prices. And so, as we look at the international portfolio and we look at North America, there's greater leverage in North America to higher prices, and there's less leverage on the international side. So it makes sense to allocate more capital into those projects right now because the returns are superior. And there's no requirements or commitments on the spend level that would cause us to have to spend more or anything along those lines. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Appreciate the color. And North America, if I just think about the 2015 fourth quarter rate and then take a linear decline through 2016, I'm showing about 20% plus decline year-on-year 4Q 2016 versus 4Q 2015, is that directionally reasonable or is that anything I ought to revise in that thinking? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I would say you'd probably end up a little bit steeper on the backside, but it's all going to hinge on how flexible we are with the capital and prices. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning or I guess afternoon. John, I'm just trying to think about 2017. If you think about it, if you get a modest uptick, obviously, cash flow, you guys have a lot of leverage to that. Your cash flow goes up. How are you thinking about the next two years? Is it spend within cash flow? Is it \u2013 it obviously would take a little bit of time to ramp to get there, but how would you thinking about that in, say, a $45 world? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think the important thing is if you look at 2016, we're guiding to relatively flat international. We said earlier on the call in the prepared notes that an additional $900 million incremental capital in North America would keep North America flat to slightly growing, which translates to about a $45 world. So 2016, we could live within cash flow and be flat to relatively slight growth. So, as we look ahead into 2017, there's a couple of things going on first and foremost. We're in the second year now of a significantly reduced CapEx budget. We reduced aggressively last year, again this year. So we've got fewer wells that were brought on than historical. So our rates will be flattening slightly as we go into 2017. Secondly, it will not take as much capital in 2017 to keep it flat, especially with North America. We're already investing at levels right now on the international side. Additionally, we've got some catalysts that will be coming on in 2017. If you look at the North Sea, our Callater well, potentially more than one well there that could be coming on. So, we've got some catalysts. And quite frankly, with the capital efficiency we're seeing, the other thing I'll say is, as we look at the 2016 budget, we've already seen well costs coming in significantly under what we planned this year. So the capital efficiency is the other big thing. So, I think as we get out into 2017, it's going to take a lower oil price for us to be able to stay flat and potentially grow. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then one follow-up, just to clarify. So you said that you're going to have four rigs in the Permian or that's where you get to. Where \u2013 maybe one or two of those doing some R&D, can you talk about where the activity is going to be? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We've got four long-term contracts, so we will ramp down to those four rigs. There'll be a couple of them working in the Delaware, two to three. And there will be at least one up in the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform as we continue to test all of our plays. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Edward Westlake with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good afternoon and thank you very much for talking about returns and fully-loaded returns at that. So as we go out on the other side of this trough, however long it lasts, what is the hurdle rate for investment fully-loaded that you're looking to develop? I appreciate oil price is going to move, the cost structure is going to change, but I'm trying to think about what hurdle rate gets you to invest. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think the key is we want to get to fully burdened corporate returns that are in the low-double digits. And I think that's where we need to be striving and that's where we plan to get to. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yes. Good that you have a returns target because historically the returns have not been as good for the industry even at $100 oil. Just a question then on the Permian and Delaware. You've got acreage, but it's not all contiguous. I'm just wondering if there's any update on people being willing to block up to get some efficiency gains? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The nice thing is we've got 3.3 million gross acres, so we've got lots of acreage. We have done a lot of small trades and we are doing a lot of things. We are trying to block some things up and have had some success. So they're not things that hit the press in terms of radar screen, but we're continually looking to block and swap. We're interbedded with a lot of the operators and there's lots of things we're doing to try to core up those positions and put together drilling units where you've got more control. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Bob Morris with Citi. Your line is open. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you. John, on the four rigs at mid-year in the Permian, will you have a rig running in the Woodford/SCOOP or anywhere else, or will it be just those four? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: At this point we've got flexibility there, Bob, but I would anticipate those being in the Permian. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then on the drilled but uncompleted inventory, how will that trend through the year? Do you have an inventory starting out the year, will that be drawn down or how will that contribute to the production during the year? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: If you look at last year, we consumed about 70 horizontal drilled but uncompleted wells and about 50 vertical. As I was pretty vocal early last year the wells we drill we intended to complete, and we drew down a lot of our DUCs. I would envision us doing the same thing this year. You could see that number come down a little bit, but it's at a level now where we don't have a lot that we haven't already completed. And the thing I'll add, too, is we have the luxury of not having a lot of rig contracts and a lot of leases that require drilling of wells right now. So we're not in a position where we're having to build DUCs because we don't think that's a prudent use of capital. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is open. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. John, I wondered if I could try two, please. I don't know if I missed this, but could you give us some idea of exit rate to exit rate in North America Q4 to Q4 2016 just to give us an idea where you're going be running at going into next year? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Doug, we did not give any guidance around that specific. I would say probably the best thing to do is take \u2013 we gave first quarter guidance, we gave the average ranges for the year and I would just probably extrapolate from that. I will say going into 2017, we expect to see capital efficiencies and things come into play where we have a much better picture for 2017 than we do currently for 2016 at these capital levels. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. I can join the dots. If I may, I want to go back to Suriname from the earlier question. And I'm just trying to understand a little bit about what's going on there with your longer-term thinking. Are you getting carried, John, on the activities there? And I'm just wondering are you retaining this really more as an option in case (1:01:04) spills over into your block? Or is that a little bit more strategic that this is really something that would be a core part of your portfolio going forward? And I'll leave it there. Thanks. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, what I'll say is when we originally took the block several years ago, the first block, 53, we viewed it as being in a very potential prospective area. I think what you now see is you've got a proven oil hydrocarbon province. We've got two blocks that are centrally located. There is a system there. We did drill one well last year. Prior to drilling that well, we did bring in partners and were promoted on the one well in Block 53. We picked up Block 58 on our own just as protection. It was not a huge commitment. And I think we now have the luxury to see what we do with it. It is a bid option. We own it 100%. And clearly it's an area that's very prospective and is getting a lot of attention. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Your line is open. Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: The strategic allocation of capital, could you contrast what you call a development CapEx versus a base maintenance CapEx, say, in the Permian? And what does strategic capital mean in that exploration bucket? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think first and foremost in terms of maintenance, there are just certain things you have to do on your existing fields. So basically, Bob, we're not drilling development wells in the Permian which would be to generate further growth. So that's going to be the difference. The other thing is going to be just your bread-and-butter maintenance things that you do with your base. And that's repairing subs, doing those types of things. In terms of strategic capital, we would put that as things that potentially sets up new drilling programs, test new zones, test new concepts, helps us better define what are going to be the inventory of growth opportunities in the future. Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So testing stacked pay on an existing development you'd throw-in on the strategic side? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: If it had running room and could open up something significant, then yes. If it's something small on the Central Basin Platform or some areas where we've got just a few locations identified, then it wouldn't be in that category. Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. I think that's clear. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It'd have to have potential scope to it for it to be strategic. Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Mike Kelly with Seaport Global. Your line is open. Mike Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Hey, guys. My question was asked. I'll hand it back. Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Your line is open. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, John, and to the rest of your team there. I appreciate you guys sticking around to answer all these questions. If I could ask what one about your dividend and your thinking there. You guys made a lot of moves and you've reviewed a lot of them on this call to adapt to a reduced commodity price early, but leaving the dividend intact stands out as an anomaly there. So I'm wondering if you can tell us a little bit about your thinking. And I know the board's thinking is really what comes to bear on this, but if you could give us some thoughts on your posture there. Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, this is Steve again. So you make very good points. We cut early, we took a lot of actions in 2015 that a lot of our peers didn't. And I think for that reason, we feel like we're very well positioned not to have to cut the dividend now. We've done all the things to strengthen the financial position, the liquidity position, our refinance risk on the debt portfolio. We've chosen to live 2015 and 2016 as close to cash flow neutral as possible. We've done that because we believe that, especially in North America, the opportunities for investment are going to be better in the future than they are now. There are some good ones now, but we believe they're going to be even better. So we've chosen to be cash flow neutral. So we've added $1.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet, chosen to be cash flow neutral, we don't really need to reduce the dividend at this point in time. And we do discuss that with the board. We discuss it with them every quarter and I imagine we'll continue to discuss that with them every quarter. But we just don't think we need to be doing that now. We'll probably reconsider it at some point in time in the future when prices and costs are better aligned and we all kind of figure out whatever the new normal, if we ever get to normal, in our industry will be in the future, then we can look at what our dividend yield is and whether that's appropriate for the situation that we're in at that point in time. But, at this point in time, we just don't have any compelling reason to have to cut it. We do realize that the dividend yield is pretty high for the situation that we're in right now, but we're okay with that for now. And that's why we went ahead and declared the regular dividend with this last quarter. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: That's helpful, Steve. Thank you. And then if I could dig down into the details on one of your Permian well results. I think, John, earlier in your prepared comments, you talked about the June Tippett well, and looking at that, even though it was kind of a short lateral, on a lateral-adjusted basis, that looks like it's \u2013 at least one of the wells there, it looks like a real standout in the Midland Basin. And I'm wondering if you could tell me if you share that point of view and if you do, where the Midland kind of ranks? Because it seems like you're ranking the Delaware Basin, generally, in front of your opportunities in the Midland Basin. Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President- Operations Support : Yes. This is Tim Sullivan. We did drill \u2013 this was at a Wildfire lease. We did drill five well pads in the June Tippett lease. Three of them actually came online in the fourth quarter and two of them online in early 2016. And what we have done here, these are mile laterals. We had acquired some additional core data out here and tweaked our landing zone, targeting a higher TOC and lower clay content area. And the 30-day IPs for the average of those five wells was 980 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and 75% of that is oil. And if you compare that to a well or a pad that we had drilled early in the air which was a mile-and-a-half pad, this mile pad is outperforming those. So we are pretty excited about that and we do have quite a bit of running room. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Rowe with TPH. Your line is open Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Just a question on the North Sea. I appreciate that there are a number of discoveries coming online in 2017 and 2018 to arrest decline. That said, can you talk about the base decline of this asset and what these productions or what these discoveries, excuse me, will do to aggregate production growth in those years? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: At this point, we see the North Sea being able to hang in there pretty strongly with the capital levels we're at. We have not looked at what price decks we'd use, and a lot of that will hinge on how many platform rigs we have, do we add those back in, in 2017 and 2018. We mentioned they would not be there the back half of this year, so a lot of that's going to hinge on capital as we lay out those future years. But we've got good running room now and a lot of nice things coming on. Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Michael, this is Steve. I'd also just point you to the presentation we made, the webcast that we made back in November. It's got some information that I think you'd find helpful. Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Understood. Thanks. I was just trying to see if there's been any change in thought process there. But maybe just my last question would be just a question on the goal of spending within cash flow and the comment you made on cash flow movements with each change \u2013 dollar per barrel change in the oil price. Of your 2016 operating cash flow, do you have a sense for how much of that is attributable to North American Onshore versus your International business at $35 oil? Thanks. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't have that number off the top my head. You're going to have more cash flow coming out of the International in terms of on a per barrel basis just because our cash margins are higher. But I'll let \u2013 we can follow-up with exactly that split. I'll have Gary follow up with a better idea on the ratio. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open. Jeff L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Thank you for taking my questions. Steve mentioned that cash flow neutrality remains the approach whether oil prices rise up or down. I was wondering if hedging might also be part of the method, particularly if oil prices rise somewhat, to protect the timing of any increased spending exposure. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Jeff, at some point, obviously, if we were going to commit a lot of capital, we would start to look at using hedging. I think you're in a period today where we don't have a cost structure that's not synchronized with price environment. But it is something in the future. If we were to put a lot of capital back to work that we would consider as a tool to offset or mitigate some of the risk to ensure that we can deliver the return objectives that we're focused on. Jeff L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Thanks, John. My follow-up is, can you review the very low Permian well cost guidance that you gave, again, with average lateral links that correlate to those costs? And also do those estimates include more intensive completions? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: In terms of our Permian well cost, we see things coming down and even further this year. As a rule, we're looking at mile-and-a-half laterals. We have seen the intensity of the frac concentrations going up. So those are the types of parameters we're going to use or using in those estimates. Operator : And I would now like to turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks. Gary T. Clark - Vice President- Investor Relations : That's going to wrap up the call, Kim. There's no more questions. We look forward to speaking to you all next quarter, and please give myself or Chris Cortez a call if you have any follow-up questions. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call, and you may now disconnect.",

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache Corporation First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Gary T. Clark - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on Apache Corp.'s First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann; and CFO, Steve Riney. Also joining us in the room is Tim Sullivan, Executive Vice President of Operations. In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our quarterly earnings supplement, which summarizes key financial and operational data for the first quarter, along with details regarding our updated 2016 production outlook. Our earnings release and quarterly earnings supplement can be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com/financials-reporting.aspx. I would like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. I will now turn the call over to John. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Gary. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. In the first quarter, Apache delivered solid operational results, strong financial performance, and notable drilling outcomes, all of which were supported by our relentless focus on continuous improvement and cost reductions. Today I would like to start with a brief recap of first quarter results, and an update to Apaches 2016 production guidance. I will then provide an operational overview with particular emphasis on some of the exceptional well-cost reductions we are achieving at our key North American onshore plays. I will conclude with thoughts on our current activity level and the potential for increasing capital investment in the near future. As noted in this morning's press release, companywide, pro forma production of 479,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was at the high end of our quarterly guidance range of 470,000 BOEs to 480,000 BOEs per day. Outperformance came primarily from North America onshore, which produced 298,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and exceeded our 290,000 to 295,000 BOE per day guidance range. Each of Apache's North American operating areas performed well, despite a significant reduction in capital. The Permian in particular delivered robust results with strong performance from the underlying base, coupled with solid contributions from both newly drilled wells and base maintenance projects. In light of first quarter production strength, we are raising our full-year 2016 North American onshore guidance range by 5,000 BOEs per day, to 268,000 BOEs to 278,000 BOEs per day. On the international and offshore side, pro forma production was 180,000 BOEs per day, which was at the low end of our guidance range of 180,000 BOEs to 185,000 BOEs per day. This is primarily attributable to unplanned third party plant and pipeline outages in the North Sea. We remain on track to achieve our full-year 2016 international and offshore guidance of 170,000 BOEs to 180,000 BOEs per day. As we have stated previously, our 2016 North American onshore drilling program is primarily focused on strategic testing and acreage delineation to build and high-grade inventory. Nevertheless, we are continuing to see some remarkable progress on drilling efficiencies. For example, in key areas of North America, where Apache was actively drilling during the first quarter, the average drilled and completed well costs were down approximately 45%, as compared to average well costs in 2014. On the expense side, continuing with our efforts from last year, we saw further reductions in both lease operating expenses and gross G&A. Looking ahead, we anticipate further benefits from aligning our cost with the scale of our business and the commodity price environment. As you will recall, Apache is targeting cash flow neutrality in 2016 under our current budget, which assumes flat $35 oil and $2.35 gas. As expected, we were not cash flow neutral in the first quarter; however, we do anticipate generating a net cash flow surplus through the remainder of the year. As such, we remain on track for unchanged or lower net debt levels at year end. Steve Riney will elaborate further on this in his prepared remarks. With the recent improvements in strip oil prices, we are prepared to increase capital spending but will refrain until we are confident cash flows have sustainably improved relative to our 2016 plan. Although we have the financial capacity to increase capital spending today, we believe that preserving our strong financial position and our credit quality through cash flow neutrality is the best approach for our shareholders in this price environment. I will provide more color on our thinking around this in a few minutes. Turning to our operations, in the Permian Basin, first quarter production held up well despite a significant decrease in the number of wells placed on production. We produced 171,000 BOE per day, which represents a 2% sequential decrease from the fourth quarter. In the Delaware, we placed five gross operated wells on production, primarily targeting Bone Spring formations in the Pecos Bend area. One very notable well, the Seagull 103-HR, produced an exceptional 30-day average peak rate of nearly 2,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day from a lateral length of approximately 4,600 feet. In its first 60 days of production, the Seagull 103-HR accumulated 78,000 barrels of oil, which makes it Apache's best well to date in the Delaware Basin. The success of the Seagull 103-HR is a function of our thorough understanding of the hydrocarbon system and continuous efforts to improve our results of these complex reservoirs. Thus far, our efforts in the Pecos Bend area of the Delaware have been focused on two primary landing zones in the Third Bone Spring formation. During the first quarter, we tested a promising new landing zone within the Third Bone Spring that could significantly enhance our running room in the area. In the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform, and Northwest Shelf, we placed 25 gross operated wells on production, which is approximately 40% fewer wells than in the fourth quarter. During the first quarter, Apache generated good results from six Wolfcamp wells in the Powell area, two Wolfcamp completions at Wildfire, and four horizontal Yeso wells on the Northwest Shelf, all of which are summarized in our quarterly earnings supplement. Before moving on to Egypt and the North Sea, I would like to highlight our North American well cost reduction efforts, which continue to exceed our expectations. Last quarter, I noted that we have dedicated a considerable amount of time, energy and resources toward reinvigorating Apache's strong culture of cost and returns discipline. This quarter, we are seeing some very tangible results from these initiatives which I would like to share with you. As I mentioned earlier, in key areas of North America where Apache was actively drilling, our average drilled and completed well costs were down approximately 45% in the first quarter compared to average 2014 levels. Notably in the Delaware Basin, our most recent well costs are now down approximately 60%. Although we have made great strides throughout 2015, I am truly amazed by the ongoing positive cost trends in our North American onshore drilling program. Six quarters into the downturn, we are still achieving significant quarter-on-quarter cost improvements. For example, in the Delaware Basin, we recently drilled and completed a Third Bone Spring well for $3.5 million. In the Midland Basin, one mile horizontal Wolfcamp and one-and-a-half mile Lower Spraberry drilling and completion costs are now projected to be less than $4 million and $4.5 million, respectively. In the horizontal Yeso play on the Northwest Shelf in the Permian, recent well costs are trending below $2.3 million. And in the Woodford SCOOP, our latest pacesetter well was drilled and completed for only $6.6 million. Achieving these lower well costs both expands our drillable inventory and significantly enhances our returns for future development programs. Recently, we received questions about the sustainability of our well cost improvements once demand for oilfield services begins to rebound. The high level answer is that more than 50% of our average well cost decrease since the 2014 peak has come from design and efficiency improvements and should therefore be viewed as permanent cost savings. In our earnings supplement this quarter, we have provided exhibits for our key North American onshore plays that highlight the breakdown between service price and efficiency improvements. Apache's cost achievements to date are more than just belt tightening efforts in response to the downturn. We seek to continuously implement structural changes and improvements which accrue to the bottom line and enhance our long term returns regardless of where oil prices and services costs go in the future. Now turning to our International operations, in the North Sea, first quarter production was slightly above 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which represents a 2% decline sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2015. Unplanned downtime associated with outages on the third-party operated Forties Pipeline system negatively impacted our sales volumes by approximately 1,700 BOEs per day during the quarter. These outages reduced our production uptime from what would have been 94% down to 90%. As a reminder, U.K. North Sea industry average production uptime has been between 60% and 70% over the last several years. Therefore, Apache maintains a significant competitive advantage in this regard. Despite the higher-than-expected downtime during the quarter, Apache still achieved exceptional LOE costs of approximately $11 per BOE. Our first quarter development drilling program in the North Sea delivered four successful new wells, all of which were placed online in the second half of the quarter. This set up a strong production rebound during the month of April. The nature of North Sea operations and production is such that there will always be monthly and quarterly lumpiness, but we are confident in our full year 2016 production guidance which we stated would decline slightly year-over-year from 2015 levels. Our subsea tieback of the Kaliter (11:46) discovery is proceeding on time and on budget, and we continue to expect this project will begin production in mid-2017. We are also looking forward to drilling our Storr and Kinord exploration prospects, which we highlighted in our North Sea webcast last November. In Egypt, our gross production of approximately 353,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was essentially flat with the fourth quarter. Steve will provide more color on Egypt production reporting in a few minutes, but excluding tax barrels and minority interests, pro forma production in Egypt was up slightly versus the fourth quarter. Apache's drilling program in Egypt continues to deliver successful and reliable results. We placed 23 wells on production during the first quarter and achieved a drilling success rate of 88%, which is in line with our historical success rates in Egypt. At our prolific Ptah and Berenice fields, we placed two more wells on production, bringing the total number of producing wells in the complex to 13. We have a few additional locations remaining to fully develop Ptah and Berenice, but facilities are currently constrained. Before I move on, I would like to leave you with a few high-level observations on Egypt. Apache's operation in Egypt remains stable. Our drilling, workover and water flood programs continue to deliver quarter after quarter. When compared to North America, our well costs are relatively low and our netbacks and margins are relatively high. And lastly, cash flow generation in Egypt demonstrates much less price-related volatility than North America, despite reported net production volatility from quarter-to-quarter. As we all contemplate the timing and magnitude of an oil price recovery, I want to leave you with a few key points around our thinking with regard to 2016 capital spending and the potential for incremental activity above our current plan. Cash flow is the governor on Apache's capital spending and activity levels in 2016. We still plan to manage to cash flow neutrality and exit the year with unchanged or lower net debt levels. We entered 2016 with an industry cost structure that was still out of sync with the low oil price environment. The recent rally in oil prices coupled with our cost reductions means that development drilling in North America is now generating acceptable returns in many areas. We believe these returns will continue to improve as costs come into better alignment with price. Recent improvements in oil prices are encouraging. We are now looking for a sustainably improved pricing structure that would generate the cash flow visibility for us to confidently increase our capital program. The potential timing and magnitude of this increase is the topic of significant planning and discussion right now at Apache and with our board. In the meantime, the vast majority of Apache's North America and onshore spending is focused on target testing, acreage evaluation and expanding our low-cost inventory locations to be exploited in an environment that offers higher returns. When the time is appropriate, our first priorities for increased investment will be to add development rigs in the Permian. We will also accelerate North American acreage testing, and we'll keep our two platform rigs running in the North Sea. Beyond that, the Woodford SCOOP play and Egypt are next in line for incremental capital. Importantly, Apache has maintained the organizational capacity and personnel to operate a significantly higher number of rigs and we are well prepared to ramp-up activity when appropriate. Lastly, we are very mindful of the fact that we are in a highly cyclical and highly capital-intensive business. As such, any ramp in investment activity will pass rigorous hurdles on returns and net present value. In closing, Apache's portfolio and capital allocation approach is designed to withstand volatility over the long term, which is evident in our results. We look forward to demonstrating the capability of our North American assets and efficiency of our capital allocation process in the next upturn. I want to reiterate what I stated on last quarter's earnings call; our plan is to emerge from this commodity price downturn with top-tier financial strength, a robust inventory of high rate of return drilling opportunities and a sustained capacity to generate free cash flow from our international assets in Egypt and the North Sea. We have made great progress in these efforts. Over the long term, our goal is to offer competitive debt adjusted per-share production, reserve and cash flow growth rates and to achieve a top quartile cost position in terms of average well cost, G&A, and LOE per BOE. We will accomplish this with an intense focus on long term, full-cycle returns for our investment programs. Through the cycle, we believe this will translate into significantly improved returns and an appreciation in our share price. I will now turn the call over to Steve Riney. Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, John, and good afternoon. In addition to reviewing our financial results for the first quarter of 2016, I would like to highlight our progress on several key financial objectives. These include continuing to aggressively drive down well costs, lease operating expense and G&A, achieving cash flow neutrality, inclusive of dividends under a flat $35 oil price, protecting our strong liquidity and financial position, and ending the year with unchanged or reduced net debt. Additionally, I will speak to our 2016 outlook for capital spending, LOE and G&A. And finally, I would like to review Egypt production volume reporting to address some potential confusion about the difference between reported volumes and the pro forma volumes we typically reference. So let's begin with the first quarter financial results. As noted in our press release, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Apache reported a loss of $489 million, or $1.29 per common share. Our results for the quarter include a number of items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates, the most significant of which are ceiling test write downs. These items total $337 million after tax, in the first quarter and as in prior periods, resulted primarily from the continued low commodity price environment. Our loss for the quarter adjusted for these items, was $152 million, or $0.40 per share. As John mentioned, better than expected onshore North American production and solid operating cost performance worldwide, were key contributors to our first quarter, 2016 financial results. Apache's continuing focus on driving cost efficiencies resulted in capital spending of $466 million during the first quarter, which excludes non-controlling interest. This is well below our guidance range of $500 million to $550 million. Capital costs in all of our North American regions were lower than we budgeted, with Permian leading the way. Our capital spending guidance of $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion for the full year of 2016 remains unchanged. We are clearly achieving better than expected capital efficiencies, thus absent an increase in planned activity, I would expect us to end the year somewhere in the bottom half of this range. That said, if the current oil price environment prevails, it's more likely that we will maintain or even increase drilling and completion activity from current levels, which would result in increased capital spending. Lease operating expenses in the first quarter were $7.81 per barrel of oil equivalent, 22% lower than the fourth quarter of 2015. Underlying improvement in this metric is primarily attributable to greater efficiency in North American onshore production and the timing of workovers and other expenditures in the Permian and North Sea. While we are very pleased with this cost performance, certain one-time items and timing issues benefited us in a way that will not continue through the year. Last quarter, we provided guidance that full year 2016 LOE per BOE would be roughly flat compared to full year 2015. This implied a target of approximately $9.50 per BOE. With the progress we have already seen this year, we now believe 2016 LOE will be closer to $9.25 per BOE. On the G&A side, total cost continue to decline as we remain diligently focused on aligning overhead with capital spending levels. Our goal for the year was to further reduce gross cash overhead costs to a range of $650 million to $700 million. We are currently tracking towards the low end of this range, and we continue finding opportunities to further reduce these costs. In the first quarter of 2016, recurring DD&A was $11.42 per BOE, 34% lower than the fourth quarter of 2015. Our DD&A costs over the last several quarters have been on a clear downward trend as the result of price-related asset write-downs. Lastly on costs, we incurred $90 million of net interest expense in the first quarter. You will note a trend of increasing expense interest and decreasing capitalized interest over the last several quarters. This is a result of unproved property impairments and reduce capital investment activity. Next I would like to make a few comments regarding our financial strength and liquidity position. In 2015, we worked very hard to strengthen our financial position and maintain our investment-grade credit rating with the three primary rating agencies. Having accomplished this, one of our key financial objectives is to protect this position by maintaining unchanged or even reduced net debt by year-end 2016. During the first quarter, cash uses exceeded sources by approximately $463 million. This was primarily the result of commodity realizations coming in below our plan, a front-end loaded capital program, and a build in working capital due to the timing of some nonrecurring working capital items. We anticipate these negative impacts early in the year will be more than offset later in the year. Even with this shortfall in first-quarter cash flows, we ended the quarter with approximately $1 billion in cash. In summary, our financial condition and liquidity remain very strong. We have created this position through disciplined capital spending and aggressive cost management rather than issuing equity, reducing the dividend or selling poor assets. Importantly, we still have good visibility to cash flow neutrality at our $35 plan level. Finally, I would like to take a moment to discuss Egypt production volume reporting. As you are aware, we most often refer you to pro forma production volumes which for Egypt, excludes two items, the one-third minority share of volumes attributable to our partner and tax barrels. Throughout 2014, and the first three quarters of 2015, our reported tax barrel production averaged approximately 26,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Asset impairments in the fourth quarter of 2015 and in the first quarter of 2016, combined with low oil prices, created a significant amount of noise in these tax barrel volumes. In the fourth quarter of 2015, these items resulted in negative tax barrel reported production of 47,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the first quarter of 2016, they resulted in Apache recording only 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production. As a reminder, tax barrels have no economic effect on our net cash flow from the business. Combined with the fact that they can lead to this type of reporting volatility, we believe investors should focus primarily on pro forma production in Egypt. A more thorough description of this will be on our website along with a brief history of the difference between Egypt reported and pro forma volumes. We have also included this information for your reference in this quarter's earnings supplement. In closing, we took great efforts over the past 18 months to position Apache prudently for a prolonged downturn. After successfully navigating the challenges that confronted the industry in 2015, Apache is well-prepared to capitalize on the opportunities that we believe will ultimately emerge. We have delivered a strong start to 2016 and look forward to continued progress throughout the year. Our primary goals for 2016 remain unchanged. We will live within our means, maintain our strong financial position, continue to build high-quality development inventory for the future, and invest to improve long-term returns and add shareholder value. While we remain conservative in our budgeting and planned activity, we are prepared to respond when the environment is right to increase investment. I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Congratulations on the cost reduction, really quite impressive. Quick question on cash. You've got $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet, so just wondering what's the optimal level? I mean, obviously, peers have done some of the things you said, like issue equity and sell assets to get to their cash balances high, and people expect oil prices may still be volatile. Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. Thanks, Ed. This is Steve. I think at this point in time, I don't know what the optimal amount of cash on the balance sheet is, but I kind of like at this point in time having $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. It's good for liquidity; I think it's a good time to have liquidity. It's a good time to have the cash ready for deployment, either in terms of paying down debt if we decide we need to do that, or for deployment into the capital program if we see the price scenario in the future improving. Or, for that matter, I am happy just to hold cash. We do believe that the cash balance will go back up to $1.5 billion by the end of this year, based on our plan for the year. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): I guess a different way of asking it is there are obviously across the broad North American portfolio a lot of assets which potentially may be of interest to others, and as commodity prices lift their head a little bit, are you looking to be more aggressive on perhaps disposals of Tier 2? Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The answer to that is we are always looking at the portfolio. We have done some small one-offs that are not really material to production. But at this point, we are always looking at our internal assets. We grade those against other things, we look at what could be added and what would add incremental value, but right now it's a pretty hard litmus test because of the types of projects we've deferred. So we sit on a pretty good set of assets, a really good deep inventory that we're very excited about, and we'll look how do we improve it going forward. But nothing major planned on either side. Operator : Your next question will from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yes. Good morning. Nice quarter. A couple of questions, first I guess just on the horizontal Yeso. John, can you talk about what your plans are there, after seeing the results in the first quarter? What should we look for from that asset over the next few months or next few quarters, I guess? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, thanks, David. That is one of the areas that we've got inventory that we could put back to work. I mean, right now we do not have a rig that's over there. We've drilled some fantastic wells with, where the cost structure is moving now and when price has gone. That would be one of the areas that we could do, add some future activity to. But right now we don't have anything immediately planned to do, but we've got a lot of nice inventory. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then as a follow up, bigger picture, if I think about, last conference call you made the comment that you could have kept 2016 production flat at $45, obviously I think your service cost and efficiencies have improved since then. Can you talk about looking forward, either give us an apples-to-apples numbers for 2016 or kind of projecting the forward for 2017, what that range would look like? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I will take you back to what I said on the last call was, in 2016 another $900 million, which would have put our capital budget midpoint around 2.5, would have kept his flat in 2016. As we look at 2017, clearly we continue to make progress on the efficiency side, which would lower that. Our decline on our base is flattening, it's a function of, we're now 18 months into a slowdown in terms of the numbers of wells we've been bringing on, so that helps. Plus the base rate is a little lower that you have got to keep flat. So we see clearly less capital in 2017 to keep it flat, but it's kind of a moving target at this point. And then obviously the other factor is we've got some projects that we are advancing, Kaliter (29:28) in the North Sea is on track, which would give us a big kick in the middle of 2017. So it's going to be less, but it's pretty dynamic and we're in the middle of working through a planning process at this point. So at this point I'll just say it's going to be less than it would have been this year and you're right, $900 million or $45 base plan versus our $35 would have kept us neutral in 2016. But it will be a lower number for 2017. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Pearce Hammond with Simmons/Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Hi, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. My first question, John, what is driving the steep decline in LOE, and then how sustainable are those cost declines? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, and I'll let Steve chime in, in a minute, a lot of its timing of how things came up first quarter. We had a big drop in a couple of areas. It is not something that will be there for the rest of the year, which is kind of why we moved our number down from $9.50 guidance to about $9.25, but we're making progress, and I've got confidence the guys can keep working on those numbers. Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I'll just... Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Yeah, go ahead. Sorry. Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, just in echoing John's comments, we had good cost results in Egypt, in the Permian and the North Sea. All three have been very strong. I think there is a good mix of that that's just timing related, and you'll note that that kind of a reduction doesn't show up in the guidance reduction to $9.25 per BOE. Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Great. Thank you. And then my follow-up is given the improvement in commodity price, any updated thoughts on hedging? Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : At this point, the environment's getting much better. I mean, we like the direction on the cost, we like the direction on the oil price, so I think we're at a point where things are starting to look pretty darn attractive. But right now, our best hedge is we haven't committed to a lot of rigs or a big program at this point. So it's one of those things we will be discussing as we start to look at plans, but at this point, we're not quite where I would feel good about locking in a scenario. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. Good afternoon to you, sorry. I appreciate all the color. I just wanted to make sure I understand the activity re-acceleration, which sounds closer. You accelerated around current levels, or are you looking for market fundamentals to clean up and then that acceleration will be governed, or the pace of that acceleration will be governed to remain cash flow neutral? Is that right? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I mean, I think the key is, Evan, we budgeted to be cash flow neutral this year at $35 and a $2.35 gas price. We're a little bit behind that in the first quarter on oil, we're behind it on gas. Clearly, in April we've seen a little bit of a rebound. So if the strip were to hold up, clearly we're going to be in a position to have some cash to deploy in the back half of the year, and those are the types of things we would look at. But there's lots of things out there. I mean, we've got debt we could address or the program. But the plan would be to \u2013 cash flow is going to be the governor, we plan to stay cash neutral, and we'll have some options to choose from if the current conditions hold. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. You also discussed your North American capital allocation in the recovery, but you didn't mention the Eagle Ford, which I had thought was a higher hurdle from your previous comments. Yet in Q1, you completed four Eagle Ford wells with competitive results. Can you discuss what the driver there was? Is that some science or lease-related activity? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we mentioned we'd been doing a lot of strategic testing. I mean, most of our North American capital is designed to that. We had some wells that were down that we wanted to complete and, you know, to be able to evaluate those. The Eagle Ford will require a little higher hurdle than some of the other plays. So as we start to think about in the future potentially putting capital back to work, right now it would not be the first place it would go. But we're seeing great progress in the Eagle Ford as well and have made a lot of progress over the last 18 months. So it's something I think can be an option in the future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Societe Generale. Please go ahead. John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : Yeah, I had a question for you on the shales. Obviously, you've had a lot of improvement. How much capital have you really dedicated from the science side of things to better optimize, like density studies, things like that? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: John, I'd say if you look at our strategic testing, it really falls into several buckets, and I don't have an exact split on how much of it is in that portion of it, but we're doing three things, really. We're testing new acreage, we're testing new zones and then we're optimizing within zones. And if you look at our completions in the \u2013 a lot of the Permian as well as the Woodford or even the Eagle Ford, I mean, we're taking and integrating seismic data, core data, petrophysics, landing zones, everything. And so we're doing a lot of time on that, and I think that's where you're seeing some of the productivity things that are showing up from that time that we're taking to do things properly, and we've learned an awful lot. John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : Okay. Next one for me, with the services companies, do you find that your conversations about future activity levels and costs are different? Is it more collegial, less adversarial, or...? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, I would say that really, since the fall of last year, it's become a lot more collaborative. I mean, we've had some really good sit-down discussions with some of the small service companies as well as some of the very big ones and have had some really, really constructive conversations on how do we lower the cost structure in North America, and a lot of progress on that front. And I think a willingness to recognize that that's what is going to take going forward. And you're seeing some of the fruits show up, not just in terms of cost reductions from the service side, but in terms of execution, efficiencies, structural things, a lot of these things that are going to be permanent. And that's what's important. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes, good afternoon. John, I was wondering if you could perhaps comment on some of the steps you're taking kind of to manage your base decline in the Permian? You had a pretty skinny sequential decline, right? So in addition to new drilling activity, what are you doing to manage that base? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I mean, I think one of the big things is we've stepped back. We've gone from trying to bring on a lot of wells and completing a lot of wells to really getting back to managing your base, and looking at fluid levels, looking at optimizing how we're producing these wells, changing some of the lift, it's amazing what you can do when you take the time. Compression, optimizing water shut offs, little things. And there's not a lot of money, but boy, it sure makes a big, big difference. I mean, we've got back in, cleaned out some injectors in some of our water floods, some of the old bread and butter, classic Apache things that we've done for decades. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : John, I remember you commenting, maybe in a previous call, that you thought that your overall base decline rate was in the low 20% range? Any thoughts on that number, is it a coming down? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I mean, clearly, as we started the year, we said it was in the 25%, 26% range. As we bring on fewer wells, which is what we've done, it has flattened and is flattening. That's a good topic of discussion with me and our reservoir engineers, because we are always working on that. But clearly it is coming off and clearly in terms of flattening, and then also all these projects help too. So I think you'll see us continue to focus on that. It gets back to the quality of having some conventional, and a big chunk of our Permian is water floods and CO2 floods and things that just don't decline as rapidly. There's a lot of things you can do, scale cleanouts, all kinds of things, moving more water, there's just a lot \u2013 you have a lot more options to pull on your conventional asset base and you're seeing us pull those. So I think you will see it flatten. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Good afternoon. Just specifically on some North Sea activity, did the Storr and Kinord wells, did those move into this year? And if you could comment if changes in the PRT tax over there have changed your view on how active you get? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, I would say that the changes in the PRT are very helpful. It does not change where we are in terms of the game plan. I mean, we've got such a low cost structure there relative to the rest of the industry, and we're going to generate cash flow out of the North Sea, much like Egypt, on our international portfolio. So it does not change big picture the steps we're taking, but it does make things more attractive, and provides us incremental cash flow, it lets us do a few more things. We do plan to bring Storr and Kinord into the back half of this year at this point. So that would be \u2013 the plan would be to at least get the wells drilled at this back half of the year or could spill into next year. Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks. And as my follow-up, turning to the Permian and really good results on that Seagull well. Could you give a little color on what you all might have done differently there and maybe a little bit of color, too, on that new zone within the Third Bone Spring that you're looking at? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I mean, the Seagull is a pretty \u2013 it's only a 4,600 foot lateral. It's really target testing and modification. As we continue to understand the hydrocarbon system, we're figuring out exactly where to land those wells and how to modify our fracs. And, Tim, do you have any color you want to add? Timothy J. Sullivan - Executive Vice President \u2013 Operations Support : Yes, really, the results of the Seagull well incorporate the integration of the team, and that really takes into consideration the 3-D and targeting fracture intensity there. And it's had tremendous results and I think it's repeatable as we've just recently put a well online, or Bluejay 103, that's flowing over 2000 barrels of oil per day, very similar geologic environment. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Guys, I don't know if you could give this or not, but Egypt and the North Sea are your big cash cows in the portfolio. I wonder if you could give us an idea of what the operating cash and free cash flows out of those assets this quarter? Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Doug. We typically don't give that type of information down to the asset level. You obviously can figure that out at the end of each year. We are thinking about some \u2013 potentially expanding our \u2013 both our guidance and our detailed reporting around things like that for the future. But we're not ready to start doing that at this point in time. I can tell you that both of those asset areas this year will be cash flow generators for us. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Were they free cash flow positive in Q1? Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Not going to say whether they were or not. I can say that they will be for the year, that's for sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James. Please go ahead. John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good afternoon. On the Bluejay 103H that you just mentioned came on at over 2,000-barrels a day and also set a record and completed at $3.5 million, what were the specs on that well, like the lateral length? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's just a single mile lateral. John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And then where specifically is it located in your position? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's our target one in the Third Bone Springs interval. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Yes, apologies, I'm going to keep going on the Bluejay and the Seagull, if I could. But if we put it in the wider context, you talked about design and efficiency gaining you in costs considerably since 2014. Has there been a step change there or is that a linear progression? And further to that, you mentioned the results at Bluejay were very strong. I was going to ask you if they were less than the Seagull, where you had such strong volume performance. Can we go \u2013 I guess what I'm driving at with the linear and the step is can we actually go a whole lot lower than that $3.5 million? Does it have a similar split between drilling and completion that we typically see? How much more do you think we can get out for less money? Is it a question of more volume, or can you actually even go less money? Thanks. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. I mean, when you look at \u2013 we put in the supplement a good bar chart that shows the steps in terms of how the costs have come down really over the last five or six quarters. So I continue to be amazed at what we can do. Obviously, there are certain things that, as you get lower and lower, it gets harder to keep having those sorts of reductions. I mean, I think $3.5 million for a mile-long lateral in the Delaware is pretty strong, especially with the type of productivity the well's come on. It tells you we're not cutting corners on the completion or anything like that. So, yeah, we'll clearly keep driving. The guys will tell you they can keep taking off small chunks, but how far \u2013 how much further can we go, I think that will be a function \u2013 we'll just have to wait and see what we can do. In terms of performance, it's going to end up being pretty similar to the Seagull. The 2,800 BOEs a day included gas, the 2,000. As Tim referenced, it's very early on the Bluejay, and that's just on the oil side. So I think it's going to be a pretty similar well before it's all said and done. But we'll have to wait and see. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Please go ahead. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, John, and to the rest of your team there. I'd like to go back to the question of the possible acceleration in the back half of 2016. I know you spent a lot of your prepared comments on this and you've already had a couple questions in Q&A here, but number of other companies have spoken about this decision, this kind of a \u2013 maybe being in two pieces. The first question is do you have the capacity to accelerate? And then the second would be do you have the appetite to or do you have the returns to? And I wonder if you could speak more to that second piece. I understand that you want to keep staying cash flow neutral on the year, but in this current environment, is $45 enough for \u2013 you would have the cash flow \u2013 but is it enough on the returns front on these plays to really entice you to up your rig count? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Charles, a couple of things. Number one, we've seen tremendous progress and now we've got a lot of wells with returns actually full cycle, fully burdened, look pretty darn good. So I think we've got plenty of inventory. If you go back a year ago, everybody started ramping up and adding rigs quickly and expecting prices to hold. And unfortunately, those that outspent significantly in anticipation of what I'll call visibility into more flat, longer sustainable price environment, ended up having to go back to the debt markets or the equity markets, that sort of thing. So I mean we're going to be cautious. We're going to be very thoughtful and disciplined. And like I said, we're going to want to see some cash flow accrue before we start putting things back to work. But we'll have a lot of conversations over the next couple of months and weeks, actually starting next week with the Board. A lot to talk about, and the nice thing is we have a lot of attractive options right now. We've also got a lot of things we want to test. And quite frankly as I look at the results and I look at the well cost, I'm glad I didn't outspend in some of the other quarters, because we've got wells that we didn't drill. I mean, we continue to make progress and we'll do things differently. So there's a fine line of feeling when we're ready to move forward. We clearly had the financial capacity to do so. The returns are starting to look pretty darn good, and it's a function of managing and balancing your financial structure. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Got it. That's helpful detail, John. And am I understanding you correctly that it's not just the level of the oil price, but you want to see it settle in there with less volatility? Is that am I hearing that correctly? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, no. We're going to have to be prepared to live in volatile bands. But I just want to see more visibility into more belief we're going to have the cash flow that's going to come with the price, and it's going to stay there a little bit, so. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Yes. Thanks. If I could, just a couple accounting-related questions for me. First, on Egypt, am I understanding it right, you basically had, on a recurring net income basis, about a $17 million loss, if I just back off the $54 million write down from the $71 million non-controlling interest? I'm just talking about the non-controlling interest side, that $17 million. And if that's right, I'm just trying to think through, what price level is that business net income breakeven? Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. Sorry, Michael. You're looking at what number for Egypt? Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : So, on the non-controlling interest side, the $71 million loss that was backed out, if you just adjust that for the $54 million write down in the adjustment, you get $17 million loss on that third of the business. Is that the right way to think about it? And if so, what price level brings net income to breakeven? Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. If you corrected that for the Egypt's non-controlling portion of the impairment in Egypt, you said. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Right. Exactly, yes. Is that the right way to think about it? Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, so \u2013 and the question is what would it take to do what? Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : My question is, number one, is that right way to think about if that's the net income on that third of the business? And then number two, what price level would be required to drive a net income breakeven for that business? Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, okay. So I think that for the quarter, yes, that's a reasonable way to think about that. I think when you reduce operating results down to a single quarter, you're going to get lots of noise in that quarter. But for example I think we had a significant piece of noise on the revenue side in Egypt for the quarter to the tune of about $8 million on gas revenue side that we're in some dispute on, and we're looking at. I think that obviously the issue with the price that would breakeven, so how much lower can the price go to breakeven from an accounting perspective. I think that's obviously very difficult to do because of the cost sharing arrangement in the PSC. So I'm not really prepared to say how far down prices would have to go in order for that number to become zero. But suffice it to say, it would have to go down a bit more from where it is in the first quarter in order for that to happen. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Yes, that's what I was getting at, that's helpful. Maybe I'll follow up more offline. And then the other piece was just on the North Sea, again accounting-related, but the $27 million PRT refund, was that adjusted out of net income in that $55 million tax adjustment, or is that still in the net income line? Is that expected to recur, or any more of those coming this year? Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, it's not adjusted out of net income. It is a PRT refund because of, there are some costs related to prior year items. That's not an unusual type of thing to happen in the North Sea. We have that happen on a regular basis, we never adjust that out, whether it's a benefit to us or a detriment to us. We don't adjust it out for calculating adjusted earnings or adjusted EBITDA. It is \u2013 it's a large item this quarter relative to typical PRT simply because PRT is now approaching zero with the price environment that we have. But it's not \u2013 if you go back two or three years, you'll find PRT expense of nearly $300 million in some years. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Michael Rowe with Tudor Pickering Holt. Please go ahead. Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon. First question I have is on cash flow. You highlighted in your prepared remarks there was a big swing in working capital during the first quarter, as well as an excess of cash CapEx over accrual CapEx. So just to confirm, we should expect those items to reverse throughout the year so that you don't have any net debt additions, all else equal, according to the budget? Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's right. So if we assume we don't pay down any debt this year, we expect to end closer to the $1.5 billion of cash where we started. We had about, a little over $450 million of cash consumption in the first quarter. Roughly two thirds of that, if you just take, if you look at first quarter actual versus the plan that it would take for the year to get to cash flow neutrality, of that $450 million, and about two thirds of that is because we built working capital in the first quarter and we had practically zero sale proceeds in the first quarter. We expect both of those items to be cash flow generators for us by the time we get to the end of the year. So, about two thirds of the $450 million is simply because of that. We had a pretty significant build in working capital during the quarter. The other one-third of the $450 million would be split roughly 50-50 between the overspend on capital in the year, versus kind of an average quarterly run rate for the year and the shortfall on revenues, less OpEx, because of the fact that prices were below our $35, $2.35 Henry Hub plan for the year. On the working capital side, I mean, so why did we build working capital in the first quarter? The primary reason for that is because of the pay down of payables and accrued costs between the end of the fourth quarter last year and the end of first quarter this year. And that's primarily because activity is slowing down so much, so our payables are coming down. Activity won't continue to slow down quite at the pace that it did through that timeframe, and we expect inventory and accounts receivables, which tend to lag a bit, the pay down of payables, those to also come down through the year. And then we've got some pretty significant unique items, if you will, on the working capital side that we expect late this year, probably in the fourth quarter. Those are primarily in the form of tax refunds on loss carrybacks that \u2013 one has been filed, one is about to be filed. And then also, we do anticipate some asset sales, which will also take place later this year, the proceeds of which will come in late in 2016. So all of those things combine to offset the $460 million cash deficit that we incurred in the first quarter. Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Great. That's helpful. Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : A very longwinded way of saying, yes, we anticipate getting back to $1.5 billion cash with the same debt level by the end of this year. Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks for the clarity there. And my second question, or follow-up, is you talked about adding capital potentially back to the Permian first if you got some stability on the oil price and felt good about the cost structure. But I was wondering if you all are comfortable allocating that towards strategic testing first, kind of like you're already doing this year, rather than full development or development drilling? Just curious on how you compare the capital efficiency between strategic testing and development drilling. Thanks. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And, Michael, in my prepared comments, we said obviously there would be some that went into the development side of Permian as well as some acceleration of some of the testing. And then also you've got a couple platform rigs in the North Sea that we'd like to keep active. And then you've got Egypt \u2013 projects in Egypt as well as the Woodford. So we look at what sets us up best for the future, and we look at the timing under which we want to go drill some development wells as well. So it'd be a balance, but you'd see some of it going to development potentially and then some of it would accelerate some testing. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities. Please go ahead. Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thanks, John, and thanks for taking a call at this late hour. I'll be quick. Obviously, you've had some nice well results over the past several quarters in that Pecos Bend area. Roughly how much surface acres do you have there and how many estimated drilling locations, given the various targets, at this point? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The Pecos Bend area is a very small area that we've got, and we've been pretty active there. I think it shows you, it's a block of acreage that's less than 10,000 acres. And quite frankly, the other nice thing there is we have a high mineral interest. So we don't have many royalty owners we have to share anything with. But it just shows you the depth and the number of wells and so forth that we can continue to drill. We've got a good, I would say, probably 40 to 50 wells there easily that even the one zone would add. Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.: Okay. And just staying that same theme, looking at some of your best areas in the Permian, I guess that would be Pecos Bend, Barnhart, Deadwood, Wild Flower, how much acreage in total is made up from all of those different areas? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I mean, the best thing I can do is point you back to our November 2014 Analyst Day where we broke the areas down. I mean, we've got 3.3 million gross acres in the Permian. We've got about 1.6 million to 1.7 million net. The four-county area we showed in the southern Midland Basin, we've got over 200,000 acres. That did not really include even the Audrian County stuff. So the best place to go look at those acreage counts would be going back to our analysts update from late 2014. Operator : At this time I will turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. Gary T. Clark - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Regina. Well, that's going to conclude the call the day. We've reached the top of the hour. We look forward to speaking with everybody on next quarter's call. If you have any follow ups, please call Christopher Cortez or myself. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining, and you may now disconnect.",

LLC Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Brandi, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Gary T. Clark - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's second quarter of 2016 financial and operational results conference call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache CEO and President John Christmann and Executive Vice President CFO Steve Riney. Also joining us in the room is Tim Sullivan, Executive Vice President of Operations. In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our second quarter financial and operational supplement. As discussed in our press release yesterday, Apache announced that during the second quarter of 2016, the company voluntarily changed its method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities from the full cost to the successful efforts method. All numbers discussed today will be stated under successful efforts unless otherwise noted. Please note the following documents will be available after the close of business today : our second quarter 10-Q filing; Form 8-K filings that include certain financial information from Apache's 2015 Form 10-K and first quarter 2016 Form 10-Q recast to reflect the retrospective application of the successful efforts method; and a successful efforts conversion PDF presentation which contains additional detailed information regarding the impact of this accounting change. Please reference our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com to access these documents. I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. I will now turn the call over to John. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Apache continues to make great progress in all aspects of our business, as demonstrated by the strength of our second quarter results. Before we get into the details, I would like to start off by highlighting a few important takeaways from today's call. First, we delivered another solid quarter of adjusted earnings and operating cash flow. This underscores the significant progress we have made on costs and the resilience of our portfolio in a low price and low reinvestment environment. Second, we have been working all aspects of our cost structure for more than 18 months. Last year, the majority of our cost savings came from G&A reductions and capital efficiencies. While these costs continue to improve, we are now seeing most of our significant savings coming from LOE [Lease Operating Expenses]. Third, production volumes continue to hold up well and track in line with the increased guidance range we provided last quarter. Our production expectations for the full year remain unchanged. Finally, with our cost structure better synchronized with the lower oil price environment and with the potential for prices to exceed our $35 budget for the year, we can see a path to more normalized investment levels. Our conservative budgeting approach coupled with incremental cash flow in the second quarter now gives us the optionality to increase investment activity. Any incremental investment will continue to be made within the construct of our rigorous capital allocation process and within operating cash flow. Now I will turn to our second quarter results, focusing first on the positive results we are realizing from our cost-cutting initiatives. Apache continues to drive significant reductions to its cost structure. After an impressive first quarter, our lease operating expenses were down even further in the second quarter. Our operational teams have done an exceptional job attacking every aspect of LOE. For example, we have renegotiated power, chemical, and water handling contracts, in some cases locking in very attractive pricing for the long term. We have also significantly lowered our third-party contractor costs in the field as we further leverage the capabilities of our field personnel. On the G&A front, while most of the heavy lifting was done last year, we continue to identify additional opportunities to align overhead costs with projected activity levels. Importantly, we have retained the capacity to support much higher investment, so we do not anticipate these costs to revert. On the capital side, last quarter I noted an impressive decrease in our average well costs, which were down cumulatively about 45% compared to 2014. While we are seeing the rate of service price reductions begin to flatten out, we continue to find opportunities for overall well cost improvements. As we transition from strategic testing to development drilling operations, we will realize additional efficiencies and cost savings. For example, we will increase pad drilling operations, thereby enabling more efficient batch drilling and completions. We will drill longer laterals and reduce the number of future wellbores and associated costs. We will increase our utilization of rotary steerables, enabling better landing zone targeting and faster penetration rates. In addition, most of our rigs currently working in North America and the North Sea were contracted prior to 2015 at very high day rates. Consequently, we anticipate our average rig rates will decline in the future. Moving on to production for the quarter, as noted in this morning's press release, Apache's global pro forma production was 461,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, consisting of 282,000 BOEs per day in North America onshore and 179,000 BOE per day in international and offshore. North American onshore production declined roughly 16,000 BOEs per day from the first quarter. We only placed 20 new gross operated wells on production in North America during the second quarter, so these declines were expected. Notably, less than 5,600 BOEs per day of this decline was in the Permian, where Apache currently generates its highest North American margins. As set forth in our quarterly supplement, Apache's cash margins in the Permian averaged approximately $17 per BOE in the second quarter, which is more than double those in the rest of North America. Consequently, most of the volume reduction in North America had relatively little impact on our earnings and cash flow. Our Permian region produced 165,000 BOEs per day in the second quarter or nearly 60% of Apache's total North American onshore production. In the Delaware Basin, we placed only two gross operated wells on production, both of which targeted the Third Bone Spring formation in the Pecos Bend area. One very notable well which we mentioned in last quarter's call was the Blue Jay Unit 103H. This well was placed on production in April and achieved an exceptional 30-day average rate of nearly 3,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day from a lateral length of approximately 5,100 feet. In fact, in its first 90 days on production, the oil component alone of this well was 147,000 barrels, making it Apache's best well to date in the Delaware Basin. In our Waha area of the Delaware Basin, through drilling longer laterals and taking advantage of natural fracture systems, we continued to enhance production rates. This has significantly improved the economics at Waha and reduced our breakeven oil price. An example of our recent successes is the 905H well, which we placed on production just after the end of the second quarter. This well achieved a peak 24-hour IP rate of approximately 1,750 barrels of oil equivalent. As a result of our technical progress, we now have an expanding inventory of attractive locations at Waha in both the Wolfcamp A and Third Bone Spring formations. To sum up our opportunity in the Delaware Basin, in the Pecos Bend and Waha areas alone, we can support a multi-rig drilling program for several years. In the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform, and Northwest Shelf, we placed a combined 16 gross operated wells on production, which is down from 25 wells in the first quarter. During the second quarter, we brought online two Wolfcamp B wells, the Connell 38B 2HM and Connell 38C 2HM, each of which achieved a 30-day average rate of more than 1,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day from one-mile laterals. Subsequent to quarter end, we placed another strong Wolfcamp B well, the CC 4144 East 2HM, on production at a peak 24-hour IP rate of approximately 2,200 BOEs per day. Much of our testing in the Wolfcamp involves completions and landing zone optimization. The improvements we are making, as demonstrated by these wells, will significantly enhance our Wolfcamp program going forward. Also in the Midland Basin, we look toward bringing on three Lower Spraberry shale wells in the second half of this year, where we have significant running room and anticipate very compelling economics. Finally, on the Northwest Shelf, we placed nine horizontal Yeso wells on production during the quarter and continued to generate very good production rates and economics from this play. One noteworthy well, the Hummingbird #7, produced a 30-day average rate of 734 BOEs per day. As a reminder, our well costs in the Yeso play are very low, typically around $2.5 million. To sum up the Permian, Apache has made great strides during the downturn to improve every aspect of our business. Reduced drilling days, better landing zone targeting, optimized fracs, and many other efficiencies have all contributed to expanding our economic drilling opportunities. We look forward to continued improvements which will fully leverage the upside potential of our vast acreage position. Outside of the Permian, Apache had no active drilling rigs in North America and placed on production only two other operated wells, both of which were in the Woodford-SCOOP. We have limited activity planned in the SCOOP for the remainder of the year. However, Apache's 50,000-plus net acres in the play will underpin a profitable two or three rig drilling program for many years to come. Despite our low level of reinvestment, we are making great progress in North America. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, our North American onshore production guidance is tracking in line with our previous 2016 guidance range of 268,000 to 278,000 BOEs per day. On the international and offshore side, pro forma production for the quarter was 179,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, consisting of approximately 101,000 BOEs from Egypt, 71,000 BOEs from the North Sea, and 7,000 BOEs from the Gulf of Mexico. In Egypt, gross production of 350,000 BOEs per day was down modestly compared to the first quarter, due primarily to outages at a third-party gas plant. On a net basis, pro forma volumes declined sequentially by 2,800 BOEs per day, primarily due to the impact of improving Brent oil prices on the cost recovery mechanisms and our production sharing contracts. Apache placed 14 wells on production in Egypt during the second quarter and achieved a drilling success rate of 93%. In the North Sea, production was approximately 71,000 BOEs per day during the second quarter, up slightly from the first quarter. This was primarily the result of a few strong development wells brought into production around the end of the first quarter and improved operational uptime which more than offset the underlying base decline. Apache drilled two very notable development wells in the quarter. The BCR B81 in the Beryl field was placed on production in late June and achieved a peak 24-hour IP rate of 55 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day. The LP7 well was also placed on production in June at a peak 24-hour IP rate of 46 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we anticipate North Sea production will be up modestly from the second quarter. The benefit of BCR and LP7 will be mostly offset by seasonal maintenance downtime. At our Aviat project in the Forties field, we have now completed and tied in the first well. As you will recall, Aviat enables a switch from diesel to natural gas as our primary source of power for the Forties field. This is an environmentally friendly project that will extend the economic life of Forties and reduce certain safety, cost, and reliability risks associated with bunkering diesel to our platforms. As highlighted in our November 2015 North Sea webcast, we are drilling two exploration prospects in the second half of 2016, Storr and Kinord. Both prospects offer low-cost tieback opportunities to our existing Beryl infrastructure and have material reserve potential. We expect to have results for both before year end. Since we have received many questions lately on Suriname, let me provide a brief update. On Block 53, we have completed an extensive geologic and 3-D geophysical review and prioritized a number of attractive prospects. We anticipate drilling our next exploratory well on the block in 2017. A drill ship has been contracted and preparations are underway. On Block 58, a 3D seismic shoot is in progress, and we will have an early look by the end of the year and have a fully processed data package in 2017. To sum up international and offshore, while activity was limited, we had very good development results in both Egypt and the North Sea during the second quarter. We remain on track to produce between 170,000 and 180,000 BOEs per day on a pro forma basis for the full year 2016. Both Egypt and the North Sea generated positive free cash flow in the first half of 2016, and we anticipate that we'll continue to do so for the remainder of the year. We are excited about the future exploration potential in our international and offshore portfolio and look forward to providing more details in the future. Now for a look into the second half of 2016 and our updated view on full-year capital guidance. As we mentioned in last quarter's call, our top priorities for incremental capital in 2016 are to increase investment activity in the Permian, keep two platform rigs operational in the North Sea, and to accelerate strategic testing initiatives across the portfolio. We have now initiated action of all of these priorities. In the Midland Basin, we added a second rig in late July and will focus on Lower Spraberry and Wolfcamp B targets through the remainder of the year. In the North Sea, our two platform rigs will remain manned and focused on workovers and development drilling. Additionally, a considerable portion of our incremental capital will be directed toward accelerating strategic testing initiatives that will have minimal impact on 2016 production. As a result of the increased activity I just described, we now expect our 2016 North American capital spend to be at the high end of our $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion guidance. Importantly, we will not lose our capital discipline as activity increases, and we will continue to target unchanged or lower net debt at year end irrespective of changes in commodity price. Our incremental 2016 spending will have minimal impact on average 2016 production. However, this increased investment will help to stem our production decline and build momentum as we enter 2017. In closing, Apache has benefited from deliberate decisions to budget conservatively and to position the company for stability and success in a lower price environment. We have streamlined our asset base, significantly reduced our cost structure, and allocated a considerable percentage of our resources to strategic testing initiatives. Despite more than an 85% reduction in capital investment since 2014, we have high-graded our drilling inventory and substantially increased our opportunity set. I can say with confidence that despite the industry downturn, Apache has far more potential than we did just 18 months ago. We have protected our balance sheet and chosen to invest within our cash flows while maintaining our dividend and avoiding equity issuances. This approach has paid off, as we have maintained our investment-grade credit rating and reduced our net debt level by 38% since early 2015. Going forward, our budgeting approach will remain conservative and methodical. We will continue to manage oil and gas price volatility by setting a reasonable expected price band and gearing our capital spending, returns targets, and capital structure to the lower end of that band. Should realized prices come in higher, we will maintain the planning capability and operational flexibility to respond accordingly. This will help to ensure we generate the best possible returns on our drilling programs and maintain our strong financial position through the cycle. In the second half of 2016, our primary goals remain unchanged. We will live within our means, maintain our strong financial position, continue to build high-quality development inventory for the future, and invest to improve long-term returns and create shareholder value. I will now turn the call over to Steve Riney. Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I will cover several key topics. I will begin with Apache's switch from the full cost accounting method to successful efforts. I will lay out the rationale for the change and outline the primary differences between the two methodologies. Next, I will review our second quarter 2016 financial results as reported under successful efforts. I will contrast these with results that would have been reported under full cost. Please note that our quarterly financial and operational supplement contains a slide that compares key second quarter line items under successful efforts to the same items under full cost. I encourage you to review these comparisons to better understand the impact of the accounting change on our second quarter results. The full cost results outlined in the supplement are probably more comparable with analyst estimates for the quarter and should compare favorably to most expectations. Following that, I will review Apache's primary financial objectives for the remainder of 2016. And finally, I will update and expand our 2016 guidance. Our guidance will now be based on 2016 anticipated results under successful efforts. So let's begin with a discussion of our switch to the successful efforts accounting methodology. As many of you are aware, Apache has been evaluating a switch to successful efforts for several quarters. We have now effected that transition with our second quarter 2016 results. We decided to proceed with the change for two primary reasons. First, successful efforts provides for a better matching of costs incurred with the period in which they impact financial results. This is primarily accomplished through the recognition of exploration expense. Under full cost accounting, more costs tend to be capitalized onto the balance sheet and then depreciated over time. During periods of sustained low oil and gas prices, this typically results in significant ceiling test write-downs, as Apache experienced over the last 18 months. Successful efforts generally results in lower reported earnings and operating cash flows in the near term. But in the long run, the balance sheet and earnings are less impacted by commodity price volatility. Second, successful efforts is generally preferred by the investment community and is more commonly used by the vast majority of E&P companies. Nine out of the 11 companies in what we often refer to as our peer group currently utilize successful efforts. So this transition allows for more easily understood and more comparable financial results for Apache. Now let me touch briefly on the changes you will see under successful efforts. As I just indicated, one of the primary differences is that under successful efforts, we will report exploration expense. Exploration expense includes four significant categories of costs. First, it includes exploration-related seismic costs, which are differentiated from capitalized development-related seismic costs. Note, both exploration and development seismic activity are common at Apache. Second, it includes exploration-related G&A costs. Third, exploration expense includes lease rentals and the cost of any expired or surrendered leases associated with unproved acreage; and finally, dry hole costs, which will be expensed in the quarter in which an exploratory well is deemed to be uneconomic. Note, successful exploratory wells will be capitalized. Changes resulting from the recognition of exploration expense will have the following impacts on our reported financial results. On the income statement, results in the near term will appear lower under successful efforts due to the immediate recognition of exploration expense. For the second quarter of 2016, we recognized $91 million in exploration expense under successful efforts. These costs would have been capitalized under full cost. On the cash flow statement, net cash from operating activities results will be lower under successful efforts due to the exploration expense impact on net income. While the non-cash portion of exploration expense is added back to arrive at operating cash flow, the cash portion will remain as a reduction. There will be an equal and offsetting reduction in cash used in investing activities since these costs will no longer be capitalized. For the second quarter of 2016, the result was a $37 million reduction in reported operating cash flow and in cash used in investment activities. Net cash flow, of course, was the same under both methodologies. On the balance sheet, exploration expense results in less capitalized costs and therefore a lower carrying value for unproved property. The impact of the second quarter exploration expense resulted in a lower carrying value for unproved properties of $22 million. In the long run, exploration successes will transition to proved property with a lower carrying value, resulting in lower DD&A. At the end of my discussion, I will offer guidance on expected exploration expense for 2016. There are other differences between successful efforts and full cost accounting, such as capitalization of interest costs, impairment calculations, reporting of gain or loss on sales, and the treatment of assets held for sale. We don't have enough time to review all of those on this call. Accordingly, we will post a slide deck on our website at the end of the day that contains a more extensive comparison of full cost and successful efforts accounting methodologies as they relate to our financial reporting. Please feel free to reach out to Gary and his team with any questions as you work through the impacts of this change. You will see that we have included in the supplement a summary of the impacts of the switch to successful efforts on our second quarter reported results. It details what I have outlined today as well as a few other items, the most significant of which is the cumulative historical impact on Apache's balance sheet. The balance sheet now reflects the aggregate effect of successful efforts accounting from an historical perspective. You will note in particular that retained earnings has increased by $5.3 billion as of the end of the first quarter. This is the cumulative effect of many items, the most significant of which are : the recognition of past exploration expense, which reduces retained earnings by $8 billion; changes in past DD&A, ceiling test write-downs, and asset impairment charges, which increases retained earnings by $14.9 billion; changes to past reported gains or losses on asset sales that decreased retained earnings by $1 billion; and various other items, including adjustments to capitalized interest and changes in tax valuation allowances, which decreased retained earnings by $640 million. So let's now switch our successful efforts based financial results for the second quarter as announced in this morning's press release. Apache reported a second quarter GAAP loss of $244 million or $0.65 per common share. These results include a number of items outside of core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in their published earnings estimates. In the second quarter, items generally not considered part of core earnings totaled $145 million after tax. Apache's loss for the quarter when adjusted for these items was $99 million or $0.26 per share. Under full cost accounting, our adjusted earnings would have been a profit of $0.05 per share. Since market expectations for the quarter assumed full cost accounting, we believe this is a more comparable basis for assessing our results. During the second quarter, we generated cash from operating activities of $744 million, a substantial increase from our first quarter result. Improved commodity prices, disciplined cost control, and a release of cash from working capital drove this improvement. Under full cost accounting, cash from operating activities would have been $781 million. Apache ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash on hand. This is an increase of approximately $200 million from the end of the first quarter. After consuming cash in the first quarter, we are now rebuilding our cash position back toward the $1.5 billion we had to start the year. This is consistent with our goal to end 2016 with the same or lower net debt than we began the year with. Turning to costs, lease operating expenses in the second quarter were $7.38 per barrel of oil equivalent, down 4% from the first quarter, following a significant quarter-on-quarter reduction from the fourth quarter of 2015. We continue to focus aggressively on all forms of cost reduction, and LOE has shown a tremendous response to that focus so far in 2016. That said, our expectation is that LOE per barrel of oil equivalent will increase in the second half of 2016 due to the timing of workover activity and seasonal maintenance. On the G&A side, costs continued to decline as we align our overhead cost structure with anticipated future capital spending levels. As you will recall, for the purposes of monitoring progress made on our G&A costs, we define G&A as our gross overhead cash costs. This excludes incentive compensation as well as G&A cost recoveries from our partners. These two items tend to offset one another but will vary from year to year. Our goal for 2016 was to reduce these costs to a range of $650 million to $700 million. We are currently tracking at the low end of this range. G&A costs have historically been incurred such that 45% was capitalized, 20% went to LOE, and 35% was expensed. With significant changes to our G&A cost structure and elements of G&A now being reported as exploration expense, you should expect going forward that G&A costs will track more closely to 25% being capitalized, 15% to LOE, 10% to exploration expense, and 50% recorded as G&A on the income statement. Actual results will of course differ and will reflect quarterly fluctuations and the timing of costs. But this is a good general allocation to use on an annual basis. Apache's DD&A in the second quarter under successful efforts was $13.75 per barrel of oil equivalent. This is a modest increase relative to the first quarter as reported under full cost. This increase in DD&A is primarily attributable to an increase in the carrying value of our oil and gas properties resulting from the switch to successful efforts. Next, I would like to turn to our key financial objectives for the remainder of 2016. Apache has worked hard to build a strong financial position, and we like where we stand. We have a strong liquidity position with $1.2 billion of cash and $3.5 billion of available credit facility. We have a very reasonable level of debt, and we have maintained our investment-grade rating through the downturn. Equally important, we are running the business to be cash flow neutral at $35 oil. That being the case, we now have the possibility of higher cash flow in 2016 to the extent oil price averages above $35. We are in a unique position where we could fund an increase in capital investment with cash from operations. As always, incremental capital spending will be subject to a rigorous focus on long-term full-cycle rates of return. With this context, our key financial objectives for the second half of 2016 are to : continue to focus on cost management in all aspects of the business. We have accomplished a lot, but there is always more to do; allocate capital resources to the very best projects to enhance the quality of our drillable inventory and to deliver attractive fully burdened returns; balance capital spending with available cash flows to end the year with the same or lower net debt; and maintain our current investment-grade rating. I would like to conclude by updating our guidance for the remainder of 2016 and offering a few additional items that may be helpful in light of our switch to successful efforts. As John already noted, after raising production guidance with our first quarter results, our full-year production guidance ranges for both North America onshore and international and offshore remain unchanged. He also reviewed our increased activity levels and noted that we now expect full-year capital spending to be at the high end of our $1.4 billion to $1.8 million range. With regard to LOE, following our first quarter results, we reduced our 2016 LOE guidance from $9.50 to $9.25 per BOE. Given the continued excellent progress we have made during the second quarter but taking into account an expected increase in workover and seasonal maintenance expense, we now expect full-year LOE at $8.50 per BOE or lower. On G&A costs, we will continue to speak about this in terms of gross spend, regardless of where it shows up in our financial statements. As indicated previously, we are approaching the lower end of our guidance range of $650 million to $700 million. While we continue to focus on our overhead cost structure, our guidance will remain unchanged. With the change to successful efforts and recent write-downs of unproved properties, we anticipate expensing a higher percentage of our interest costs going forward. Accordingly, we forecast that approximately 90% of our total interest cost will be expensed in 2016. As noted previously, successful efforts requires the recognition of exploration expense each quarter. Exploration expense includes some items that are planned and predictable and other items that tend to be volatile from quarter to quarter. Specifically, dry hole costs and unproved property impairments by their nature do not lend themselves to guidance. Consequently, for the full year 2016, we anticipate exploration expense in aggregate will be in the range of $250 million to $300 million. This includes actual dry hole costs and unproved property impairments through the second quarter but excludes them for the second half of the year. Finally, with regard to taxes, as I noted on our call back in February, we anticipate minimal cash taxes will be paid in 2016. In conclusion, we are proud of our financial accomplishments over the past 18 months. Our liquidity is strong. Our debt levels are under control, and we are living within our means. We have completed the transition to successful efforts, which will enhance comparability with our peers and better inform our already rigorous planning and capital allocation processes. We look to the future with great optimism and have set our long-term sights on significantly improving returns on capital employed and generating competitive per share growth, which will be an outcome of disciplined returns-based investment decisions. I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond with Simmons Piper Jaffray. Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray : Thank you for taking my questions. John, on hedging, what are your latest thoughts there? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Pierce, we came into this downturn unhedged. And our best hedge was being able to reduce our activity levels, which we've done. We feel like we're living within cash flow. We're going to approach forward-looking prices in terms of budgeting around a band and then giving ourselves flexibility when prices range above that. So the plan at this point is we don't have a lot of plans for hedging. We want the exposure. And I think the big key has been we're making long-term decisions and long-term investments, and we need to be gearing our cost structure and overhead structure and investment criteria to where those prices are. We'll budget conservatively and then reap the benefits when things are above it. Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray : Great. And then my follow-up is what are you doing differently with the Blue Jay well, the very strong well results there? Is there anything specific that you're doing differently now versus, say, a few months ago? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think it's just the culmination of the technical work that we've been doing in the area with specific targeting. We now have three zones in the Third Bone in that area. We've really gone in and I'll say specialized our completions. We're learning which zones, where we want to complete with all of the changes there. But it's just really the evolution of the process and the continuous improvement that we seek in every well we drill. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning \u2013 or I guess it's afternoon. John, when you start thinking about 2017 and assume a higher price deck, I'll just call it whatever, call it $50 \u2013 $55, how should we think about the Permian as far as allocation? I know that number bumped up a little bit this quarter, thinking about 2016. So how do you think about Permian allocations, and where would those rigs be focused within the Permian? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: At this point, we geared 2016 at $35. And at that level, we were not making very many development drilling choices in North America. You see with the little shift in capital, North America is getting the lion's share of that. The lion's share of that is going into our Permian operations. Clearly, at those types of price levels, Dave, we'd be looking at significant higher levels of investment. We're running a bunch of scenarios as we start to think about 2017. We'll come out with more color and more guidance like we typically do when we look at the fourth quarter call of this year as we start to think about 2017. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, and then let me follow up with the North Sea. You're talking about keeping two operated rigs \u2013 or platform rigs out there. Can you talk about what that looks like over the next six months? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It shows you that first and foremost, we're able to add a couple of platform rigs back into our plan in the North Sea. And truthfully, if you look at our international CapEx, it's going to be down from where we started initially the year, which is due to the efficiencies. So it shows you the progress we've been making on the international front as well. We felt like maintaining those two rigs is critical. We've got a lot of workovers and a lot of high-return projects that we can pursue, and it's not a lot of capital added back in for the back half of the year. So they compete very, very well, and a lot of low-hanging fruit that we'll go after. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : Yes, hi. Thank you. John, in your prepared comments, you mentioned that your employees can support a much higher level of activity. Could you give us a sense of how high is high? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: John, the one thing we didn't want to do, we reduced our staff about 30% in 2015. And quite frankly, I think when we look at us today, we've got the ability to ramp up internally significantly from where we sit today. I think we could probably handle a $60 \u2013 $65 deck pretty easily. So we tried really hard. We've got a lot of employees we've made significant investments in, and we were very methodical and forward-thinking in terms of our staffing levels. So I feel really good about our internal head count. That's the one area we didn't want to get too aggressive and try to gear it to this lower side of the \u2013 the lower end of the price environment. John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. My next one for me is on Suriname. I couldn't quite hear you. You shot seismic on Block 53 or Block 58? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We've got two blocks there. Block 53 we own 45% of. That seismic was shot prior. We have gone and we drilled a well last year and have gone in and fully evaluated that. We have a handful of prospects we're looking at. We have contracted a rig and anticipate drilling a well on Block 53 in very early 2017. Block 58, we are currently shooting seismic there now, and we own that block 100%. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you, good afternoon. As you begin to ramp up CapEx a bit, you talked about the incremental going a little bit more for strategic testing versus development. Can you talk about how long the period would be where you'd be more focused on strategic testing versus development based on the inventory or opportunity to do those strategic tests? Or what oil price would you need to see where you would allocate meaningfully more capital towards the development side of the equation? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think the important thing, Brian, is we've got a lot of opportunity in our acreage position that we're excited about, and we have a lot of key wells that we want to drill. We want to get some of those wells drilled because knowing those results and those things will impact how you grade out your capital in the future, which projects you pursue, and also it comes into how you address the portfolio. So there's a lot of things out there. And quite frankly, we took a very balanced approach this year. We took a conservative approach. We budgeted $35. We scaled back significantly. That just slows down the rate at which we're moving through some things that are pretty important to us. Clearly, with prices averaging in the second quarter above $35, it's given us some cash flow. You see we put a rig out last month in the Midland Basin, which will be drilling some Midland Basin, Wolfcamp, and Lower Spraberry shale wells. So we're excited about that, and clearly we've got some areas where we're doing some additional testing. And I think we'll keep testing until we feel like we're in a position that we're ready to stop testing. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it, thanks. I guess it goes to the question of is $45 a good price for Apache or just a better price than $35 to accomplish both your delineation, development, and potentially in places like Suriname, exploration objectives? Or do you feel like you need the $50, $55, $60 to accomplish those objectives based on today's cost structure and how you see the balance sheet? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think the point there is, with the progress we've made on cost structure, we feel pretty good about even a $45 deck. If you go back to this year, and keep in mind our North American capital has not gone to development type projects to try to bring on volumes, at $45, if we budgeted $45 and added an additional $900 million of CapEx to North America this year, we would have kept North America flat, lived within our means, and we're already keeping our international flat. So I think the thing as we think into 2017, that number is going to be lower. Number one, our capital efficiencies are much, much better. They continue to get better. You see the progress we're making on the cost structure, the overhead structure, the LOE, the well costs. So our capital efficiency is actually \u2013 we continue to surprise ourselves with the progress we're making on the capital efficiency side. And then the other piece is, our base has come down a little bit as we've been less focused on growth and more focused on adjusting cost structure to where we can generate returns. So quite frankly, $45 would have been a pretty comfortable price for us this year, and I think that number would be lower in 2017. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James. John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good afternoon. When I'm thinking about the CapEx budget and through the new conversation on the higher end, can I still think about that when I'm looking at the implied oil price? Is it still okay to just say roughly, on an annualized basis, $400 million of incremental cash flow for every $5 improvement in the oil price? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think that's a pretty good number annualized. John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, and then just one quick one. On the North Sea, last quarter you all had a good bit of the third-party plant and some pipeline outages, and I'm just curious. Did all of that get resolved, or did any of that spill into this quarter? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think we had a little bit. It was better this quarter. But I think we planned for a little bit more than in years past, but it's much better today. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, guys. My first question is a follow-up to Brian's macro question. John, you've been constructive on the oil outlook since February, and now you've begun a modest acceleration. So as it relates to Apache, what are your early thoughts on 2017 volumes on a low $50 oil price? And are you ready to join the emerging, growing low $50s club that seems to be emerging from earnings? And I guess secondly, given the tremendous costs and sequential improvements, any thoughts on what that means for your commodity outlook that have been pretty constructive since they've been pretty accurate as well? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The first thing I would say is we're going to be a member of the returns club, is the club we want to be focused in and focused on full cycle, full cost, fully burdened returns. And that's the club we're focused in. I think above $45 this year, you would have seen our volumes grow and been able to do that. So as I think about joining a $50 club, we probably already were in the $50 club. So we just haven't planned accordingly. We budgeted $35 this year, and you've seen us let a little bit of capital out. So I think the market today is more constructive than it's been, both on oil and natural gas. I think it got a little bit ahead of itself here in the last few months, and we've seen it come back as we went back and touched $40. I think we'll see what kind of price band we look at as we get into 2017. I don't see us departing from a conservative budgeting approach, gearing things to the low end of the band. And then we can always let a little bit out where we don't get ourselves in trouble in terms of spending out way beyond our means. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. My second question, your Bone Springs results have been very good. It's a smaller position there, Midland very attractive. We get the question on the depth of Apache's Tier 1 unconventional inventory. So any update or comments on the number of locations, percentage, or how you think about the amount that's economically attractive at a four-year or how you would classify as a Tier 1? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We haven't come out and really updated anything since the fall of 2014. And the approach has been we've been doing primarily strategic testing. We're not running a ton of rigs in North America. We were running 93 rigs in the fall of 2014, and we had four rigs for most of last quarter. I think at some point in the future as we start to turn more capital loose, we'll come out and talk more about some of those things. We feel good about our acreage. We feel good about our inventory. We've been building inventory. And the big deal is working the cost structure. And you see with the few number of rigs we're running, you see results getting significantly better. And that's a credit to all of our teams, the science they're applying, and the progress we're making. So we feel quite good about our inventory, our running room in a number of plays. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Edward Westlake with Credit Suisse. Edward G. Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good afternoon. I guess you've allocated more capital to the Permian, and obviously that brings into question I guess non-core assets. You've got $7 billion of net debt, which could still be viewed as a bit high in a volatile oil price environment. So maybe talk through about disposals or the plans for Canada, the Mid-Continent, and the Gulf, an area which has not gotten as much capital together. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think right now we've been working on North American cost structure. And I'm thankful that we're not in the position that we're wholesale selling assets and that over the last 12 months in this low price environment. We moved some conventional assets in late 2014 when prices were high. We moved some South Louisiana assets in late 2014 when prices were high. We moved our LNG on a high price deck. So I feel real good about what we were able to sell. I think as we look at the portfolio, and it will continue to evolve. And as we continue to assess our inventory and look at that, we'll address some of those decisions over the next 24 months in the future. But I don't see right now is a time that you want to be trying to just sell assets and bring forward cash when we're not in a period where we're outspending or wanting to spend more and drive a lot of development in this low price environment either. But clearly, over the next 24 months, we'll continue to assess what the portfolio looks like and where we will be making those types of investments. Edward G. Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And a lot of your debt has got great duration. There is some in the 2018 to 2024 timeframe. Any plans on aiming free cash flow to reduce that debt or asset disposals? Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks for throwing the finance guy a bone. So no, we are looking at possibly using some of the cash on hand to pay down some of the debt. I don't think we'll be going to any extreme amount. But if we could maybe pay down a little bit of debt as we end this year, maybe into next year, that wouldn't be a bad thing. I think you indicated we had a relatively high level of debt. I think our debt level is actually pretty comfortable right now. It could certainly be a little bit lower, yes. But with $1.2 billion of cash today and $3.5 billion of credit facility, I feel pretty comfortable with our debt level now. I might use some of the cash to pay down debt, especially in the short term. And in the meantime, I don't find that our debt level is what I would call burdensome, especially given the capital spending program that we have going on right now. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, good afternoon. Stephen, I wonder if I could throw you another bone. The LOE guidance, clearly tremendous cost progress you guys have made. How much of that would you say is going to be kept by Apache, assuming oil prices do go back up? I guess we're hearing the service companies are starting to chat a little bit about them needing some relief to some extent. Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Doug. We feel like the vast majority of our cost reductions, not just in LOE, but on the capital side and on the expense side, we feel like the vast majority of those are going to be cost reductions that we can retain. Sure, if oil prices go back up, when they go back up, there will be some pressures in some places. I'm sure John will want to weigh in on this question as well. But we feel like a lot of the actions that we've taken are really what we would call self-help type of things, changing the way we work, changing the way we do things, and both on the capital side and on the expense side. These are things that are not dependent upon the pricing from third parties. They're things that we do and the way that we work, and we feel like the vast majority of those are permanent. And a significant amount of these cost reductions have come in the onshore North America and in particular in the Permian Basin. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And the only thing I would add, Doug, is just a lot to our field folks. What we've got is workforce out there that's taken on the burden of doing things themselves, things that they might have contracted in the past, and it's that old Apache hard-core, low-cost mentality, where everybody realizes they can pitch in and save a few dollars here, and it adds up. And it's that mindset that I think that you've seen really come through in 2016. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : John, my follow up, if I may, is it seems from your prepared remarks that you're making some pretty good progress in your strategic review in terms of the initiatives and so on. Can you give us some idea where you stand then in terms of what you think is the identified inventory? Because clearly, you have a very large footprint, and I'm guessing that there's room for another portfolio high-grading exercise in North America somewhere down the line. If you could just give us some color on that, that would be great. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think the color we'll give you is we've been busy, and we're going to continue to be busy. We've had to go through a total reset in the business over the last 18 months. And the good news is we've made progress in all aspects of our portfolio. From Canada to our Mid-Continent to our Eagle Ford to our Permian, we've made progress in all of our projects, and we have a deep inventory. We also have a lot of key things that we're testing, which obviously could change the pecking order things. So we're working through all those things, Doug. I think as we start to make some decisions and conclude some of the testing and things that we're doing and start to talk about some of that, I think then that leads to what some of the follow-ons might be after that. But I'm excited about the progress that we're making across the entire portfolio and that all of our areas are doing a fantastic job. And we've got a lot of things that look very attractive with where prices are today and where cost structure has moved today. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice & Company. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, John, and to the rest of your team there. I'd like to drill in a little bit more on your Midland Basin program, where you're putting that rig back to work, or where you've recently put that rig back to work. Could you talk a little bit about, in your prepared comments, you mentioned the CC 4144 East 2HM well that came on at 2,200 BOE a day. Could you talk about, is that also in the Powell-Miller area, and was it also a 5,000-foot lateral, or was it a longer lateral? Timothy J. Sullivan - Executive Vice President \u2013 Operations Support : Charles, this is Tim Sullivan. That well was in the Powell field. It is a little bit longer. It's about a mile and a half lateral, and it's currently flowing at a rate of about 2,000 barrels a day and about 1,800 MCF per day as well. And in regard to the activity for that additional rig, second half activity in Midland will consist probably of about 17 wells, primarily focusing in the Wolfcamp and the Lower Spraberry shale. And where we will be drilling, again strategic testing in our three main fields at Wildfire, Azalea, and at Powell. And that should keep that rig busy for the remainder of 2016. John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The thing I'd add to that, Charles, is we've been busy doing some swaps and some things too that have really cored up that acreage neutral, but have cored up our position where we really can drill more longer laterals now and less the shorter laterals. That's another thing that some of the progress that we've made while we haven't had rigs in the field. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Got it. And, John, that actually gets to where I was going to go with my follow-up. Should we expect more longer laterals? It sounds like yes. And are you also still testing your individual landing zones within those formations, or do you think that you've pretty much figured out where you want to go there and you're more testing completion concepts at this point? Can you give us a sense? John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The answer to the first question is yes. You can anticipate longer laterals. That's one of the things we've been working on in our Midland basin portfolio. And then secondly, we're making progress, but there will still be some testing with this rig and some of these concepts. We've got a pretty good idea we'll be working some spacing tests as well as the zones and how you stack those zones across a section. And so we'll never stop testing. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our allotted time for today. Presenters, did you have any closing remarks? Gary T. Clark - Vice President- Investor Relations : Yes, this is Gary Clark. For those of you that did not have an opportunity to ask a question, please feel free to follow up with myself or my team, and we'll be happy to get back and answer any remaining questions you have. Thank you all for joining us today and we'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Herrlin - Societe Generale Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Doris, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache Corporation third quarter earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I will turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead. Gary T. Clark - Apache Corp.: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's third quarter 2016 financial and operational results conference call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be : Apache CEO and President John Christmann; Executive Vice President of Operations Support Tim Sullivan; and Executive Vice President and CFO Steve Riney. In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our third quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. Also, please note that Apache's third quarter 10-Q will be filed at the close of business today. I would now like to turn the call over to John. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Apache continues to make great progress on the goals we set at the beginning of the year, and our recent announcements and third quarter results underscore this positive performance. On today's call, I will discuss four primary topics. First, I will review the strategy we laid out at the beginning of 2015 to guide Apache through the downturn. I will outline how the execution of that strategy has positioned Apache for success in 2017 and beyond. Then, I will discuss our capital spending priorities as we look ahead to 2017. Following that, I will review our Permian, Egypt, and North Sea regions, and then conclude with a discussion of the Alpine High. At the start of the downturn, we established some guiding principles that have brought us to where we are today. These were : dramatically reduce development spending until price and costs come into better equilibrium; establish a strong financial position and protect it by living within cash flow; and prepare the portfolio for long-term returns, growth, and shareholder value. At the start of 2016, we put forth a very conservative capital budget of $1.6 billion. This spend level was based on a plan to live within cash flow at $35 per barrel of oil. Our capital allocation process reflected the decision to constrain capital investment in North American onshore development activities. Despite this, our North American onshore production has performed well in 2016, which is a testament to Apache's greatly improved capital efficiency and the relatively low decline rate of our Permian-anchored production base. At the beginning of 2016, our planned capital allocation for the Alpine High play was less than $100 million. As the year progressed and cash flow came in above budgeted levels, we elected to invest incremental cash flow in Alpine High rather than chase near-term production growth elsewhere. As a result, we now expect to spend approximately $500 million in Alpine High this year, which effectively accounts for the incremental cash flow above our original budget. Our financial and operational discipline has served us well. We plan to end the year with relatively unchanged net debt, and we brought forth a transformational discovery at Alpine High that will drive incremental growth and returns for years to come. With regard to next year's outlook, in February on our fourth quarter conference call, we will provide a detailed view of our 2017 capital budget and other guidance items. In the meantime, I thought it would be helpful to provide the following high-level summary of our 2017 investment priorities. Our top priority next year is funding the Alpine High. The budget will likely consist of a four- to six-rig program and a first wave of midstream build-out. The near-term pace of spending on Alpine High will be governed by the timing of infrastructure availability, as well as a prudent appraisal and delineation program. Our goal in 2017 is to ensure that investment levels do not outpace our comprehensive understanding of the opportunity or our capacity to get product to market. Our next priority is to increase development activity in our other Permian Basin focus areas. Specifically, we will add three rigs in the Midland Basin before year-end 2016, bringing our total rig count to five. This additional activity, coupled with first gas production from Alpine High, will return the Permian Basin to a strong growth trajectory in the second half of 2017. We will also continue to invest in Egypt and the North Sea at levels designed to sustain production and generate significant free cash flow. And, lastly, our other exploration projects and North American development opportunities will compete for the remaining available capital. Now turning to the third quarter. As noted in this morning's press release, Apache's adjusted production in the third quarter, which excludes tax barrels and our non-controlling interest in Egypt, was approximately 438,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This is comprised of 270,000 BOEs per day in North America onshore and 168,000 BOEs per day from the international and offshore. Production in North America onshore continues to perform well despite minimal development capital. For the full-year 2016, we expect North American onshore production will be in the upper half of our most recent guidance range of 268,000 to 278,000 BOEs per day. In the Permian, while we are clearly excited about our Alpine High acreage, we are also positioned for very attractive growth and returns elsewhere in the basin. Our focus on strategic testing during the downturn has yielded excellent results in our core Midland and Delaware Basin acreage, where we have expanded and prioritized our inventory of high-return projects. Improved landing zone targeting and new completion designs are delivering strong well performance in both areas. With these improvements and the significant progress we have made on costs, we are confident in bringing growth-oriented capital investment back to the Permian Basin. As such, we have initiated a more aggressive development drilling program the Midland Basin, and will look to expand our rig count further in 2017 if warranted by commodity prices and available cash flow. Turning briefly to our international and offshore regions, production for the quarter excluding tax barrels and our non-controlling interest in Egypt, was 168,000 BOEs per day, comprising 98,000 BOEs per day from Egypt, 62,000 BOEs from the North Sea, and 8,000 BOEs from the Gulf of Mexico. During the quarter, our North Sea operations were impacted by planned and unplanned maintenance downtime, as well as third-party facilities downtime. Thus far, we have seen volumes in the fourth quarter rebound to more normalized levels. For the full-year 2016, international and offshore production is on track for the midpoint of our 170,000 to 180,000 BOE per day guidance for the year. I am very pleased with the drilling results in our international operations this year. Our exploration and development drilling success rate in Egypt and the North Sea year to date is approximately 90%. Apache made another key discovery in the North Sea this quarter in our Storr prospect. We highlighted this prospect in our North Sea investor webcast late last year, and it marks our third consecutive exploration success since acquiring 3-D seismic data in the Beryl area. This validates the quality of our 3-D seismic data and geologic modeling and gives us higher confidence in the dozens of future exploration prospects we have identified to date. Now I would like to spend a few minutes discussing our Alpine High play. The Alpine High is an immense resource and a transformational discovery for Apache. We have invested a significant amount of human and financial capital through two years of extensive geologic and geophysical work and reservoir and fluid analysis. This was accompanied by concept testing an initial round of verification wells, the results of which we disclosed in early September. We are now engaged in a methodical appraisal and delineation program to confirm the geographic and stratigraphic extent of the play and to formulate our long-term infrastructure plan. This work will continue for the next several quarters before transitioning to an active development program once gas processing and transportation infrastructure is in place. The Alpine High can be broadly characterized as five distinct target formations, all of which we believe will be highly economic. This includes the Bone Springs and Wolfcamp, which are prevalent and productive throughout the Delaware Basin. These hybrid unconventional plays are the current focus of the industry to the north and east of the Alpine High. Two early tests have demonstrated that these formations are oil productive and offer significant potential at Alpine High. More appraisal drilling in these zones is necessary before we will provide prospective location counts and resource-in-place estimates. Underlying the Bone Springs and Wolfcamp and unique to the Alpine High is a true resource play in the Pennsylvanian [Penn], Barnett, and Woodford formations. This is a world-class source rock sequence, up to 1,500 feet thick across our acreage position. Based on our appraisal program to date, we anticipate this will become a very large resource play with attractive rates of return and breakeven economics. Together, the Penn-Barnett-Woodford source rock in the two hybrid unconventional zones in the Bone Springs and the Wolfcamp are up to 5,000 feet thick across Apache's Alpine High acreage position. Given this extensive vertical column, we anticipate drilling multiple landing zones in each of these formations and ultimately defining several pipe wells and associated location counts. As a reminder, in previous disclosure, we assigned only one landing zone to each of the Barnett and the Woodford formations on only a portion of our acreage to arrive at our current 2,000 to 3,000-plus location count. When we announced Alpine High in September, we provided production results from eight horizontal wells, six in the Woodford and one each in the Barnett and Bone Springs. The objective of this initial group of wells was only to test the boundaries of specific geologic settings and evaluate certain potential hazards. We made no effort to optimize completions, well orientation, or landing zone placement. Despite this, the test wells have continued to perform very well. Since Barclays, we have flow-tested two additional wells. The Black Hawk 1H, a normally pressured Woodford well, flowed at a peak 24-hour IP rate of 5.3 million cubic feet of gas, 224 barrels of oil, and 245 barrels of NGLs. The Redwood 1H, an over-pressured Woodford well, flowed at a peak 24-hour IP rate of 18 million cubic feet of gas. This well was drilled to a vertical depth of nearly 14,000 feet, further confirming our thermal maturity model of the play and the depth limit of the wet gas window. Tim Sullivan will provide more details on our Alpine High wells in his remarks. Finally, we have closed several additional acreage transactions over the past two months, and our Alpine High position now comprises 320,000 net contiguous acres. Apache identified and captured this position for an average price of $1,300 per acre over a period of approximately two years. This very low entry cost gives us an advantage that we believe will translate into very attractive returns on capital employed compared to the alternative of acquiring prospective Delaware acreage at current transaction prices. To summarize, our near-term drilling objectives at Alpine High include : geographic testing to define geologic settings across our acreage position; stratigraphic testing to collect data from all five formations; defining the number of landing zones and the optimal well placement and orientation within each formation; and enhancing completions and testing longer laterals and well spacing to optimize full field development. At this point, we can say with confidence that the Alpine High contains thousands of predictable high-return horizontal drilling locations that will drive returns and production growth for many years to come. Importantly, Apache controls the vast majority of the play, and we have the ability to establish the pace and scope of development. Our ultimate goal is to optimize value of this extensive resource base for the maximum long-term benefit of our shareholders as well as other stakeholders. I would now like to turn the call over to Tim Sullivan and Steve Riney, who will discuss the company's drilling results, financial performance, and midstream plans before coming back for some final remarks ahead of the Q&A session. Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Thank you, John, and good afternoon. My remarks today will be focused on providing more detail around results from our core areas, highlights from specific wells, and near-term development plans. Our Permian region produced 159,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter, or nearly 60% of Apache's total North American onshore production. Production in the Permian Basin decreased by roughly 6,200 BOE per day from the second quarter, as their declines were buffered primarily by 13 well tie-ins and our Northwest Shelf Yeso play. In our new Delaware Basin discovery, the Alpine High, we're showing results from 10 wells, comprising eight Woodford, one Barnett, and one Third Bone Springs wells. On page 15 of the operations supplement, we have updated our production curves from the wells we showed at Barclays and have included the two most recent wells. As you can see, our Alpine High wells compare favorably with the P-50 type curves for the Marcellus, Utica, and SCOOP resource plays, with half the wells producing at or above the P-50 type curves. Keep in mind, the Alpine High wells are short laterals and have not been normalized for lateral length. Also, the completions and landing zones have not been optimized. These initial wells were drilled as appraisal wells and test-of-concept and were oftentimes drilled near hazards so that we can better understand the boundaries of the play. Given this, we are excited about the early time performance. We are shutting wells in as we complete testing and we'll collect pressure buildup data. These wells will be brought back online when we begin selling gas in 2017. The two new Alpine High wells John previously mentioned are both producing from the Woodford formation. The Black Hawk State 1H, which was drilled in a normally pressured setting, has the highest oil cut in the Woodford among the wells we have drilled to date. The Redwood 1H is the deepest well we have drilled and is our highest gas producer. We have also updated production from the Bone Springs producer Mont Blanc 2H, which can be seen on page 17 of the operations supplement. The well, which was a non-optimized completion with a short lateral, has a cumulative production of greater than 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent over 100 days and is currently producing 220 barrels of oil and 580 MCF per day with a stable GOR. Also, you can see that the water production has decreased to approximately 275 barrels per day. The wells drilled to date have confirmed the unprecedented picture of the vertical dimensions of the play of the Bone Springs to the Woodford across our acreage position, with the hydrocarbon column ranging from oil to wet gas to dry gas confirming our geologic model. We have seen a range of initial oil cuts in the Woodford from zero to 20%. The shallower Barnett well has an oil cut of 21%. These yields are in line with our thermal maturity model and can be correlated to depth. The gas is extremely rich, with an average BTU of approximately 1,300. This should provide for an average NGL yield in excess of 100 barrels per million cubic feet of natural gas when permanent facilities are in place. As expected in a resource play, Alpine High is becoming more predictable. Every well we've drilled has confirmed our model. In the Pecos Bend area in the Delaware Basin, we placed seven gross operated wells on production, all of which targeted the Third Bone Springs formation. We continue to see excellent production performance across this play. Our Blue Jay Unit 103H well continues its strong performance. Using 3-D seismic, we targeted a highly fractured area. The well has produced 427,000 barrels of oil equivalent in just under seven months, achieving an average rate of roughly 2,260 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This well is currently producing approximately 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 60% is oil. In a less fractured area of the play, we are also able to drill economic wells by utilizing pad drilling operations. On our Falcon State lease, a 6-well pad came online in mid-September, with an average 30-day rate of 625 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This pad also demonstrated our best-in-class operational efficiencies in this basin, with an average total well cost of $3.5 million per well. In the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform, and Northwest Shelf, we placed a combined 16 gross operated wells on production in the quarter. We ran two rigs in the third quarter, primarily in the Midland Basin, and intend to ramp up to five rigs by the end of the year. Activity is focused on stratigraphic landing zone targeting and development pad drilling in the Wolfcamp and Spraberry shale formations and our Wildfire, Azalea, and Powell focus areas. We also expect to bring 20 horizontal wells online over the next two quarters across these three areas. As we stated on our last quarter call, in the third quarter we brought online the CC 4144 East 2HM, producing from the Wolfcamp B formation at Powell. This well continues to show strong performance and has produced 136,000 barrels of oil equivalent in the first 90 days online, at an average of more than 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This well along with our Connell 38B 2HM and 38C 2HM wells were drilled with our improved targeting and completion design, which we highlighted last quarter. Please refer to page 18 in our operations supplement for a production update of our Midland Basin focus area. Subsequent to quarter end, we brought online the Lynch A 6HM, a Wolfcamp B producer in our Wildfire area in Midland County. This 8,500-foot lateral was completed with 146 frac stages at approximately 60-foot frac spacing, pumping 1,700 pounds per foot of sand. The well is still cleaning up and has not reached peak production but is flowing at a rate of 1,120 barrels of oil and 1.1 million cubic feet of gas per day. In addition to this well, we will be testing one Middle Spraberry and three Lower Spraberry wells in our Wildfire focus area later this month. Much of our previous strategic testing in the Wolfcamp and Spraberry involved completions and landing zone optimization. The improvements we are making, as demonstrated by these wells, will significantly enhance our Midland Basin program going forward. In the Northwest Shelf, we placed nine horizontal Yeso wells in production during the quarter and continue to generate very good production rates and economics from this play. The 30-day rate for these nine wells averaged almost 450 barrels of oil equivalent per day. With our best-in-class drilling and completion cost for these wells, we averaged less than $2.5 million per well. This program generates extremely favorable economics on a fully burdened basin. In addition to the nine horizontal Yeso wells, we also placed four vertical Yeso wells on production during the quarter. Outside of the Permian, Apache had no active drilling rigs operating in North America during the quarter. We did, however, test seven operated wells, all in Canada, in our Annie Creek, Montney, and Wapiti Montney focus areas. Most notably is our 9-of-23 well, completed in the Lower Montney in our Wapiti area. This well tested at an impressive initial rate of 10.6 million cubic feet of gas per day and approximately 2,000 barrels of condensate per day, with a total estimated completed well cost of $6.2 million. We are making great progress in North America, even at our low level of reinvestment. We remain focused on returns and are positioning the Permian Basin for a growth trajectory in the second half of 2017. Moving to international and offshore operations, in Egypt, gross production of 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was up slightly compared to the second quarter. On a net basis, adjusted volumes declined sequentially by 3,000 BOE per day, primarily due to the impact of improving Brent oil prices on cost recovery mechanisms and our production sharing contracts. We continue to benefit from a robust, optimized drilling program, drilling 45 producers and only five dry holes, achieving a 90% success rate through the first three quarters of 2016. Apache placed nine wells on production in Egypt during the third quarter. Most notably is the Ptah #12, producing from the Shiffah formation, with a current peak oil production of over 2,800 barrels of oil per day. Since field discovery in November 2014, the Ptah and Berenice fields have produced a combined 17 million barrels of oil equivalent from only 14 wells and are still producing at a rate of more than 38,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Well costs for this play averaged only $3.2 million per well. In the North Sea, third quarter production decreased approximately 8,300 BOE per day due to downtime resulting from planned maintenance turnarounds and third-party operated facility restrictions that impacted production. This was associated with seasonal turnarounds that occur in this region during the late summer. This deferred some 3Q production into the current period, so we expect 4Q volumes to bounce back to levels we've seen in the first half the year. As John mentioned, we also made a nice discovery at our Storr prospect in the Beryl area, which encountered hydrocarbons in two separate fault blocks. The results were in line with pre-drill estimates, and we expect to test more fault blocks at Storr in the future. Apache has a 55% working interest, with Shell holding the remaining 45%. In late October, we commenced drilling our next Beryl area prospect, Kinord, which we expect to reach TD by year-end. Please refer to our November 2015 North Sea investor update for more details on Storr, Kinord, and other opportunities in the Beryl area. I would note a new high-rate development well at the Beryl field, the Nevis North NNA, which came online mid-September. The 30-day average rate for this well was 20 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day. At our Aviat project in the Forties field, we have now completed and tied in the first well. As you may recall, Aviat enables a switch from diesel to natural gas as our primary source of power for the Forties field. This is an environmentally friendly project that will extend the economic life of Forties due to lower operating costs and reduce certain safety and reliability risk associated with bunkering diesel to our platforms. We estimate our annual diesel savings due to this project at $15 million per year. Importantly, using natural gas to fuel the Forties field should enable us to maintain higher and more stable water injection rates, which should in turn result in higher sustained hydrocarbon production from the field. In Suriname, we completed our 3-D seismic shoot on Block 58 in September, and we will have preliminary processing results by year-end and a fully processed data set in the third quarter of 2017. On the adjacent Block 53, we will commence drilling operations on a commitment well in the first quarter of next year, the Kolibri #1. While this is an attractive and sizable exploration prospect, very few wells have been drilled to this depth offshore Suriname, and as such, carries a significant amount of risk. The dry hole cost to Apache for this well is estimated at less than $40 million. To sum up international and offshore, while activity was limited, we had very good exploration and development results in both Egypt and the North Sea during the third quarter. We're excited about the future exploration potential in our international and offshore portfolio and look forward to providing more details in the future. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve. Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I will discuss the following. First, I will review our financial results for the third quarter and provide updated 2016 guidance on selected items. Next, I will provide a few details on our near-term Alpine High infrastructure development activities, which have the primary purpose of achieving first gas sales around mid-2017. Then I will conclude by outlining the framework that we intend to follow as we put together our 2017 capital budget. Before I dive into our (28:44), I want to remind everyone that all of our numbers I will review on today's call are now reported under the Successful Efforts accounting method. For those who would like to compare these results to those under the Full Cost accounting method we used in the past, please reference the 10-Q that will be filed later today. As noted in our press release, Apache reported a loss of $607 million or $1.60 per common share. Our results for the quarter include a number of items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates. This includes a $355 million impairment of certain proved properties in Canada as a result of downward reserve revisions related to well performance and lower expected net gas realizations. In addition, with the reduction of the UK petroleum revenue tax, or PRT, to 0% in September, we recognized a charge of $481 million to eliminate the PRT benefit associated with certain future abandonment costs. Despite the apparent negative impacts of the change, in the long term the reduction in the PRT tax rate will improve our North Sea returns. When excluding these and other smaller items, our adjusted loss for the quarter was $12 million or $0.03 per share. In the third quarter, Apache generated $651 million in cash flow from operations. We operated near cash flow neutrality after paying dividends and after increasing capital expenditures in the Alpine High and in our core Midland Basin. As a result, we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash. Our 2016 CapEx guidance, which we updated in early September, remains unchanged at $2 billion. And we still intend to end the year with unchanged or lower net debt. A combination of asset disposal proceeds and a significant U.S. tax refund, both anticipated in the fourth quarter, should enable us to achieve our targeted cash balance of $1.5 billion at year end. Turning to costs, lease operating costs in the third quarter were $7.94 per barrel of oil equivalent, approximately 10% lower than the same period last year. As previously guided, LOE per barrel of oil equivalent increased from the second quarter due to higher seasonal maintenance activity and increased workover expenses. While we expect LOE per BOE to trend a little higher in the fourth quarter, we are again revising our full-year 2016 guidance down to less than $8 per barrel of oil equivalent. This just reinforces the tremendous progress we have made on costs this year. On the G&A side, our gross overhead spend, which we've defined on previous calls, continues to track toward the lower end of our 2016 guidance of $650 million to $700 million. As such, you can now expect our 2016 gross overhead spend to be about $650 million. Lastly, exploration expense in the third quarter was $161 million. $114 million of this was attributable to unproved leasehold impairments in Canada, the Eagle Ford, and the Canyon Lime. Last quarter we guided to $250 million to $300 million of exploration expense for the full year. With the incremental impairment from the third quarter, we now expect full-year 2016 exploration expense in the range of $350 million to $400 million. I would now like to provide a few details on our Alpine High infrastructure development plans. There's currently very limited infrastructure in the immediate vicinity of our acreage. During the course of delineation drilling, Apache has installed skid-mounted refrigeration units to process gas and recover natural gas liquids. NGL recovery volumes are currently constrained by the capability of these temporary units. We have also installed separation facilities to recover oil. Both the oil and the NGLs are being trucked to local sales points. These temporary arrangements will over time be replaced by more permanent solutions. The initial objective of our infrastructure investment is to establish permanent gas processing capacity and transportation of residue gas to market sales points. First gas sales are expected in the middle of 2017. Field processing of the gas stream will be accomplished using refrigeration units at key locations across the acreage. These units are modular and can be expanded commensurate with increasing production. This will help optimize the pace of capital deployment and maximize efficiency. A high priority during the initial phases of field development is to ensure that production is not limited by processing or transportation capacity. The gas takeaway infrastructure will include 60 miles of 30-inch diameter trunk line that will traverse our entire Alpine High acreage position. Major third-party transport lines are currently situated or are under construction in locations approximately 10 miles to the north and south of the Apache leasehold. The Waha hub is located less than 50 miles to the east of Apache's acreage and provides access to most major U.S. markets. Apache is currently evaluating numerous options to utilize these points of access to both U.S. and Mexico gas market opportunities. We will install the trunk line across the Alpine High and establish most market connections through 2017 and 2018. As indicated previously, NGLs are currently being transported by truck to local sales points. As production volumes increase, NGLs will eventually exceed trucking capacity and will require pipeline transport. Apache is evaluating options for the type of gas processing and the means of access to major NGL markets. There will be additional disclosure regarding these plans in the future. Apache's Alpine High infrastructure strategy will address both the near-term requirement for market access during the appraisal and delineation phase as well as the long-term requirements for optimizing value through the transition to full field development. As the ultimate production potential of the Alpine High is better understood, the long-term infrastructure requirements will be formulated accordingly. As with all capital decisions at Apache, infrastructure investment and full field development decisions at Alpine High will be made with full-cycle, fully burdened long-term returns as a key priority. To reiterate some of John's early comments, as we think about our 2017 capital allocation process, we will do so based on a continuation of our core principles. We will focus on living within our means, maintaining our strong financial position, and investing to improve long-term returns. We will provide the details of our 2017 capital plan and guidance in February. However, I would like to share three of the key themes in this year's planning process. First, the Alpine High and the rest of the Permian Basin will be high priorities for our capital program. We fully expect to return the Permian Basin to a strong growth trajectory in the second half of 2017. We are pleased with the improvements we made during the downturn across our portfolio, and we are now prepared to execute on our robust growth plan. Second, we will continue to fund our Egypt and North Sea assets to sustain production and free cash flow. Our returns in these regions are highly competitive, and the free cash flow is critical for funding growth opportunities without resorting to dilutive equity raises. Finally, we are fortunate to have many quality assets that will compete for capital funding throughout the portfolio. In some situations, when funding availability is scarce, we have the luxury of deferring investments without significantly impacting underlying values. With that, I will turn the call back over to John. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Thank you, Steve. Before taking questions, I wanted to make a few closing comments. Apache used the industry downturn to drive substantial change and improvement. We drastically reduced our cost structure, implemented a rigorous and integrated capital allocation and planning process, upgraded and expanded our drilling inventory, improved our capital efficiency, and positioned ourselves extremely well for the future. We invested a high percentage of our precious capital in strategic testing and captured the Alpine High play. This significant new discovery reflects not only the company's strategic focus on organic growth, but also highlights the strong technical capabilities that were necessary to discover and secure it. In 2017, we will continue to manage oil and gas price volatility by setting a reasonable expected price band and gearing our capital spending, return targets, and capital structure to the lower end of that band. Should realized prices come in higher, we will maintain the operational and financial flexibility and optionality to respond accordingly, as we have done in 2016. Our overall strategic approach will remain unchanged. Apache will live within its means, maintain its strong financial position, continue to build and develop our high-quality drilling inventory, and invest our capital with a primary focus on improving long-term returns and creating shareholder value. And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A. Operator : Our first question is from the line of Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Congratulations again on Alpine High. Just on the gas line first, I mean a 30-inch line. Maybe give us some idea of how much capacity that would have because obviously that's probably going to be the governor on the size of the play in the beginning. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Ed, at this point I don't want to talk about capacity. I think a 30-inch line will tell you that it will move a tremendous amount of gas. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): That's what I thought. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: So I just want to leave it at that, because obviously with compression and so forth, you can do a lot there. But we're not in the position to talk about scale. That's just the main trunk line through the field and in terms of what we have to run from north to south. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And then slide 17 caused some debate today. Bone Spring well, obviously great initial rate, and then a decline down to 220 barrels a day. Maybe talk a little bit about the proppant loading, the landings and optimization, because in delineation you're not doing a lot of that. So maybe talk about the hopes you have to improve that performance over time. Obviously this is a short lateral as well. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: I think the first thing is, and Tim Sullivan did a good job in the script of walking through this. What we've got is a hydrocarbon system that has 5,000 feet of stack pay. And so what the purpose of that well really to do was, was to prove that we have oil production at a depth of around 9,000 feet, which confirms our geologic model and our thermal maturity model. So quite frankly, we're very pleased with that well. It's a very short lateral. It's a small frac. It was more designed to test the geologic model and the maturity model. And quite frankly, what's impressive about it is the GOR has been stable and is relatively flat, and you've seen the water lines come down. So we're quite pleased with it. As we've said all along, we have not tried to drill big press release wells that are going to blow everybody away with their production rates. This was a well that was designed to confirm we have oil production. We have a very rich column all the way from 9,000 feet down to 14,000 feet, which the Redwood confirmed when we move from oil down to wet gas down to dry gas. And the beauty of it is, unlike other plays where you have a 200-foot zone that you're trying to track aerially across windows, we've got such a thick column here and we have the maturity all the way up the column. So all we have to do is move our pole and we will have more oil and so forth. So as we get into further test points and start to delineate and start to drill some other wells, we'll bring on some other things. But the important point here is it validates there is oil production at 9,100 feet and 43 gravity API, and I think it's something we're very excited about. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good afternoon. John, I was wondering if you could maybe just compare and maybe contrast the opportunity set for oil in the Woodford and Barnett. I think you talked about in the prepared remarks thinking about maybe a 20% oil cut in the Barnett, zero to 20% in the Woodford. And then maybe also talk about how things could play out for the Bone Spring and Wolfcamp. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Arun, as I just mentioned, we've got a model that is confirmed and has been validated. And really, the oil cut is going to be a function of thermal maturity and the depth of burial. And so as you move up, the only Barnett well we've drilled has a 20% cut. Below that, in the deeper Woodford wells we've drilled, we've anywhere from zero up to 21%. So the point in this whole thing is that we've got multiple zones across a window, a hydrocarbon system that we know has hydrocarbons ranging from oil from 9,000 feet and probably shallower \u2013 I mean, we've got some other indications it could go shallower \u2013 down to 14,000 feet. So those cuts are going to be a function of which rock we place in those depths. And quite frankly, the transgressive sequence from the Woodford up through the Penn, it really doesn't matter what age it was laid down. It's more a function of where it is in the maturity model. And so as we move up, we will see higher oil cuts, and we're confident in that. And we've got wells that we're drilling that we'll be bringing forth in the future that will design those. You can look at the oil cut in the Mont Blanc 2H, and it's very good at 9,100 feet. So I've tried to articulate what you've got is a hydrocarbon system, okay, which is unique because we've got five stack pays, different types of rocks. And as you move up, the cuts are all going to be a function of depth and temperature. And that's the good thing about it is everything's been validated and we can predict it, and everything's coming in at or better than our model would suggest. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's helpful. And just switching gears a little bit, Steve, I was wondering if you could just comment. In Egypt, they did free float their currency, and there has been a pretty significant devaluation versus the dollar. Can you talk about the impact to Apache in terms of the devaluation? Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yeah, so the direct financial impact is pretty minimal, actually, Arun. By contract, all of our revenues come in U.S. dollars, both on the gas and on the oil side. Oil, we actually export, sell in the open market, and get U.S. dollars into U.S. bank accounts. On the cost side, we do have some costs that are based in Egyptian pounds, which means that we're a net Egyptian pound buyer. On a quarterly basis, we buy about $100 million worth of Egyptian pounds. And we buy them obviously at a rate at which we would consume them. So the logical conclusion would be that the devaluation would benefit us on the cost side. But actually, we would anticipate that inflation would mostly offset that over time. And then, just as a general rule, on a day-to-day basis, we generally hold a pretty minimal amount of Egyptian pounds at any one point in time. And just as an example, at September 30 we had a little over $50,000 worth of Egyptian pounds on hand. So the actual exposure to the Egyptian pound in a direct financial basis is pretty minimal. Of course, the more macro issue is that Egypt is going through a very difficult time. They're doing all of the right things, but it's going to be very difficult, and it's going to be tough on the economy, and we obviously keep a very close eye on that. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on a couple of the earlier questions. First with regards to the midstream and Alpine High, if you can't give us the specifics on the capacity on the gas front that you're trying to expand to at least initially, can you just talk to the CapEx strategy and what we should expect that midstream spending to look like for at least the shorter term, kind of next year, year and a half type piece? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Brian, when we come out in February with our year-end call and give a look on 2017, we'll give some specific color. Obviously, this year, we've ramped up to $500 million in the Alpine High play, and we said 40% of that would be towards the midstream. I'll say directionally, you'll probably see numbers go up next year in Alpine, but I'm not in a position to give you a whole lot more color than that. I mean, the good news is we can fund it, and we're on a pace to bring on really this first big phase that will carry us through what ultimately would be a bigger build-out in subsequent years. So it'll be done incrementally and in a way that we can handle it. Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yeah, I would also say \u2013 so let's start with the 30-inch trunk line. That is a trunk line through the field, but we have three directions in which we can connect to markets. And eventually I would hope and assume that we would be connected in all three directions, and therefore the trunk line can flow in different directions. And obviously therefore, it's not \u2013 the amount of gas that the field can produce is not limited by a unilateral flow of gas through the trunk line. It can flow in different directions. And then there will be a third connection most likely to the east from the middle of the field over to Waha. So the capacity of the field to produce and transport gas out is not actually limited by one-direction flow of a 30-inch line with compression. I think you could probably get a pretty good estimate of what the capital costs are going to be over the next few years. We're going to put in all the pipes and the connects over the next two years, 2017-2018. We're actually going to begin construction on the trunk line before the end of this year. So we'll have trunk line connections, hopefully north-south into Waha, and an NGL line, most likely into the Waha direction as well, by the end of 2018. And I think industry estimates probably work to figure out the cost of that. A 60-mile trunk line less than 10 miles to the north and south, and then just less than 50 miles over to Waha. On the processing side, we're going to be \u2013 you can put in refrigeration units in the 50 million to 100 million cubic feet per day increments. That works economically. And for both processing and compression, an industry cost estimate of somewhere in the $0.40 to $0.60 per cubic feet per day in terms of capital spending is probably a reasonable estimate. So whatever you're assuming in terms of our development profile and production profile, you can pretty much match a field processing and compression profile with that and get a decent estimate of the capital spending. We do anticipate that we will put in processing and compression capacity in advance of us needing it, so we won't be takeaway constrained \u2013 processing or takeaway constrained. We'll be well deliverability constrained. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thank you. And the follow-up is I had a couple small questions on the international front. One, in your prepared comments, you referenced I think a reserve reservoir performance issue in Canada. I just wondered if there's a little bit more color there. And then on the back of Arun's question on Egypt devaluation, do you have confidence that for domestic consumers of oil and gas that the prices will be \u2013 the currency devaluation will be passed along? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: A couple things, Brian. I didn't see anything on a reserve impact in Canada. I'm looking at Steve... Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: It was the impairment. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: It was the impairment. Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: So we had an impairment in Canada, and it was due to reserves related to both well performance but also to net-back realizations and the impact on PUDs that were booked at that point in time. So we took a reserve write-down in Canada, and the $355 million pre-tax impairment was related to the reserves. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: In regards to Egypt, Brian, having just gotten back from there the week before last, and my third trip over there, I've actually seen President Al-Sisi twice this year. I've got to give them a lot of credit. They're on the right path. They're doing the right things. They're in the process of securing a loan from the IMF. This is all part of a process to go through and start to take some of the subsidies out and do the things to put the country onto the right track. So I actually feel very good about where things are. Our relationship is good. I think they understand how important Apache is. So we feel very good about that aspect of it. They've just got to go through a reset. And the good news is they're taking this head on and they're working on doing that. So we feel good about our overall situation though. Operator : Our next question is from the line of John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale : Close enough, guys. Anyway, you're not willing to quite say what you think everything can do with the Alpine High when it's installed and you don't want to front 2017 expenditures. But looking out and saying longer term, what do you think a normalized volume growth model would be for Apache once you're further along versus an also fiscally conservative approach where you're not diluting people, where you're living within your means? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Obviously, John, you can look at the math, and things change significantly for us starting in the back half of 2017. What I'll say is when we look at the volumes coming out of Alpine High, we're not talking hundreds of millions of cubic feet of gas a day, you're probably talking billions a day with a lot of oil and liquids associated with it. So our profiles are going to change dramatically. I think when we come out in 2017, we'll talk a little bit about 2017, and most of that is going to occur in the back half of 2017. So we'll start to give some color, but it's going to be a different profile then we've probably had in our history. John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale : Okay, that's fair. Regarding the Midland, a lot of companies now are going out 10,000 feet and beyond. Is that something in your wheelhouse too that you're considering doing? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Yes. The big controlling factor there, obviously, is the land ownership. We showed a well in the ops report today that's about 8,500 feet. So clearly where we have the land to do that, your limitation isn't the rock in terms of how far you can drill. So we'll be drilling as long laterals as we can and optimizing those on pads. Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Brian, one comment I might make as well on that is we spent a good portion \u2013 or a good amount of work this year on blocking up our acreage at three of our fields at Powell, Wildfire, and Azalea. And as a result, we feel like about 2/3 of our locations now will be extended laterals between the mile and a half to two mile. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I had a question on \u2013 I hear you saying that you want to live within cash flow to grow this program. Would you consider asset sales as another source of funds to maybe accelerate this program, and are there parts of the portfolio that would be ripe for that? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Bob, the thing I would say is the good news is our pace for the development of Alpine is going to be governed at the start based on the build-out of the infrastructure and just the amount of time it takes to collect the data and do this properly in a way that's going to maximize the NPV and the returns. So it's not a matter of needing more capital to try to accelerate Alpine, the Alpine High play. It's going to get its capital at that pace. And then amazingly, it becomes cash flow positive pretty fast and self-funding. I think the bigger question will be as we look at the portfolio, Steve mentioned in his comments, we've got a lot of things we can defer as we have really the last two years. As we shut down, we're doing strategic testing and stuff. Most of our acreage is HBP. We've got a lot of really other attractive plays, and a lot of that will depend on what capital budget we want to run and what price deck we're comfortable spending at in terms of how we feather those in and that sort of thing. If there clearly are things at higher prices that we don't envision ourselves getting to, then obviously we would be looking at some of those options over the next couple years. So those are all things that would be on the table. Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks, and a quick follow-up. Can you talk about the process by which you got board sanction for this big 30-inch pipe big infrastructure investment? Did you present them with a 20-year project asset level, and what was that process like? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: What I would say is they had the scope and scale of the Alpine High. We're in a process where they have seen numbers going into 2017 and have sanctioned those. And the cost of this for what we've got identified looks fantastic, but it is a board-level approval and has been approved by our Board of Directors under our normal course of business. Operator : And our last question is from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for squeezing me in. John, if I think about \u2013 I know you said you won't comment on 2017, but I'm going to try to ask anyway. If I just think about your regional CapEx mix that was in your slide deck this morning on page 26, you have 50% \u2013 Permian and Alpine High get 50%, and then 50% other are outside of U.S. onshore. Is that the right way to think about it as far as a 2017 number, just based on obviously whatever the cash flow and prices end up being? But is that the right allocation? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: What I would say is Alpine is going to get its capital. We're going to invest to sustain North Sea and Egypt. Permian is going to get a big chunk of its capital. And then how that pie changes is going to be a function of what price deck we're comfortable running with and how much capital we pour. So we've seen a lot of volatility. We've gone from the low $50s to the mid-$40s. And so obviously every $5 of oil price and the movement of gas price means a lot to us in terms of that. So as we start out 2017, a lot of that's just going to hinge on what price we've got we feel comfortable using. The good news is we made a lot of progress over the last 18 months, not just on our Alpine and just on our Permian. We've got a lot of really strong projects that are very competitive. We've got a nice SCOOP position in the Woodford with 52,000 net and 200,000 gross acres out there, a nice little position in the STACK. You've seen some of the results from some of the Montney and the Duvernay today. So we've got a lot of other quality projects that we're fortunate that we can defer a few of those. But it's all going to hinge on ultimately where we shake down on the capital plan going into 2017 is going to be where will we'll start. And of course, the main thing is we're going to maintain the flexibility like we did this year by budgeting a little bit conservatively to then react and ramp up because we've got a lot of optionality and a lot of opportunity in our portfolio both within the Permian and the other parts of the portfolio. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, let me jump real quick to Suriname. Can you just give me your latest and greatest thoughts as far as \u2013 I know Hess made some noise about Liza a few weeks back. But can you just give me some color around that? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: What I'll say is, number one, we completed our 3D shoot on Block 58, so we'll be looking at that. We'll get that seismic in full evaluation sometime next year. So we're excited about Block 58. It's right in the kitchen. We own it 100%. Block 53 we're partners in. we've got 45% of that. We have a commitment well that we're going to spud first quarter, the Kolibri #1. We're very excited about it. It's a very, very strong prospect. There are some follow-on prospects. And quite frankly, it's an exploration well, but it needs to be drilled, and we're very excited about it. But it's exploration, and it will be first quarter of 2017. Operator : That's all the time for questions we have for today. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Clark for any closing remarks. Gary T. Clark - Apache Corp.: Thank you all for joining us today. There were a number of you left in the queue, so if we didn't get to your question, please feel free to reach out to the IR team as always. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache Corporation Fourth Quarter and Full-year 2016 Results Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Gary T. Clark - Apache Corp.: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's fourth quarter and full-year of 2016 financial and operational results conference call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann; Executive Vice President of Operations Support, Tim Sullivan; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Steve Riney. In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our fourth quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. I would like to note that the supplement posted this morning includes expanded production and financial guidance for 2017. Production numbers cited in today's call have been adjusted to exclude our non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. Please also note that we are now providing guidance for our Egypt-based operations that includes non-controlling interest and tax barrels such that analysts can reconcile their estimates to Apache's reported production numbers. I would also call your attention to the updated production guidance we are providing for North America. We are now providing specific production guidance for the Midland and Delaware Basins, combined which represents Apache's primary growth engines. Another minor change we have made for 2017 is that we are now including the Gulf of Mexico in our North American guidance. We're also providing more comprehensive capital guidance, which now includes all oil and gas capital investment, leasehold acquisition, capitalized interest and capitalized G&A, and we are continuing to exclude Egypt non-controlling interest capital from our guidance. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking statements and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. I will now turn the call over to John. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will review our 2016 accomplishments, outline our 2017 strategic and operational objectives, discuss our capital spending plans and production outlook for the next two years, and I will conclude with an update of our Alpine High play. First, I'd like to step back and take stock of the last two years and how we have repositioned Apache. The collapse in commodity prices which began in 2014 required a strategic response to improve the company's financial standing and our operational capabilities and to position Apache to thrive as prices recovered. We have accomplished all that and more. The cornerstone of our approach has been strict capital discipline and cost structure rationalization, both of which have significantly improved the quality and economics of our underlying inventory as well as our ability to access and exploit its value for the future. We accomplished this through a rigorous and more centralized process for capital allocation, a more detailed long-term planning process, and through significant cost reductions in our operations and in our overhead structure. For example, we significantly reduced activity Onshore North America where costs were not aligned with lower commodity prices, dropping from 91 rigs in the third quarter of 2014 to eight rigs at year-end 2016. And since 2014, we drove down average onshore well costs by 30% to 40% across key plays in North America. Our LOE per BOE is down 24% and we have reduced our gross overhead cost structure by more than $300 million. As a result of these efforts, we were able to preserve our dividend, avoid issuing equity and maintain our investment-grade rating. We are now well prepared for a more constructive, albeit lower price environment, than prior to the downturn. With the proven quality of our Midland Basin acreage and the recent addition of the Alpine High in the Delaware Basin, we have an inventory capable of delivering robust organic growth for many years. Though some commodity price softness may continue, we are comfortable increasing our capital investment, which will leverage the quality of our inventory and the progress we have made on costs over the last two years. Now let me recount some of our key 2016 accomplishments. This was an exceptional year for Apache and another step forward in the positive transformation of the company. We exceeded our original production target, significantly lowered our cost structure and discovered an enormous new resource play in the Delaware Basin at Alpine High. Our operational improvements and exploration successes have positioned the company to deliver returns-focused growth for many years to come. On this call last year, I outlined a series of strategic and operational objectives designed to guide the company through a potentially lower-for-longer commodity price environment. We delivered on all of them. Most notably, we focused our North American capital on strategic testing and completion optimization, and in doing so, significantly expanded our economic drilling inventory and demonstrated our ability to deliver well results better than offset operators. We worked to streamline our North American portfolio through new acreage leasing, trades, and sales. We now have a more concentrated and contiguous position in the Permian Basin. We continued to drive cost efficiencies throughout the organization and achieved a 16% reduction in LOE per BOE from 2015 and we began the year with a conservative budget, which enabled us to increase activity levels late in the year as commodity prices improved. All of these efforts were necessary to position Apache for a strengthening commodity price environment. Our long-term focus has consistently been on delivering fully burdened returns-focused growth. In the lower commodity price environment, allocating capital toward our free cash flow positive assets in the UK, North Sea and Egypt while investing in exploration was the optimal use of our capital. As commodity prices strengthened, deploying a greater proportion of our capital into developing our world-class Onshore North American assets, is better. Our objective going forward will be to deliver returns-focused growth and our plan to support this objective includes : budgeting conservatively and maintaining flexibility to accelerate activity, if warranted; continuing our focus on costs and well optimization to maintain the structural efficiencies achieved over the last two years; increasing capital allocation to the Midland and Delaware Basins, where we have an extensive high quality inventory; initiating an optimized development program at Alpine High; investing to sustain long-term free cash flow generation from Egypt and the North Sea; and, finally, actively managing our portfolio and redeploying capital to higher-value opportunities. Now I'll turn to the 2017-2018 capital budget. Our capital budget for this year is $3.1 billion, which is up more than 60% from 2016. Our 2017 plan assumes $50 per barrel WTI, $51 per barrel for Brent index crude, $3.15 per Mcf for NYMEX natural gas, and $5.25 per Mcf for UK indexed gas. At these price levels, our capital program will exceed anticipated operating cash flow. The gap will be covered by proceeds from non-core asset sales, $400 million of which has already occurred, and a realization of prices at the current strip. We have also put in place some oil price hedges to protect against downside price movements. Steve will cover these in more detail. Our 2017 capital plan allocates nearly two-thirds or $2 billion to the Permian Basin. Of this amount, 90% will be directed to the Midland and Delaware Basins. This includes approximately $500 million for infrastructure construction at Alpine High, which will fund multiple pipeline connections along with the necessary compression, gathering, centralized processing facilities and tank batteries that will more than accommodate our planned volume ramp. Internationally, we will invest to sustain long-term free cash flow generation in Egypt and the North Sea. Total international spending represents approximately $900 million or 29% of our 2017 budget, split fairly evenly between Egypt and the North Sea. We have also included $37 million for an exploration well in Suriname, which we expect to spud next week. Outside of Suriname, our 2017 international opportunity set is primarily focused on development drilling and lower risk step-out exploration, where we have a long-standing track record of success. We are particularly excited about two exploration concessions that we recently received in the Western Desert of Egypt, our first award there in over 10 years. Should commodity prices further improve during the year and cash flows allow, incremental capital will be allocated primarily to the Midland and Delaware Basins. Turning briefly to 2018, our preliminary capital outlook is for $3.2 billion in investment. This program is supported by anticipated volume growth and higher plan prices for 2018. Like 2017, our 2018 plan will be heavily weighted toward Permian investment. Our 2017 and 2018 plan capital program will initiate a significant and prolonged production growth ramp. I would note specifically the magnitude of our anticipated production growth in the Midland and Delaware Basins. To assist in the production outlook discussion, we have provided a series of slides on pages 22 to 26 in our financial and operational review issued this morning with our earnings results. This includes a production forecast through the end of 2018. While our capital program has increased to reflect the objective of delivering long-term returns-focused growth, our production response will have a brief lag before transitioning to a strong growth trajectory. We anticipate total production will decline to approximately 372,000 BOEs to 384,000 BOEs per day in the second quarter of 2017. This will be a result of three primary drivers. In preparation for the start-up of our Callater discovery in the third quarter of 2017, we have accelerated our annual North Sea maintenance turnarounds into the second quarter. These turnarounds would typically occur later in the year. We have significant gas plant maintenance downtime scheduled in Canada for the second quarter of 2017 and investment in our lowest-margin North American assets was severely curtailed over the last two years and these assets are currently in decline. Importantly, none of this projected decline is in our higher-margin Midland Basin production, despite very low activity levels last year. In the second half of the year, the North Sea should rebound sharply with the start-up of Callater. More notably, North America will begin a rapid and relatively consistent quarterly growth ramp, which should continue through the end of 2018 and beyond. This will be driven primarily by the combination of accelerating oil production in the Midland Basin and the start-up of Alpine High in the Delaware Basin. Our projected oil growth in the Midland Basin is underpinned by the impressive performance we are seeing in our most recent vintage wells. Tim Sullivan will provide more detail on our Midland Basin wells in his remarks. At Alpine High, we anticipate having our first major sales line connection by July. Well connections and facilities commissioning will take place through the end of the year, accompanied by a material ramp in wet gas production. To put some numbers around our two-year growth profile, we expect total company production to increase by approximately 10% annually from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2018. Our Midland and Delaware Basin assets are projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 50% over the same time and drive the vast majority of Apache's overall production increase. Oil production growth in the Midland and Delaware will also be very strong with an annual growth rate of approximately 18%. We're very confident that Apache's portfolio can deliver on our production expectations through the end of 2018 and beyond. We are seeing outstanding drilling results in the Midland Basin and Alpine High continues to surprise us to the upside. With that, I will conclude with a brief update on the Alpine High play and review our next steps as we begin to phase in well optimization and fuel development activities. Since first announcing Alpine High last September, we have made tremendous progress delineating the play. We have confirmed several things thus far. We have an extensive play fairway, which spans 55 miles and a 5,000 foot vertical column encompassing five geologic formations, each with multiple targets. The hydrocarbon phase of this column ranges from dry gas to wet gas to oil. The entire Alpine High fairway is over-pressured with higher pressure gradients to the north and to the south. We have a second landing zone in the Woodford formation and most likely a third. We have productivity in the Pennsylvanian formation. And in the southern portion of the play, we have encountered the entire hydrocarbon column, improving productivity in the Woodford. With these results, we now believe that Alpine High's resource and location count has increased significantly since last September. And we haven't changed our view on well economics. We will provide updates to these numbers in the future. Importantly, we are beginning to optimize our wells using customized zone targeting, larger fracs and, in some cases, longer laterals. Combined with multi-well pad drilling we are confident this will demonstrate the economic value of the wet gas interval of Alpine High over the coming months. We continue to refer to Alpine High is a wet gas play, because that is what we have confirmed thus far. As we have previously noted, we are delineating from the bottom-up and this process is not yet complete. This is a prolific wet gas play from which we expect a minimum of 3,000 drillable locations. A significant enhancement to the economics of the source rock interval at Alpine High is the lack of water in the target formations. Once these wells produce the frac load, water production declined sharply, which results in significantly lower operating costs. Additionally, the field development program is not constrained by the need for extensive water handling infrastructure. As a result, even in the lower commodity price environment, this play is going to be very economic. Turning to midstream and marketing, our efforts at Alpine High are advancing quickly. Because the play lies in an area with very little existing infrastructure, it provides the unique opportunity to design a greenfield fit-for-purpose system that optimizes processing and transportation of our production and will service Alpine High for the full life of the field. For now, we own 100% of the midstream as it allows us to control the pace and scope of the build out. Alpine High is ideally situated with three major transportation lines located within 10 miles to the north and one major line to the south. The Waha hub which is located roughly 45 miles east of our acreage provides additional options for access to a wide range of domestic markets. Our location places us at the front of the line to deliver gas to Mexico as well as being advantageously positioned with LNG and petrochemical markets on the Texas Gulf Coast. Contract negotiations are well underway, and we see no near-term takeaway constraints as we prepare for first gas and the follow-on production ramp. On the marketing front, we have been inundated with interest for both our natural gas and NGLs. Potential customers are looking for certainty of supply, and the thick hydrocarbon bearing zones at Alpine High can provide it. In conclusion, Apache begins 2017 with an excellent opportunity set. Momentum will start to build around mid-year, with increased contribution from our pad drilling in the Midland Basin and the commencement of first residue gas sales at Alpine High. The Permian Basin will clearly be the driver of strong growth in the second half of 2017 through 2018 and well into the future. While commodity price volatility may not be completely behind us, we have come through the downturn with a very strong financial position and the ability to fund future growth through cash flow and portfolio high-grade. We continue to have no desire to add leverage or dilute our equity holders. Over the last two years, Apache demonstrated that we can play very good defense, and we now look forward to showing you our offense. With the plans, we have in place, we believe we will deliver highly competitive returns and top-tier Permian-driven growth. I will now turn the call over to Tim. Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Good afternoon. My remarks today will focus on 2016 production, expected activity in each of our regions during 2017, and a perspective on supply and service costs that we're seeing, particularly Onshore North America. Turning first to production; our fourth quarter results reflect the impact of reduced CapEx and development activity throughout 2016. During the fourth quarter, North America Onshore production averaged 252,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 7% decrease from the third quarter. Our Permian operations produced an average of 149,000 BOE per day, down 6% from the third quarter. As John noted, we expect overall North American production will continue to decline into the second quarter before shifting to a strong growth trend. Most of this decline will occur outside the Permian in regions where we have made relatively little capital investments over the past four quarters. In the North Sea, our production in the fourth quarter returned to more normalized levels at approximately 70,000 BOE per day, a 12% increase compared to the third quarter, which was impacted by extended facility turnaround issues. We are in initial planning stages for development of the store discovery that we announced on the last conference call. Our high-risk Canord (21:29) exploration well reached TD in the fourth quarter and did not encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. We have drilled three successful exploration wells and only one dry hole since acquiring our 3-D seismic survey over Beryl in 2013. Our gross production in Egypt during the fourth quarter declined approximately 2% on a sequential quarterly basis. On a net basis, excluding tax barrels and Sinopec's minority interest, production was approximately 90,000 BOE per day, a 7% decline from the third quarter, as higher realized prices resulted in Apache receiving fewer cost recovery barrels under our production, sharing and contract agreements. Please refer to our financial operational supplement for more details on our fourth quarter and full-year production. Turning to operations; last year, our focus on operational improvements and strategic testing established a solid foundation for achieving the company's 2017 goals. As a result, we are now drilling more productive wells more efficiently, and you will begin to see the impact of these improvements this year as we increase development activity primarily in the Delaware and Midland Basins. Our financial and operation supplement highlights some recent performance results from well optimization we implemented last year in the Midland Basin. This includes the use of improved targeting, drilling longer laterals, and more advanced completion designs. We have updated these cumulative curves with additional wells and more days on production since we first showed them in September. The bottom line is that we continue to see wells on our core acreage in the Midland Basin outperforming peers in the area. Apache concluded 2016 by adding three additional rigs in the Midland Basin, bringing our total rig count in the area up to five. We were at only one rig for most of 2016. These rigs are dedicated to long-term pad development drilling and our core acreage will enable us to place 25 wells on production during the first half of 2017. This is a significant increase from the nine Midland Basin wells placed on production in the second half of 2016 and will put the Midland Basin on a positive growth path. We are excited about moving forward with a multiyear, multi-rig drilling program that is designed to generate production from some of our best wells and our best rock. Most recently, our five-well Lynch pad at Wildfire came online last quarter with production from the Middle Spraberry, Lower Spraberry and Wolfcamp B formations. This pad exhibited excellent 24-hour IPs, 30 day IPs and cumulative 60 day oil production. Our next pad at the Powell field is in early stages of flow back on six wells and began oil production last week. Following that, a nine-well pad at Azalea will go online in April. During 2017, we expect to average 15 rigs in the Permian Basin and drill approximately 250 wells. Our 2017 Permian Basin rig count comprises five rig lines and two frac crews in the Midland Basin. Three rigs drilling in the Delaware Basin outside of Alpine High, one rig on the Northwest Shelf drilling in the Yeso play and one vertical rig dedicated to improved recovery in the Central Basin Platform. In addition, we will have a four-rig to six-rig program at Alpine High. To accelerate well completions and data collection, we added a second frac crew at the start of this year. Elsewhere Onshore North America, in Oklahoma, we will run a targeted drilling program in the SCOOP/STACK play. We have a large inventory of locations in this play and total drilling costs have come down as we've improved our completion techniques. We expect to drill four wells in the MidContinent this year primarily for the purpose of holding acreage. In Canada, we plan to drill a total of 10-wells this year. In the first half of the year, we will drill out a six well pad in our Kaybob Duvernay play with production from those wells anticipated around mid-year following winter break up. We'll also drill three Montney 10 year wells in our Wapiti area in 2017. In the North Sea, we will operate an average of three rigs for the year, which includes two platform rigs and two semi-subs on rig sharing agreements. We plan to drill 15 wells to 16 wells this year. We've pulled forward our annual plant turnaround in the North Sea to accommodate first production at Callater. The net effect of this downtime and new production is that we expect the first half 2017 North Sea production of approximately 55,000 BOE per day and second half production at roughly 70,000 BOE per day. Our gross production in Egypt during 2017 is expected to be down slightly, about 2% from last year. This is primarily the result of an expected decrease in lower margin gas production as our large cost of field begins to decline. We will run eight rigs to 10 rigs during the year and drill 90 wells to 100 wells. The two new concessions awarded to Apache in November should be signed during the second quarter, and we plan to commence drilling operations in the fourth quarter. To support development on our existing acreage and the exploration on our new concessions, we will initiate a large continuous 3-D seismic survey program. This will take place over the coming months and provide newer vintage, high resolution imaging of the substrata across our Western Desert position, allowing us to build and high-grade our drilling inventory. Offshore Suriname, we are getting ready to spud the Kolibri #1 (27:24), an exploration well and Block 53, where Apache holds a 45% working interest. The rig is currently moving on to location and we expect to begin drilling next week, reaching targeted depth about 10 weeks later. With the move up in commodity prices and the subsequent increasing demand for drilling rigs, we are seeing an uptick in costs, particularly for certain services in North America Onshore, such as pressure pumping and sand. Our move to pad drilling operations in the Midland Basin brings efficiencies that will help offset some of these increases and protect some of the cost savings that we have captured over the past two years. We continue to look for ways to optimize our operations and improve our margins. This includes finding alternative sources and services to mitigate inflation and preserve well economics. We are finalizing contracts to secure fleets in West Texas with terms that include indexing prices to WTI and extending contracts with favorable rates. Our international operations have not seen the volatility in service costs as compared to North America Onshore. For example, service costs in Egypt remain very competitive and are among the lowest in the world. I'll conclude by noting that we have structured our capital allocation process and our operations to respond quickly as circumstances warrant. We are pleased to be back at work drilling more wells. As you can see from the recent data, we believe our 2017 North America development program will be more productive and capital efficient than in previous years. I will now turn the call over to Steve. Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Thank you, Tim. Today, I will highlight the company's fourth quarter and full-year 2016 financial performance. I will also outline our 2017 financial guidance and outlook. 2016 was a very successful year as we continued to progress a very important transformation of Apache Corporation. From a financial perspective, we re-based our capital investment programs to deliver competitive returns in a lower-for-longer price environment. We delivered on our overarching goal of cash flow neutrality, protecting the strength of our balance sheet and our liquidity. We maintained our investment-grade rating, and we delivered an exceptionally smooth transition to the successful efforts method of accounting. Many analysts and investors have noted Apache's conservative and disciplined approach. We remain grounded in the belief that a strong balance sheet, conservative planning and budgeting, and rigorous investment economics based on full-cycle, fully burdened returns deliver the greatest amount of long-term value for our shareholders. We are proud of this approach and it has served us well for the last two years. We have improved our financial position, strengthened our investment programs for the future. And, at the same time, we accessed and advanced a world-class discovery at Alpine High. Let me now review our full-year and fourth quarter 2016 results. As noted in our press release issued this morning, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Apache reported a loss of $182 million or $0.48 per share for the fourth quarter. These results include a number of items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates, the most significant of which were asset impairments. Adjusted for these items, the fourth quarter result was a loss of $22 million or $0.06 per share. Note this adjusted loss still includes dry hole costs, which amounted to $27 million or $0.07 per share after tax. For the full-year 2016, Apache reported a loss of $1.4 billion or $3.71 per share and an adjusted loss of $430 million or $1.13 per share. In the fourth quarter, Apache generated $819 million in net cash from continuing operating activities and $2.5 billion for the full-year. We maintained our strong liquidity position throughout 2016, ending the year with $1.4 billion cash on hand. Our net debt position at year-end 2016 was $7.2 billion, down slightly from year-end 2015. 2016 capital spending was $537 million for the fourth quarter and $1.9 billion for the full-year. Approximately $900 million of our investment during 2016 was directed to the Permian Basin, of which approximately $500 million was directed to Alpine High. We invested approximately $700 million in our international businesses, consistent with our strategy of investing to sustain the cash flow generating capacity of these assets for the long-term. Lease operating expense for the full-year averaged $7.85 per BOE, a 16% decrease from 2015. In the fourth quarter, lease operating expense was $8.39 per BOE, down 17% from the fourth quarter of 2015. For 2016, we set a gross overhead cash cost target of $650 million. Actual overhead costs for the year were $639 million. We reported expensed G&A of $410 million or $2.15 per BOE. During the fourth quarter of 2016, Apache entered into transactions to sell certain non-core assets. These included midstream assets in the North Sea and two mostly non-producing leasehold packages in the Midland and Delaware Basins. The net production impact from these sales is approximately 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day and is reflected in our 2017 production guidance, which John provided earlier. Now I will move on to our 2017 capital program and other financial guidance. As John outlined, we have a clear line of sight to closing the funding gap in our 2017 plan. While we believe that now is the time to outspend cash flows, we also want to protect our balance sheet. We have worked hard to build a strong financial position and we will not put that at risk to near-term price volatility. As such, we have put in place some protection against further price downside. Over the past several weeks, we have entered into put option contracts providing a floor of $50 WTI and $51 Brent for most of our second half 2017 oil production. With this protection in place, we will move forward with our Permian Basin capital program knowing that any price weakness will not cause a funding shortfall. We chose to use put options to mitigate the risk, while maintaining full exposure to upside price potential. In terms of other guidance, we have chosen to expand annual guidance around selected production and financial metrics. This is provided in our quarterly financial and operation supplement. John has already covered production and CapEx, so I will move directly to financial items. Please note that all guidance is based on our plan assuming $50 WTI and $51 Brent. My comments here will be relatively brief, so please feel free to follow-up with Gary and his team for any questions as you incorporate the data into your models. In 2017, we will continue to focus on lease operating expense and enhancing our margins. However, given our production declines in the first half of the year and some expected service price inflation, we see lease operating expense rising to somewhere between $8.50 and $9 per BOE. We estimate gathering and transportation costs will be $200 million to $250 million. Our portion of 2017 cost expense to G&A on the income statement is projected to be around $450 million and our capitalized portion of interest should be around $65 million. Cash income taxes should be approximately $125 million, which is driven entirely by the profitability of our North Sea operations. Finally, we are forecasting approximately $150 million of exploration expense in 2017. This includes recurring exploration overhead costs and planned exploration expense activities. This excludes any dry hole expense or unproved property impairments, which are difficult to project in terms of timing and magnitude. In closing, Apache took a prudent approach to capital spending through the downturn. This has put the company on firm ground going into 2017. We are now very well positioned to fund the capital program that will deliver long-term returns-focused growth, primarily from the Midland and Delaware Basins. We look forward to a successful 2017. And I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : And your first question is from John Herrlin of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Yes. Thank you. For the Midland wells and the curve improvements that you've demonstrated, can you kind of attribute what you thought the improvements were in terms of landing zones, fracs, well length? Or is it just too hard to generalize? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: No, John, I mean, we took time and, really over the last two years, worked on our programs. We focused on targeting there, we did a lot of core work and really zoned in on where do we want to be landing the wells. I can tell you, in general, we went back to higher fluid volumes. They are more stage numbers they're closer together and we actually reduced our sand concentration significantly, so it really is part of the optimization process. We're very excited about the results and since we're flowing back in pads versus one well per section, we're very confident in those results and it's really attributable to the work that the team's done at the detail level in integrating core into the completion optimization process. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Okay. Thanks, John. My next one from me is on the Alpine High gas. You mentioned that you've had a lot of interest from industry. Are you looking for index contracts, long-term contracts? I mean, how are you thinking about things? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: I mean, I think right now, most of it will be priced off of Waha, is how we're thinking about it. We're very early. The thing I think that we've seen is that on the longer-term view there is a need out there for supply and so I think we'll have some optionality and we're really starting to think about that and think longer-term with larger volumes. Operator : Your next question is from Edward Westlake with Credit Suisse. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yes. Good morning, and thanks for the update last week as well. So, you've further de-risked more of the Alpine High in your statements last week, at multiple landing zones in some of the wet gas. But when we look at the well results outside of the Northwest of the play, where you've had some really good wells, Redwood, Spruce, and Mont Blanc. The market is really just not being impressed by the flow rates. So, maybe just a reiteration of what excites you in the rest of the acreage that the market's not been pleased by? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, thanks, Ed. I'd say first and foremost, we've been drilling kind of cookie-cutter wells that are designed to test the rock in the stratigraphy. I think the important piece of information we brought forward was the overpressure to the south. In fact, now, if you look at the pressure gradient across the whole play in the bottom zone, it's all lower pressure. Clearly, as we move to the far northwest, you're deeper and there's even more overpressure. But as we look back, the one well we disclosed, a couple of different wells, but the Hidalgo well actually, we believe, we had to spud that well before we had the 3-D in. And we believe it is drilled. In fact, we now know it's not on the proper azimuth. We've got a couple of wells coming that we're excited about that will be on the proper azimuth. But what was impressive to us was how flat the well has been. It leveled off and hasn't budged and the water is continuing to come down. So, we're very impressed with it. The pressure gradients were higher and the thing that we've been able to see is the entire column as well. So, if you look back, the process we've taken, the very first Woodford wells were all in the middle part of the section. We've now validated there's a stronger upper zone. We believe there's a third landing zone as well on the lower, which would give you three landing zones in the Woodford alone. And if I take you back to the Barclays disclosure in September last year, we really assigned just one landing zone on part of our acreage to the Woodford and the Barnett. So, I know everybody wanted big flow rates. We don't have the processing facilities in place yet to do that. We are under flaring rules and so drilling longer laterals with bigger fracs right now is just not the optimal use of our dollars. But, we are moving into a phase where we have line of sight now on connection to the gas markets, where we can start to stretch some things out and actually start to demonstrate what we know this rock will do. So, we're very excited to be shifting gears as we start into the optimization process, but bottom line on it is that there are many, many landing zones, a vast resource, and we're excited about the potential across the whole hydro-column, all the way from the dry gas to the wet gas up into the oil zones, which we're about to get to. The last thing I'll say, I was at your conference last week, we said we have eight wells that are currently in process that will be targeting shallower zones from 9,500 to 11,000 feet. So, we know the gas gets richer and the liquids content is going to go up and we do anticipate seeing some oil as well. So, we're excited. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And then we're all watching the data, but the other big item obviously is getting this pipe in place, maybe just an update on the progress in terms of getting the infrastructure in place to be able to flow these wells a little bit more optimally? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, we've got July circled on the calendar and... Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: July 4? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: ...we're obviously on a path to get there and the way we give guidance and things, I would expect we'd be able to make what we've told you we'd be able to do. Operator : Your next question is from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks, good afternoon. Maybe a little bit on the King Hidalgo well. You obviously saw some area that there was overpressure there. It looks like the well, based on your presentation a week or two ago, indicated that it was flown with ESP. Can you discuss, is that in-line with your expectation? Or would you have expected that to be flowing naturally a little bit longer? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: No, Scott, I mean, if you look at the well, still a lot of load coming back. I mean, most of these wells we've moved ESPs in early to get the water off of them. You see a trend on that well that's coming down. As I mentioned, it's not on the optimal azimuth, and we've seen that in some of the wells in the other parts of the play. Getting them on the right azimuth will make a difference as well. But, we're absolutely thrilled with the well and think when you start to look at the curve and realize that really from about day 33 on through we're now over 100 days, the thing has not budged. The oil's been slowly coming down, and it is cutting a little bit of oil with it as well. So, we're very excited about it. I will reiterate, this is only a 3,300 foot lateral and we had a limited number of frac stages in the small frac. And it's not on the optimal azimuth. Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And just to clarify then, then if you would have been on the proper azimuth, then obviously had a more optimal frac, you would have expected that to be flowing naturally a little bit longer? Is that a fair statement? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, there are different areas in terms of how the wells flow back. A lot of the wells we've run subs in early they get the water off of them. We've got some instances where they haven't needed them. And I think the different azimuth will relate to a different profile on the water, higher IP, and obviously we think the productivity is going to go up when we optimize the frac. So, I think it will change the shape and the IP capacity of the well and so forth more than anything. Operator : Your next question is from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Could you talk about the Suriname prospect; sort of days to drill, when we might get some news, the chance of success, and maybe a risk size, if you're willing to give that? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Bob, at this point, it's a well we're very excited about; Block 53 we own 45% of. We've got two partners in there. The rig is on its way to location now, as we speak. We should be spudding it probably late next week. As Tim said in his prepared remarks, it's probably a 70-days, 10-week type well. I'll say it's an exploration well. It's a well we need to drill. We're excited about it. And that's all we've really disclosed on it. I will also tell you we're working the 3-D on Block 58, which we have 100%, we're really thrilled about as well. So, if I had my druthers, I might be drilling 58 first, but the timing is the opposite. But we're very excited about the Kolibri (46:41) prospect and we'll come back with the results in 70 days, 80 days, roughly. Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And is it a fully strat trap, or is there a structural component? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: It is a strat trap. Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good afternoon. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Hey, Brian. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: My first question is with regards to decline rates outside of Permian Basin and outside of Alpine High. Given the focus on those two areas, can you just refresh us on how we should think about some of those decline rates in a budget that stays relatively flat in 2018 relative to 2017? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, what I would say, Brian, is overall our North American decline rates probably on average about 20%. It's come down significantly over the last two years as we have not been investing in a lot of those projects and plays. It's about where it would sit now. Some areas are a little heavier, some areas are a little lighter; but in general, that's kind of where that overall base decline rate would be today. As we start to go back to work in some of the other areas, we'll be bringing on some higher decline stuff and it'll start to trend back in the future. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And what about the areas outside? And where are you at these days in Egypt and North Sea? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: With the international, depending like you're seeing, we pulled the third quarter turnaround in the North Sea after the second quarter, so it's going to be lumpy at times. We see relatively flat for our international over the next couple years. The one thing that drives Egypt is the price and the way the production sharing contracts work, so you're seeing our nets come down a little bit as prices started to improve late last year. And that's going to have a little bit of an impact as we look into the out years as depending on price, but pretty stable. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good afternoon. I just quickly want to go back to the press release and you guys commented how your budget of $3.1 billion would exceed your planned cash flow for ops. Guys, is that inclusive of the dividend when you all made that comment? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Arun, it is and it's also at the $50 price deck. So, what we state in there was with the sales that we have already in the house, over $400 million and with where strips would be today, that would cover dividend and everything. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. So that comment was including the dividend as well? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Yes. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And thanks for the longer-term disclosure and thoughts through 2018. I was wondering as we work on our models, if you could help us think about the oil and gas and the liquids mix, particularly as we get into 2018, just given how Alpine High is going to be more on the wetter gas side of the equation? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, what we've done, Arun, we gave you a corporate level numbers. We showed you kind of a North American production outlook and then we really broke down the key driver, which is Midland, Delaware. We showed you an overall number and we've showed you the oil piece. What we did not show you is the liquid yield on the gas and, quite frankly, Alpine is going to be the driver there. And the big thing is by July of this year, we'll have facilities up and running. We'll have more data. We can come back then and start to update the NGL yields and some of those things. I'll also tell you that given the program we have today, which is more wet gas driven with a lot of tests in the oil zone still yet to come, we've got a pretty conservative mix dialed in. So, there's a good chance you get out to 2018 or even later this year where we will be updating those and giving more color. But we didn't want to get into that until we really had the facilities up and running and could really shed some light on the NGLs. And, quite frankly, we've got a lot of well still yet to test that can make things oilier. Operator : Your next question is from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Afternoon. John, a lot's been asked on the Permian. Let me get back to the cost. I remember year ago or so you were talking about unbundling the service costs and maybe doing something along those lines. Kind of, where do you see your current, I guess, cost progress and how should we think about it over the next 12 months? And are you having luck on that unbundling, if you will, of service cost? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, the answer is absolutely, David. I mean that's kind of the model we've taken. We did see the pumping pressure go up in December. If you look at our overall well costs \u2013 and I can have Tim give some more color in just a second to kind of add on to what I'll say here. We have forecasted some inflation in total, probably around 10%. What we don't have dialed in is efficiencies. I think areas like Alpine High where we're still very early we've got a lot of room to move on the efficiency curve as we get in to drill these things. Quite frankly, a few of the laterals that we drilled in the upper zones, we were surprised that the pressure gradients were higher and we had to run some shorter laterals than we had originally planned. So, as we learn those you're going to see things come down, but we've unbundled. Tim pointed out in his comments there that we've done some things, the frac crews, where we've indexed some portions with commodity price. So, we're trying to get creative on how to make it really a win-win as we work through this. But absolutely, still unbundling, very confident in where our cost structure is. We've secured most of our services for the next couple years. So we feel good about what we've got in our numbers. Is there anything you want to add, Tim? Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: The only other thing I might mention, about half of our Permian rigs, a little bit more than half, we do have under longer-term contracts, anywhere from six months to 1.5 year contract. So, we don't see a big push on that. As far as pumping services go, we've seen an increase to-date between 15% and 20%. And on our sand, we've seen an increase to-date about 10%. But, as John mentioned, we do have agreements in place that are tied to WTI. So as we see a 10% increase in WTI, we will only see about a 3% to 5% increase in service costs. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then, John, Central Basin Platform, how should we think about? Is there any capital going to that this year? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: There is a little bit, David. I mean, it's a cash cow for us. It's why we split it out from the numbers in terms of where the growth investment is. We're excited about \u2013 I mean we remain optimistic and excited about the Central Basin Platform. Quite frankly, with more cash flow, there's more projects to do there. But there are things we don't have to do. And so there's a fine line of balancing. One of the things that we should be doing versus what you can be doing. But we've got slight decline there. It's much lower than the North American numbers that I gave, well under 10% on average, and it's a significant source of volume and cash flow for us. After Egypt \u2013 Egypt, Central Basin Platform and North Sea are really the three cash drivers \u2013 cash flow generators for the corporation right now. So, an important part of our portfolio and the nice thing about it is the longevity. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Good afternoon. I just want to make sure I understood the slide 25, when I look at it, the 50% compound average growth rate in Permian. Should I think of most of Alpine High's early potential as built into this forecast? Or can Alpine High represent some upside to the forecast? And if it could, could you discuss the high level variables? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean, Jeff, it is built into that forecast right now. We roped it in. Now, I'll tell you, like we always do, we're going to guide in things that we feel like we can deliver. So, it's not our Permian. That's just the Midland and Delaware. So, I think there were a few folks that got that mixed up this morning in their notes and forgot that we've got 72,000 BOEs a day on the Central Basin Platform, but that is just the Midland and Delaware Basin curves. It does have Alpine in it. I think it is a good look, conservative look for us for right now and it's liable to get stronger and liable to get more oily. But I'll leave it. For right now, that's what we put out. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. And the other question I wanted to ask was with regard to slide eight, the Other North America. I was just wondering, if this primarily includes the Montney. Is there something else in there? I'm really asking just because it seems like Apache's continuing to try to simplify the portfolio to the Permian Basin and international assets? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, that's going to be predominantly our Canadian assets and what we call our Houston region, which would be our conventional Anadarko and our Eagle Ford assets. So that's heavily influenced by Canada as well as the \u2013 I think we've got Guam in there as well, but just a much smaller volume. Operator : Your next question is from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, John, and to the rest of your team there. I wondered if you could give us an update perhaps on the two wells that you talked about. In your conference last week, you talked about were flowing back the (57:31). I believe it's the 7H in the Penn and also the Redwood well. I believe it's 4H that was the horizontal in the Wolfcamp. And I'm specifically wondering on the Redwood well. Is that in that same part of the Wolfcamp that gave you the 700 barrels a day from the vertical drills in test back last year? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean, at this point, we have not provided updates, Charles, on either of those wells. We are in the area where we were seeing the DST. What I'll also tell you, though, is we had a lot of open hole above us and that's where we, obviously, took a big pressure kick. We let it flow, flowed for about 10 days, was making 700 oil. But we had a lot of column above us. And we showed in the Credit Suisse package that we thought that was probably in a more gassy regime. So we will see. There's a good chance that oil may be coming from some of the up hole zones that also look fantastic as well. But you know, the DST, you had open column but that is where the tool was when we took the kick. So, still to be determined as we delineate and get to that. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: No. That's helpful color, John. I think it just emphasizes how much there is still left to figure out here. And then second question, if I could switch over to the Midland Basin, Tim, you went through the, some of the big pads you have coming online early in 2017. Once we get to the back half of 2017 and into 2018, are we going to be at or are you going to be more at a steady-state of bringing pads online? Will you have built-up enough momentum at that point? Or should we expect ongoing lumpiness in the Midland Basin program? Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Yeah, the difference is, as we mentioned, in 2016, we only ran one rig for the majority of the year. And we just added additional rigs toward the back-half of the year, and now we're just now getting some pads online. Now we've got the pad we talked about, we've got one that's flowing back today. Now, we've got a nine-well pad at Azalea that will be coming back on in April, and then we've got another six-well pad back at Powell that will come on mid-May. And then you get into the back-half, again, we will be drilling with pads, but we're going to have continual operations. It will be a bit lumpy because it is pad drilling, but I think you're going to see a much more steady stream of wells coming across in the back-half. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: The other thing I would say there is if we've got more cash flow, that's going to be one of the first areas that you can see us pick up some more rigs and activity. I mean, Midland, Delaware are going to be the areas that you'll see, you know, if prices were to move up, we have more cash flow, that's where you'd see us accelerating. Operator : And your last question is from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, guys. Appreciate the color. Could you just go back to a high-level question? In terms of your infrastructure spend in the Alpine High, what are really your long-term assumptions here? Where do you think this is going in terms of the ultimate volumes over time? How are you going to sell the gas? And what your assumptions are for spending as much money as you are right now? Thanks. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, Paul, I mean, I think if you lay out, we spent $200 million last year, we've laid out $500 million the next two years. We're very excited. I mean, the first two phases of this are going to take us several years in. We won't have a decision point to make on staying with re-fridge, which is kind of the base case we have in the field right now, or do we go to cryo? But as I said on the earnings call last August, we're not talking hundreds of millions of cubic feet of gas here a day, we're talking multiple Bcfs, a very rich gas, wet gas, NGLs, and we think there's going to be also a lot of oil to go with it. So, we're very excited about what we have in front of us. I think once we are able to get the processing equipment in the field and things running, you'll start to see some things in terms of lateral lengths, optimized fracs, and we'll start to show you really what this resource is capable of doing. So, we're very excited about it, and I think it's going to be a big underpinning item for Apache and our Permian for a long, long time. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : But you don't \u2013 can you share \u2013 I mean, you must have assumptions on where you're going to here, given the upfront spend. And we're just trying to get to a long-term sort of present value idea of what you guys are basically assuming? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Yeah. And what I'll say, Paul, is just look at what we've given you. We've given you now a look into the end of 2018. I've said, it's likely conservative on what Alpine and what our Permian can do. We gave you some location counts at Barclays. We've come back now and said we've got a minimum of 3,000 confirmed locations in the wet gas window. We will unfold more as it continues to progress, but we remain very optimistic, very excited. But one thing I'll say about this field is it gets bigger. I know there was a little bit of a negative reaction to some of the rates, because everybody's expecting us to be optimizing and scaling-up our fracs and things, but we're very pleased with where we are, and the scope and scale of this field has done nothing but get bigger since our initial disclosure in September of last year. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Got you. Could I ask just one very specific one? Your Midland results have looked good. What percentage of the acreage there do you think will go to longer laterals? And I'll leave it there. Thanks. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Yeah, most of that, we're now got 1.5 mile to two miles dialed in. We did a lot of work over the last two years buttoning down some trades. So most of the wells we're going to be drilling are 1.5 mile to two mile laterals now. So, we're excited about that as well. Operator : This concludes our Q&A portion. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Gary Clark for closing remarks. Gary T. Clark - Apache Corp.: Well, thank you all for joining us. We have gone past the top of the hour, so we need to cut it off there. If you're still in the queue \u2013 and there are some left, please give us a call; feel free to give my team a call and we'll be happy to get your questions answered. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's call. You may now disconnect.",

Meade - Johnson Rice & Company L.L.C. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Operator : Welcome to the Apache Corporation First Quarter 2017 Results Earnings Call. I would like to turn the call over to Gary Clark, Vice President-Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Gary T. Clark - Apache Corp.: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's first quarter 2017 financial and operational results conference call. Speakers' making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann; Executive Vice President of Operations Support, Tim Sullivan; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Steve Riney. In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you've had the opportunity to review our first quarter Financial and Operational Supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. Please note that the details of our 2017 production guidance increase can be found on pages 21 through 24 of the supplement. On today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. And I will now turn the call over to John. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will discuss our strategy for delivering returns-focused growth, review our first quarter 2017 accomplishments, provide an overview of our international operations, and conclude with an update on the progress of our Permian Basin growth initiatives in the Midland Basin and at Alpine High. As I reflect over the last two years, I see tremendous progress at Apache. We've streamlined our portfolio, allowing us to focus our capital and allocate it more efficiently to organic growth opportunities in North America and toward free cash flow maintenance in Egypt and the North Sea. We are benefiting from actions taken to strengthen the balance sheet, budget conservatively, and manage to cash flow neutrality. We've realigned our overhead and operating cost structures to achieve profitability in a lower commodity price environment. We've demonstrated an ability to grow organically by bringing forward a differentiated, low-cost, unconventional play in the Delaware Basin at Alpine High. And finally, we have a much deeper understanding of each hydrocarbon system within the portfolio, which has led to a significant improvement in well results and a larger, higher-quality drilling inventory with greater resource potential. As a result, we are a different company today. One that is capable of delivering highly competitive per share growth rates and double-digit returns, while living within cash flow in a $50 oil price world. As we stated last quarter, Apache's overarching objective is to deliver long-term returns-focused growth. Key components for achieving this include : budgeting conservatively and maintaining the flexibility to accelerate activity, if warranted; increasing capital allocation to the Midland and Delaware basins to fund Apache's very attractive growth areas; preparing for long-term development at Alpine High by completing our resource appraisal program, conducting optimization and spacing tests, and installing necessary infrastructure; investing to sustain long-term free cash flow generation from Egypt and the North Sea; relentlessly focusing on cost and well optimization to achieve the highest returns and net present value from our assets; and actively managing our portfolio with a long-term perspective and strategically redeploying capital to our highest value opportunities. We continue to make excellent progress on all of these objectives. Before moving into the first quarter, I would like to touch briefly on oil prices. As a reminder, Apache's 2017 capital budget assumes flat oil prices of $50 per barrel WTI and $51 per barrel Brent. You will recall that we've protected these prices for the second half of the year with put options on most of our anticipated oil volumes. Oil prices have been volatile year-to-date, with WTI ranging from a high around $55 to a low of $47 per barrel. As the process of working off historically high worldwide crude oil inventories unfolds, we anticipated significant volatility and planned accordingly. We have both the capital budget and the price protection we need for this environment. Regardless of where oil prices go for the remainder of the year, our capital program is well protected and we have maintained full upside leverage to any price improvement. Now, let me highlight our first quarter accomplishments. After an extended downturn, Apache returned to profitability on both a reported and adjusted earnings basis. It was also the fourth quarter in a row that our cash flow from operations, before changes in working capital, exceeded capital expenditures as we continue to exercise spending discipline with oil in the $50 range. We significantly increased activity in the Permian Basin, with roughly two-thirds of our first quarter capital focused in the core Midland Basin and Alpine High. Our midstream buildout at Alpine High is ahead of schedule and under budget. This enabled us to bring the first phase of production online two months early, which is providing two important benefits. First, as a result of this week's startup of Alpine High production, we are raising our full-year 2017 North American production guidance. Our Financial and Operational Supplement issued this morning describes this increase in more detail. Second, we're accelerating some of our planned 2018 infrastructure build into 2017, with no corresponding increase in our capital budget. Also, during the quarter, we continue to make good progress on the cost side in the face of inflationary pressures, delivering capital costs and lease operating expenses below plan. And lastly, we closed two non-core Permian acreage transactions for cash proceeds of $440 million, receiving a very attractive per acre price. Turning now to some of the operational details for the first quarter. Internationally, Egypt and the North Sea produced approximately 147,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day on an adjusted basis; and, together, are tracking in line with our expectations. Lower-than-expected gas production in the North Sea was offset by better-than-expected production in Egypt. Together, these regions contributed strong free cash flow during the quarter, underscoring their strategic fit in our portfolio. Our strategy in Egypt and the North Sea is to continue to invest at a level that sustains free cash flow generation. Both regions have extensive infrastructure in place. Our capital programs look to leverage that infrastructure through a robust inventory of development drilling and step-out exploration prospects. In Egypt, we continue to have success drilling high-rate exploration and development wells, which are generally offsetting natural field declines. This year, we will initiate a new, high-resolution 3-D seismic survey in the Western Desert. This will include our two new concessions, which add nearly 40% to our acreage footprint in the region. We believe that the new seismic program and acreage additions will yield additional attractive growth opportunities. In the North Sea, we currently have two platform rigs running and one semi-submersible. As discussed in February, our second quarter production will be down, primarily due to accelerated annual maintenance activities to accommodate the installation of subsea tieback facilities for our Callater discovery. Callater remains on schedule for first production in the third quarter of 2017 and should drive a material uptick in second half production levels. During the first quarter, the North Sea benefited from premium natural gas and Brent oil prices, and the region continues to generate Apache's highest cash margins per BOE. In Suriname, the Kolibrie 1 exploration well in Block 53 reached TD in April and was deemed non-commercial. Well costs were significantly below our budget as we drilled the well very quickly and efficiently. We gained valuable information about the basin from this well, and are evaluating our next steps in Block 53. On Block 58, where we hold 100% working interest, we are currently processing 3D seismic and are seeing positive early indications of very significant potential. We remain enthusiastic about our prospects in Suriname. Turning now to North America, production averaged approximately 252,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with each region performing in line with expectations. Total oil and gas capital investment in North America was approximately $500 million, which was below budget. In 2017, we plan for an average well cost increase of 10% to 15%. However, proactive measures taken to contain inflationary pressures on certain services are helping to sustain some of the lower cost structure we worked so hard to achieve. In the Midland Basin, our performance was very good this quarter and production is on track despite some changes to our pad completion schedule to accommodate frac operations on offsetting leases. We operated an average of six rigs during the quarter and brought online a six-well pad. The production impact from our increased rig count will be more fully reflected through the remainder of the year as we complete and flow back multiple pads. Two years of well cost improvement initiatives are clearly evident. On our recent Connell 47 and Connell 48 pads, we drilled a total of 12, one-mile laterals at an average completed well cost of approximately $4.6 million. Tim Sullivan will provide more details on our Midland Basin well results and future activity plans. We have a large position in the core of the Midland Basin, and I look forward to this area contributing returns-focused growth for a long time. Now, let me turn to Alpine High. We announced our discovery of Alpine High in an Investor Conference eight months ago. At that time, we described the extensive geologic and seismic analysis used to discover the play and the detailed reservoir evaluation we had initiated to characterize the potential of this massive hydrocarbon system. As you all know, we have been delineating Alpine High with what we call test wells. Test wells are designed for the purpose of minimizing the cost of delineating the resource base and maximizing learnings. They demonstrate the potential of the rock, but do not represent the productive capacity of an optimized development well or pad. When we announced Alpine High, we released data on nine test wells. The results of these wells, coupled with the geologic and reservoir evaluation work completed at that time, confirmed a world-class unconventional resource with an estimated 75 Tcf of gas and 3 billion barrels of oil in place in the Woodford and Barnett formations alone. Resource estimates were confined to these two formations, because they had been the focus of the work to that point in time. The performance of our first batch of test wells at Alpine High was on par with or better than longer-lateral, fully-optimized wells and analogous shale resource plays, such as the SCOOP and the Marcellus. This has since been supported by an independent third-party in their review of EURs per well. Since our original announcement, we have continued to delineate the play. The test wells drilled to-date have proven much of what we anticipated for Alpine High, but this is a multi-dimensional hydrocarbon system with five distinct formations extending across a 60-mile fairway. The Woodford, Barnett, Pennsylvanian formations are a true unconventional shale sequence characterized by excellent reservoir quality, minimal to no in-situ water, strong EURs, low F&D costs, low operating costs, and high expected rates of return at current commodity prices. There are at least eight potential landing zones within the Woodford, Barnett, Pennsylvanian, four of which we have confirmed to-date. We've also confirmed that the entire source rock sequence is over-pressured and contains all three hydrocarbon phases : oil, wet gas and dry gas. And that the depth and temperature at which the source rock is encountered varies across Alpine High and determines the dominant hydrocarbon phase. And lastly, we've established that the Wolfcamp and Bone Springs formations are present oil bearing and perspective and significant portions of Alpine High. With the knowledge gained from our appraisal work, we are confidently building a comprehensive, long-term, full-field development plan. In parallel, we are constructing a large scale infrastructure system to ensure the ability to process and market the full stream of hydrocarbons and to optimize the value of Alpine High. We have already begun the transition from the test well program. The majority of our wells going forward will begin an optimization program that will entail longer-laterals, larger fracs with more stage density, vertical and horizontal spacing density, and lateral wellbore placement within highly targeted zones. This morning, in our Financial and Operational Supplement, we provided results on three new test wells. Two of these wells, the Chinook 101AH and the Blackhawk 5H were drilled to the Woodford and Barnett formations, respectively, in an area where the source rock sequence is quite shallow. These wells achieved higher 24-hour oil IP and higher oil cuts than any of the wells drilled, completed and disclosed (15:46) to-date. This further validates our geologic and thermal maturity models, which predicted that the source rock would produce more oil and higher BTU gas at shallower depths. The third well we announced today, the King Hidalgo 3H in the southern portion of Alpine High, was an offset to our previously disclosed 9H well. You may recall from the disclosure in February that we did not believe the 9H well was drilled on an optimal azimuth, as it was drilled before our 3-D was fully processed and interpreted. In the 3H well, we reoriented the lateral and more than doubled the IP rate of the 9H. Tim Sullivan will provide more detail on all three of these wells. I would just reiterate that these wells are still representative of our testing program. And while we believe they are economic as drilled, the rates do not represent the capability of optimized Alpine High development wells. You can expect future disclosure to contain well results with more optimized completions. To-date, we've drilled more than 40 wells at Alpine High. We currently have four wells producing and 22 wells shut-in or curtailed awaiting infrastructure. Additionally, there are a number of wells in flow back, completion or drilling. We look forward to bringing these wells online, optimizing liquids recovery and demonstrating their potential. I would now like to transition briefly to Alpine High infrastructure. Our midstream facility construction represents a strategically important investment and has proceeded extremely well. Delivery of the initial phase of the buildout was significantly ahead of schedule and under budget. We first broke ground on our infrastructure at Alpine High in November, and since that time have installed approximately 14 miles of 30-inch trunk line for gas delivery, 11 miles of gathering systems, five centralized processing facilities which are in various stages of completion, one water recycling facility, and 10 central tank batteries in various phases of construction. Initial gas sales began this week at a rate of around 20 million cubic feet of gas per day. This volume should ramp up to more than 50 million cubic feet of gas per day by the end of June. We're also making good progress on drilling operations at Alpine High as we continue to climb the learning curve. Tim will have more details on our recent well costs, and how that will change as we transition to more optimized wells in the future. Finally, we recently strengthened our organization on the midstream and marketing side. Last week, we announced the appointment of two highly experienced executives to the team. Both of these individuals bring a deep understanding of midstream and marketing activities in North America, broad business development experience, and extensive end user relationships to complement our team. These additions will significantly strengthen our commercial capabilities as we ramp up production at Alpine High and continue to evaluate future alternatives for the midstream business in Apache. To sum up Alpine High, this is a massive hydrocarbon resource and we believe we control the vast majority of it. A play of this size takes time to properly delineate and optimize, but our progress, since the initial announcement eight months ago, has been exceptional. To-date, we've confirmed a highly economic wet gas play with a minimum of 3,000 locations. The economics of the wet gas portion of Alpine High are greatly enhanced by its oil content and the high-quality NGLs demonstrated in many of our test wells to-date. As we complete our delineation, we believe the wet gas location count will rise significantly. And as we test shallower zones and geologic settings, we believe that oil locations will also be added. In closing, we hit the ground running in 2017, and we are delivering on the production, capital spending and LOE targets we established in February. We're pleased with the early start-up of Alpine High, our under-budget delivery of the midstream side, and the associated increase in production guidance. We look forward to providing further updates in the near future. I will now turn the call over to Tim to provide more operational details. Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Good afternoon. In my remarks today, I will highlight operational activity and key wells in our focus areas. I will also provide an update on service and supply costs, along with the actions we're taking to address inflation. Our first quarter results reflect the impact of reduced CapEx and development activity during 2016. These effects will linger into the second quarter of 2017. Then, we begin our shift to a growth trajectory that you will see in the third quarter and subsequent periods. We began expanding our drilling program in the Midland Basin beginning late in the fourth quarter, increasing from two rigs to the current count of six. These operations feature pad drilling, which can take longer to see production results than with the single well, but is a more efficient way to produce hydrocarbons and helps us preserve the lower cost structure we achieved last year. During the first quarter, North America production averaged 252,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 3% decline from the fourth quarter 2016. Most of this decline comes from lower volumes in the Midcontinent, Gulf of Mexico and Canada regions, where we limited investment. We continue to build momentum in the Permian Basin, where production of 148,000 Boe per day in the first quarter was nearly flat with 149,000 Boe reported for the preceding period. The Midland/Delaware basins contributed approximately 85,000 Boe per day to this total in the first quarter. The main highlight from the Midland Basin this quarter is the start-up of production from the six-well Connell 48 pad at Powell Field in Upton County. These wells have oil cuts of approximately 80% and have produced at very strong initial 30-day average rates 6x wine-rack spacing in two landing zones in the Wolfcamp B formation. The Connell 48 pad features mile-long laterals as we're conducting spacing tests on the pad. The flow rates on a per thousand foot basis are impressive. They are outlined in our first quarter Financial and Operational Supplement. Going forward, in the core of the Midland Basin, we expect two-thirds of our wells to have extended laterals of approximately 1.5 miles or longer. Following Connell 48, the rig moved to the Connell 47, a six-well pad where we'd be testing tighter 8x wine-rack spacing in two Wolfcamp B landing zones. We are in very early flow back on the Schrock 34 pad in the Azalea area on the border of Midland and Glasscock counties. This includes nine wells drilled with 6x wine-rack spacing in intervals of the Wolfcamp A1, B1 and B3 formations. Turning to Alpine High, included in our first quarter Financial and Operational Supplement are results from three recent test wells at Alpine High. The Chinook 101AH produced at a peak 24-hour rate of approximately 8.5 million cubic feet of rich 1,300 BTU gas and 620 barrels of oil. At a depth of 10,100 feet, the Chinook is our shallowest Woodford test to-date. This is an excellent result, particularly when considering that it is an unoptimized test well with a 4,500 foot lateral and a smaller standardized frac. The Blackhawk 5H was completed at a depth of 9,760 feet and is our shallowest Barnett well disclosed to-date. This well produced at a peak 24-hour rate of 742 barrels of oil and 5.3 million cubic feet of rich 1,300 BTU gas. Like the Chinook, this was an unoptimized test well. Moving to the southern end of Alpine High, we drilled the third well disclosed this morning, King Hidalgo 3H in the Woodford formation. This was an azimuth test well offset to the previously disclosed King Hidalgo 9H well. The 3H, at a depth of 13,000 feet, recorded a 24-hour peak rate of 7 million cubic feet of 1,200 BTU gas and 72 barrels of oil. The much stronger performance of the 3H proves that azimuth is critical in optimizing flow rates. Because our initial test wells have been quite deep in the Hidalgo area, we didn't expect to encounter a cooler temperature regime. This enabled liquids production and indicates that there will be significant amount of up-hole zone with potential for higher liquid cuts. For comparison, recall that we encountered dry gas in the Redwood unit at a similar depth in the northern portion of Alpine High. The cost story at Alpine High is also very positive. We recently drilled a pacesetter well with a 4,600 foot lateral in just 13 days, from spud to TD, at a cost of approximately $2 million. Regardless of the ultimate completion size and technique, all-in costs for this type of a well should fall comfortably in our targeted range of $4 million to $6 million. The result we see in our test wells at Alpine High continue to give us confidence that this will be one of the lowest cost, wet gas plays in North America. We look forward to demonstrating this later in the year with optimized drilling results. I will turn now to our international assets. Adjusted production in Egypt declined approximately 2% from the fourth quarter 2016 to 88,000 Boe per day. We drilled 18 wells in Egypt during the first quarter with a 72% success rate. Highlights from this program include development wells at Berenice 6 in the Faghur Basin with a 30-day average IP of nearly 3,760 Boe per day; the Phiops 11, which achieved a peak rate exceeding 3,400 Boe per day in the Shushan Basin; the Ptah 7, which achieved a peak rate of more than 3,330 Boe per day in the Faghur Basin; and the Herunefer 3, which achieved a peak rate of more than 3,100 Boe per day in the Matruh Basin. In the North Sea, our production declined to 58,000 Boe per day as operations were impacted by a mechanical issue on the Beryl Alpha platform during the quarter. We also experienced some underperformance on a few gas-prone wells in the Beryl area. Oil volumes were generally in line with expectations. Progress on the Khalda Development continues on schedule for start-up in the third quarter. We have moved up our North Sea facilities' annual turnaround activity to accommodate hookup and commissioning with the new subsea tieback. While this turnaround and facility work will impact second quarter production, it should help reduce overall planned downtime at Beryl for the year. Please refer to our Financial and Operational Supplement for more details on our first quarter production. I'll move now to service costs. We continue to see pricing pressure for certain services and supplies, which we planned for in our 2017 capital budget. Cost escalation is most apparent for pressure pumping, premium drilling rigs, and sand in the Permian Basin. Anticipating this, we implemented a number of strategies to keep our cost structure low and minimize the impact of inflationary pricing. This includes leveraging our size as one of the most active drillers to achieve volume discounts, and we've also unbundled services. We're working with a wider assortment of vendors who want to work with Apache as we can provide a more continuous, steady program than other operators with smaller footprints. We have also signed agreements for pressure pumping services and sand that index prices to WTI, providing a win-win outcome for us and our vendors as commodity prices improve. In these agreements, we have seen very little cost increases thus far. On the sand side, we're self-sourcing product by buying almost exclusively native sand, mined close to the operations. Our test indicates that we are achieving effective results with this product, and it significantly reduces our transportation costs. Vendor competition is good for Apache and healthy for the industry. We found that we can achieve good results safely and economically, sourcing more work to new and different providers. I will conclude by noting that we are pleased to be increasing activity in North America at a measured pace with the focus on generating strong fully burdened returns. As indicated by our guidance, growth will follow in the second half of 2017. Despite industry cost pressures, we believe our 2017 North America operations will be more productive and capital efficient than in previous years. I will now turn the call over to Steve. Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I will review our financial results for the first quarter, update a few 2017 guidance items, and discuss Alpine High midstream and marketing activities. Beginning with the first quarter financial results, as noted in our press release, Apache reported net income of $213 million or $0.56 per common share. Our results for the quarter include a number of items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates. These items include a $222 million gain on sale after taxes for the recent non-core asset divestitures John mentioned earlier. When excluding this gain and other smaller items, our adjusted earnings for the quarter were $31 million or $0.08 per share. Note, this adjusted earnings amount still includes dry hole costs which amounted to $40 million or $0.10 per share after tax, which Apache does not include in its guidance and is not typically modeled by analysts. Cash flow from operations in the first quarter was $455 million. Before working capital changes, Apache generated $730 million in cash flow. The significant working capital used this quarter is primarily related to the payment of expenses accrued at year-end 2016. With the proceeds received from non-core asset sales, we increased our cash position to $1.5 billion at quarter-end and reduced net debt to just under $7 billion. Our Oil and Gas capital investment for the quarter was $646 million. This was below our expectations due to capital activity being delivered under budget, as well as movements in the timing of certain spending to later in the year. For reasons outlined by John, our full year capital investment guidance remains unchanged at $3.1 billion. Turning to costs, lease operating expenses in the first quarter were $7.76 per barrel of oil equivalent, approximately 8% lower than the fourth quarter of 2016. We made tremendous progress on LOE over the last two years, and we are focused on retaining as much of that improvement as possible despite inflationary pressures. These efforts, combined with increasing low-cost Alpine High volumes, are bringing LOE expectations down. As a result, we are revising our full-year 2017 guidance range for LOE per Boe down to $8.25 to $8.75 per barrel of oil equivalent. Lastly, exploration expense in the first quarter was $92 million. $67 million of this was attributable to dry hole expense and small amounts of unproved leasehold impairments. For the full-year 2017, we previously guided to $150 million of exploration expense excluding dry holes and unproved impairments. This guidance remains unchanged. For all other expense items, our first quarter and full year results are generally on track; and thus, our full-year 2017 guidance is unchanged. Please reference the quarterly supplement for a summary of our guidance. Next, let me turn our midstream and marketing activities at Alpine High. On the midstream side, we are well into a multi-year infrastructure buildout to serve the long-term needs of Alpine High. While there are significant industry infrastructure around the Permian Basin, Alpine High requires extensive in-field processing capacity and transport to market access. Last year, our early testing demonstrated the enormous resource potential of Alpine High. As plans for full-field development materialized, we made the decision to build the infrastructure ourselves. It is strategically important to control the scope and pace of the buildout, and we are confident we have the capability to manage a project of this scale. The start-up of gas processing this week ahead of schedule and under budget reinforces that confidence. Looking ahead at our future infrastructure buildout plans, a high-pressure gas trunk line system, through our acreage, should be mostly complete by the end of 2018. We will have a 30-inch line that connects to three market pipelines to the north, and a 30-inch line that connects to one market pipeline to the south. To accommodate longer-term volume growth, completion of the third line, running from Alpine High to the Waha Hub, is anticipated during 2019. The size of this line has yet to be determined. Ultimately, Alpine High gas will have access to multiple markets, providing significant optionality for gas flow in the future. The remaining infrastructure, including gathering lines, separation, treating, compression and processing facilities will be built out over time as the pace of upstream development dictates. In the longer term, we will explore the option of installing cryogenic gas processing to extract more NGLs. In terms of liquids infrastructure, oil and NGLs are currently being trucked, which will continue for the near term. We anticipate the completion of an NGL pipeline, the size of which has yet to be determined, during 2019. We are evaluating options for the NGL line to extend beyond the Waha Hub to access further market optionality. Finally, there are many options for oil pipeline access, and we are exploring those for future consideration. As we look further into the future, the need to continue owning the Alpine High infrastructure assets should become less important. We see the possibility of a partial or full monetization and are planning accordingly. In the near term, we are confident this infrastructure project is a compelling investment, both strategically and financially, as these types of assets are generally monetized at very attractive multiples. On the gas marketing side, we are advancing discussions on many fronts and have begun implementing a contracting strategy. At this point, we have contractual assurance for the sale of most of our Alpine High gas for 2017, and have begun to contract for 2018. We are developing a portfolio of market solutions for Alpine High gas production. This will include targeting end users across a wide variety of industrial users, such as petrochemical complexes, utilities, and L&G exporters. It will also include access to gas markets that can deliver higher net backs. Specifically, this will require the ability to move gas away from the Waha Hub to places such as the Texas Gulf Coast and Mexico. Today, we are receiving a Waha base price for our natural gas. Since Apache announced the Alpine High discovery, more than 10 pipeline projects have been proposed and/or under review to expand takeaway capacity out of the Permian Basin. We expect at least two of these pipelines will be constructed with estimated in-service dates of mid-2019 to early 2020. While there has been some recent volatility in widening in the Waha base's differentials, additional transportation capacity to the Texas Gulf Coast should help alleviate the situation. In closing, it was a good first quarter for Apache financially, and we are demonstrating excellent capital cost and operating cost discipline. We've made great progress with our planning and execution on the midstream and marketing side at Alpine High, and I look forward to future updates. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for questions and answers. Operator : Our first question is from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein. Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Alpine High gas takeaway, is that connected to all of the pads or is it focused on some of those pads in the north? How much of those pads can access that market right now? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Bob, good afternoon. Right now, the first connections have been to the north. We've got one central processing facility up there that's up and running. So we've got just a handful of wells that we're bringing on initially. We're significantly ahead of schedule. And so, we've started in the north, but it will expand pretty quickly. Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So that 50 million cubic feet a day by end of June is coming from a handful of wells? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: It will be a pretty small number. I mean, actually, right now, we're curtailed by what we nominated. We are flowing close to 20 million cubic feet a day and we'll ramp pretty quickly to the 50 million cubic feet. Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse. Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: A question on Alpine High and balance sheet. So, again, congratulations on the work you're doing there. You talk often about stages per well, longer laterals and optimizing liquids recovery. I mean, the longer lateral math is pretty easy to understand in other plays. But maybe just some color in terms of where you are in terms of current stages and where you think you will get to? And then, what yield uplift you think you might be able to get as you optimize the equipment on the liquids? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Ed, we've taken, as you know, a very disciplined approach and all of our wells have been specifically designed to kind of mirror each other in terms of the completion. So they've been, what we call, test wells. They've had relatively strong small fracs, very few stages. And we've done that purposefully, so that with the changes we can see what the rock was telling us, not as you start getting real fancy on your completion. So the nice thing is, we said earlier, this year we were transitioning. And by getting the infrastructure on it, it lets us flow gas early and start to sell some liquids as well. But more importantly now, we're not going to be limited by flaring and other things. So we've transitioned. As we start to bring some of those wells on and start to disclose some of those rates, we'll start to give some of the comparisons. But we expect a pretty material uptick from what we've been using as our standard completion. Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And then, just on the balance sheet. I mean, obviously the whole sector's down, oil is down. Therefore, we don't have a real view on the commodity, but you've still got $1.5 billion of cash. You've spoken about capital flexibility, but also perhaps disposals, maybe just what is the rainy day plan? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean, if you look at what we did this year, we (41:04) for the back half of the year to protect us at $50, which is our plan. So we feel really good about this year's capital program because we've got a lot more exposure to oil price than we do gas price. We do have $1.5 billion of cash on hand. We sold $440 million of predominantly non-producing acreage, some things that we weren't going to get to for a long time, probably five, six years, if ever. And so, that's helped us. I think the big thing is, is we've taken a very measured approach. I mean, we've got a very robust inventory and our guys are chomping it a bit to do more on the capital side, but we've just taken a pretty measured approach. We want to be focused on the cost side, focused on the discipline and ramp up slowly, which is kind of the approach we've taken. So we feel good about where we sit right now with where commodity prices are. Again, there are some other things we can do as we continue to look at the portfolio, but we feel really good about where the balance sheet is. I don't know, if you want to add anything, Steve? Okay. Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good afternoon. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Hello. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: A couple of questions on Alpine High. The first is, you've talked about that comprehensive development plan. Can you give us a little bit more color on what that looks like? Specifically, if it includes the Wolfcamp and Bone Springs zones? And then, what the milestones are in those zones to get from today to developing more oilier areas? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: The thing I would say, Brian, is it's a live product for us. As we continue to get more data, it becomes more expansive. The best thing I would say is, look to the guidance. If you go back to the start of the year, we gave you Midland and Delaware and we gave you a look through the fourth quarter of 2018. And, obviously, we've got a lot of wells that we're drilling. We drilled over 40 wells. With the three we announced today, we've now disclosed I think 19 results. And we're starting to bring some of those on, and we've got a lot of wells that are in the queue. They're either flowing back now, shut-in and waiting to be produced, being completed, or drilling. So I think it's going to be an exciting next couple quarters for us as we bring forward a lot more information. But we are very optimistic, as we stated, about the parasequences, the Wolfcamp and the Bone Springs. We've done a lot of integrated work on the geology, the modeling, integrating 3-D seismic; done a lot of work. And I think we've done our homework and we've got some exciting appraisal wells that are in progress. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. And then, if we look back on some of the older Alpine High wells, what are you seeing on the decline rate side? And because some of these wells are constrained, would we expect a lower decline rate than the decline rate that we would see in the development plan? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Brian, most of the wells that \u2013 after we've kind of stabilized test rates on them, we shut most of the wells in. So we have not been producing those. I mean, when you're flaring gas without the ability to sell the gas, then you'd be paying royalty that did not make sense. So we shut most of those wells in. And, obviously, this week we've started to open some wells back up. So we're very anxious to produce. I can tell you, the early responses look really good. A lot of flush liquids and some exciting stuff. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Good afternoon. On the Chinook and the Blackhawk wells that had the oil condensate rates, can you give us a little color in terms of the gravity of the oil? Did that fall in line with your expectations or was that a little bit higher than anticipated? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: No. Well, first of all, Scott, it's oil; it's not a condensate. It's very stable. And, yes, it fell in line with our models. So no surprises. The gas BTU content gets heavier as we move up and the oil gravities are getting lower as well, which is a really positive sign. I think one of the keys for us will be getting things into the processing facilities. When you're catching (45:45) on those, it's hard sometimes and there is room for error within those test samples. But everything really, really fits our maturity model and our geologic models very tightly. So we're very excited about the predictability in the transgressive source intervals. Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And, outside of the test rate, were you able to flow those wells a little bit or are those shut-in like you mentioned due to the infrastructure constraints? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: No, those wells have been flowing over the last several days. And so, we have been flowing those wells. And, quite frankly, we will be able to move the into facilities pretty early this quarter. Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Any color on some of the productivity, post the initial test rates? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: No, it looked good. I mean, we're very excited about it. So one of the keys is, we need to get the facilities, get everything tied in and run them through properly, because then we can really start to dial down in what these things are going to do. But we're very encouraged, and it was predictable to see as we moved up the column with the lower temperature. We knew they were going to get more oily, which is the case. And there's a lot of real estate above us and a lot of other zones to test as well. So, I mean, it's very exciting. Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And if I could just quickly on the gas sales contracts. I think you all said that you had most or all of 2017 locked up and looking at 2018. Who are you signing up the contracts with for 2017? What type of end users, not maybe specifically, but if you can generalize that for us. Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yes. No, we're not at this point disclosing exactly who we're contracting with, but there are lots of player in that area. So you can count on the fact that we're \u2013 as I said in my script, we're looking to have a pretty good size portfolio of various solutions on the contracting side, both in terms of transporting product, as well as marketing it to various forms of users. And we do have contractual assurance, as I said, for the vast majority of our volume for 2017, as much as we think we can be capable of producing this year. And part of that contract goes into \u2013 or part of the contracting that we've done so far goes into 2018 as well. Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Appreciate that. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of John Herrlin with Soc Gen. John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale : Thank you. With respect to the cryogenic units at Alpine High, can you give us a sense of how big you're contemplating? Or you're going to do skid units or you're going to do some large centralized units? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Yes. John, it's early. We've got some time. I mean, it's really an option for us. So as we start to pull the processing facilities, get them all up and running, that's one of the things we've got tabled to make a decision on. Really, we could pull the trigger on it at any time, but we will look at what's optimal. I mean, the nice thing about this resource play is we've got a wide range from pretty much dry gas in some areas up to the north, to very, very wet gas. So I don't envision it being an all-or-nothing decision on the cryo, and it's just one of the things we've got tabled to do later. John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale : Okay. That's fair. And then, in terms of monetizing this down the line, I would assume that this is several years out because you want to control your growth right now of the infrastructure in terms of going in a healthy route or whatever? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: I mean, I think if you look at what some of the transactions that have been recently done out there, they're significant value. I mean, I think clearly right now as we're ramping up, now would not be the time. But I think as you get out past a year from now, you could easily be in a window where you could consider doing something. I don't know, Steve, if you want to add anything further? Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yes. John, I think ultimately the answer to that is going to be both a strategic answer and a financial answer. I think John is exactly right. By the time we get into \u2013 well, into 2018 financially, we'd certainly be capable of monetizing this at a pretty attractive price. And then, it'll come down to the question of strategically is it the right time. And you're exactly right, there's \u2013 as I said in my comments, it's strategically important for us to control this at this point in time and the ability to start it up two months early and the flexibility that we have around constructing. It's a pretty sizable project. It's proven to be pretty important that we had complete control over that. So we'll continue to monitor that both strategically and financially, and combined, we'll make the decision as to when and if we monetize it. John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale : Okay, great. Thanks, Steve. One last one for me. Do you have any sense of the notional value of what your hedges are right now for the oil? Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: I haven't looked at them today, but they're probably worth more today than they were last week. John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale : Okay. That's fair. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Phillip Jungwirth with BMO. Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good afternoon. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Hello. Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States): We're starting to see industry activity, whether it's permits or rigs, into Jeff Davis County. And I know this isn't an area where you guys lease. But curious as to your view on how the play changes as you move west of your position? And why this wasn't an area that, had you focused on when you initially built this position? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean, what I would say, Phillip is, is obviously since we put the play together grassroots, did a lot of work upfront, went out and leased what we felt like we wanted, shot a massive 3-D over the entire area. I think we like our position. As I said in our comments, we think we've leased the lion's share of the Alpine High. So, clearly, there's a lot of other targets and a lot of things, and you see a lot of activity picking up around us. But we like where we are and consciously leased what we wanted to lease. Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, great. And then, in Suriname, just curious as to your thoughts on farming down some of your 100% interest in Block 58. And then, given that dry hole costs in this area are relatively inexpensive, how would that factor into your consideration? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: The Kolibrie well was a well we needed to drill. We've learned a lot about the basin from that well and gained some very, very valuable information. Right now, I am also glad that we drilled that well with, what I'll call, 45-cent dollars as we had a 45% interest in it. And our dry hole cost was significantly lower. It came in around $20 million versus a budgeted number of around $37 million, so relatively much cheaper. What I would say is, is we're working on next steps at Block 53. We've got time on Block 58. We've shot the 3-D, we're processing it, we'll have that done sometime this year. We're very encouraged by what we see on Block 58, and we'll just leave that for another date. Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Arun Jayaram from JPM. Challenge... John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Hey, Arun. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : How are you doing? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Good. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I was wondering if you could help us think about, on a go-forward basis, what the cost structure is going to look like at Alpine? I am just trying to think, your cash flow per Mcfe kind of margins, as you start getting into 2018 and start to dial the volumes up. So can you help us think about the cost structure for Alpine High? Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yes, Arun. This is Steve. I think the best place to go and get that would be in our Barclays pack that we used, the slide deck that we used. Go to that one slide on economics. I think from there you can get the cost per barrel. It's in the fine print on that slide, but be sure you add $500,000 per well for infrastructure costs, because it's included in the economics that we ran, but not included in the well costs that we published on that day. It does give you the $4 million to $6 million per well on the high-end and low-end. Add $500,000 to that, you've got estimated EURs and, therefore, you'll have estimated production mix from that. Today, we're selling oil basically at WTI. We are selling NGLs at about \u2013 we've been selling it anywhere from 45% to 50% of WTI. And you could probably use Waha Hub as pricing for the gas. So you'll get a mixed price per barrel equivalent. And I think you can use your typical gas field type of cash costs on the operating side. And I think when you do that, you're going to find a pretty darn attractive ratio of the cost per barrel to cash margin per barrel. That would probably compete with anything you're doing on a more oily basis in the rest of the Permian Basin. You'll see from that why we're so excited about the economics of this wet gas play. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. But maybe details on \u2013 your thoughts on the LOE versus the GPT on Alpine High? Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: No. We're not really sharing any of that right now. But I think you can count on the fact that the LOE per Boe is going to be low, especially for the next several years, as we drill some fresh wells, get some flush production going. And it's going to be, I think, a typical LOE on a robust gas field. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Fair enough. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: One of the pluses, Arun, is you don't have a lot of water in the lower source intervals, which is all we've talked about in the economics. So we're not going to have the water handling challenges that you have in northern parts of the basin. Now, if we start to bring forward some of the parasequences, there may be some more water with some of those. And so, that's one of the reasons why we'll bring some of that data forward in the future. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Fair enough. And just switching gears a little bit, in terms of the new concessions in Egypt, at what point, John, do you think you'll be able to drill some wells on these new concession areas? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, we expect those to be awarded some time pretty quick, this month or next month most likely. I think we could be actively planning to drill this fall, is the plan. So we're very, very excited about those concessions. A big uptick. We have not got two new onshore concessions in the Western Desert since 2006. And we see a lot of low-hanging fruit and a lot of really neat stuff to go after. So we're chopping it a bit to get our hands on those concessions. We're going to do a lot for our Egypt inventory. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. Thanks a lot. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bob Morris with Citi. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. John, it wasn't clear on the processing or the handling of the NGLs, when you would have that processing capacity in place to begin moving and selling NGLs. And if you're initially going to be installing cryogenic plants or just going with cheaper lean oil plants to start with on that? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: We will have refridge in the processing facilities. We've got one up, it's up and running now, that we are working through, kind of lining it out. So we will be selling NGLs. Have been selling some off to some of these skid-mounted units we've had in the field as well. So, as Steve said, we've kind of been receiving anywhere from 45% to 50% of WTI for those NGLs. And, right now, our plans are for refridge in the field. And with the decision to be made on cryo, as I said, when Mr. Herrlin asked the question, later this year, early next year, sometime in the future on the cryo decision. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company L.L.C.: Good afternoon, John, to you and the rest of your team there. I wanted to ask a question about the Hidalgo pad, the King Hidalgo pad, and the uplift you guys saw on the 3H versus 9H. As I adjust for lateral length there, it looks like there's an uplift of about 60% just from adjusting your azimuth. And I am curious, is that indicative of the uplift you think is available through most of Alpine High by optimizing your azimuth? Or is there more something visible particularly to this area that made the azimuth more important down here? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, what I would say, Charles, is targeting is always critical in the productivity side, especially when you have rock like this. I mean, we've got a very provable area down there. We knew the azimuth, because we spud that well. We had done some before we had gotten our 3-D processed and really worked through it. So we knew it was on the wrong azimuth. We disclosed that back in February when we disclosed it, and we knew it would make an impact. So it is one of the key things. And when we talk about \u2013 even mentioned it in the press release today \u2013 when we talk about moving into more optimization, that's one of the things we're going to be doing, too, is tweaking the targeting. And it matters a lot. And getting things on the right azimuth, that's one of the big pluses to having such a blockey acreage position because we can do this the right way, not trying to drill down lease lines and so forth, like you do in a lot of other plays. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company L.L.C.: Got it. So is the stress field pretty tricky across the whole play, or is it more just kind of \u2013 as you get more structurally complex that it becomes an issue? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: It will change based on the geologic setting and it changes within the setting. So it's one of the things that you have to do a lot of integrative work to fully understand, like anything else. But the 3-D is pretty helpful to understanding that and seeing what some of the substructure is doing, is pretty key to understanding that. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company L.L.C.: Right, right. And then one last quick one. The pace of your divestitures, how are you thinking about that? Is that something that we should expect an ongoing kind of steady pace on that? Or is that more opportunistically driven in that case may be attached to oil prices? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: No, I mean, it's more opportunistically driven. We continue to look at our portfolio. As we build out more optionality and more inventory, there are things that we look at today that in the past we might have thought we would've funded that we won't get to. And so, we don't have anything set out there that we're saying here's what's going to be next. But I'll just say we're actively looking at our portfolio and managing it, and it would be more opportunistically in terms of what we decide to put out there. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company L.L.C.: That's great detail. Thanks, John. Operator : And our last question comes from line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo. David, your line is open. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. I was on mute. A couple of questions, John. North Sea, can you just talk about the production? I think there were some outages, but can you talk about the production quarter-to-quarter and what happened there? Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yes, David. In January, we had an upset at Beryl Alpha and the whole platform went down. We lost about 18 million cubic feet a day for the month of January. And then, we drilled a couple of non-commercial wells, and then we had a couple of wells that under-performed in the first quarter and that's what's causing our issue. But keep in mind we've got a calendar coming online start of the third quarter. We're very excited about that. And then, we had really a tremendous quarter in Egypt with a lot of successes not only in our development program, but in our exploration program. Got 13 wells online there and we've got a number of wells that will be coming online in the second quarter. So as a result of all that, we did not have to do anything with our guidance. We left guidance unchanged for international. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And Alpine High has been (01:03:56). John, so just a comment you made about service contracts, I don't know if that was you or Steve that made the comment, but about linking those to WTI. What percentage would you say \u2013 is it something that you envision going meaningfully higher like structural change and the way prices are set going forward? Or is this just kind of a one-off? Or how should we think about this in the big picture context? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: No, I mean, I think there's an opportunity in some cases to turn it from a win-lose into a win-win. And we've sat down and had some pretty grownup conversations with some of our bigger service providers that do a lot of different things for us and have tried to find ways where you tie things more to the oil price rise, where both sides are happy than you are directly with demand. Because, as you know, as we saw in late-2014 and demand can oftentimes outrun the rise in terms of what the commodity price is doing. So I think we're trying to do some things more in a way that's going to create a win-win or we can put some equipment and crews in place and let them work for a long, long time for both companies and be happy with it. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. Thanks. That's all I've got. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Thank you. Operator : That is all the time we have for questions today. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Clark for closing remarks. Gary T. Clark - Apache Corp.: Well, thanks, everybody, for joining us on a busy earnings day. There were number of analysts left on the queue. So if we didn't get to your question, please feel free to call myself, Patrick or Kian, and we'd be happy to follow up with you. Talk to you all next quarter. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Operator : Welcome to the Apache Corporation's second quarter 2017 results earnings call. I would like to turn the call over to Gary Clark, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Gary T. Clark - Apache Corp.: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's second quarter 2017 financial and operational results conference call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann; Executive Vice President of Operations Support, Tim Sullivan; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Steve Riney. In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our second quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. On today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude noncontrolling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. Please note that all currency references in our prepared remarks are in U.S. dollars. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. I will now turn the call over to John. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will : review our approach to navigating the lower-for-longer oil price environment; discuss the strategic rationale and financial benefits of our pending exit from Canada; provide current operational highlights, including Alpine High; and conclude with our thoughts around balancing funding and spending in 2018. Since the beginning of 2015, we have restructured our business to adapt and thrive in a lower-for-longer commodity price environment. The organization reacted swiftly to the downturn in oil prices. We stressed the importance of properly aligning cost structure with commodity prices as well as achieving and maintaining cash flow neutrality. We completed a series of transactions that simplified our portfolio. We reduced operating costs, overhead, and capital commitments, and significantly improved the balance sheet. With regard to our asset base and strategy, we successfully expanded and enhanced our organic unconventional North American acreage footprint and technical capabilities. We also focused our international capital spending to deliver strong and sustainable free cash flow from our core businesses in Egypt and the North Sea. These efforts were supported by significant improvements in our planning and capital allocation processes, which helped drive our strategy of returns-focused organic growth. In early 2017, WTI oil prices were trading above $50 per barrel, with the out years of the NYMEX strip trending even higher. We had concerns about the fundamentals underpinning this oil price optimism and the corresponding cash flows from operations. At the same time, we had just announced our discovery at Alpine High, a very attractive large-scale opportunity which would require significant near-term investment. Given our strong financial position, a cost structure that was now properly aligned with commodity prices, and a deep inventory of fully burdened high rate-of-return projects, we believed it was appropriate and value creating to budget a moderate outspend for the near term. Our general philosophy was that the upstream expenditures and dividends should be funded within cash flow while using a combination of non-core asset sales and the balance sheet to fund a viable midstream build-out at Alpine High. Accordingly, on our fourth quarter earnings call in February, we announced a 2017 capital budget based on a $50 WTI oil price, which at the time was conservative relative to the prevailing strip. We also announced that we had protected the 2017 capital program with put options at $50 WTI and $51 Brent for the majority of our oil production in the second half of the year. This helped to ensure our ability to fund the Alpine High capital program, which was strategically important to our long-term returns-focused growth strategy through a potentially volatile commodity price environment. Today, through the combination of expected cash flows from operations and proceeds from recent asset sales, our planned 2017 CapEx and dividends are funded. As a result, our $3.1 billion capital program remains unchanged. We expect to end 2017 with more cash and less debt, and we will have significantly higher production levels in the Permian Basin. I'd now like to comment on our exit from Canada, which we anticipate will be finalized upon the closing of two transactions later this month. From a strategic perspective, the sale of Canada further streamlines our portfolio and increases our North American leverage to the Permian Basin, which can be seen in our financial and operational supplement. While the Montney and Duvernay plays in Canada offer long-term growth potential, they are strategically disadvantaged relative to the other opportunities within our portfolio. Financially, Apache will realize several important benefits from the Canadian divestiture. In addition to the roughly $700 million headline sales price, the present value of asset retirement obligations on our balance sheet will be reduced by approximately $800 million. Gross cash overhead costs plus other corporate program costs will be reduced by approximately $70 million annually. Average cash margins per BOE, earnings per share, and free cash flow will be positively impacted, and return on capital employed at the corporate level will improve. I will conclude my remarks on Canada by noting that Apache is very grateful to the many employees who built this region over the years. We believe the employees and the assets will be well served under the new owners, who are eager to make significant capital investments in the business. Turning now to results and highlights from the quarter, oil and gas capital investment was $738 million in the second quarter, two-thirds of which was in the Permian Basin. Of this amount, Alpine High midstream expenditures were $128 million. Total first half 2017 capital investment of $1.4 billion is consistent with our planned full-year CapEx of $3.1 billion. As a reminder, this year we budgeted for an average well cost increase of 10% to 15% versus 2016 levels. And while we have seen price increases of 30% to 40% for certain service lines, our increased pad drilling operations coupled with other efficiencies and cost initiatives have resulted in average well cost at/or below budgeted levels. Tim will discuss this more in his remarks. As anticipated, our total daily production bottomed out in the second quarter, and we have shifted to a growth trajectory. We expect continued production volume increases at Alpine High and in the Midland Basin as well as our international regions during the second half of 2017. Now, I'd like to discuss some of our specific regional highlights, starting with Alpine High. As noted previously, we achieved first production at Alpine High in early May and exceeded our June 30 target of 50 million cubic feet per day of processed gas. Currently, our net sales gas exceeds 60 million cubic feet per day, and we anticipate this will increase to more than 100 million cubic feet per day by the end of September. Due to the timing of infrastructure build-out and gas takeaway, the majority of our Alpine High production thus far has come from our northernmost acreage. The drilling in this area has primarily been lease-retention-focused, and these wells are generally deeper and, thus, have a lower liquids content. The liquids ratio should increase as we drill and connect more wells in other areas of the play, and as we commission additional processing facilities. In the month of June, total Alpine High sales, net to Apache, averaged approximately 7,400 BOEs per day, of which approximately 10% was oil and natural gas liquids. As just mentioned, this liquids ratio should increase in the second half of the year. On the midstream side, we invested $270 million in the first half of 2017. Managing midstream internally provides Apache with operational flexibility and cost control benefits as we delineate the upstream and move into early-stage development. By retaining 100% ownership, we are investing in an asset that we believe will significantly increase in value as the upstream production and reserve potential are further demonstrated. Currently, our operational midstream facilities consist of 35 miles of 30-inch trunkline for gas takeaway, more than 40 miles of smaller diameter gathering lines, two central processing sites and eight central tank batteries. In addition, we have several significant midstream infrastructure milestones coming up in the second half of the year. In August, we will bring online our third central processing site followed by a fourth and fifth site in September, one of which will be located in the southern portion of the play. Also in September, we will connect our 30-inch trunkline to a market pipeline in the southern portion of the play, which will be capable of moving gas south to Mexico or north to the Waha Hub. Around year-end, we plan to have our sixth central processing site operational. In terms of new activity, we drilled four appraisal wells in the oil window of the Wolfcamp, Bone Springs parasequences at vertical depths ranging from 9,000 to 10,000 feet. We are excited about these wells, which have confirmed an over-pressured regime and 42-degree to 44-degree gravity oil. One of the wells, an approximate 4,500-foot lateral drilled in the Wolfcamp formation recorded a 30-day average rate in excess of 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. With an oil cut of 70%, this well has cumulative production of approximately 37,000 barrels of oil in 75 days. A second well in the Wolfcamp is still cleaning up and producing around 400 barrels of oil per day. The third and fourth wells will be completed and begin flowing back shortly. We are pleased with the indications thus far from our oil bearing parasequence test at Alpine High. Early results from mapping and testing these zones gives us confidence at minimum in hundreds of drilling locations, and there is still a considerable amount of acreage in numerous landing zones to be tested. Optimization work is underway at Alpine High, and we are testing a number of different parameters across multiple formations to determine the best patterns, spacing, well-bore placement and completion designs. This process will be multifaceted and continuous. As we gather data and reach key conclusions, we will discuss them further with the market. On the costs side, we have made excellent progress and remain comfortable with our previous estimated average drilling and completion cost of $4 million to $6 million per well, despite the rising service cost environment. Overall, Alpine High operations are on track to progress to development. Trunkline and gathering system construction and takeaway connections are proceeding as expected, and our processing facilities are actively optimizing liquids recovery. From the wells connected and flowing thus far, we are seeing decline curves and pressure data consistent with our EUR projections. In addition to the Wolfcamp and Bone Springs parasequences I just mentioned, we continue to be very confident in our more than 3,000 wet-gas well location count, which remains highly economic at current or even lower prices. Turning now to the Midland Basin where our activity is primarily focused on multi-well pad drilling to the Wolfcamp and Spraberry formations. In April, we brought the nine well Schrock 34 pad online at the Azalea field in Glasscock County. This pad exhibited strong performance with 60-day cumulative production exceeding our expectations. Average well costs were only $4.3 million, underscoring the significant efficiencies we are achieving in pad operations. In the second half of 2017, we have five additional multi-well pads scheduled to come online in the Midland Basin, which Tim will discuss in a moment. Internationally, we continued to generate strong free cash flow during the second quarter. In Egypt, our exploration program included two high-rate exploration discoveries with material potential for more activity in the Matruh Basin. As previously mentioned, we have received approval and expect to have signed agreements soon for two new concessions in Egypt. Combined, these blocks add approximately 1.6 million acres to Apache's footprint in the Western Desert, a 40% increase. With the opportunity set provided by these new concessions and the modern vintage 3-D seismic we are accumulating across our acreage in the Western Desert, we are very excited about the long-term potential in Egypt. Moving over to the North Sea; at Callater, we completed our facilities tieback ahead of schedule and proceeded with testing of the 18x discovery well in June. In July, we successfully tested a second well in an adjacent fault block. Both wells were recently brought online at a combined facilities-constrained rate of approximately 19,000 BOEs per day net to Apache, of which approximately 70% was oil and liquids. I'd like to close with a review of our 2018 capital budget and the flexibility we have around this program. Adjusted for the pending divestment of Canada, our planned capital budget for 2018 is $3.1 billion. This plan, which we announced in February, was based on $55 WTI oil and $3 NYMEX gas, and was designed to approximate cash flow neutrality, excluding Alpine High midstream investment. Our 2018 budget is flexible and can be adjusted in response to macro conditions, as every $5 per barrel change in oil prices impacts our cash flow by roughly $350 million. If necessary, we have numerous options available next year to manage a lower oil price environment. To begin with, we are maintaining the operational flexibility to reduce planned activity across most, if not all of our regions. Second, we believe costs in a sub-$55 oil price world would be lower than what we have estimated in our plan; and hence, the same overall activity set could be delivered for less than the $3.1 billion budget. Third, we could continue with the small asset package divestitures. Fourth, we have multiple options with respect to our Alpine High midstream assets, possibly initiating a monetization process or seeking third-party funding. And lastly, we could choose to utilize a portion of our significant cash position. What you can count on is that we will enter 2018 well prepared to manage a capital program commensurate with the prevailing price environment. We will do so with a keen focus on long-term returns, and we have no intention of stressing the balance sheet or diluting our shareholders. To wrap up, Apache is executing well on all fronts. Production is now growing in the U.S., as our Permian teams deliver strong drilling results in the Delaware and Midland Basins. In Egypt and the North Sea, we are bringing on several key wells which will provide production momentum in the second half of 2017. Across the company, we are successfully managing cost pressures and working diligently to manage LOE and G&A. In terms of our long-term growth and return expectations, we are making excellent progress incorporating or merging Alpine High outlook into our multiyear plan. As that full field development plan evolves, we will look to communicate some of the key elements of the multiyear plan to the investment community. Apache's balance sheet remains in great shape and our expected cash flow from oil production is well protected in the back half of this year. We look forward to entering 2018 in a strong financial position and continuing to create value with our differentiated, organic, unconventional exploration capabilities. I will now turn the call over to Tim to provide more operational details. Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Good afternoon. My remarks today will cover operational activity and key wells in our focus areas, new technologies we are applying to improve our performance and service and supply cost trends. Our second quarter production results reflect the lingering impact of last year's reduced capital and development activity. These effects, combined with the scheduled maintenance activities in Canada and the North Sea, contributed to a 3% production decrease on an adjusted basis from the preceding quarter. With those events behind us, we are shifting to a growth trajectory for the remainder of the year and beyond. During the second quarter, we increased activity at a measured pace, averaging 35 operated rigs worldwide with 17 in the Permian, 1 in the Mid-Continent, 13 in Egypt and 4 in the North Sea. In North America, second quarter 2017 production averaged 244,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 3% from the first quarter. In the Permian Basin, production of 146,000 BOE per day was flat compared to the preceding period. I'll begin with an overview of Alpine High in the Delaware Basin, where we have six rigs operating today. At quarter close, 11 wells were connected and producing into our midstream facilities, five of which were constrained to control flow as we commissioned newly-installed equipment and evaluated initial reservoir performance. Six wells were in various stages of flowback and testing, and 17 wells were waiting on completion, or shut-in waiting on infrastructure. Subsequent to quarter-end, we have connected additional wells, and production continues to impress. In addition to the Alpine High parasequence wells that John mentioned, we also recently completed a Barnett well with a test rate of more than 7.7 million cubic feet of gas, 400 barrels of oil and 450 barrels of NGLs per day from a 3,300-foot lateral. I would also note that we are seeing much more competitor activity around Alpine High. Offset operators have drilled or were drilling 16 wells with another 28 competitor wells permitted. As we drill more wells, we are also seeing improvements on the costs side. We are utilizing a spudder rig to set surface casing in an effort to reduce shallow hole cost associated with high-demand larger rigs. In addition, we have been successful in the elimination of the casing string in some areas, and reduced drill time in the intermediate and lateral sections of the well. All-in costs for these wells are on track to fall within our targeted range of $4 million to $6 million. Elsewhere in the Delaware Basin, in our Mentone field north of the Alpine High, we brought online a five-well pad at the Magpie unit. These wells were drilled with 1-mile laterals in the third Bone Springs and achieved an average 30-day IP rate in excess of 1,000 BOE per day and an average cost of $4.5 million per well. In the Midland Basin, we are primarily focused on drilling larger multi-well pads. The nine-well Schrock 34 pad in our Azalea field is contributing strong performance. This mile-long pad was designed as a spacing and landing zone test with completion in the Wolfcamp A1, B1 and B3. In addition to this pad, we drilled the Calverley 2932 1H, a 1.5-mile lateral that is the first well of a future nine-well pad. 30-day IPs from these 10 Azalea wells averaged approximately 950 BOE per day, with a 75% oil cut. In the Powell Field, we completed the first two wells on two separate pads, where we plan to drill a total of 12 wells each in the Wolfcamp B formation. One pad has a mile laterals and achieved a 30-day average IP rate of nearly 900 BOE per day. The other pad has a 1.5-mile laterals and achieved an average 30-day IP rate of just under 1,300 BOE per day. During the second half of 2017, we plan to bring online approximately 30 Midland Basin wells, most of them having extended laterals of 1.5 miles or longer. I'll turn now to our international assets. Adjusted production in Egypt, which excludes minority interest and the impact of tax barrels, increased slightly from the first quarter 2017 to 89,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We had several exploration and development highlights from the Egyptian drilling program during the second quarter, primarily in our legacy Matruh Basin. We are developing new concepts in this mature basin, which is leading to greater results from great rock. We tested two zones at the Herunefer West 1X well. The AEB tested 5,900 BOE per day, and the Lower Safa tested 4,500 BOE per day. The discovery established our thickest pay interval to date within the basin, logging approximately 400 feet of total net pay in the Safa and AEB formations. It also sets up several development locations and derisks additional exploration prospects on trend. Also in the Matruh Basin, the Bravo 2X tested at nearly 4,100 BOE per day from 78 feet of pay in the Safa, with additional pay behind pipe. In Egypt, during the first half of 2017, we have drilled a total of 43 wells with a 77% success rate. Notably, 22 of the 33 producers have exhibited extremely high test rates exceeding 1,000 BOE per day, with successes spanning five different basins. Keep in mind that these are vertical wells with completed well costs of approximately $3 million. We have also performed 18 recompletions this year, with flow rates also exceeding 1,000 BOE per day. I'll move now to our North Sea region. Due to scheduled maintenance activity at the Beryl platforms, our production declined to 55,000 BOE per day during the second quarter of 2017. This was better than expected, as equipment deliveries necessary for the planned maintenance turnarounds were delayed, so the tar started later than planned. We used this delay to accelerate testing of our first well at Callater, the 18x. As previously disclosed, the lower half of the 18x tested at a peak 24-hour rate of more than 15,000 barrels of oil and 28 million cubic feet of gas. This was stronger than expected and nearly equivalent to the rate that we had forecasted for the entire well. Subsequent to the second quarter end, we tested the upper half of the Callater 18x, and it flowed at a peak 24-hour rate of more than 19,000 BOE per day with a 69% oil cut. As John noted, we also recently completed a second well at Callater in the adjacent fault block. The CB2 tested at a very strong 24-hour rate of more than 11,000 BOE per day with a 65% oil cut. With both wells flowing at Callater, we expect the North Sea will deliver higher production levels in the second half of the year. In addition to the progress at Callater, we drilled the BLB, an infill well at Beryl Bravo platform. This well flowed at a 30-day initial production rate averaging nearly 6,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with an 82% oil cut from the Nansen reservoir. Please refer to our financial and operational supplement for more details on our second quarter production. Across our portfolio, we are implementing new technologies to improve the data we use to explore the subsurface, increase operational efficiencies, reduce costs, and improve hydrocarbon recoveries while optimizing net present value. We are taking an integrated geoscience and engineering approach to these initiatives. In the Permian, both in the Delaware and Midland Basins, we are collecting massive amounts of data from multiple sources. On a single pad, to better understand reservoir performance, we have obtained or installed downhole microseismic data, surface vertical seismic profiles, fiber optics collecting pressure and temperature data, downhole pressure monitors, and oil and chemical tracers. This data collection and analysis will provide us unprecedented insight into the effect of our stimulations on the rock fabric. Ultimately, it will allow us to optimize well placement and spacing. Apache also has been building new state-of-the-art water treatment and recycling facilities, including large, highly engineered water storage pits in both Midland and the Delaware Basins. These facilities directly add value to our projects by reducing water costs and increasing reliability and flexibility. Finally, Apache is developing new workflows and technologies that allow for rapid characterization of thousands of feet of core and quickly getting this into the hands of geologists and engineers for faster characterization of shale plays and landing zones. Overall, we are building a far more robust understanding of our conventional and unconventional plays and their performance than was previously possible. Instead of just gathering data, we are owning, maintaining, validating, and optimizing the use of the data to add value to our assets. I'll move now to service costs. This is a positive execution story, as we've been able to effectively maintain the lower cost structure achieved in 2016. As John noted, we anticipated much of the inflation we're seeing today and have been successful offsetting it with operational efficiencies and service contracts. Overall costs for North America were essentially flat in the second quarter of 2017 compared with the first quarter. We do not expect rising service costs to materially impact our activity or budget for the remainder of 2017. We continue to see cost inflation for certain services and supplies, primarily for pressure pumping and sand in West Texas, where spot market prices continue to trend upward. Hoping to offset this, we are sourcing low-cost sands that are delivered from local mines in the Permian Basin, reducing transportation costs considerably. We also entered into contracts with pricing indexed to WTI, which protects against a portion of those increases. Internationally, costs are tracking as expected. During the third quarter, the current contract on Ocean Patriot expires, and we've renewed the semisubmersible drilling rig at a considerably lower day rate. This will reduce our North Sea drilling costs in 2018 and 2019, with an option for a third year. I will conclude by noting that we have increased activity in North America at a very measured pace and generally avoided direct competition for equipment and services at spot market rates. We are focused on generating strong, fully burdened returns. And as indicated by our guidance, growth will follow in the second half of 2017. Despite industry cost pressures, we believe our 2017 North America operations are more capital efficient than in previous years. I will now turn the call over to Steve. Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Thank you, Tim, and, good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I will review our second quarter financial results. I will provide an update on quarterly and annual guidance items, which will reflect the full anticipated effect of Apache's exit from Canada. And lastly, I will comment on our updated hedges and the continuing strength of our financial position. Let me begin with second quarter financial results. As noted in our press release, Apache reported net income of $572 million or $1.50 per diluted common share. Earnings were positively impacted by a net deferred income tax benefit related to a financial restructuring in Canada in preparation for the exit. This consists primarily of a $678 million reduction in a U.S. deferred income tax liability with respect to untaxed foreign source earnings. Together with some other smaller adjustments, the total tax benefit excluded for purposes of calculating adjusted earnings is $670 million. Results for the quarter also included a number of other items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates. These include a $26 million unrealized mark-to-market gain on our commodity price hedge positions, $25 million of unproved acreage impairment and $18 million of loss related to recent divestitures. Excluding these and other items, our adjusted loss for the quarter was $79 million or $0.21 per share. Note, this adjusted earnings still includes the effect of dry-hole costs incurred of $46 million or $0.08 per share after tax. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $751 million. This includes a working capital benefit of $148 million. Our cash position on June 30 was $1.7 billion, a slight increase from the previous quarter. Turning to costs, lease operating expenses in the second quarter were $8.81 per parallel of oil equivalent, an increase over the first quarter rate. This increase was anticipated and is primarily attributable to seasonal maintenance activity in our North Sea business. Our first half 2017 LOE was $8.27 per barrel of oil equivalent, which is in line with our guidance for the full year of $8.25 to $8.75 per BOE. Exploration expense in the second quarter was $108 million, $85 million of which was attributable to dry-hole expense and unproved leasehold impairments. Now I'll move to guidance, and today we are mending several of our 2017 guidance ranges to reflect the impact of Apache's pending exit from Canada. As previously announced, we are exiting our Canada business via three separate transactions. Our 2017 updated guidance is provided on pages 22 and 23 of the supplement. All new guidance now reflects Canada results through the actual or anticipated transaction closing dates. As a reminder, the first of these three transactions closed on June 30, and the other two transactions are expected to close in August. Additionally, on pages 19 through 21 of our supplement, we have provided new adjusted quarterly production guidance which excludes Canada from all quarters in 2017. I will walk through some of these guidance items, but my comments will be relatively brief. So feel free to follow up with Gary and his team with any questions you may have. Beginning with our adjusted North American production guidance on page 19 of the supplement, we have removed actual and projected Canadian production for all of the periods shown. We have also tightened our forward-looking guidance ranges reflecting more clarity around our second half production ramp, particularly at Alpine High. On the international side, our adjusted production guidance remains essentially unchanged. However, I would like to note that Egypt tax barrel guidance for reporting purposes has decreased by 10,000 BOEs per day, which is primarily driven by a lower commodity price outlook and thus lower taxable income in Egypt. With regard to capital, our $3.1 billion 2017 budget is not impacted by the Canada exit, since most of the capital allocated to the Canada region this year will have been spend by the time the transactions have closed. The exit from Canada will reduce our planned 2018 capital budget by approximately $125 million. Turning to guidance for expenses, on page 23 of the supplement, you will note that we reduced annual guidance for G&A expenses by $25 million and for gathering and transportation expenses by $20 million to $30 million, both primarily to reflect the Canada exit. Note that our DD&A guidance for 2017 has increased slightly on a BOE basis since our Canada business had a relatively low carrying value. Moving now to hedging, in addition to our oil PUDs, we have begun adding some gas hedges. For the second half of 2017, we have now swapped an average of 33,750 MMBtu per day of gas volumes at an average price of $3.36. More significantly, we have begun hedging our first quarter 2018 gas volumes with 150,000 MMBtu per day swapped at an average price of $3.39. As a reminder, the primary goal of our hedging activity is to protect the pace and delivery of a strategically important capital program at Alpine High. This continues to be the case as we look to 2018. We do not use hedging to speculate on price. I would like to conclude by emphasizing Apache's financial strength. This is a product of our disciplined approach over the last few years. As I indicated previously, our cash position has been growing and net debt is down $355 million since the beginning of the year. For the remainder of the year, our cash flow is well protected with our price hedges, so our ability to fund the capital program and dividend payment without utilizing the balance sheet is secure. We are well prepared for continued volatility in oil and gas prices. We continue to balance the need to flex the capital program commensurate with the price environment, while also funding our long-term strategy. Throughout this effort, we focus on investments that will deliver sound full-cycle economics at current or even lower commodity prices. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : Our first question is from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: A question on the Midland Basin. There's been a lot of talk amongst investors about rising gas-oil ratios in that play and the potential that they're displacing forecasted oil type curves. What's your view on that? How do we think about your GORs in the Midland? Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: This is Tim. In the Midland Basin, our shale wells, they're performing in line with our type curves. We really haven't been surprised by the GORs. We understand the producing characteristics of our different areas that we operate in. And our GORs are performing as we would have expected. Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thanks. The other is, do you have an estimate of where you were Alpine High sort of end of \u2013 or currently or call it the end of 2Q? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Actually in the prepared remarks, Bob, we said we produced 7,400 BOEs a day net to Apache. 10% of that was liquids and almost all of that was oil in the month of June. Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Got you. Thank you. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: You bet. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Good afternoon. John, I wondered if you could give us a little bit more detail. In your prepared comments you talked a little bit about how you expect Alpine High to perform in the northern part of the field versus the south. So I wondered if you can give us a little bit more color around that. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: I mean, Arun, I think the good news is, is we got online early. We were scheduled to bring everything on July 1. We have some of the stuff to talk about in the second quarter, because we were able to bring things on in early May. Things are progressing really as planned. We were able to sell net to Apache 7,400 BOEs a day in the month of June. And like I said, we've been bringing up the CPFs. If you look at kind of where we are today on the infrastructure, we now have 35 miles of the 30-inch trunkline in. We've got over 40 miles of gathering in. There are two CPFs that are operating with eight tank batteries. And then in August and September, we've got our third CPF coming in \u2013 coming on in August, fourth and fifth in September, as well as a connection to the south. And so what we've said is, our volumes are \u2013 we're currently producing about 60 million a day net to Apache. You're going to see that grow to 100 by September. And you're going to see the liquids ratio grow as well, especially as we start to bring on more NGLs. So a lot of exciting things. We only had 11 wells on in the quarter, and really five of those have been constrained. So we're really, really just getting started. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got you. Got you. And then, just in terms of \u2013 you talked about by year-end getting to six CPFs. What type of productive capacity do you get from six CPFs? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: We've said that we're going to be bringing on these CPFs in increments, 50 million to 100 million a day. They're all going to be able to be incrementally added. So what we've done is given you volume forecast and guidance. Right now, we are constrained, but we hope to resolve that as we catch up, as these things come on in the next couple of months. And then, from there, we hope to have more capacity than we'll have volumes. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got you. And just my follow-up is just in Egypt, what is your plan to explore on some of the new licensed acreage that you've received, I think, earlier this year? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: It's going to \u2013 it depends on the timing. Right now, as we've said, we're shooting a brand new high-res 3-D across our existing acreage. And as well, we'll be shooting the new permits as soon as we get the final documents signed. Everything's approved. We're just waiting on the final documents. So that should happen here pretty soon. We'll get started on the seismic in this fall, and we could potentially drill our first well this fall. We see a lot of low-hanging fruit, and we're very, very excited about the potential. I mean, they're very large concessions. We know a lot about them. And \u2013 I mean, they're going to be a real, real shot in the arm. You got to go back to over 10 years since we've had two new concessions. Not anything of this size either, so it's going to be a real shot in the arm for our Egypt production, maybe late this year, most likely as you start to go into 2018, 2019, and beyond. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right, good afternoon. John, could you talk about \u2013 do you guys have a definitive timeline as far as when we'll get more clarity around the potential resource at Alpine High? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: David, as we've said, we're ramping up most of our wells, like the wells we disclosed on the last earnings call. We cleaned them up and shut them in. Most wells have been waiting. We've got \u2013 as Tim said in his notes, we've got a lot of wells waiting on the infrastructure. Now that we have the facilities and things, it doesn't make a lot of sense to be flaring volumes and things. And so, as we bring more things on, I think you're going to continue to see a lot of data coming. And when we get to a point that it makes sense to talk more definitively, what we really want to do is get the processing facilities lined out, get more time behind the wells, continue with our optimization work, and at some point, we'll come back with something very meaningful and very definitive. But I think what we've continued to state is that we feel very, very good that we have more than 3,000 wet gas locations. Your best EURs would be to look at what we disclosed at Barclays almost a year ago. And now we said with the two Wolfcamp wells that are, by the way, in two different zones in the Wolfcamp, in a significant distance between those wells, we feel very confident now that we have hundreds of locations in the Wolfcamp, so \u2013 that will be oil locations. And \u2013 so we'll come back as we get more data. We're really just getting started with our infrastructure and being able to bring things on and produce them into ideal production situations. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. I think \u2013 let me just stay with Alpine High then. Midstream, future funding, there's been a lot of talk about whether you sell it, whether you bring a partner in, whether you're going to go out alone. Any additional color you can give us on that? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, I think what you've seen is this year we had an outspend on our infrastructure side and now we've more than covered that. As we look at 2018, we \u2013 the 2018 budget had originally looked at $55 as a price target. We've said that there are lots of options we have on that. Our spend in 2018 is planned around $500 million. We're probably going to pull some of that into this year as we stated within our $3.1 billion budget. So we feel very comfortable that we're going to be able to handle that funding without having to stress the balance sheet, issue equity, or really put ourselves in a bind. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right, thanks. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jeoffrey Lambujon with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Good afternoon, thanks. In the Alpine High, specifically on the oil zone test, I realize that it's early. But can you speak to your initial thoughts on the deposition of both the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring across your position? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: It's going be very similar, the parasequences. So they were laid down at a time when you had very rapidly rising sea level. And so there is some discontinuity in them just like there is in all of the Delaware Basin, so very similar. And so you've got a lot of mixed things in there. But we're very excited about what we've got. And these two wells are going to perform very similar to the other wells in the Delaware Basin. Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Great. And then staying in the Alpine High but on optimized completions, can you give us some detail on what you're testing, when we can expect to hear more, and what early indications you have, if any? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: When we talk about optimization, there's really a lot of things. It involves targeting, spacing tests, pattern tests, landing zone, lateral length, the orientation, and in the completion design. And even in the completion design, you've got your fluids in terms of your volumes, your sand concentrations, the stages, clusters, everything. So we have begun the optimization process. We've actually had 11 wells into the system at the end of the quarter. As we bring more in, clearly we're going about it very methodically like we have the whole play. And as we get to points where we draw some conclusions, we'll start to make those more clear. But we're doing a lot of things. We've got some longer laterals. We've got some larger fracs, targeting, azimuth, everything. Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good afternoon. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Hey, Brian. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: A couple follow-ups on the capital allocation question. When you say moderate outspend for the near term, can you add more color on the length and threshold for that outspending? And I guess relatedly, if Alpine High midstream is where you see the outspend happening, when does the midstream achieve critical mass, and then when would we expect the outspend to end? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: When we think about \u2013 right now we're just talking 2017 and 2018 is what we've been looking at. So if you look at 2017 and 2018, that would be that time period. I think the important thing with our infrastructure at Alpine High is it's going reach a critical mass where we really believe middle of next year we could be in a position to start to monetize a portion of it or do something there. So we'll look at 2018 as we start to roll into \u2013 later this year or early next year, we'll start to give another look into 2018 and beyond. But we're looking right now at 2018. The other thing I'll say about 2018 as our original budget had it \u2013 which is really flat activity to this year, had a $55 deck in there. $5 in oil price means about $350 million of cash flow to us. And so we see we have a lot of flexibility with our program. One, we can reduce activity. Two, if we really are in a sub-$55 world next year, then our cost structure is going be lower than what we have in that budget. So there will be the ability to get more for that activity set. I think we've shown this year we can do some non-material asset sales, which I would not put the strategic exit from Canada in that bucket. I've touched on the Alpine High midstream, and then we also have a very nice $1.7 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thank you. And then switching to the Alpine High Wolfcamp oil well, the first well that you announced where you talked about 1,000 BOE a day, it looks like that would imply about 700 barrels a day of oil in the first month, and then about 350 to 360 barrels a day for the remainder of the 75 days. I just wanted to check in on both your expectations for well costs for these wells and then if these rates are in line with your type curve and what rates you're looking for from the next batch of wells. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: It looks really good. I think the thing we'll say, number one, it's approximately 4,500 foot lateral. It has come on 70% oil. And the 30-day average is actually greater than 1,000 BOEs a day, and it did produce 37,000 barrels of oil in the first 75 days. A lot of the research this morning has come out tagging that as BOE, which is not correct. Very typical profile to a lot of the other Delaware wells. Good charge. We'll have more water than we'll have in our resource zones in the Woodford, Barnett to pin, so it's going to be very typical characteristics and very, very strong profile, and performing very, very well. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company LLC : Good afternoon, John, to you and the rest of your team there. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Hi, Charles. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company LLC : Thank you. You guys have fielded a lot of Alpine High questions, so I'm going to go a slightly different direction. I think you \u2013 perhaps Tim hinted at this in some of his earlier comments. When I look at the wells you guys have drilled already, you've drilled 1-mile laterals with a significantly lower completed well cost than your peers have been delivering in the area. But I think what I heard is that going forward, at least in the back half of 2017, you guys are going be going after longer laterals which presumably will have some higher completed well costs. And I wonder if you could characterize for us where you think you are on your optimization of your well design and your completion time design for those Midland Basin wells. Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Charles, what we've been doing primarily is we've been drilling mile laterals in our three core focus areas; Wildfire, Powell, and Azalea. If you go back to 2016, we changed our completions dramatically since then. And one thing I might note though, if you look at our completed costs from 2016 to today on those mile laterals, our completed well costs have remained relatively unchanged at about $4.5 million. And a lot of that has been the conversion from drilling one-offs to going to pad drilling and getting the efficiencies obviously from batch drilling and the savings that we see there. Going forward, we've got about 30 wells. We've got about five different pads that we anticipate we're going bring online in the second half, and most of those are going be mile and a half type laterals. And we are still doing a little bit of spacing testing and landing zone testing along with this development drilling that we're doing as well. So the completions are still \u2013 we're still working on them, and every area is a little bit different, so I don't think we'll ever get to one completion design that will be standardized across the entire play. It's going be tailored to the type of rock that we've got at each field that we have. So it's something that we will continue to optimize, and we'll really never be done with that process. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company LLC : Okay, thank you for that, Tim. And then if I could ask a question about the North Sea, and you had those impressive well results with Callater. And I'm wondering if you can guide our expectations a bit with respect to North Sea results going forward. Should we look at Callater and particularly at the idea that this most impressive well was on offset fault block? Should we be looking for more sorts of results like this, or is this a one-off sort of thing that we ought not look for a repeat? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Callater is a well we disclosed in 2015. It was a new discovery. There will be some offsets. We announced another fault block there with that, so we're very excited about the area. I think the best thing to do in terms of forecast is just look at what we've guided to, Charles. I mean, we've had this well planned in and this development baked in. It's really a function of the exploration program. We've had a series of announced discoveries over the last couple of years that are in the queue to be coming on in the future, and Callater is kind of in the first of those that we're tying in, in 2017, so... Operator : Our next question is from the line of Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe I'll bring it back to the Alpine High. And maybe I missed it, but when do you guys expect to reveal the larger development plan you discussed in the call? Is it \u2013 is that in connection with the 2018 CapEx budget? And if there's no specific date, what still needs to happen there before you feel confident in that plan? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, we feel confident in the plan, Evan. I mean, obviously, we gave guidance this year for a two-year look. We've given you a 2018 4Q exit rate, and we didn't touch any of those numbers this quarter. In fact, didn't really touch our guidance at all, other than adjusting for Canada. So we have a plan that we're working on. We're always updating it with new data. We've still got a lot of areas we are testing and bringing things in, but we have a base plan and we gave you a two-year look at it this year. Obviously, we'll choose as we're phasing in and bringing things on. We've said we're at 60 million a day net today, and we'll be north of 100 million in September. And as we get more color and continue, we'll come at it sometime in the future and give you a longer look. But we gave you a good two-year look, and for now, we have a lot of confidence in that. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And maybe to follow up on that, the 100 million guide, can you walk us through how that estimate is billed? Meaning, how many wells are connected and what percentage of them will be on constrained flow because it's harder to \u2013 it's harder to kind of model for us? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: The better thing to do is look at the numbers we gave you and run off of those, because we've gone end of the first \u2013 end of the second quarter we had 11 wells on and five of them are constrained. And we should get to a point where we don't have constrained wells as we get these next three CPFs up over the August and September timeframe. But we haven't given an absolute well count, as that's dynamic. But what we have given you is ranges, Evan. And we said, in June we produced 7,400 barrels of oil equivalent a day net. It's not gross; that's net. And it was 10% liquids, and almost all of that was oil. And the liquids ratio is going to grow as the volume grows in the future. Operator : Our next question is from the line of James Sullivan with Alembic Global Advisors. James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Hey. Good morning \u2013 good afternoon, guys, there. I just wanted to go back to that Wolfcamp oil well real quick. You talked, John, about there being a nice charge in that well there, and a couple of comments on the overpressure there. Could you just talk about how you released that well, I mean, in terms of initial chokes and how you were kind of letting it out there? Any color you can give on that would be great. And on pressure drawdowns, too. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: It's just a very, very strong well. We've flown it back naturally, and there is a sub pump in there today. And it's very typical to the other wells we have and the other areas of the Delaware Basin. James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Okay. Great. Sounds good. Just on \u2013 over to the North Sea real quick, you guys did the turnaround over there. Can you quantify the amount of volume that was offline there for the quarter? Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: For the second quarter, it was just under 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. That was offline. Some of that turnaround got pushed into the third quarter. So we'll see some downtime from turnarounds in the third quarter as well. James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Okay. And then Q4 will be more like your run rate? Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Correct. James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Great, thanks so much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Thanks. I guess just a couple on my end. As it relates to the DUCs and wells waiting on infrastructure and just I guess general backlog in the Alpine High, how many of those at present are currently in the oilier zone? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Yeah. Right now, Michael, we've got a mix. We haven't given breakdowns on that. You've got a range, some of those are going be wet gas wells. Some of them are going to be \u2013 there's a few we've got several that are in flow-back. So it will be a mix kind of like we have across our play. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Okay. But specific to the Wolfcamp or Bone Spring, you don't, by chance, have that available? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: There's going be more than two, and I'll just say that. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Okay, fair enough. And then I guess the other was just still on the Permian, but higher level. I was just curious when you guys think you'll see oil volumes in the Permian turn around? They've been obviously on decline, but you've got a big back-half ramp that you've outlined. Do you think we'll see sequential growth in oil volumes in the third quarter or how should we think about that? Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Yeah. So, we have turned the corner now on growth, not only in international and in North America, but just on North \u2013 our Permian oil growth will be \u2013 continually grow quarter-after-quarter. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Good afternoon. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Hey, Jeff. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Hey, John. In the Permian Basin, many producers are moving towards completing all the locations of a given zone or maybe even several zones and wants to avoid well interference and enhance efficiencies. I was just wondering what is your completion approach as you're increasingly focusing on drilling more wells and zones per pad. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: That's a novel idea. We've always talked about \u2013 ultimately you do your testing, so you can get to pad development, and that is the optimal way to do that. So you want to get in the pads where you can develop the rock and produce it in the best way, shape or form. So it's exactly the approach we're taking. That's \u2013 we've got some 10, 11 well pads coming on later this year in Midland Basin. So I mean it's clearly the direction you want to go with all of it. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And my other question is in Egypt. With the large increase in acreage, how will you allocate capital there over the next year or two? I mean, obviously you're having great success in the areas where you have concentrated operations. So I'm just wondering how will exploration spend on the new acreage look relative to the spending as a whole. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: It's probably going be pretty similar to how it's been. I mean, we drill quite a few exploration wells in Egypt every year anyways. So as Egypt continues to generate more free cash flow, potentially you could see more capital. But we're not going to change philosophically how we're thinking about that. But it's an exciting place. I mean, I think we're going to find ourselves with better \u2013 some pretty strong deliverability things, much like Ptah and Berenice have been over the last couple of years. So a lot of low-hanging fruit that should help us with volumes and also with the ability to generate more free cash flow and also reinvest more. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our last question is from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, everybody. Good afternoon and thank you for getting me on, John. John, you guys are... John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Only for you, Doug. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I'm trying to take advantage of you a little bit here, John, because you're uniquely qualified with your background and your vertical well inventory for the history of Apache to really opine on this issue that, I guess, Bob brought up earlier. Obviously, sector is getting annihilated in the back of this GOR issue. So I'm wondering if you could take just a little bit of time and just maybe do the market a favor and explain what you meant by the type curve or the gas breakout, the GOR has not changed adverse to your expectations. And what I'm getting at is the difference between the pressure drawdown in the vertical versus the pressure drawdown in the horizontal. What are you seeing there? Is there anything different in the oil recovery in your Midland Basin wells versus what you expected and versus what you've planned on based on that vertical well history? Because there seems to be a little bit of a panic going on that this is actually a deterioration of oil recovery as opposed to an enhancement of gas and NGL recovery. Could I ask you to... John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: I'll say a few things. Number one, we've always forecasted our oil and gas streams separately. Like \u2013 I mean, it's just fundamental petroleum engineering. Anybody forecasting BOE curves and you've got changing dynamics out there you have to model it. I mean, it's like anything else though, Doug. You do your core work, you do your fluid analysis, you look at your pressure and temperature data. And we can model that. We've got a lot of history and we do a lot of time modeling that. And so our wells are producing and \u2013 as our type curves are laid out. And we have not had any surprises in terms of the forecasted volumes with how they are performing. Areas behave differently. And if we go back to some of our earlier areas where we drilled some wells in 2010 and 2011, they were in a little less mature area, a little higher GORs, they're going to behave differently. We've got a lot of history and have a deep understanding of how this works. And so we're not surprised by the GORs and you have to examine those very carefully. And \u2013 but every rock, every area, the rocks will differ depending on the play, and that's why it takes time to collect the data properly, do the core work, do the fluid work, do the pressure work and create your material balance just like you would in conventional rock. But there's a difference. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I appreciate that. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: There's just a real difference between how conventional and unconventional reservoirs behave and there's a difference how they behave over time. And you'll see contribution from different types of the fabric as it goes forward. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So just to be clear, I know we're out of time here. So if I could just add two quick pieces to that, one is, related to that, the vertical pressure drawdown versus a horizontal pressure drawdown, would you concur with the idea that the horizontal is getting the gas breakout quicker but not changing the material balance? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: I wouldn't say that rock is going to drawdown and break out exactly how it's exposed to the surface. So that's just a function of temperature and pressure and the drawdown. The orientation of the well isn't going to have as big of an impact as just how the rock is going to behave under pressure and temperature and how the makeup of it is. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And my last one is more Apache-specific. What do you need to see to declare a broader oil inventory in the Alpine High? Obviously, you've given another couple of wells today. And if I may, when that happens, I assume it's going to happen at some point, would it change your targeting on how your initial development plan versus \u2013 oil versus gas? And I'll leave it there. Thank you. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: I'd say any incremental well, obviously, you tweak your plans as you go through it. You'll see more from us as we bring more wells out. We've had 11 wells on the end of June, half of them, or five of them were flowing constrained. We've just got a lot of data coming over the next couple of quarters. But it's very exciting. We're going to be very deliberate on what we disclose. We're not going to come out with big location counts unless we're confident in those location counts. And there's a lot of rock to test even in our parasequence zones. So there's a lot of exciting things. We've got a big thick column, 5,000 feet of hydrocarbons over a 65-mile area down there, and a lot of rock to work with, so you're going to see a lot more locations coming out of us in the future. Operator : And that does conclude the Q&A portion of this call today. Thank you for your participation. Ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect.",

Morgan Doug Leggate - Bank of America Michael Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors Michael McAllister - MUFG Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Jennifer and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gary Clark. Sir, you may begin. Gary Clark : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's third quarter 2017 financial and operational results conference call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann; Executive Vice President of Operations Support, Tim Sullivan; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Steve Riney. In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our third quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. On today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. I will now turn the call over to John. John Christmann : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will discuss third quarter results and accomplishments, comment on our Midland basin oil production and development program, recap some of the key Alpine High points from last month's webcast and provide an update on our 2018 planning process and current thinking around commodity price assumptions. Beginning with the third quarter, as anticipated, our average daily net production in the US returned to a growth trajectory. We also grew net production in the North Sea and gross production in Egypt. Production was in line with our guidance with notably strong performance in Permian oil volumes. We stated in our webcast update last month that we expect this performance to carry through into the fourth quarter with Midland and Delaware oil production tracking at the high end of the guidance range, established back in February. As we also noted, the delayed start-up of two central processing facilities at Alpine High caused by Hurricane Harvey will defer some natural gas volumes into 2018. So, our updated fourth quarter production guidance is unchanged. In the Midland and Delaware basins, we are benefiting today from the strategic testing, optimization and development planning initiatives that we implemented in 2015 and 2016, while running a very lean capital program. Going forward, we anticipate continued capital efficiency gains in both the Midland and Delaware basins. This is particularly true at Alpine High, as we move further into multi-well pad development, continue to extend average lateral length, utilize more smart completions and further optimize our landing zone targeting and well spacing. The majority of optimization benefits, which have been proven in other unconventional plays are still ahead of us at Alpine High. On the international side, cash flow generation during the third quarter was strong once again, as both Egypt and the North Sea benefited from improving Brent crude prices and production from our Callater startup in the North Sea. Overall, capital investment was in line with expectations and remains on track with our guidance for the full year. We have shifted some capital in the back half of 2017 from our international regions into the US to take advantage of attractive portfolio opportunities in the Permian Basin. Finally, we continue to benefit from our cost structure focus with both LOE per BOE and G&A costs remaining low as a result of the significant rationalization efforts over the last two years. Apache also made some excellent progress this quarter with regard to its portfolio transition. Specifically, the discovery of Alpine High enabled our strategic exit from Canada. In only one short year, we will have completely replaced our Canadian production and we will have done so with an asset that offers significant returns and is only just beginning to show its enormous long term potential. Value creation and returns accretion were challenged in Canada, given this low ratio of cash margins to F&D cost. Alpine High on the other hand will have significantly lower F&D costs, much more attractive cash margins and will transform Apache's long term return on capital employed profile. Organic portfolio transformations like this take time, but are much more accretive to returns than acquiring high priced proved acreage positions. I will now turn to the Midland Basin where activity is primarily focused on multi-well pad drilling to the Wolfcamp and Spraberry formations. Our third quarter oil production was up approximately 5,500 barrels per day over the second quarter, as we are delivering excellent results from recent multi-well pads in our core areas. We will continue to progress our development efforts with two more pads coming online before year end. Our focus in the Midland basin is on multi-well pads and full field development. We believe the proper approach to an unconventional resource has developed each section in a way that optimizes long term value and returns. This requires a full understanding of intra-well dynamics and proper spacing in order to design development patterns that optimize costs and recovery. Additionally, Apache utilizes a fully burdened returns approach, which should give you confidence that the anticipated returns will result in a competitive return on capital employed at the corporate level. Tim will share more details on the impressive progress we have made in our Midland basin development efforts. Next I would like to move to Alpine High and reiterate a few of the key points made in last month's webcast. First, Alpine High consists of three primary plays, a highly economic wet gas play that contains the majority of our currently identified locations, a dry gas play that is smaller, but very economic and an emerging oil play with tremendous future potential. Second, we increased our location count from 3000 to more than 5000, which consists of at least 3500 locations in the wet gas play, at least 1000 locations in the dry gas play and more than 500 locations in the oil play. As we have previously discussed, we believe there is significant upside potential to all of these location counts. Third, 90% of our currently disclosed locations are in the highly predictable and repeatable transgressive source interval, which consists of the Woodford, Barnett and Penn formations. Being a true source interval, there is minimal in situ water that will be produced with the hydrocarbons. Water handling and disposal costs are becoming a significant challenge across the Delaware Basin and this will only get more difficult in the future. We are fortunate to not have this problem in the transgressive source interval. Fourth, returns of Alpine High are driven by the combination of extremely low development costs with attractive cash margins. Recent wells have validated our assumptions on future drilling and completion costs. Cash margins will be attractive due to the high quality liquid content and the low operating costs. Lastly, we are very pleased with the performance of the wells of Alpine High, many of which have been producing now for several months. Cumulative production data is confirming our expectations for this high quality rock, which was predicated on extensive geologic, geophysical and reservoir engineering work. Our investment economics are robust for all three plays at current or lower commodity prices and are consistent with those presented more than a year ago. Next, I'd like to discuss the process we are undertaking as we finalize our 2018 plans. Since the beginning of 2015, we have operated Apache with a fundamental belief that over a typical run of years, it is both possible and appropriate for an E&P company to live within operating cash flows. Within cash flow, a company should be capable of growing production volumes and delivering competitive rates of return above its cost of capital, while also increasing return of capital to shareholders through dividends and/or share buybacks. We have taken a number of transformative steps over the last three years, designed to enable this vision, irrespective of the oil and gas price environment. We streamlined our portfolio and strategically shifted our asset base, reset our overhead and operating cost structure, dramatically reduced our capital investment program from mid-2015 through 2016 to live within cash flow, implemented a rigorous capital allocation process based on fully burdened returns as opposed to fundamentally flawed half cycle economics and reduced debt and preserved our dividend without issuing equity and diluting our shareholders' future ownership. Recently, we have been on the road meeting with shareholders and other long term oriented potential investors. Encouragingly, the market sentiment is becoming more aligned with Apache's philosophy. For most of the last three years, the E&P industry has been engaged in excess spending to drive short term oil growth. Today, we are seeing a return to the fundamentals of capital discipline and focus on long term returns. We welcome this change and believe it is very constructive for the long term health of our industry. So as Apache enters the 2018 planning season, we are experiencing some natural, but very positive short term budget tension. That is, do we continue investing in our attractive Permian upstream opportunities at what we consider to be the optimal pace for delivering the long term returns or do we pare back and manage the program for cash flow neutrality. That is a nice problem to have and as an expected outcome of discovering and bringing into development a large low cost new play. We believe Alpine High is a compelling world-class resource. Once ramped to its production potential, Apache will benefit for decades from high returns and free cash flow from a significant portion of our future capital employed. Given the dynamic nature of our opportunity set and the volatile commodity price environment, our 2018 capital budget is still being rigorously worked. Consistent with previous years, we will issue our 2018 budget and associated guidance in conjunction with our fourth quarter earnings results in February. As we have in each of the past three years, we will base our 2018 plan on benchmark pricing that is slightly on the conservative side of the prevailing strip. Given the recent volatility in oil prices, this means we are preparing for a number of possible scenarios. Fortunately, we have considerable portfolio flexibility. Our focus now is prioritizing next year's activity and identifying areas where the capital program could be pared back. While spending could be lower in 2019, the allocation of capital across the portfolio would likely be very similar to 2017 with Permian Basin investment representing the majority of Apache's capital program. Internationally, we will continue to invest to maintain current levels of free cash flow. At recent oil and gas prices, this spend is in the $700 million to $900 million range. In 2018, we will also continue to fund the Alpine High midstream buildout as this is strategically important to enable an optimized upstream development program. As we have stated previously, we believe this represents a very attractive investment opportunity and are continuing to review its monetization potential. Finally, like in 2017, we have begun a program of hedging for 2018 and '19. This activity is focused on protecting cash flows to support our near term capital program. Steve will talk more about the details in his prepared remarks. To sum up, the third quarter was important for Apache as it marked our strategic exit from Canada, the very early stage acceleration of production at Alpine High and a significant turn in our Permian Basin oil production. We're making excellent progress across the company. As the Permian region grows in relative scale with our portfolio, the quality of its returns and cash flows will improve those of Apache as a whole. Our teams have created a deep inventory of investment opportunities, both domestically and internationally. As we have over the past three years, we will fund these opportunities in a disciplined manner that in no way stresses our balance sheet. We look forward to discussing our plan further in February when we will provide a review of our operating cash flow, capital spending and production outlook for 2018, a higher level preliminary outlook for 2019 and potentially beyond, a longer term view into how the investments we're making today will improve long term corporate level returns and free cash flow and a more detailed view into Alpine High for both the upstream and the midstream. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Tim who will provide some operational highlights. Tim Sullivan : Good afternoon. My remarks today will cover operational activity and key wells in our US and international focus areas and their impact as we plan for 2018 and subsequent years. Our third quarter production results reflect the ramp up in drilling activity Apache began at the end of last year. We have shifted to a growth trajectory and are benefiting from the fiscal discipline and returns focused drilling programs that we initiated in 2015. During the third quarter, we maintained activity at a measured pace, averaging 36 operated rigs worldwide with 17 in the Permian, 4 in other North American areas, 12 in Egypt and 3 in the North Sea. In North America, third quarter 2017 adjusted production average 207,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 7% from the second quarter. Please note these volumes exclude Canada, where we completed our country exit during the period. With the success of our Midland basin drilling program and the continued production ramp at Alpine High, third quarter oil production increased 8% quarter to quarter. Our core Midland Basin assets are the primary contributor to these higher oil volumes. At our Wildfire field in Midland County, we completed seven wells with mile and a half laterals at the June tippet-12/13 pad. The pad comprises four completions in the lower Spraberry with twelve by spacing and three completions in the Wolfcamp B on six by spacing. These wells achieved an average 30-day peak initial production rate of 1058 BOE and fifty per day, producing 83% oil. Also in the Wildfire field, on the Lynch A unit, we drilled a six well lower Spraberry pad, also with 12 by spacing. The wells were drilled with a mile and a half long laterals and average a 30-day peak IP rate of 1142 BOE per day, producing 85% oil. At the Powell field in Upton County, we drilled the CC4045, a six well pad with two mile laterals on 12 by spacing staggered in the Wolfcamp B1 and B3 formations. These wells have been online for about four weeks and are trending toward an average 30-day peak IP rate of 1300 BOE per day with 80% oil. We plan to drill three additional wells on this pad in early 2018. These excellent Midland Basin well results are reflective of our integrated approach to determine optimal landing zones, pattern spacing, lateral length and completion design. At Alpine High, net sales to Apache averaged 13300 BOE per day during the third quarter. As we noted in our webcast last month, we began our fourth quarter, producing at a rate of 20,300 BOE per day and assuming this start-up of the Hidalgo CPF by the end of the year, we anticipate achieving production of approximately 25,000 BOE per day. We continue to make good progress on drilling, completion and cost optimization at Alpine High. We recently drilled and completed three wells with an average lateral length of approximately 4500 feet and for an average cost of $5.5 million. We remain very confident that in our development, we will be able to achieve completed well costs in the range of $4 million to $6 million, which is consistent with the economics we put forward when we announced the play last year. I'll turn now to our international assets. Gross production in Egypt increased slightly to 339,000 BOE per day. Adjusted production in Egypt which excludes minority interest and the impact of tax barrels decreased slightly from the second quarter 2017 to 87,000 BOE per day. The decrease in adjusted production reflects the terms of our production sharing contracts in Egypt, which generally provide for fewer cost recovery barrels to the contractor as the price of Brent index crude oil increases. In the North Sea, production increased 9% from the second quarter to 60,000 BOE per day. Net production from the Callater field is currently averaging approximately 14,000 BOE per day from two wells. A third well, the CB1, was recently drilled into a new fault block and found more than 260 foot of net pay. This well is expected to come online later this month. Please see our financial and operational supplement posted today for more information on drilling and production activity during the third quarter in our US and international regions. I'll now turn the call over to Steve. Steve Riney : Thank you, Tim and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I will begin with a brief review of our third quarter financial results, comment on our infrastructure build out and future midstream plans at Alpine High, provide some additional color on certain Alpine High economic assumptions behind our webcast last month and lastly I will update our hedge positions and the continuing strength of our financial position. Let me begin with third quarter financial results. As noted in our press release, Apache reported net income of $63 million or $0.16 per diluted common share. Results for the quarter include a number of items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates. The after tax values of some of the more material items are a $219 million gain related to recent divestitures, $104 million of unproved acreage impairments and a $54 million unrealized mark-to-market loss on our commodity price derivative positions. Excluding these and other similar items, our adjusted earnings for the quarter was $14 million or $0.04 per share. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $554 million. Before working capital changes, Apache generated $655 million in operating cash flow. During the third quarter, we completed non-core asset sales in the US and Canada for net cash proceeds of $693 million. Our cash position on September 30, including a small amount of restricted cash, was $1.9 billion, up from $1.7 billion the previous quarter. Lease operating expenses in the third quarter were $8.74 per barrel of oil equivalent, down slightly from the prior quarter. Our year to date LOE was $8.42 per barrel of oil equivalent, which is in line with our guidance for the full year of $8.25 to $8.75 per BOE. Exploration expense in the third quarter was $231 million. $198 million of this was attributable to dry hole expense and unproved leasehold impairments. The primary contributors to dry hole expense this quarter were the previously mentioned well in the barrel area of the North Sea along with some exploration wells in Egypt. Unproved impairment costs were primarily related to acreage in the Anadarko Basin. These were legacy acreage positions, which based on the success of Alpine High will clearly never compete for further exploration funding. Our October 9 webcast included a review of the progress we have made on our Alpine High midstream buildout. As John mentioned, we are investing in a large infrastructure system that will make for an extremely attractive midstream enterprise. Our board recently approved plans to install a first phase of cryogenic processing in Alpine High. This decision was taken for three primary reasons. Most importantly, we believe the incremental cost of cryo processing will be economic in the future. Secondly, having at least some cryo capacity significantly enhances the reliability of processing the extremely rich gas to assure we meet sales pipeline spec and finally cryo processing capacity will enhance the value of the midstream enterprise and product marketing by introducing optionality for the product stream. We will begin by installing 200 million cubic feet per day of cryo capacity, which will come online in 2019. Future increments of additional capacity will be treated as independent decisions and will have to be economically justified based on the then prevailing price outlook for gas and NGLs. To eliminate any potential confusion, let me be clear that this investment is already embedded in our current $500 million Alpine High Midstream capital plans for 2018. Note also that this Midstream spend may be pared back when we finalize our 2018 budget. Next, I would like to discuss some questions that have come up related to the economic assumptions for Alpine High that were set forth in last month's webcast. One of these questions is about how we arrived at our estimated average NGL realization of 60% of WTI. To begin with, I should clarify that this realization is before third-party transportation and fractionation costs. As such, you need to subtract these costs to arrive at a net realization to Apache at the least. Given we are currently trucking NGLs from our processing facilities, these costs are around $10 per barrel. In the future, with full pipe transport, these costs will be closer to $7 per barrel. At current Mont Belvieu pricing and assuming cryo recovery, over 90% of anticipated Alpine High NGL barrels would be priced in a range from 55% to 60% of WTI. Based on some of our future pricing assumptions, average NGL realizations could be as high as 70% of WTI. I would also note that the mechanical refrigeration units we currently use for processing leave most of the ethane in the gas stream. As a result, our NGL barrels today are receiving close to 75% of WTI before transportation and fractionation. Another question we have received is around our long term Waha basis differential assumption of $0.35 per million BTUs. Waha basis has ranged from a $0.37 to $0.53 discount to Henry Hub in the last six months. Prior to that, from 2010 through 2016, that same Waha basis differential range from a $0.69 discount to a $0.42 premium and averaged around $0.15 discount. The forward market view on Waha basis reflects a significant widening of the differential as anticipated production volumes would test takeaway capacity. We see this as a relatively short term risk before additional transport capacity comes online, most likely in 2019. For the long term, we believe Waha basis will trade in a lower range. Moving now to hedging, we have added some crude oil and natural gas hedges through a mix of financial derivative instruments. As a reminder, the primary goal of our hedging activity is to protect the pace of a strategically important capital program at Alpine High against the risks associated with price sensitivity on cash flows. This continues to be the case as we look to 2018. We do not use hedging to speculate on price. For 2018, we have currently hedged an average of 55,000 barrels per day in aggregate of WTI and Brent based oil production volumes through a variety of instruments. On the gas side, we have entered into a series of swap transactions that lock in average 2018 pricing at $3.07 per million BTUs for average volumes of 237 million BTUs per day. We have also entered into hedge positions relative to Waha basis. Most of these hedges are focused on production for the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019. For this four quarter time period, through a series of swap transactions, we have locked in an average basis differential of a $0.52 discount for 207 million BTUs per day of production. We also have some contractual hedges for Waha basis, which access non Waha based pricing through transportation and sales contracts. A couple of things to note. First, the actual volumes and pricing of product hedged differs from quarter to quarter. What I gave you were averages for the time periods described. Second, our hedge positions represent only a portion of our anticipated production for any given quarter. They should not be construed to give any guidance as to future production volumes. The details on all of our current hedge positions for the remainder of 2017 and the full years 2018 and 2019 can be seen in our financial and operational supplement posted on our website today with the quarterly earnings press release. I would like to conclude by emphasizing Apache's financial strength and quarter end cash position of nearly $1.9 billion. This is a product of our disciplined approach over the last few years. Looking ahead, we are well prepared for continued volatility in commodity prices. Our hedge positions provide cash flow support to assure the deployment of high priority investments without putting the balance sheet at risk. We also have the ability to flex the capital program if that proves to be the best decision for our shareholders. With regard to our capital investment plans, we are carefully weighing the balance between achieving cash flow neutrality and the desire to move forward with investments in 2018 that will optimize long term returns from our asset base. Throughout this effort, we focus on investments that will deliver full cycle economics at current or even lower commodity prices. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our fresh question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein. Bob Brackett : A question on the US rig program. It looks like you've got four rigs running outside the Permian. Can you talk about what they're doing and would you expect those rigs to be running next year. Tim Sullivan : Good afternoon, Bob. No, we've got one section in the scoop, where we've had three rigs running there. There are seven wells we're drilling. They will finish up year end and then they will - that's where they'll stop for now. And then in the Panhandle, we've got some acreage that we got two rigs in quickly that are going to get in and drill some footage before year end, the whole block of acreage there. So they're just purely picking up some acreage retention. Bob Brackett : And can you think about next year? I know you don't want to give a specific guidance. Can you just give us some idea of where the levers are? What assets have the most flexibility to dial up CapEx or dial down CapEx? Tim Sullivan : I mean if you look at the program, we're in really good shape. I mean we've given you the kind of the range. International is going to be pretty similar in the 700 to 900 range. That's where we can sustain our ability to generate good strong free cash flow there. You look at the rest of the rigs predominantly, we're sitting in the Permian with both our Midland basin and Alpine High and we will have the flexibility to flex there either directions. So we've got a lot of flexibility and you'd see it kind of generally across the Permian. Bob Brackett : So I guess Alpine High where there are still optionality around retaining acreage might be the least flexible, but everything else has the ability to dial up and down? Tim Sullivan : Well, even in Alpine High, we've got good flexibility in there. We don't need - we've got six rigs running there today. We would not need all six of those. I mean the nice thing about Alpine High is a lot of that land and we've got some very astute royalty owners with some very large ranches and they recognize that the best way to maximize value for them and us is alignment on how you would handle that. So it's not like we've got a section by section program, where we've got to go out and drill one well across the whole portfolio. So, we've got a lot of flexibility and that count can be scaled up or down pretty easily as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Societe Generale. John Herrlin : Two for me. With the Midland drilling, you were doing 6 to 7 well pads, is that going to be kind of the norm going forward and then the next one for me is on hedging. What's the maximum amount that you will set volumetrically Steve? John Christmann : So on the pads, John, as you know we've been pretty vocal that you need to be developing all your areas on a section basis. So these have been designed and we've got a couple more pads coming on between now and the end of year. They've been doing our adequate spacing and pattern tests. So that's why there are no half sections, we're kind of doing a half section test pad. So that's what you've had going on in the Midland and it's really defined tune exactly the pattern and the spacing between the various landing zones that we say. Hedging, I'll let Steve. Steve Riney : John, the question on hedging was what's the maximum volume we would hedge? John Herrlin : Yeah. Steve Riney : So we don't - we haven't really thought about what the maximum volume at this point in time. We've hedged - we've begun the hedging process. So I think you got to go back to first of all what's the purpose of hedging and why do we do it. We generally like commodity price exposure that's the business that we're in and we prefer to have it. We hedge for purposes of protecting the capital program against say a low price environment. We began hedging oil and gas for 2018 during the quarter. And we put the positions on that you see in the supplement. We feel like that's a good place to be right now. We feel like the oil price movement has been pretty constructive here recently and we'll continue just to monitor that and align any forward hedging program or activity. With that strategy, we want to make sure that we're protecting the balance sheet and cash flows associated with the capital program that we want to deliver. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Paul Sankey : Can I just follow up on the hedging question while we're on it and you explained that some of the force behind it. But you also have repeatedly made the point that you've been relatively cautious over the down cycle and you're going to remain I think, it sounded, let's say, cautious relative to the strip going forward. Isn't that a bit of a belt and braces guys in terms of planning the company just in terms of being both cautious on how you plan and hedged. Steve Riney : Yeah, maybe so Paul. I don't know, I've never worn belts and braces. I don't think that that's necessarily a bad thing in the price environment that we've come out of over the last couple of years in the volatility associated with it. To be a little bit cautious, a little bit conservative about what we're committing to in the capital program and the liquidity and financial capability of meeting those commitments once we've made them. [indiscernible] maybe a bit on the conservative side on doing that, yes. We've indicated the volumes that we've had for the quarters out in 2018 and Waha basis hedges for '19 as well. We haven't gotten into what is that relative to anticipated production volume. The only thing I would say is that we are below 50% of our anticipated production volume in almost every product, in almost every quarter for 2018 and definitely 2019 obviously, we don't have any commodity hedges other than the Waha basis. So we've still got a significant amount of unhedged volumes going into 2018. John Christmann : And one thing I want to add to Paul is, we've done some things to protect the upside to because we like the exposure even on the oil where we've done some collars, we've also bought the coal as well. So it's more geared towards protecting some downside and protecting the balance sheet over the short term than it is trying to make a price collar because we like actually the constructive nature, especially on the oil side. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeoffrey Lambujon with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Jeoffrey Lambujon : If the planned midstream monetization is structured, it comes with a large cash payment up front or if commodity prices are materially higher than what you end up budgeting with for next year. Can you just talk through how you'd rank your options for allocating that extra discretionary funding? John Christmann : The good news is, is with the price movements has gotten very constructive lately. And we find ourselves and can see a price now where we could actually have some free cash flow next year pretty soon. So I mean that puts you in a position to, you know, we've been a company that's maintained our dividend and actually continued to return something to the shareholders over the last three years. So obviously dividend is an option if you look at in terms of - you could be in a position of accretion. Obviously share buybacks or some acceleration, but clearly we would look to find ways to return that to shareholders. Jeoffrey Lambujon : And then just one last one, looking longer term, starting with the cash balance that you're planning to exit this year with, obviously gives you a lot of flexibility in the near-term to do - to explore some of those options you've mentioned. What does that number look like long terms, is there a steady-state cash balance you have in mind. Thanks. Steve Riney : I think the steady-state cash balances obviously quite a bit lower than $1.9 billion. We don't anticipate carrying 1.9 billion for obviously for the extended period of time into the future. We do that now because we've got for several reasons. The two most important would be, we've got some debt maturities coming up in 2018 and we want to make sure that we've got the liquidity to handle those as they come due 560 million of debt maturing next year. And then also just having that backstop of cash and liquidity in the event of downside price volatility. We are still exposed to that and we want to make sure that we've got the liquidity to protect ourselves in the event that that occurs. I think as we get Alpine High in particular, so we get to a midstream solution in Alpine High and as we get to Alpine High becoming a larger scale producing asset and is more cash flow generative and supports itself and certainly we don't need 1.9 billion of cash I would say that would be - at a sustained level of cash is certainly below $0.5 billion. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC Capital. Scott Hanold : In the Anadarko Basin, you talked about having a few rigs drilling. Is that HBP, some acreage or are you testing a specific concept. And also with the write-off in that area how does that regionally, how does that write-off compare with some of the stuff you're testing right now. John Christmann : Number one, the write-off is really legacy Anadarko Basin; it's not what we call a SCOOP stack area. So it's going to be more in the Texas panhandle, there's some hangover from the Cordillera transaction many, many years ago. So it's really more just legacy Anadarko Basin acreage have some attractive things in the future, but it's not anything we're funding or planning to fund in the near term. So that's where that is. And in the SCOOP stack, actually it's in the SCOOP area. We've got a section there that we needed to drill a well to hold, but rather than going in and drilling one well, we got in there and did seven wells because that's a proper way to do that. So we're drilling those seven wells in the in the SCOOP there to meet some lease obligations on a section that we really like. And it gives us the ability to test some spacing and things in the SCOOP as well. So kind of two birds with one stone. Scott Hanold : And just to clarify and I know you guys are still working the capital budget for '18. Are you comfortable spending a little bit in '18 to keep Alpine High up and running or have those thoughts changed at all. John Christmann : I mean I would say at this point we're looking at '18 hard. We're watching the commodity price view. We said we will come out with a plan that's kind of predicated on something slightly conservative to strip. So we're watching that very carefully. I think the good news is there's flexibility. I mean we don't have to outspend to keep Alpine High up and running so to say is the way you phrased it. But we're also looking at what we think is the right thing to do in the right pace to develop Alpine High. That we're just going to really maximize long-term returns and that's really what we're trying to accomplish. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer : A little bit of a similar take to Scott's last question, I think you posted the industry history about spending in recent years pretty well in the - this asset is the one worth outspending cash flow for a dilemma that you're facing is likely when many companies have faced over the years. To the degree do you decide to out of free cash neutrality? How do you prioritize between Permian and Alpine High, it seems like based on your comments you might flow the Permian. And is there any flexibility internationally or do those assets run in maintenance levels regardless. John Christmann : Well, it's a little bit of flexibility on the international side, but we kind of laid out that range where we'd like to stay the $700,000 to $900,000. I think there's flexibility in both places. And I'd also remind you that Alpine High is part of Permian. But there's flexibility in both. I mean you wouldn't see us flex one or the other and we're not talking a massive change from what we've laid out in February of this year anyways. That plan was going to be neutral on the upstream spend at a $55 deck and we're not far from that right now. So we're not talking about a lot that we'd have to pare back and it can be flexed into place. And so we'd look at what we thought made the most sense. And that's some of the exercises and scenarios we're running through right now. Brian Singer : And then on Alpine High, can you talk to a little bit more towards the oil zone opportunities and whether you see a scenario or a likely scenario where you see less volatility and greater predictability of well performance from those zones or should we expect the well may ultimately be perspective and may not necessarily be as consistent. John Christmann : Well, I mean I think it's just different geology. I mean that's something we've gone to great lengths to explain in terms of a source interval versus a parasequence, which is what the Wolfcamp and the Bone Springs are in the Delaware Basin. So actually if you look at the five wells we've drilled, we're very pleased with the results. Since the disclosure on October 9, we've actually had another one well in there that's cleaned up very, very nicely. So it's actually fairly predictable. We're just talking in terms of the geology. You have to get in and do your rigorous mapping. We have to do the inversion work with the seismic. I mean it's more going to be based on where the organics inside and what's really water wet rock and you have to do the detail work. But once you've done the detail work, it's going to be pretty predictable. It's just not a blanket you're going to lay across a large area. Most of the locations you know we'd came out with 500 was based on a couple of landing zones, we've in truthfulness we've added another one, so those location counts are going to go up even since the October 9 disclosure. So we see it as a very prominent program. I can tell you most of those are in the northern trough. And the good news is, with every well we drill in Alpine High, we're looking at all those sections. So we see it as a very viable and a very material play that we're going to continue to move forward. And you're going to see the number of landing zones and the location counts grow. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Morris with Citi. Bob Morris : John, you did a nice job last month of laying out the liquids and oil potential an Alpine High. And you sort of touched on this earlier in the Q&A. But you'd been working to try and renegotiate or extend a lot of your leases to be able to accelerate drilling of the shallower zones and still hold those without having to drill to the deeper gassier zones first. How is that progressing? And then, second part of that question is, is there a minimum level of activity or capital spend in 2018 to hold the acreage that you have now that you'd be able to or would want to have to maintain? John Christmann : There's two things I would say, Bob. Number one, we do have some very sophisticated land owners and we've been making great progress on our discussions with them as well. But it's not a matter of just trying to drill the shallow zones and not drill the deeper zones later. What you really want to do like anything is, you wanted to develop the sections properly and very systematically where we would develop the deeper zones and the shallow zones together where we need to do that. What you don't want to do is come back later and drill deeper after you have develop shallower or you're going to find yourself with some of the challenges that you're seeing in the other parts of the Permian. Where now they happen to run extra casing strings and things to deal with water flows because you've they're going to run extrication strange things to deal with water flows because you've because you've dealt in depletion and that sort of thing. So contrary to that one of the advantages we have at Alpine High, we've done a lot of data analytics and been recently able to eliminate even a string of seven of 58s on our 14,000 foot TVD wells. So you want to do this properly and I think the conversations we're having with the landowners are constructive and that you want to go about this in the right way where we can develop the wet gas and the oil zones and you want to do them where you don't have to go back in later. So it's more or less of you know developing everything and then margin directionally than it is trying to develop bottom up or come in and develop all your shallow and then have to drill through your shallow to get your deep. Bob Morris : That made sense, so that would seem instill a little more activity in drilling these wells. So the second part of my question was, in doing all of that, is there a minimum level of activity or capital spend you need to do in 2018 to be able to hold onto leases? John Christmann : If you look at '18 and I look at Alpine High and if I just if - even if we were to keep a six rig program, less than half of that would be necessary in terms of near term acreage. So I mean, we're in a really good spot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gail Nicholson with KLR Group. Gail Nicholson : Looking at the replacement of the Canadian volumes in the year with the Alpine production. That's very impressive especially since now those wells are completed in the optimal manner. When you look at the well count to get to that $50,000 rate by next May, what percentage was optimally completed and what percentage was more science wells? John Christmann : I mean if you look today, I mean we've been making that shift. And as of the October 9 disclosure we had 34 wells online. And we said we're going to be virtually halfway there year end with I think another eight wells, we're going to bring on 42 by year end. So as we move forward and start to shift into our pattern and spacing tests, you're going to continue to see us start to climb that curve. I'll give you a little bit of a feel for well camps that are necessary to do that. Gail Nicholson : And then just shifting tack a little bit, I know everyone is trying to talk about cash neutrality and paring back the budget. But looking at the improvement in kind of Brent/LLS pricing that we've seen to-date. Are there any exploratory projects in the portfolio that look more attractive that you might be willing to spend some capital on next year because of the spread there versus WTI? John Christmann : I think we're continuing looking at the portfolio and clearly we've got projects in Egypt and the North Sea that have, you know, that are Brent-weighted. We've got some brand new acreage that in Egypt that we just received through the award process. We're anxious to get our seismic shot and we'll actually be drilling wells there. So I think it's more a function of the opportunities as we high grading things, there will be things that we will move up in the portfolio for sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles Meade : I wondered if I could push a little bit more on this idea that you put out on your prepared remarks about the optimal investment profile being a little - optimal investment for 2018 being over what you'd look at, if you just fund it with cash flow. I think most of us are understanding that to certainly applied to Alpine High, but I'm curious does that also apply to your Midland program or in other words would you, is the optimal development there, would that call for more than cash flow as well. John Christmann : I think the thing you got to think about is, number one, we're not far off of that optimal from where we sit today anyway. So and kind of what we laid out at the start of this year would have been what we thought was optimal. So we're not, you know, we're pretty darn close to being that zip code as we sit today. The point is, you always want to balance and what's going to maximize our long-term returns and the pace. And I think the beauty of it is, as it has been alluded to we've got some flexibility, we've got some cash on the balance sheet. You're just trying to balance the right approach. And the good news is, we've got the ability to defer. So those are just some of the trade-offs that you have to balance and that's some of that what I'll call good positive tension. As you find things and discover things, your goal is to always bring more things into the portfolio that give you opportunities to high grade and pull things forward. And so it's just a good healthy situation and tells you the quality of our portfolio. And the other piece I'll say to that is. you see we're in multi-well pads, we're not out one well here, one well there. And so I think the testing we've been doing in the Midland Basic, we've been building a lot of momentum there. The patterns and spacing tests and things were also moving toward Alpine High. Those are all building towards understanding and to finding that optimal pace because that's how you're going to maximize your long-term returns versus short-term things you can do to manage short term. Charles Meade : And actually kind of segues to what my next question is, is around what sort of results are we going to see from Midland. If we look at those three pads, where you had those good results, I believe it was [indiscernible] wells on each of those. Is that going to be the bulk of the Midland program in 2018, those big pads or at least moderate sized pads? John Christmann : Well these are half section type tests. And so, depending on the capital level that we decide to disband, you're going to see us moving more into full section development type mode. And you'll see more similar type things, but that will be hinged on the pace that we want to go. And the beauty of having a lot of inventory that's drill ready and the infrastructure that we put in place puts you in a great position to be able to move forward. But you'll see continued building on pad level type economics because fundamentally we think that's how you're going to create the most value Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with J.P. Morgan. Arun Jayaram : I want to start off, you mentioned in your script how you'd moved some capital from international back to the US. I'm wondering if you could talk about that as well as the prospects for the North Sea and maybe just highlight the results thus far Callater. John Christmann : I mean, I'd let Tim go into details on Callater, but first two wells that gone on are performing quite well. Any color you want to add Tim to Callater. Tim Sullivan : The first two wells we brought on, net production was about 19,500 barrels of oil per day. They're currently producing about 13,000 barrels per day right now. We've got another well that will be bringing on shortly. We do have some facility constraints there with our bundle and some surface facilities. But we also have future drilling plans out at Callater as well. So a lot of good things happening there in the North Sea. John Christmann : And I would say on the capital shift, Arun, it's pretty minor. But it's more geared towards some of the pad testing and things we're doing in the Midland basin. Arun Jayaram : And just a question, as you guys think about future markets for Alpine High gas. Is obviously the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline, which is the Kinder Pipeline, any thoughts on Apache participating in that long haul pipe? John Christmann : We're looking at all options. I mean our gas today is flowing into Mexico, but we're certainly not counting on the Mexican market to be the purchaser of all of our gas. We recognize that we've got to be able to move a substantial volume of gas to the Gulf Coast. We're certainly looking at all options associated with that. And for that matter the liquids as well. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : John, just come back to the relative capital allocation for next year, what's the obligation on from an HBP standpoint in Alpine High that might limit your flexibility there. And what I'm really getting at is that you've obviously got a very strong ratable program in the Midland. I'm just wondering would you tend to skew capital away from the Midland in order to meet HBP or would you want to keep the momentum going in the Midland as well. I've got a follow up please. John Christmann : No, I mean, I think as I've answered, we're in a good place in both. I think we'll be able to move both programs forward. if you look at current rig count today as I mentioned less than half of the capital we'll be spending this year as we kind of roll forward into next year would be required in terms of how we need to meet lease obligations in the Alpine High. So I think we're in a pretty good zone that we can materially move both programs forward, like we need to move them forward. Doug Leggate : Is five-rig program is still the right number for avoiding any acreage expiry and so on? John Christmann : I mean if we look at Alpine High today, I mean, you could see something similar very easily. Doug Leggate : My follow actually is really going back to the question about the activity level outside of the Permian. I mean, when you look at the returns that you're talking about in the Alpine High, their obviously, they're going to just be anything else in the portfolio it seem so. When you think about the scaling up of that business going forward, what does it say about the high grading of the bonds? I know you've done a lot, but is there more to be done thinking obviously Oklahoma in particular. John Christmann : Well, I mean I think the key there is, number one, I mean if you look at the portfolio today, we like the balance that we have across the entire portfolio. We like what we have internationally or like what Egypt and the North Sea bringing to the table with exposure to Brent, we think we've got world class operations there and we differentiate ourselves. And so we like having free cash flow that we can invest. We also like the running room and the exposure we have in those two areas. I think it's a very good compliment. When we look at North America, we're always looking at the portfolio and that's something we will continue to do and continue to do on a daily basis. I like right now we moved up and we've got a nice position in the SCOOP. We could run a couple of rig program up there for several years. And we think it competes fairly nicely. So that's where your rigs are now. But I'll tell you we continue to look at the portfolio, we continue to have those conversations with the board. And I think the nice thing is, with the, you know, those areas there's a lot of upside and there's very little to hold those positions. And so I think they really create options for us in the future because we can see to a point where we're going to be generating a lot of free cash flow coming out of Alpine High. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Michael Hall : I guess maybe just continuing on the theme around cash flow neutrality and balance. Two questions I guess, number one, longer-dated, how far out do you see it when Alpine High does become self-sustaining including any midstream spend. And then secondarily, when we talk about cash flow neutrality, just to be clear, is that CapEx plus dividend equals cash flow or is it CapEx equals cash flow\u2026 John Christmann : First of all, if we just take a single rig at Alpine High, it's less than two years before its self-funding. So, it really comes down to pace and how we want to scale that up. I mean that's the way you want to think about that. And that's fully burdened with infrastructure and midstream spend. And then secondly, when we do talk about our numbers, we've got our dividends dialed in. So our dividend payment has been dialed into our capital programs. Michael Hall : And then I guess on the midstream side, as we think about monetization pads in 2018, can you maybe just kind of talk about the relative pros and cons you see for the different pads available and how important upfront cash flow is relative to longer-dated value capture. Steve Riney : We're still in early days of looking at that. And looking at the options, we've got a lot to consider. It's not just about the assets that we own, it's about what's going on in the Permian Basin and what's going on between the Permian Basin and the Gulf Coast. So there's a lot of work to do just to get prepared to consider the question that you just asked. We're going to look at it from the perspective of what creates the most value for the shareholders long term and not so much about what creates cash flow in the short term. We'll certainly look at it from the perspective of how does that impact our strategic value for the upstream, making sure that we've still got adequate elements of control if you will to be able to make sure that the midstream serves the purpose of the upstream as opposed to the other way around. But beyond things like that, we're open to quite a few options and exploring what those options ought to look like before we start talking to anybody in earnest in the marketplace. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael McAllister with MUFG. Michael McAllister : My question has to do with Alpine High midstream, when you talked about the cryogenic facility being built out in 2019, is that early 2019 or mid-2019, what's the thought on that? Steve Riney : What we're looking at is something that would come available probably in the first half of '19. So it would be - so obviously something that we would start construction on in 2018. Michael McAllister : And are there mechanical facilities in the budget for 2018 or we're going to just go with the 330 that are expected at the end of this year? Steve Riney : No, there will be more. There will be more processing in the field during '18. Michael McAllister : Do have a number or is it just contingent on the budget I guess activity? Steve Riney : It's something that we haven't shared yet and we'll probably share that when we get to the '18 plan for - that we'll go through in the fourth quarter results in February. Michael McAllister : What steps have you been taking for - there's not much NGL takeaway from there, what steps is Apache taking on that front. Steve Riney : By the time we get to a cryo plant, we will obviously need pipe takeaway for liquids as well. So we are looking at that. Operator : And we have no other question in queue at this time. And I would like to turn the call back over to Gary. Gary Clark : Thanks everybody for joining us. We look forward to speaking to you again in February. In the meantime if you have any follow ups please call myself or Kian or Patrick on the IR team and we'd be happy to walk through anything you need. Thanks so much. Bye, bye. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's Apache Corporation third quarter earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Thea, and I will be the conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache Corporation fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Gary Clark. Please go ahead. Gary T. Clark - Apache Corp.: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's fourth quarter 2017 financial and operational results conference call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann; Executive Vice President of Operations Support, Tim Sullivan; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Steve Riney. In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our fourth quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. On today's conference call we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude noncontrolling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. Also please note that with our exit from Canada, forward guidance and future quarterly reporting will refer to the United States or the U.S., and we will no longer use the term North America. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. Our prepared remarks will run a bit longer today, as we have a lot of information to cover with fourth quarter and full year results, as well as our three-year outlook. So we will extend this call past 2 o'clock in order to accommodate 30 minutes of Q&A. And I will now turn the call over to John. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will begin by discussing Apache's approach to the current environment. Then I will highlight our 2017 accomplishments and provide an overview of the fourth quarter before turning it over to Tim and Steve for more details. And finally, I will close with commentary on our 2018 to 2020 outlook. Early in 2015, we focused Apache on a path that creates real value for our shareholders over the long term and through the commodity cycles. The foundation was underpinned by cost and capital discipline. And we linked our compensation plans accordingly. This approach has driven our actions through a very challenging period. Specifically, we have streamlined our portfolio, reduced capital investment, increased capital productivity and efficiency, and reset the corporate and operating cost structure. By choice, we allowed production to decline rather than chase growth in an environment that was mostly value destructive. This disciplined approach enabled us to cost effectively lease and quietly discover a world-class unconventional resource of scale and to direct our limited additional investments to improving long-term returns. We were also able to maintain our dividend, while many in the industry were reduced or eliminated. Moreover, we strengthened our balance sheet by reducing debt and avoided diluting our shareholders' long-term value by electing not to issue equity to pursue expensive acreage acquisitions or to fund an outsized capital program. We have been clear in our belief that an E&P company, over the long term and through the commodity cycles, must be able to do the three things that leading companies in mature industries do, live within cash flows, grow the enterprise through prudent investment, and return capital to shareholders through a competitive dividend and/or share repurchases. This is the path that Apache is on now. And we have assembled the team and the portfolio to do so for decades to come. Our current investment programs are directed at building the optionality over the next few years to maximize the value of that portfolio. Specifically, at Alpine High we are building out a world class resource play that will change the course of Apache. The expanse of the opportunity in terms of acreage and hydrocarbon column will drive capital investment and very soon, free cash flow for decades to come. The capital program in short order will bring forth the capacity to deliver oil, gas, and NGLs at scale to the rapidly growing market on the U.S. Gulf Coast. The midstream infrastructure capital program at Alpine High is a critical piece to the story for the near term. We must strategically control the build-out of the infrastructure to meet the needs of the upstream. We do not need to own 100% of these assets for the long term though. And we are studying strategic alternatives that will ensure we capture the value we are creating and will free up cash flow by eliminating future capital. In the Permian Basin, outside of Alpine High, we have proven the quality of our inventory and are now well-positioned to profitably grow oil volumes for many years to come. Internationally, the North Sea and Egypt are very well-positioned to serve their primary strategic purpose, provide free cash flows back to the corporation for many years to come. And we still have a tremendous amount of running room. In Egypt, we've increased our acreage footprint by 40% with two new concessions and are conducting a large scale broadband 3D seismic survey that will set up growth opportunities for the future. In the North Sea, we have a sizable inventory of development locations and exploration prospects around our existing infrastructure. And in Suriname, we have two highly prospective blocks that are on trend with recent discoveries in an emerging world class oil basin. In the relatively near future, we will have significant optionality across the portfolio, especially in the Permian Basin, to direct investment across an extensive highly economic portfolio to produce oil, gas, or NGLs. At that time, the Permian Basin will be generating substantial free cash flow, which will bring another dimension of optionality. Those cash flows could be directed to any of the following, further accelerate the pace of Permian development, fund growth opportunities outside of the Permian, which may have been deferred due to Alpine High funding requirements, and return of capital to our shareholders. The future allocation and prioritization of how those cash flows will be utilized will be determined by what we deem to be in the best long-term interest of our shareholders. This is the strategic direction of Apache today. 2018 promises to be a very interesting year. Our industry is at a critical inflection point following three years of depressed commodity prices and disappointing returns in terms of both return on and return of capital. Today, we are in a more constructive oil price environment. And the market is watching carefully to determine whether E&P companies will maintain discipline and focus on long-term returns or revert to the historical norm of a singular focus on top line growth. For the industry to adopt a more rational approach to balancing optimal risk adjusted returns and growth, management incentives must be appropriately aligned. Consistent with that, investors are now seeking key changes to executive incentive compensation programs. Shareholders are advocating for the inclusion of absolute return metrics and programs historically more heavily weighted toward relative returns performance. They are also insisting that growth related metrics be calculated on a debt adjusted per-share basis. As I indicated, Apache restructured its compensation philosophy three years ago that clearly linked our long-term compensation as closely as possible with long-term shareholder value. It was also the best way to align our entire organization with our strategic direction. Specifically, our long-term incentive program has taken a balanced approach, with 50% based on relative TSR and the other 50% based on two metrics, which are highly correlated with absolute returns. The targets for these latter metrics are agreed with the board on an annual basis and reflect corporate objectives that are consistent with the economic environment at the time and the context of the long-term strategy of the company. We align those metrics every year. And therefore, they have no inherent bias for subjective growth targets. Turning now to our 2017 highlights. It was a great year of progress for Apache, marked by several important advancements that position us for strong performance in the years ahead. Following two years of curtailed capital investment, our Permian Basin production volumes entered 2017 in decline. Notwithstanding this slowdown, we have made and continue to make significant progress on many fronts, consolidating our land position; investing in science, data collection, and strategic testing; improving our drilling and completion capabilities; confirming additional landing zones; conducting important pattern and spacing tests at the section or half-section level; and testing shallow zones at Alpine High and other unconventional oil opportunities in the U.S. In 2017, we returned the Permian Basin to a growth trajectory, exclusive of Alpine High, with a relatively limited capital program. And clearly demonstrated that Apache possesses high-quality acreage and can deliver leading well results. Notably, our total Permian Basin production reached a record high in the fourth quarter, exceeding the previous high set two years ago in the fourth quarter of 2015. This achievement occurred just two quarters after Permian production reached a four-year low in mid-2017. As a result of the operational progress we made and the now proven quality of our inventory, we anticipate sustained, high return growth from the Permian for many years to come. In the Midland Basin, we have both a technology and execution success story. We are applying state-of-the-art capabilities to reduce drilling and completion time, locate wells more effectively within landing zones, and more efficiently stimulate the productive interval. In the second half of 2017, we began to significantly increase our average lateral length, which will continue into 2018, as 85% of our wells are planned for 1.5-to-2-mile laterals. We are very excited about our recent Midland Basin results and will continue to advance and leverage these key learnings for the future. At Alpine High, we initiated first production ahead of schedule in May and ramped production volumes steadily through the year, as we commissioned infrastructure and connected wells. We increased our inventory of risk locations to more than 5,000 and initiated our first true multi-well pads and pattern tests, which will drive increasing capital efficiencies into the 2018 program and beyond. We are pleased with these results and have begun to climb the learning curve with our development program, which will deliver well cost and productivity improvements in the future. Internationally, as I mentioned earlier, we added significant new acreage in Egypt. And we are moving forward with our exploration program in Suriname. Both of these areas bring significant future prospectivity to Apache. In 2017, we implemented a number of cutting edge technology initiatives across our operational footprint. The continued evolution and application of technology is vital to our industry. It will drive efficiency gains, inventory expansion, higher returns, and performance differentiation among E&P companies. Apache has long been a leader in technological innovation. And the recent addition of Mark Meyer as Senior Vice President of Energy Technology Strategies underscores the strategic importance of these initiatives. Lastly, I note the excellent progress we made in the ongoing reshaping of our portfolio. We took advantage of the active market for leasehold in the Permian by divesting some non-core acreage packages at very attractive prices. We also completed our strategic exit from Canada. These actions, combined with the ongoing investment at Alpine High, represent a large scale, multiyear portfolio rotation that will be extremely accretive to capital efficiency, recycle ratios, and most importantly, long-term returns. Moving now to fourth quarter results, Apache finished the year on a positive note with its second consecutive quarter of profitability. In the fourth quarter, we delivered strong adjusted EBITDA and cash flow, demonstrating our leverage to improving oil prices. Operating and G&A costs decreased from the third quarter on a unit basis. Capital spending was on plan. And U.S. production was at the high end of our guidance range. Internationally, we had some mixed results. Both Egypt and the North Sea benefited from improved Brent pricing and delivered combined cash flow from operations of nearly $0.5 billion and significant free cash flow. In Egypt, we continued to deliver excellent drilling results and achieved more than a 90% success rate during the quarter on 25 new wells. In the North Sea, following a long run of success, we encountered a few challenges. An unscheduled shutdown of the Forties Pipeline System, an unexpectedly tight producing formation in our CB1 Callater offset well, and an exploration dry hole on a long standing obligation well combined for a disappointing quarter. The result was lower production volumes in the quarter and a lower trajectory going into 2018. Despite these setbacks, the North Sea remains a vital, high return business for Apache. We have two existing discoveries in development planning and a deep inventory of attractive tie-back prospects. In the U.S., we had a very strong quarter. All of our growth came from the Permian Basin, where production increased 10% over the third quarter. At Alpine High, we commissioned our fifth central processing facility at the Hidalgo site and achieved our year-end production target of 25,000 BOEs per day. This flow rate was temporary, as we subsequently shut-in some production for a scheduled expansion at the Dakota central processing facilities. For the quarter, production averaged 20,000 BOEs per day. Midland and Delaware Basin oil production exceeded the high end of the guidance range we established a year ago. This was driven by a combination of strong well performance, a significant number of new wells placed online in the Delaware Basin, and timing of some high impact, half-section spacing tests in the Midland Basin. With that summary of our fourth quarter results, I will now turn the call over to Tim, who will discuss operational details of the fourth quarter and our 2018 activity plans. Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Thank you, John. My remarks today will include operational activity in key wells in our U.S. and international regions, planned activity levels by play for 2018, and I'll conclude with commentary about the use of new technology throughout the organization. Operationally, we had a good year and continue to improve in key areas. Our fourth quarter production results continue the growth trajectory established in the third quarter. In the U.S., fourth quarter production averaged 222,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 7% from the third quarter. U.S. oil production increased to 98,000 barrels of oil per day, an 8% increase from the preceding period. Much of this growth was driven by continued success in the Midland Basin. At the Powell field in Upton County, we brought online 20 wells from three pads with an average 30-day peak IP of nearly 1,400 BOE per day. These wells were drilled to the Wolfcamp B formation and are comprised of 1.5- and 2-mile laterals, producing in excess of 75% oil. These are half-section spacing and pattern tests, designed to methodically and scientifically determine the optimal development plan for the area. We continued to make good progress on drilling, completion, and cost optimization, as we use capital more efficiently with larger well pads and longer laterals. In the Midland Basin, we have reduced drilling and completion costs 20% over the last 12 months on a treated lateral foot basis, while production volumes improved 17%. These results give us confidence that we can continue to improve here and elsewhere in the Permian Basin. As John mentioned, we are moving to more pad operations at Alpine High. The Dogwood State pad is a six-well spacing test located in the northern flank and was selected due to retention requirements. These are dry gas wells on 660-foot spacing drilled in the Barnett and the Woodford formations to a total vertical depth below 13,000 feet. This pad has produced more than 2 Bcf in just 49 days and is currently producing approximately 75 million cubic feet per day. In the Central Crest, the two-well Elbert State pad drilled the Woodford formation at a TVD of approximately 9,800 feet, nearly 4,000 feet shallower than the Dogwood [State] pad. As projected from our thermal maturity model, these wells produce wet gas and oil and averaged a 30-day peak IP of 1,175 BOE per day with an oil-gas ratio greater than 60 barrels per million cubic feet. Drill, complete, and equip costs for this two-well pad averaged $6.2 million per well. As we move to pad operations at Alpine High, we are realizing the benefit of reducing cost and increasing efficiencies. On the drilling side, these include using less expensive spudder rigs to drill the surface and intermediate hole; batch drilling operations with walking rigs; casing design optimization with standardized production casing, and in some areas, the elimination of an intermediate casing string; substituting oil-based muds with less expensive brine drilling systems; customized bit and bottom hole assemblies; and the use of rotary steerable equipment to increase penetration rates in the lateral section. These efforts have reduced spud-to-TD times in some cases to under 15 days. On the completion side, pad operations have also led to the following cost and performance benefits, pumping more frac stages per day, optimized sand loading to pattern size, recycled and brackish water use, higher pump rates allowing for gel elimination requiring lower horsepower, and pads also allow us to verify confined stimulation intervals with tracers and micro-seismic. Through these efforts, we have brought down our costs considerably, and we expect costs to continue to decrease from an average of $8 million last year, where we were heavily invested in science and data collection, to $6 million this year. Ultimately, we anticipate well costs will be closer to the lower end of the $4 million to $6 million range we provided in 2016. Elsewhere in the Delaware Basin, we brought online seven wells in our Dixieland field in Reeves County and five wells in Eddy County. These wells have targeted four separate landing zones in the Bone Springs and Wolfcamp formations with impressive peak 30-day IPs ranging from 1,100 to nearly 2,200 BOE per day. And in the Anadarko Basin, we completed the Scott 33, a five-well pad in the Woodford SCOOP play. These mile laterals are producing in excess of 1,700 BOE per day with an oil-gas ratio in excess of 50 barrels per million cubic feet. Drill, complete, and equip costs for this pad averaged approximately $8 million per well. Internationally, our Egypt and North Sea regions continued to generate excellent free cash flow, benefiting from the recent price increase for Brent Index crude oil. In Egypt, highlights for the quarter include the Ptah 18, a development well in the Faghur Basin with a 30-day IP in excess of 3,400 BOE per day, all oil. Also, two exploration tests in the Matruh Basin, the Herunefer West-4X and the Chelsea-1X, were both discoveries in the upper Safa formation with a combined test rate in excess of 14,000 BOE per day, producing 58% oil. Both wells set up additional development and step-out exploration opportunities. For the full year, Egypt delivered a success rate greater than 80%, completing 88 net wells, of which 40 had test rates greater than 1,000 BOE per day with 87% oil. These are low-cost vertical completions and generate very attractive returns. In the North Sea, fourth quarter production averaged 58,000 BOE per day, as volumes from the Forties field were impacted by the unscheduled shutdown at the third-party operated Forties Pipeline System. The Callater field, a subsea tieback to the Beryl facilities, came online in mid-2017, and with the addition of the recently drilled CB1 well is currently producing on a gross basis 17,000 BOE per day, 43% oil. Please refer to our financial and operational supplement for more details on the fourth quarter. Now I will move to our 2018 capital program, beginning with the U.S. The Permian Basin remains the focus of our activity in the year ahead, with approximately $1.6 billion being directed to this region, or roughly two-thirds of our annual upstream budget. We plan to operate 13 to 15 rigs during the year, with six to seven at Alpine High, three elsewhere in the Delaware Basin, and four to five in the Midland Basin. We also expect to run four to six frac crews during the year, split primarily between Alpine High and in the Midland Basin. At Alpine High, we plan to drill 85 to 95 wells during 2018. And this will comprise approximately 50% development retention wells and 50% delineation wells. For perspective, to date we have drilled a total of 118 wells at Alpine High, of which 48 were online and producing at year end. Our retention program is crucial, as competitor activity around us has increased significantly, with more than 170 wells drilled or permitted by other operators since we announced Alpine High in September 2016. Importantly, drilling to the deeper Woodford formation allows Apache to retain drilling rights for all zones above it. Additionally, the wells drilled to the deeper source rock provide data needed to optimize the build-out of our infrastructure and shape the full field development plan at Alpine High. In the Permian Basin outside of Alpine High, we are planning a balanced drilling program of approximately 55 to 60 wells in the Midland Basin and 45 to 50 wells in the Delaware Basin. While we plan to drill a similar number of wells as last year, our average laterals will be increasing. And we expect to drill 15% more total lateral footage. These plays are predominantly oil. Our capital program for the international regions reflect their role in our portfolio as free cash flow generators to fund reinvestment in the Permian Basin. Our 2018 planned capital investment here is approximately $690 million. This will provide for continued cash flow generation from Egypt and the North Sea regions, though we expect some natural field decline at this investment level. Our 2018 capital program anticipates a moderate level of service cost inflation, approximately 10%, and we are managing this carefully. We have already contracted most of our rigs, pumping services, and sand required to execute the plan in the year ahead, avoiding the premium being paid currently with ramped up activity for many services. Higher costs are more likely to be seen in ancillary services in the Midland and Delaware Basins and will be more difficult to offset because of industry-wide activity levels. In spite of the inflationary trends, we are well-positioned at Alpine High for a step-change reduction in our cost profile as we scale up our business. Throughout our organization, we are applying new technologies and creating new tools that are improving how we work. These apply to subsurface, drilling and completions, production, and supply logistics groups. We are increasingly applying big data analytics across the company. We continue to lead the way in the development and application of simultaneous seismic sources, both onshore and offshore, the result of which has allowed us to save millions of dollars in exploration costs, greatly reduce the time to collect, process, interpret data, and realize large improvements in data quality. We have developed a drilling intelligence guide app that gathers high-frequency data from sensors on the rig for use in prediction and avoidance of downhole issues. We have also developed workflows and developed technologies that allow us to rapidly characterize thousands of feet of core and quickly get this information into the hands of the project geologists and reservoir engineers for rapid characterization of our shale plays and landing zones. Along with our ongoing efforts on oil fingerprinting, we are building a far more robust understanding of our shale plays and their performance. We're using multiple sources, such as fiber optics, micro-seismic, and 4D seismic, all of which are providing unprecedented insight into our formation stimulations, leading to optimized reservoir development. We've built new state-of-the-art water treatment facilities, including highly engineered water storage pits, both in the Midland Basin and Alpine High areas, that directly add value to our projects by reducing water costs and in increasing both reliability and flexibility in our operations. We're using remote operating centers that utilize real-time data to optimize well performance, allowing immediate reactions to changing circumstances. These data-driven decisions help deliver operational improvements and increase efficiency. The combination of data analytics technologies and advanced machine learning inform and validate our decision-making processes and operational strategies. As John mentioned, we expect technology will play an increasingly vital role in our future exploration and development progress. In conclusion, 2017 was a very good year. We achieved 124% production replacement rate from E&D adds net of engineering revisions. We returned to growth in the Permian Basin, advanced Alpine High, and generated robust free cash flow from our international regions. 2018 will be an extension of these efforts, as we continue our operating and capital cost discipline and our commitment to returns-focused growth. I will now turn the call over to Steve. Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Thank you, Tim. Today I will highlight Apache's fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results, discuss our 2018 outlook, comment on cash returns and return on capital employed, update our Alpine High midstream progress, and briefly review our hedge positions. Before I get to these details, let me first review a few of the company's key financial achievements in 2017. Apache returned to profitability in 2017, both on a GAAP reported basis and on an adjusted earnings basis. We reduced our absolute level of debt and our net debt, ending the year with more cash on hand than we began with. We retained our investment-grade credit rating. We returned nearly $400 million of capital to shareholders through the dividend. And asset sales generated $1.4 billion of proceeds and eliminated approximately $800 million of future asset retirement obligations. In 2018, we will continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, direct our capital investments for value and long-term returns, and take important next steps to progress Alpine High into full operational mode, so we can return to living within cash flows as we prefer. Through all of this, we will also continue to return capital to our shareholders, which is an underappreciated aspect of Apache. Over the last three years, we've returned over $1.1 billion to shareholders through the dividend. For the next three years, we plan to return at least this amount, and possibly more, through the dividend or through share buybacks. Turning to our fourth quarter and full-year results, as noted in our press release this morning, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Apache reported fourth quarter 2017 net income of $456 million or $1.19 per diluted common share. Results for the quarter include a number of items that are outside of core earnings and are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates. The most significant of these is a $306 million deferred income tax benefit from U.S. tax reform. Excluding this and other less material items, our adjusted earnings for the quarter were $126 million or $0.33 per share. For the full year 2017, Apache reported GAAP net income of $1.3 billion or $3.41 per share. And adjusted earnings of $92 million or $0.24 per share. With respect to U.S. tax reform, the $306 million tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter reflects the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017. This represents the combined impact from the deemed repatriation provision and the reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. This is a provisional assessment of the U.S. tax reform. And we continue to assess its full impact. Importantly, as we have indicated in the past, Apache is not currently a cash taxpayer in the U.S. And given the carryforward of certain tax attributes, we do not anticipate this changing in the foreseeable future. In terms of operational and financial results, key items such as North American and international production volumes, capital expenditures, LOE, DD&A, and G&A were consistent with or better than our latest guidance. Capital spending was $862 million for the fourth quarter and $3.1 billion for the full year. Throughout 2017, we further strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity position, ending the year with net debt of $6.8 billion and cash on hand of $1.7 billion. Let me turn now briefly to 2018. We have provided more detailed guidance for the year in today's fourth quarter financial and operational supplement. I won't go through each component, but would like to highlight a few key items. Our capital budget for 2018 is $3 billion, which is down slightly from 2017. We plan to invest $2.5 billion in the upstream and $500 million in Alpine High midstream. At current pricing, the upstream will be approximately cash flow neutral, inclusive of the current company dividend of $380 million. The midstream will operate at a cash flow deficit of approximately $500 million. This deficit could be significantly reduced or even completely eliminated in the event of a funding transaction involving the Alpine High midstream assets. It is anticipated that any cash flow deficit for 2018 will be funded through cash on hand. For the year, Apache's adjusted production is expected to increase by 7% to 13%, consisting of 19% to 24% growth in the U.S. and a 3% to 10% decline internationally. Oil production in the Permian Basin is projected to grow by approximately 9%. For the first quarter of 2018, U.S. production is expected to be around 223,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Adjusted international production is expected to average 135,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. So the first quarter will be flat to slightly down from the fourth quarter, before we return to a growth profile that will deliver the 7% to 13% increase for the full year that I just mentioned. This is the result of several factors, including timing of pad completions in the Midland Basin, as we placed three pads into production during the fourth quarter of 2017, but we only have one pad planned for the first quarter of 2018; mechanical compression issues on one of our Beryl facilities and further temporary outages at the Forties Pipeline System in the North Sea; production curtailment in the Permian Basin due to weather impacts and a temporary shutdown to rebuild a tank battery in the Midland Basin; and Brent crude pricing impacts on our Egypt volumes as a result of our production sharing contracts. From a capital and expense perspective, first quarter should generally run at a quarterly pace of around 25% of the full year dollar guidance ranges. Exceptions to this would be capital expenditures will be around $800 million, cash exploration costs will be around $50 million, G&A expense will be around $120 million, and financing costs will be around $105 million. Let me turn now to a discussion of returns, which as you know, is integral to how we manage our business. For three years now, we have been consistent in our approach to capital allocations. We fund opportunities that we believe will maximize long-term value and optimize long-term returns. To reinforce this, we added a cash return on invested capital metric to our annual incentive compensation plan. We outline the specifics of how we intend to calculate this metric in our financial and operational supplement. For 2018, we have established a cash return on invested capital target of 18%. Our performance against this target accounts for 20% of the entire company's annual incentive compensation. This measure of returns should improve by about 2% per year for the next few years. Another important measure of returns we watch closely is return on capital employed. Just like the cash return on invested capital goal, we have added a strategic goal related to ROCE on our 2018 incentive compensation plan. That goal is to implement a long-term plan that returns the company to sustainable double digit ROCE. Everybody has a preferred methodology for calculating ROCE with the most significant differences arising from the use of pre- versus post-tax income in the numerator and gross versus net debt in the denominator. Our preferred method is a numerator using adjusted earnings before interest and taxes and a denominator using average debt plus average shareholder equity. Using this methodology, at flat pricing from today, our 2020 ROCE is projected to be around 10%. And this will continue to improve for the next several years after 2020. With the required start-up investment at Alpine High, improving ROCE will take some time. Embedded in our forecasted ROCE is the assumption we continue to own, operate, and fund 100% of the Alpine High midstream infrastructure. Although strategically critical and valuable, these investments tend to hold back returns as measured by accounting metrics. A transaction involving these assets could materially improve these ROCE estimates. The upstream investment in due course will become the long-term engine for dramatically improving ROCE. While Alpine High may take a bit of time to attain critical mass, with its extremely low entry cost and attractive recycle ratios, it will drive significantly improved ROCE for Apache Corporation for many years to come. Next I would like to provide some color on our Alpine High midstream operations, where we continue to make steady progress on multiple fronts. Construction on these facilities began in November 2016. And the progress we have made in a little over a year is remarkable. Currently, we are operating 110 miles of gathering line, 45 miles of 30-inch trunk line, 21 central tank batteries, and 5 central processing facilities with inlet capacity of 330 million cubic feet per day. By the end of 2018, we anticipate reaching 830 million cubic feet per day of inlet processing capacity. During the year, we plan to commence installation of centralized cryogenic processing facilities, which will add another 600 million cubic feet per day of capacity in 2019. We have also begun implementing a takeaway strategy with the signing of an agreement with Kinder Morgan to access capacity on their Gulf Coast Express long-haul gas project from the Waha Hub to Agua Dulce near the Texas Gulf Coast. This agreement includes an option to participate in the project on an equity basis, which we believe will prove valuable to the midstream enterprise for the long term. You can anticipate similar arrangements on the NGL and oil sides in the future. We recognize there is a wide variety of long-term strategic options for the Alpine High midstream assets, and we are giving these careful consideration. The inherent value of these assets comes from the massive long-term flow of hydrocarbons from Alpine High and the optionality that will create along the value chain. Numerous parties have approached us with some very interesting ideas of how they might join us in the build-out of the midstream business. While it is likely these assets will end up in an enterprise separate from Apache, for both funding and for value optimization reasons, we currently anticipate owning a significant share of this enterprise for the long term. Before turning the call back to John, I'll comment briefly on our hedging program. As a reminder, we do not engage in hedging to speculate on price. The purpose of our hedging program is to protect cash flows to fund the capital program at Alpine High. For 2018, an average of 85,500 barrels of oil production per day currently have some form of hedging protection. 47% is in the form of puts, 37% is in collars, some with upside call options, and 16% is in the form of swaps. All of these hedge positions give the desired downside protection, and nearly 70% retain some form of upside potential, which we generally prefer. While our cash flow sensitivity to natural gas price movements is considerably less than for oil, we did recognize risks associated with certain types of gas exposure. As such, we entered into both NYMEX gas price swaps and Waha basis swaps to eliminate some of the uncertainty. To date, we have swapped an average of 237 million BTUs per day of NYMEX gas price exposure for 2018 at a weighted average price of $3.07. With respect to Waha basis, for all of 2018 and the first half of 2019, we have entered into swaps for an average of 156 million BTUs per day at an average basis differential of $0.51. We have also entered into a small number of Waha basis swaps for the second half of 2019. The details on all of our hedge positions can be seen in our financial and operational supplement. This time of year, we also typically provide updated guidance on our cash flow sensitivity to changes in commodity prices. For 2018, we estimate that a $5 change in oil price impacts cash flow by approximately $350 million. A $0.30 change in gas price impacts cash flow by approximately $65 million. Both of these estimates exclude the effect of our hedge positions. I would like to conclude by noting Apache's continued financial strength and flexibility. We entered 2018 with $1.7 billion of cash, $150 million of which we used to fund debt maturities earlier this month. We have an additional $400 million of debt maturing in September, which we will also retire using cash on hand. We will continue to balance the great confidence we have in our current investment programs with our overarching desire to live within cash flows. We have purposefully created the liquidity to fund the near-term outspend because it will maximize long-term value for our shareholders. While this will be a small and short-lived outspend, we are exploring all options for minimizing or eliminating it entirely. We will also continue to take advantage of the flexibility our portfolio provides on the capital program outside of Alpine High. We will maintain the planning and operational flexibility to manage these programs as market conditions dictate. I'll now turn the call back over to John for a discussion of our three-year outlook. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Thank you, Steve. Before we move on to Q&A, I'd like to comment on the 2018 to 2020 outlook we provided in this morning's press release. Over the next three years, we plan to invest a total of approximately $7.5 billion in the upstream, with just under $2.5 billion budgeted for 2018 and increasing slightly through to 2020. Additionally, we expect to invest $1 billion in the midstream build-out at Alpine High over the next three years. This will include around $500 million in 2018 and another $500 million split evenly between 2019 and 2020. As we have made clear, we are exploring funding alternatives for our midstream assets and are working to eliminate some or all of this capital from our three-year plan. I cannot overstate the strategic importance of the midstream solution at Alpine High. The optimal outcome requires a deliberate and thoughtful approach, highly integrated with the upstream development plan, and we are investing the necessary time and resources to get it right. The outcome of this capital program is a projected compound annual growth rate of 11% to 13% for Apache as a whole and 19% to 22% in the U.S. over the next three years, which will be accompanied by very solid returns. This growth will be driven almost entirely by the Permian, which we project to grow at a compound rate of 26% to 28%. Our international operations in Egypt and the North Sea will continue to be free cash contributors. For the last two years, we have been investing below our $700 million to $900 million maintenance capital rate. As a result, we have seen international production volumes decline. And for now, we anticipate they will continue on a shallow decline rate, given our planned investment levels. In the North Sea, however, we do anticipate improving capital efficiency, as our high day rate contract on the Ocean Patriot semi-submersible rolls down to a significantly lower rate in mid-2018. We feel good about the long-term strategic direction of Egypt and the North Sea, and industry activity is picking up in both regions. I'd like to take a few minutes now and focus specifically on our three-year Permian Basin investment plan. As you know, Apache has one of the largest acreage footprints in the Permian, and it is our largest-producing region. From 2018 to 2020, we plan to invest approximately two-thirds of our upstream capital in the Permian, consisting of $2.5 billion in Alpine High and $2.5 billion in the Midland Basin, other Delaware Basin, and Central Basin Platform combined. Outside of Alpine High, we will focus our capital program on horizontal oil drilling in the Midland and Delaware Basins and on moderating our Central Basin Platform decline rate through water flood and EOR projects. With the advancements made over the last three years that Tim discussed, the capital program in these areas is becoming both more efficient and more productive. We have the inventory to significantly increase this investment level, especially in the Midland Basin, if our objective was to simply maximize short-term oil growth. However, a deeper understanding of multi-zone reservoir dynamics on a section level will lead to much more economic full development decisions for the long term. This section-level approach requires the collection and analysis of massive amounts of data to fully understand the complex, inter-well, inter-zone physics. Our current rig and completion pace allow sufficient time to collect and analyze this data and design and implement optimal spacing and pattern configurations across our acreage position. After we complete this important work, then we will look to accelerate our Permian development pace in the context of available cash flow. With nearly all of our key Midland Basin acreage held by production, we have the luxury of utilizing time and technology to ensure long-term value maximization of our Permian acreage. The industry is just beginning to understand the dynamics of downspacing, inter-well and cross-landing zone communications, and long-term reservoir performance of multi-well pads. Apache's goal is to stay at the forefront of that understanding. Turning to Alpine High, Apache has the unique opportunity to advance a low-cost greenfield play of enormous scale. We are confident it will become a long-term, high -return, free cash flow generating asset for decades to come. In the context of today's commodity price, we acknowledge that funding a wet gas play is a bit contrarian, but it is justified by the long-term scale and return potential, even at lower gas prices. With 340,000 contiguous net acres, up to 6,000 feet of hydrocarbon columns spanning the full range from dry gas to oil, relatively high permeability, low clay content, and generally over-pressured true organic shale formations, the potential of the play is very compelling. Our investment plan for Alpine High upstream over the next three years assumes an average of 6.5 rigs in 2018, increasing to 10 rigs in 2020. During 2018, approximately 50% of the drilling program will focus on wrapping up the primary phase of delineation and testing. The rest of the three-year drilling program can be roughly split 50 :50 between retention drilling and impact development drilling. The key to success for Alpine High will be its cost structure, both on a capital and operational basis. We have already made great progress on drilling costs. But over time, well design optimization, pad drilling, and pattern development are expected to drive Alpine High's average completed well cost down into the $4 million to $6 million range, resulting in very attractive F&D costs. The Woodford, Barnett, and Pennsylvanian source rock are also true shales, which means they contain little to no in situ formation water. With minimal water handling costs, Alpine High will have extremely low operating costs. We are projecting a steady decrease in lease operating expenses over the next three years to less than $2 per BOE by the end of 2020, excluding gathering, processing, and transport fees. This is a major difference between Alpine High and other sweet spot Delaware Basin plays that we believe is vastly underappreciated. In addition to low costs, revenue uplift from oil and liquids in the wet gas portion of the play will contribute to strong cash margins. Together with the low F&D costs, this will drive very competitive recycle ratios compared to those generated by other Permian Basin operations. 2018 will be another key step in the transition of Alpine High from delineation and testing to full development mode. The build-out of the infrastructure backbone will continue through 2018 and into 2019. There will be times when we need to shut in production to commission new facilities, to upgrade or expand existing facilities, or to reroute product flows. The infrastructure build-out also comes with inherently unpredictable timing risks associated with weather, surface use agreements, and third-party engineering, procurement, and construction vendor delays. Drilling at Alpine High will progress at a steady and increasingly efficient pace as we transition to more pad development, while the turn-in line schedule for larger pads will periodically drive significant waves of new production capacity. Midstream installation and commissioning, in parallel with the drilling program migrating to more multi-well pads, will create significant lumpiness to the near-term production profile. As I mentioned earlier, Alpine High production in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 20,000 BOEs a day net to Apache. By 2020, average daily production is expected to be between 160,000 and 180,000 BOEs a day, which represents a compound annual growth rate in excess of 150%. Our forecast has certain embedded assumptions for improved capital efficiency and productivity that are common with new resource plays. We believe these assumptions are conservative relative to improvements the industry has seen in other unconventional plays such as the SCOOP/STACK, Utica, and Marcellus, so there is meaningful upside from this forecast. We are still very early in the unfolding of Alpine High, and there is much learning still to occur. In terms of production mix, fourth quarter 2017 volumes at Alpine High were comprised of 83% gas, 10% NGLs, and 7% oil. In our three-year outlook, we are conservatively forecasting the oil percentage to remain relatively flat, as our drilling program will be weighted toward deeper drilling for retention purposes. However, there are many avenues by which the oil mix should increase. And I anticipate we will see many updated views on the oil mix in the future. In terms of the NGL mix, our first cryogenic processing facility will be commissioned in 2019. At that point the percentage of NGLs in the production stream will begin to ramp up. And in 2020 should be around 30% of total Alpine High volumes on a BOE basis. Going forward, there are three primary program milestones to monitor. The first is well cost reductions in the development program. As we transition more of the drilling program to pads and patterns, completed well costs should improve over time and eventually land in our $4 million to $6 million target range. Second is improving well productivity in the development program. As we drill and complete more wells, you should see the learning curve benefit of more productive wells over time. And the third is expansion of the drilling inventory through the delineation and testing program. As we further test the Crest, Southern Flank, and the shallower zones of the play, we anticipate increasing the number of wet gas and oil locations significantly. Alpine High has all the makings of a great resource play. And Apache is fortunate to have such a commanding acreage position. Investing in Alpine High is arguably a gas and NGL proposition for the near-term investment horizon. We realize we are often held to the comparative conventional wisdom of Permian Basin, especially Delaware oil plays. But we believe that a hydrocarbon agnostic evaluation of this play is the right approach. Full cycle returns will be determined not only by top line revenue, but importantly, by cost structure as well. With respect to the former, we believe the macro environment is setting up very nicely for gas and NGL producers, as the important drivers like the Gulf Coast pet-chem build-out, LNG exports, and Mexican demand accelerate as we enter the next decade. In terms of costs, we are confident the geological attributes, such as continuous and contiguous transgressive sequence, high organic content, over-pressured geologic settings, and the operating simplicity that comes from low water cuts will result in Alpine High being highly competitive with, if not ultimately superior to, other leading Permian Basin plays from a full cycle return standpoint. And ultimately, that is what Apache is about, generating and sustaining leading full cycle returns. It will take time to bring clarity to the full potential of Alpine High in terms of resource and production profile. And this clarity will only come through investment. We are confident though that it will be a game changer for Apache and provide a powerful complement to the rest of our portfolio. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : We'll pause for just a moment. The first question will come from John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Yes. Thanks. Regarding your Midland well pads, John, how many wells per pad? And is the 1.5 to 2-mile length ideal? Is that your optimal horizontal length for those wells? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Yeah, John. Thank you. First off, we brought on three half-section pads. And a lot of those were 8 and 10 wells, so we're testing multiple zones and the patterns there, and it's really important. I mean we'll be watching those wells now over time. We've got a couple of other \u2013 we've got a pad coming on in the first quarter, as we said, of 2018. And some others planned in 2018, which will help us with that. Right now, 1.5-to-2-mile is probably optimal. And a lot of that hinges on your land position. So we've had to do some work to kind of be able to block up some trades, to be able to drill those longer laterals. But I do think that the 1.5-to-2-mile laterals are going to be optimal for now. And obviously we're watching the spacing. I think that's one of the big keys is getting this spacing right. As you know, you can't take back wells you drill. And we've seen some instances where others have plowed ahead and are over-drilling. And now you're seeing a lot of interference. And so I think it's important to take the time, effort, collect the data, and do the science to make sure you get those patterns and spacing tests right to maximize the long-term returns. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : With respect to the data gathering and all that, how much incrementally or how much has that been for the well costs or the pad development costs, the technology that you're focused on? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, we had a pad where we ran fiber on all the wells. We ended up spending a couple million dollars there ultimately, because of how we collected it. We also had seismic crews out there. And we actually collected true seismic data in between each stage. So we've done a lot of things, John, where we've invested that money. But when you look at the grand scheme of things, that relative to just one well that you over-drill is money well spent. So I mean it's worth taking the time and making sure we do this right. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Great. That's really it for me. Thanks. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Bob Brackett with Bernstein. Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Question on the U.S. non-Permian, non-Alpine High. If I kind of take your guidance and back out what it implies for U.S. non-Permian, it's kind of under-investment, like a decline. If I look at the Permian outside of Alpine High, it looks like you guys basically keep it flat through 2020. Is that about right? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: When you look at the capital program with where we are today, Bob, yes. We are spending very little outside the non-Permian capital. I think you're actually going to see though, that it's \u2013 with the investment that's come off of the last three years, it's not going to decline a whole lot. In fact, our Mid-Continent stuff will actually grow with just the five wells we brought on in the SCOOP this year. So we're in a pretty good spot there. But, yes, very little capital there for 2018. Now as we get out past a couple of years and we start generating a lot of free cash flow from Alpine High, we see that changing quickly. And so we like having the optionality there in those assets. And right now in the other Permian, it's close, a little more than maintenance. But it's really more designed at going at the right pace there. As I mentioned too in the Midland Basin, I mean we've shown \u2013 if you look at the results, the back half of 2017, as I mentioned in the script, we peaked in the fourth quarter of 2015. And then we really shut the programs down, reset the cost structure. Bottomed second quarter of last year. And then quickly in a matter of two quarters made a new production high. So really it's an off/on switch. It takes a couple of quarters. But it shows you the quality and the progress that we've made in terms of being able to apply that capital to the other Permian assets. Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And if you have those assets that other people would voraciously drill, at what point do you say that those belong in somebody else's hands? Or to your point, do you keep them for future optionality? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, we just have to weigh the value of that. I mean we look at the portfolio. We work the portfolio very hard. Last year we made a strategic decision to exit Canada, which we're very glad we did. I think one of the things that gets lost in there is that we eliminated $800 million of ARO, but that was a big strategic decision for us. We also unloaded some acreage that we felt like we got some very \u2013 prices for. And is exactly that. Something that somebody placed a high enough premium on that we felt like it would be better in their hands. So you're always looking at those things and weighing those things. And we continue to do that in the future. Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Thank you. [Technical Difficulty] (59:22 \u2013 59:31) Operator : Jeffrey, your line is open. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Thanks. On the multi-year plan, you mentioned the 10% service cost inflation. Can you talk through some of the other assumptions, specifically what commodity prices you're underwriting? And if you're including any expected efficiencies or productivity improvements? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: On the service side, yes. As Tim said, we have most of our big ticket items \u2013 rigs, frac crews, sand \u2013 under contract and tied up for the foreseeable future. So we feel good about the main services. But we are seeing the smaller things that drive the day to day, trucking, simple as the backhoes, pads. Everybody is wanting to raise costs everywhere. So we did bake in, in general, a 10% rise. Now when you look at some efficiencies at \u2013 and then we kind of took each play, play by play. As Tim told you, in 2017 we were able to reduce our Midland Basin well cost by 20% on a treated lateral foot basis and increase productivity by 17%. So we've taken those kind of play by play into account. The greatest efficiencies we'll see at Alpine High is we're early in that play and really starting to move into pads. And then less in the more mature plays, where we've drilled more wells. And so we've got a pretty conservative forecast on the capital side going into this year. And what I don't want to be is in a couple quarters, having to raise my capital, because I assumed that we could keep things down when the reality is there's a lot of pressure out there on a lot of different fronts. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: I appreciate that detail. And then I guess on the commodity price assumptions through the three-year timeframe. Just trying to get a good sense of what's under-written, when Steve talked about cash flow neutrality and the upstream piece this year, for example, and just how that might evolve over time. Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yeah, Jeff. So obviously, there's lots of conversation out there today about cash flow neutrality and pricing assumptions and what pricing assumptions people ought to use. And obviously I think that the last few years have demonstrated how important we believe cash flow neutrality is. And we've said that many, many times that we ought to be able to live within our means. I think it's important that we actually acknowledge there are lots of different definitions out there about cash flow neutrality. There are lots of different methods that people use to talk about that. Some include dividends, some don't include dividends. Some actually go so far as to include asset sales. And some have some capital structure changes, all contributing to cash flow neutrality. Just to be clear, we take a very, maybe extremely pure approach, because we believe cash flow neutrality means that with no asset sales and with no changes to debt or equity, that you should end the year with the same amount of cash on hand that you began the year with. And that's a very pure definition. I'm not sure there's a more accurate definition of cash flow neutrality. If there is, I'd like to know what that is. So with that said, our plan for 2018 and beyond, what we talked about today around \u2013 or I talked about around 2018, is so the midstream is obviously operating at an out-spend, about a $500 million deficit. That doesn't \u2013 that's regardless of what price assumption that you might use. And there's obviously \u2013 there's some reasons that some of that might go away. And what I talked about is that the upstream, which is everything else in Apache, including dividends, that that would be cash flow neutral at current pricing is what I said, which is about $60. $60 $61, WTI's current pricing I believe, unless something's happened on the call. So we would be cash flow neutral at around that type of price assumption. We believe we could also be cash flow neutral down into the upper $50s. We're working on a number of things that could help us do that. In terms of pricing in our plan, we've actually run numerous price scenarios, all of them lower than $60. We've reviewed many of these with the board. And just a couple weeks ago, we actually agreed our plan for this year with the board, and that was at a price of $58 WTI. Obviously at that price there would be a small cash flow deficit in the upstream to go with the midstream deficit. And I think that \u2013 I think with the information that we've now provided around the plan and with the supplement around price sensitivity, around the hedge positions, we've given you lots of details. You understand cash flow sensitivity relative to movements in oil price or gas price. You see the details on our hedge positions, which obviously affect cash flow sensitivity as cash flow \u2013 as price moves down. And I think \u2013 so I think most of the data there, to meet any modeling requirements that you might have, to understand how cash flow changes as commodity prices move up or move down. The only word of warning that I would give you on that is that if you start moving too far off of this, our plan at $58 or current pricing at around $60, you start moving too far off of that either to the upside or the downside, then the current plan, all of the other elements of the plan actually begin losing relevance. Number one, we have our hedges in place, so you've got that. Number two, I think the simple math on cash flows due to price isn't really adequate. Because when you start moving well below that $58 or $60 current pricing or well above it, then all of the other assumptions inherent in the plan begin to change. All of the things around cost inflation assumptions that we've made, the actual activity set that we would engage in, the actual capital allocations that we would make, all of those change as you move far off of that plan. So we set ours at \u2013 we set the plan with the board at $58. And we think that's actually somewhat irrelevant. The current pricing, $60 to $61, we would be cash flow neutral in that upstream or everything outside of the Midland \u2013 or the midstream, which is about a $500 million deficit. Unknown Speaker : Thank you. Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yeah, all of that, just to be clear, again, that all includes the dividend. Unknown Speaker : Understood. Appreciate all the color there as well. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, John, to you and your whole team there. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Good afternoon, Charles. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Thank you, John. I want to go back to something that you spent some time on in your prepared comments. And I'm hoping you can perhaps add a little bit more. And that's the discussion around the \u2013 said maybe the balance of returns between your Alpine High and say your Midland asset. And it sounded like you were saying in the short term, perhaps a better return is available in the Midland Basin. But if you widen the perspective a bit and look at the longer term trajectory in Alpine High, that actually that's going to deliver better returns to Apache shareholders. I wonder is that the right way to interpret your comments? And if so what is the timeframe where maybe there's a breakover that Alpine... John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, first thing is the returns in both programs are excellent, so it's really not a return difference thing, Charles. The point was we could increase short-term oil by going much quicker in the Midland Basin today or some of the other Delaware Basin stuff today. The point was in the Midland and the Delaware, we're gathering a bunch of data by moving to the pads and the pattern spacing tests. And that's really, really important data that we're collecting right now. And quite frankly, you want to \u2013 the market has gotten conditioned to thinking that early performance in IPs is a direct correlation to EURs, which is just not the case. You have to look at how these wells perform and how these pads perform over a longer time, and especially as you start to look at the inside wells and so forth. So in our Midland program, we've actually brought on three brand new half-section pads late last year, which we're going to critically watch. And they're a little different configurations and we collected a lot of data. So there are two elements there. What my point was is we could accelerate the short-term oil over the longer-term investment at Alpine High. At Alpine High, you have a totally different animal, though. You have 6,000 feet of hydrocarbon column. We've got a 70-mile fairway, 340,000 acres that we control, multiple zones. We've now proven over 11 different landing zones across just the vertical column, and there's many, many more as we work through that. So it takes time. We're moving the infrastructure forward. And most of that's geared to the wet gas infrastructure that we have to have to process that and get put in place. And so when we look at advancing that over time and then you just look at the velocity at which we'll be able to reinvest that capital because of the F&D and because of the turnover and the returns, from a longer-term perspective, what's in our best interest now is advancing the Alpine High at this pace and the Midland Basin at the pace we're at. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Okay, got it. I think that makes sense, John. And then this is more just a rifle shot question. The Dogwood and Elbert State pads, your Alpine High pads that you gave us some results on, I believe you gave us the oil cut. But what was the \u2013 if you could, give us an idea of the NGL yield on those. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: No, the Dogwood pad we said is in the dry gas. I think the thing that's very exciting about that is that's a six-well pad that's on 660-foot spacing. And quite frankly, that's a heck of a lot tighter than what our location counts would be today. So the performance there is very encouraging. And it could lead to an increase in numbers of well counts, because it's performing very, very nicely. But the Dogwood is in the dry gas. And as we mentioned, we've got six wells on. They're 660-foot spacing, and they're currently making over 75 million [cubic feet] a day, and have already made 2 Bcf in a very short term while they were cleaning up. So it's really the first true pad and pattern. And it's validating the organics. This is a true shale. And so you're seeing great response from the first pad. The Elberts are shallower. And there you see the liquid yield goes up. Those are still cleaning up as well. It's a two-well pad. I think the key there was we got the cost down. And what you're seeing there is the liquid yield. And that will be wet gas too as it moves up. So I don't know, Tim, do you have the NGL yield on the Elberts? Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: This is high BTU gas. And under the cryo, it's going to be in the 140 barrel per million range of a typical wet gas well. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: And it's about 60 barrels a million right now of oil too, correct? Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Correct. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Great, that's what I was looking for. Thanks, Tim, and thanks, John. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Thank you, Charles. Operator : The next question will come from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Thanks. I guess first on the trajectory of Alpine High in the three-year outlook, I'm just curious. Should we think about that as basically filling up infrastructure as you go, or do you have remaining infrastructure capacity to continue growth beyond that timeframe? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: No, Michael, it's a pretty conservative plan. It's really based on retention, half the capital going to retention. We will be ahead of that. I said we would end the year at about 830 million a day of inlet processing capacity at the end of this year. And the volumes we have on that outlook don't fill that up. So we've got a lot of capacity there. And quite frankly, I think there's room for the picture to improve greatly as time marches on this year, both in terms of the volumes as well as the liquid content and the oil content as we test more of the zones and go forward there. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : And in what timeframe does the Alpine High project as a whole go from being in an investment phase where there's an outspend, including the midstream, to \u2013 let's just set aside monetization, but to a free cash flow phase where you're actually harvesting the cash flows from the program? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: We look at it \u2013 probably the best way to put this to you is on a rig line basis. A single rig line is going to turn cash flow positive in less than two years. And so if we hold the rig lines constant, you'll see it turn pretty quickly. So that's how we think about it. We laid out the capital on the midstream was (1:14:04) $500 million last year. We said $500 million this year and then $250 million, $250 million. So it starts scaling down. So then it really comes down to the pace on those rig lines. But you're going to see this thing start throwing off a tremendous amount of cash in less than a two-year window per rig line. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Okay. And then last on my end is just around the cost structure. I was just looking year on year at the LOE cost guide. It's up despite adding a pretty large wedge of what I would think is pretty low-cost gas. What's going on there that's not driving a reduction in LOE per unit? And should we anticipate a reduction over the longer timeframe within the three-year outlook? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: There's no doubt that, as we mentioned in there, the per-barrel numbers are going to come down on Alpine High. Some of that's with starting to put various things in the LOE lines that hadn't been there prior. Some of it is when we pored our plan, our guys have taken a pretty conservative approach for what LOE looks like right now just because of the pressure we're getting for everywhere to raise the small things. So I think there's room, as we have historically done, to work on those numbers and beat those numbers. But it's probably just a little bit with this price environment changing so dynamically, that and the timing of some pads and some things coming on that is driving that. But there's no doubt over time the LOE per BOE for the Permian is going to come down significantly as Alpine High ramps up. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : And at the corporate level, should we see that by 2019 you think, or more time? Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yes, this is Steve. So I think that a lot of that will depend on what happens with the midstream at Alpine High. Because John made reference to what we believe the LOE per BOE at Alpine High will be in his prepared remarks. That was excluding the midstream costs. And today, all of the midstream costs show up, or the operating costs for that show up as LOE. And obviously, as you're building that out, you're building out capacity and starting it up and operating it below its actual true capacity, in some cases and for some periods of time well below its true capacity. You're going to have a pretty high cost per BOE going through that. Two things will change that, number one, just ramping it up to a larger scale and really getting it ramped up to efficient activity. But also eventually what's going to happen, or at least I would anticipate will happen, is that the midstream assets become part of a midstream enterprise separate from Apache. And depending on the accounting treatment of that, the structure of it and control and ownership, you could see all those costs move over to gathering and transportation, which will be more of a typical third-party type of transport and processing fee as opposed to LOE. But that's going to have a meaningful impact, especially on 2018, the startup and operations of that midstream enterprise. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : All right. Look forward to seeing how it all progresses. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Hey, Brian. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: With the three-year outlook on Alpine High to get to 160,000 to 180,000 BOE a day, fully recognizing that production mix is different from value, can you just give us the update on your expectations for the oil versus NGLs versus gas split in 2020? And then on the gas piece, what are your expectations for how much will go beyond the local market in 2020? I think you referenced the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline as one option, but maybe you could quantify that a little bit more. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: in the prepared remarks, we said fourth quarter, you were 83% gas, 10% NGLs, and 7% oil. And we said in my prepared remarks by 2020 that the oil, we assume the oil will remain about constant. And the NGL volume's going to grow to about 30%. So you're going to be more like 63% gas, that's probably then going to be two-thirds to \u2013 or more wet gas to dry gas with a heavy 30% NGL. And then we've assumed a 7% oil mix. But I believe that's pretty conservative. And that's \u2013 as I mention right now, our plan is geared more towards retention and what we see without the ability to be able to drill more at the other locations. So that's how that'll transition. And... Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: And on the marketing side, we've got a lot of activities actually underway here, a lot of parts that we're working on. We're continuing to contract gas at or around Waha or near our assets. We're continuing to work on contracting gas down on the Gulf Coast, where we now have the capacity to transport 500 million a day starting in 2019. So we're working on marketing contracts at the Gulf Coast from that point forward. And then we're continuing to look at more gas opportunities as well as \u2013 for the longer term, as well as oil and NGLs. And so I think there's still a lot of work to do on the marketing side, both physically moving product and also selling that product or downstream products from those products. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. And then shifting to the other side of the world, there was some news earlier this week of some contracts signed to move natural gas into Egypt in a couple years out, at a price ostensibly greater than what Apache receives for its gas. I realize that Apache's price is probably a blend of a number of contracts and concessions. But how prominent are the opportunities to grow gas production on your concessions? And how interested would you be in investing or monetizing that in some other way? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: I mean there are definitely opportunities to move that forward. I mean I think we just added 40% to our acreage footprint. Most of our revenue comes from the oil side, quite frankly. And the way a lot of our concessions are structured and so forth, some of those prices are set. The Egyptian government has been very flexible and willing to step in and structure things that would encourage some development of some different types of things. So I think you'll see us continue to do that. And if it makes economic sense in relation to the oil that we're developing over there, we will do that. In general, we applaud the contracts to bring the gas in. I think it's a good thing for Egypt and the country and actually, it's very beneficial to us. So we're happy to see what's happening, both in the deepwater with the gas developments there as well as bringing in the gas that was recently announced. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. Operator : The next question is from Leo Mariano with MetAlliance (1:21:37). Unknown Speaker : Yes, hey guys. Just in terms of the Alpine High midstream monetization, recognize that it sounds like you guys are still contemplating various avenues here. But just try and think of it from a high level perspective. Is this likely to be an event you think that's going to come later in 2018, or more of a 2019 event? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: It could come any time in 2018 I would guess. I'll be honest with you. We made a lot of progress. We've had some inbound proposals that are fairly attractive. There's a tremendous amount of interest. And quite frankly, I think there's a lot of folks out there that realize this is going to be one of the most critical pieces of infrastructure in the Delaware Basin. And so I'm very optimistic that we'll be able to get something done and something that'll be very, very strategic for Apache. Unknown Speaker : All right, that's very helpful. And then just looking at kind of the Alpine High project and thinking about some of the splits that you threw out there in terms of hydrocarbon mix. You certainly talked about strong rates of return for your shareholders here. Just wanted to kind of think about some sensitivities there. Have you guys looked at kind of some of the downside cases, where if say you're getting $2 for the gas over the next three years and $20 for the NGLs, does the project still have kind of the right hurdle rates for Apache? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: It \u2013 the beauty of it is, is with the wet gas, you don't need the gas. Now you got a scenario where you have really low NGL prices and really \u2013 I mean obviously, as under a scenario where all commodity prices go way down, then it's a different story. But this thing's going to really hum below $2 on the gas side. And I think with what's going on on the Gulf Coast, with the expansion that's taken place in the petrochemical end, we look out to 2019, 2020, 2021, and we see a pretty robust NGL market, as well as the ability to get the gas to the Gulf Coast. So it's what sets this play apart is the cost structure. And ultimately, it's the cost to drill the wells that's going to be superior and the deliverability. And it's that combination with the liquid yields and the oil production is what makes it unique. And quite frankly that's what we know makes it differential. And the other factor is you're not going to have to move a lot of water in the lower zones. And that's another very differentiating fact. But, yes, we've run many cases on the downside. We would not be making this type of investment on the midstream or the upstream side if we thought there was a sensitivity that was close to anything that would come into making it not work under very, very low gas and NGL and oil prices. Unknown Speaker : Thanks, guys. Operator : The final question is from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Oh, hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for squeezing me in. John, you've given a fairly robust defense of the Alpine High in terms of the returns, the cost structure, and so on. And certainly, the production growth looks pretty impressive. Can you give us an idea of what you anticipate the cash flow growth to look like under your planning assumptions matching that? Because obviously it's going to be a function of basis differential and the prevailing gas price at that time. So what are your planning assumptions as you see going through 2020 in terms of cash flow growth? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: I think as you get out longer term and you see the expansion in the infrastructure that we see as being built and will be built, we don't see Waha continuing to trade at a big discount on down the road, because that will be solved. Part of it starts with the Kinder [Morgan] Gulf Coast Express Pipeline in 2019 and so forth. So I mean historically, Waha has traded at a, call it, $0.10 to $0.20 discount. Over the long haul, you're probably going to be in a $0.35 to $0.50 transportation cost differential at worst. You could \u2013 some scenarios actually see Waha become a premium, depending on what happens ultimately with Mexico and so forth and the West Coast. So we think, try to think, longer term with a project like this. We realize it's a little disruptive. If you look at last year when we were putting in a lot of our hedges, we were a lot of the market at Waha. And a lot of the reason why that differential is where it is today. We recognize that. So any time you bring on a world class play that's going to be a little bit disruptive, you've got to go through that time period till you can see through it. But I think as we get out to the timing, when we start to see the cash flows really ramp up here, the beauty of it is we will be solving some of the short-term obstacles that would stand in its way initially. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I appreciate the answer. My follow-up, I'm afraid, is a midstream question also. Because obviously this is a fairly pivotal event if you are able to get something done this year. Your CapEx guide assumes $500 million for midstream. And forgive me if I'm wrong. I think you had indicated you might see the same spend next year also. Are you pretty much done after that in terms of midstream build-out? And if you did manage to find a structure for the midstream, would that capital move off your balance sheet onto another entity, let's say? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Yeah. Well, first of all, next year's spend, we didn't guide to $500 million. We said it would be $500 million this year and $500 million in 2019 and 2020, split evenly amongst those two years. So you're really $500 million, $250 million, $250 million is terms of how we see it. But absolutely, Doug. We envision moving the future CapEx spend into the entity, where it will be able to do its own thing. So that would be the plan. And we're very confident we're going to be able to do something. I mean it... Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Really helpful. Thanks a lot, John. Thanks, guys. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Are there any closing remarks? Gary T. Clark - Apache Corp.: No, thanks, Thea. That'll conclude the call. If anybody has any questions, please call myself or Patrick Cassidy. And we'll look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the first quarter 2018 earnings call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. And I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Gary T. Clark - Apache Corp.: Good morning and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's First Quarter 2018 Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann; Executive Vice President of Operations Support, Tim Sullivan; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Steve Riney. Also available for the Q&A session are Mark Meyer, Senior Vice President, Energy Technology Strategies; and Dave Pursell, Senior Vice President, Planning and Energy Fundamentals. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 25 minutes in length with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our first quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. Please note the supplement was updated this morning to include information on our Permian Basin oil and gas marketing positions, which can be found on pages 22 and 23. On today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude noncontrolling interest in Egypt and Egypt's tax barrels. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause the actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before I get to the results, I want to take a moment to recognize a long-time Apache who has recently announced his plans to retire later this year, Kregg Olson, our Executive Vice President of Corporate Reservoir Engineering. During his 26 years with Apache, Kregg's leadership and expertise have been significant contributors to our long term success. On behalf of all of Apache, I want to thank Kregg for his years of service and wish him well in retirement. In light of this change, we have announced Dave Pursell, Senior Vice President, Planning and Energy Fundamentals, will lead our Corporate Reservoir Engineering function upon Kregg's retirement. This transition is already underway, and we look forward to introducing you all to Dave in the months ahead. On today's call, I will review Apache's first quarter progress and provide highlights from some of our key operating areas. Tim Sullivan and Steve Riney will then provide a brief review of our operational and financial performance during the quarter. And before moving to Q&A, I will conclude with our perspective on a few themes we have been hearing recently from the investment community. Apache is off to a strong start this year. In the U.S., we exceeded our first quarter production guidance through solid operational execution, shorter completion cycle times, improving efficiencies, and continued outperformance from new wells placed online over the last two quarters. The positive impact of these items more than offset volume losses we incurred from unplanned facilities downtime and adverse weather. As noted in yesterday's press release, we delivered record production in the Permian Basin. And the excellent progress we made during the first quarter has prompted us to raise our U.S. production guidance for both the second quarter and full-year 2018. Internationally, our leverage to Brent oil pricing contributed to improving margins, higher cash returns, and strong free cash flow. Production was in line with guidance, which remains unchanged for the full year. Moving now to specific region performance, beginning with the Permian Basin. Our results continue to improve, as we strive for best in class execution, leveraging the best technology advancements and insightful data analytics. In the Midland Basin, our current drilling program is focused on section and half-section testing and development in the Wolfcamp and Spraberry formations. We are delineating additional landing zones within our core fields and assessing other parts of our acreage, where we are seeing positive early results. In the Delaware Basin, outside of Alpine High, we are generating solid growth from our Wolfcamp and Bone Spring drilling program. We are drilling multi-well development pads, testing incremental landing zones, and evaluating additional prospect areas. Our plan is to sustain a three rig drilling program outside of Alpine High in the Delaware Basin. We have made excellent progress reducing well costs, increasing productivity, and driving higher returns in the Midland and Delaware Basins. We are deliberately operating at a measured pace, which is enabling timely integration of key learnings into our capital program. On many occasions, we have stated that production growth will be the outcome of our disciplined returns focused investment program. We are certainly seeing that in the Midland and Delaware Basins, where daily oil production has increased 37% since the second quarter last year and in the Permian Basin as a whole, where daily oil production has increased 19% over the same time period. Turning now to Alpine High, where progress toward a value optimized full field development plan is continuing as planned. As I indicated on last quarter's call, you can monitor Alpine High progress on three key fronts, well cost reductions, well productivity, and inventory expansion. First, we are making substantial improvements on well costs. Our objective is to decrease average well costs by 25% from 2017. During the first quarter alone, we delivered an average 20% reduction. Having already achieved 80% of the target, we have clear visibility into further well cost reductions through the remainder of the year. Second, we are focused on enhancing well productivity at the section level, which is the true economic unit we are seeking to optimize. We are now gathering data from two important half-section multi-well pad tests, which Tim will provide details on in his remarks. And third, in terms of drilling inventory, recall that we increased our risked location count to more than 5,000 locations at our October webcast update. At the time, we characterized this as a conservative view based on only six landing zones and relatively wide spacing assumptions. We have now confirmed hydrocarbon production from 11 distinct landing zones. And we are continuing to delineate these and other landing zones across Alpine High. We are also testing tighter well spacing and have seen some encouraging initial results. While we are not updating our location count today, we are confident that as field delineation and development progresses, the risked location count will increase substantially over the next several years. Alpine High is also making great progress on lease operating expenses. LOE was approximately $4.50 per BOE in the first quarter, and we are targeting a decrease to less than $3 per BOE by year end. As previously indicated, we are on target to drive LOE per BOE below $2 by the end of 2020. One of the primary factors behind our low cost structure is that the transgressive source interval in the Woodford, Barnett and Penn [Pennsylvanian] produces very little water, resulting in minimal handling and disposal costs. On the midstream side, our buildout at Alpine High continues, with additional infrastructure coming online as expected. Our strategic objectives this year include finalizing a JV, or partial monetization of the midstream enterprise, and reaching agreements for future oil, gas, and NGL take away capacity. Moving on to Egypt, we are continuing with a high destiny seismic acquisition and processing program across our expansive acreage position, which will greatly enhance our subsurface imaging capabilities. We believe this will uncover numerous meaningful opportunities to grow future oil production on both new and legacy acreage. In the second half of this year, we plan to commence drilling on our new concessions, which comprise 1.6 million acres. We are very excited about these concessions, which are geologically similar to our producing acreage in the Western Desert and are virtually unexplored. In the North Sea, we recently announced an impactful discovery at Garten in the Beryl area. We believe this discovery will yield a minimum of 10 million barrels of oil with potential to move significantly higher. Apache owns 100% of Garten, which will be a relatively quick and inexpensive tieback to existing facilities. This should have a positive impact on our 2019 and 2020 international production guidance, which we will revisit later in the year. In summary, we are off to a great start in 2018. Execution is very strong, and we are investing capital efficiently and strengthening Apache's overall capabilities to deliver more sustainable, higher returns over the long term. Now, I will turn the call over to Tim Sullivan, who will provide some operational details on the quarter. Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Good morning. My remarks will briefly cover first quarter 2018 production performance and capital efficiency, including drilling highlights and activity in our core regions. Operationally, we had a very good quarter and saw improvement in many key areas. We achieved first quarter company-wide adjusted production of approximately 367,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 6% increase from the same period a year ago and up slightly from the fourth quarter 2017. The Permian Basin remains the primary driver of our growth, where oil production increased 14% and total production increased 24% from the first quarter a year ago. This reflects the ongoing development of oil production in the Midland and Delaware Basins and the start-up of Alpine High. We averaged 16 rigs and four frac crews in the Permian Basin during the quarter, with seven rigs and one frac crew dedicated to Alpine High. In the Midland Basin, we have implemented a new completion design with more optimal stage and cluster spacing, which is contributing to improved early time well performance. We are fracture stimulating more lateral feet per day, completing wells faster and more efficiently, and realizing significant cost savings. For the quarter, we brought online 12 wells in the Wolfcamp formation with an average peak 30-day IP exceeding 1,100 BOE per day, consisting of 75% oil. Notably, we tested our first Wolfcamp C producer, which achieved a very encouraging 30-day IP of nearly 1,150 BOE per day, 70% oil. These positive results could open up hundreds of additional Wolfcamp C locations across our acreage position. Moving to the Delaware Basin, production at Alpine High averaged 26,300 BOE per day. Of note, we brought online our first multi-well pad in the wet gas window, the four-well Chinook pad, which delivered peak 30-day IPs averaging 5.2 million cubic feet of gas and 170 barrels of oil per day. The Chinook gas has an average BTU content of 1,350 and is currently recovering 50 barrels of NGLs per 1 million cubic feet of gas. This yield is expected to increase to 150 [barrels] with the addition of cryo. We are pleased with these early results, which will yield attractive economics, as well cost averaged only $6.4 million. A year ago, drilled on a one-off basis, these wells would have cost more than $8 million per well. We have made significant progress on our cost reduction goal at Alpine High, targeting an average completed well cost of $6.2 million for 2018. As we move to pad operations, we are realizing the benefit of increasing efficiencies and reducing well costs. On the drilling side, these include the use of less expensive spudder rigs to drill surface and intermediate holes; standardized casing programs, and, in many wells, the elimination of a casing string; and optimized bits and bottom-hole assemblies for specific areas. Completion savings include the ability to pump more frac stages per day, optimize sand loading to pattern size, and the use of recycled and brackish water. At the end of 2017, we placed on production the Dogwood pad, our first multi-well development pad in Alpine High's dry gas window. This pad has been producing for 119 days with cumulative production of 6.4 BCF. The stabilized production rate from the six-well pad is currently 62 million cubic feet per day, compared to the initial peak 30-day IP of more than 70 million cubic feet per day. Importantly, we have seen no interference between these wells at 660 [foot] spacing, which is a very encouraging indicator for tighter well spacing during full-field development. Keep in mind that our current 5,000 well location count assumes 925-foot spacing in the dry gas window and 800-foot spacing in the wet gas window. Other downspacing tests are in progress. Elsewhere in the U.S., production for the Mid-Continent region increased from the preceding quarter as a result of the recent completion of approximately eight net wells over the last two quarters in the SCOOP. These are showing strong performance. And this production uplift will allow us to hold Mid-Continent production flat or grow slightly year over year. Internationally, Apache remains the largest oil producer and most active driller in Egypt. For the quarter, Egypt adjusted production averaged approximately 80,000 BOE per day, down slightly from the fourth quarter 2017. We drilled and completed 28 operated wells with an 86% success rate. Of particular note, the Apries East-1X, a discovery in the Shushan Basin, found 280 feet of pay in the Shifa formation. The gas condensate reservoir flow tested 20 million cubic feet of gas per day and 2,400 barrels of condensate. This success sets up several development and follow-on exploration wells in the area. Our seismic acquisition is ahead of schedule. To date, we have acquired 710,000 acres of a planned 2.6 million acre seismic shoot, spanning four different basins in the Western Desert. Early results indicate the data will deliver a paradigm shift in imaging capability and reservoir characterization. Moving to the North Sea, production averaged 54,000 BOE per day during the quarter and was impacted by a number of items, including downtime associated with inclement weather, unscheduled maintenance and repair on compressors in the Beryl area, and periodic interruptions on the Forties Pipeline System. No new wells were placed on production during the quarter, which contributed to a sequential decline from the fourth quarter. As we have stated before, production in the North Sea tends to be lumpy on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but we are seeing some of the above conditions abate thus far in the second quarter. As John noted, an important highlight for the quarter was our discovery at Garten, which is located only 6 kilometers from the Beryl Alpha facilities. The discovery well encountered more than 700-foot of net pay from multiple zones. Drilling, completion, and tieback costs are estimated at approximately $60 million. And with minimum reserve estimate of 10 million barrels of oil, we expect very low F&D costs. To sum up, operationally, we are off to a very good start to the year and are focused on building this momentum in the quarters ahead. I will now turn the call over to Steve. Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Thank you, Tim. Let me start with first quarter results. As noted in our press release issued last night, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Apache reported first quarter 2018 net income of $145 million, or $0.38 per diluted common share. Adjusted earnings for the quarter were $124 million, or $0.32 per share, the most significant adjustment being a $39 million after-tax unrealized gain on our derivative positions. As John outlined, our U.S. production exceeded guidance by 4%, while international production was in line with guidance. Capital investment of approximately $850 million was above guidance, due to accelerated activity in the Permian Basin, primarily driven by more efficient completion times. There was also additional spending on our Garten discovery in the North Sea, due to a higher working interest than previously planned. Despite inflationary pressures, costs remained under control during the quarter. Nearly all categories of costs ended the quarter consistent with or better than latest guidance. Two specific areas of costs included accounting impacts for one-off type changes. First, G&A for the quarter includes approximately $10 million of non-cash charges related to a change in retirement policy. Second quarter G&A will include a similar amount of non-cash charges. Second, gathering, transmission, and processing costs for the quarter, reflect the reclassification of certain charges under the new revenue recognition rules adopted for 2018. This change has no net effect on results. In the past, these costs were netted against revenue. Now, they are recognized as an expense, and thus our reported revenues have increased by the same amount. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 47% on a GAAP basis. This is higher than most would expect due to the accounting treatment of U.S. taxes. We operate at a profit in Egypt and the UK and accrue taxes at the average effective tax rates of 45% and 40%, respectively. In the U.S., we operated at a small loss, which would normally bring the average effective tax rate down. However, uncertainty in realizing these benefits precludes us from recognizing them on an ongoing basis today. The result is that the GAAP effective tax rate is a bit high, but there is no impact on cash flow. Moving now to guidance. Following strong first quarter results, we are increasing full-year U.S. production guidance to a range of 250,000 to 258,000 BOEs per day, up from 245,000 to 255,000. Most of this increase is attributable to the Permian Basin. Our 2018 international guidance remains unchanged at this time. On the full year guidance for other items, we are making only one change, increasing cash taxes to a range of $175 million to $225 million. This reflects the anticipated income uplift from improving realizations for North Sea crude oil production. For the second quarter, we anticipate U.S. production will be approximately 248,000 BOE per day. And adjusted international production is expected to average 135,000 BOEs per day. This would result in 7% quarter-on-quarter U.S. production growth and 4% overall growth worldwide. We have provided second quarter guidance for a number of other items, but I will not cover those in detail. You can find them in our financial and operational supplement. Turning now to Alpine High midstream, we are currently operating 121 miles of gathering line, 33 miles of 30-inch trunk line, 34 central tank batteries, and 780 million cubic feet per day of inlet gas processing capacity. An additional 50 million cubic feet per day processing capacity expansion was planned for later this year. We are now looking at options to eliminate this expansion by bringing forward the mid-2019 planned start-up of the first cryo facility. We are actively working design and procurement for three 200 million cubic feet per day cryo plants. Once fully operational, these facilities will significantly increase our NGL volumes out of Alpine High, boosting overall liquids production from the play. Plans to joint venture or partially monetize the Alpine High midstream are on track and a formal process is underway. That process has drawn a significant amount of interest from a broad range of potential partners. And we are confident we will put some form of venture in place during 2018. I'd like to close by commenting on the steps we have taken to mitigate the impact of widening Permian Basin differentials. We recognized the potential issue over a year ago and have been proactive in addressing it through various strategies. We have in place a combination of basis hedges, sales contracts, and firm transportation to access other pricing points. We anticipate a relatively tight market situation will last through much of 2019, and that is the timeframe we have targeted for mitigation efforts. While we have some exposure to both price risk and product flow risk, we are taking actions and looking for opportunities to further mitigate both of these risks. Now, I'll turn the call back to John for some final remarks before moving to Q&A. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Thank you, Steve. Before we open the call to Q&A, I would like to comment on a couple of the recurring topics we have heard during recent interactions with shareholders and the broader investment community. With oil prices well above the baseline for 2018 planning, there is a lot of focus on what industry will be doing with the extra cash flows. For Apache, the answer to that question has to be based on the key elements of our plan for the year. Our 2018 base plan showed an approximate outspend of $700 million at $58 WTI, which was primarily driven by the Alpine High midstream investment program of $500 million. In conjunction with that plan, we outlined our desire to transact the midstream business in a way that would eliminate our ongoing funding obligation, while still leaving us significantly invested in the future value add from the growth that will come from the upstream. As Steve outlined, we are well into that process. And we are confident that we will execute such a transaction in 2018. That said, the timing and structure of this event are not finalized, and we will plan and respond accordingly. As such, our first priority for any extra cash flows in 2018 will be to close the cash flow gap with our overall capital program, including Alpine High midstream. When we have better visibility to full year cash flows and certainty around the midstream outcome, we will then consider other options, including the return of additional capital to shareholders and incremental capital investment. Another common topic is Permian Basin's supply growth, take away capacity, and the resulting impact on oil and gas basis differentials. Both oil and gas take away capacity is tightening as we move through the year and into late 2019. Basin offtake capacity is the main concern in this situation, and Apache is well protected through a combination of firm sales contracts and firm transportation solutions for the majority of our projected volumes. A related concern is the widening basis differentials that accompany a constrained market. Here again we have taken proactive steps through basis hedges and firm transportation commitments that will help mitigate the price risk. I won't go into the details here, but we have included a few slides in our first quarter supplement that describe our current Permian marketing position and hedges. Pipeline offtake constraints and differential widening will be a relatively short lived condition. The industry has been there before in the Permian, and these issues were quickly resolved, as Permian Basin intrastate pipeline capacity is comparatively easy to build. Over the longer term, the Permian Basin provides a tremendous opportunity for Apache to deliver attractive growth at high rates of return. We have the fourth-largest acreage footprint and plan to commit 70% of our capital to the basin over the next three years. That said, accelerating industry activity is creating significant competition for oilfield services and nontrivial operational challenges. In this environment, our priority is to protect and grow returns. We are operating at a disciplined pace with the objective to be the returns leader in the Permian with growth as an outcome. And with that, we are ready to move to Q&A. Operator : And our first question comes from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James. John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you. When I'm looking at the impressive cost reductions at Alpine High, you've already achieved kind of 80% of the target that you had, and you're really just starting to get kind of the impacts or the benefits from the pad development. I guess what's kind of been the biggest surprise relative to your initial expectations? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: John, I think it's just a matter of moving into pads, I mean the drilling analytics, and the things we've been able to do. We've originally said we thought we could get down to $4 million to $6 million. So getting to the $6.2 million target this year, we knew we would be able to achieve it. And I think probably just being able to get there as quickly as we have, given the inflation we've had on some of the small services. So I'm really pleased with where we are. I can tell you we see pacesetters daily coming out of there with all the analytics and technical tools we're applying. And I expect us to continue to drive those costs down. So it's a great story and is going to only get better. John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. And then when I look at Alpine High with basically you all averaging seven rigs and the one frac crew, once all the midstream is taken care of, can you kind of give me an idea kind of how that ratio of rigs to frac crews would you see changing kind of in 2019 and beyond? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean we're at a period right now where you're working both your frac crews and your rig counts, and they will be dynamic. We've actually got two crews in that region, one of them kind of bounces back and forth between there and the Delaware. So it's really not just directly, I would say, one. A lot of that's a function of the pad and the timing and how we're scheduling that. So over time, we would expect both. We've seen significant efficiencies on the completion side in the Midland. And I think you in general are going to see ratios similar to what we have, but probably in that same line. John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. And just the last one for me, following on the really impressive discovery at Garten, you all said you're going to revisit the international guidance on 2019 and 2020. Just maybe sort of an idea of kind of when you think you'd have enough information to at least preliminarily give some idea on how that changes numbers? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Garten is a very exciting discovery for us. And it will be material to our North Sea. I mean part of this will hinge on getting the well on and testing it, as well as evaluating how many other wells there might be there. This structure could \u2013 is more subtle and could be significantly bigger than the 10 million barrels that we have disclosed. So as the year progresses and we get to do more technical work, we'll come back with that sometime later this year. But it's going to have an impact positively in 2019 and 2020. John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I appreciate it. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein. Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for the disclosure on the gas positioning in the Permian. Can you talk \u2013 and you guys have thought about this, clearly, what are tactically some of the things you would do if gas production flow risk emerged? Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yeah, hey, Bob. This is Steve. Well, the thing is we are continuing daily with the contracting strategy for gas out of the Permian Basin and Alpine High. You see in the supplement we have 91% of our gas production planned for 2018. That's either on firm transport or is into gas sales contracts that require taking that gas. So really only 9% of our production volume that we have planned for this year on the gas side in all of the Permian is at risk to any type of a takeaway capacity constraint. And we work on that daily. We're looking at more firm transport, more opportunity to get product out of Alpine High and get it into other basins. As you know, there's a lot of activity out there in the market on that. And we're very active in all of those types of conversations. And I would anticipate there will be more activity on that as we go through 2018 and into 2019. We're also looking at \u2013 we're also \u2013 there are option \u2013 we do have two large pipes going to Mexico that run to the north and to the south of Alpine High. And we are looking at options and possibilities on moving product on those as well. Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And I heard your approach that by 2021, this is a \u2013 or 2020, 2021, this is something that the industry typically solves. How are you set up for 2019? Because you are growing gas fairly prolifically through 2019. Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yeah, we're still working on that. We've got the Gulf Coast Express that'll be coming online in the third quarter of 2019. That'll take care of a lot of the growth after that point. And then we're continuing to work the contracting side of this. As long as we have firm contracts to move our product with customers and they have the transport capacity, then our product will move. Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Morris with Citi. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you and congratulations, John, on some nice well results in the Permian and on the Wolfcamp C discovery. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Thank you. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: You mentioned that \u2013 you're welcome. You mentioned that at Alpine High you've now delineated 11 distinct landing zones. And you've had nice results from the pilots targeting the Woodford and Barnett formations so far. Can you say what other formations you'll be targeting this year with your drilling activity? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Bob, as we've said, we'll have about half of our program over the next three years will be in, primarily going towards retention, which is going to be predominantly Woodford and some Barnett. The other portion of that will be \u2013 is discretionary or what we call impact, and we will be testing and drilling some other wells. So you'll see us start to work up the column. You'll see us start to work the Woodford in the shallower areas, the areas where it's going to be more oily and more liquids rich. So we're excited about those. And there's stuff that's ongoing now and will continue. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then my follow up. Steve, you mentioned pulling forward one of the cryogenic processing plants into this year. And maybe I missed it. But how are you able to do that? And what is the timing? Because obviously that'll have a big impact on the liquids mix once that plant is in place. So if you could just, if you can, give any color on now what the timing of that will be to be in place? And how you were able to pull that forward? Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yeah, sorry, Bob. I may have misled you on that on that comment. To be clear, our original timeline for starting up the first cryo unit was mid-2019. And we're simply looking at an option for bringing that forward in 2019, earlier in 2019. We won't have a cryo unit online before the end of 2018. That's for sure. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. So that still has to pull forward. Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeoffrey Lambujon with Tudor Pickering. Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Looking at the overall opportunity set in the Midland, Delaware, and Alpine High and just thinking about long term activity levels, what's the right rig count or well count to keep in mind that gets you \u2013 again for the long term balance of optimally developing the resource, managing inventory levels, and also appropriately capitalizing when it comes to the infrastructure? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Yeah, Jeoff, I mean I think what we've stated is today we like our pace in both places. We've done some strategic tests at the half section level in the Midland Basin. And you're seeing the results of those that we're now integrating into the wells we're drilling now. So it's making a big impact by being able to incorporate the learnings and the data in the work we're doing. Ultimately it boils down to, how do you develop these sections? And we've got to get the completions fully optimized. You've got to get your patterns right, numbers of wells, and those things. And so taking the time to do it, taking the time to analyze the data, and then coming back, because you can always drill more wells, but you can't take away any that you drill. So we like the pace we're on there. I think we're going to be able to accelerate into that as time progresses. The second thing we're doing is you've seen, by getting out and testing the Wolfcamp C, we're testing other benches. And we're also testing other portions of our acreage that \u2013 when we've given our location counts in the past, we've been very conservative. We've got a lot of acreage in the southern Midland Basin there that's highly prospective and others would consider core, so some of that's continuing to test those. So you'll see us continue to ramp that activity over time. We can handle many, many more rigs than we're running there today, but we like the pace. And similarly at Alpine High. What's unique about it is we've got 6,000 feet of rock over a 70-mile area. And obviously we're doing what we need to do to earn and hold the acreage, as well as build the infrastructure. And a lot of that pace has been driven by the wet gas side early on, because that's what we need the infrastructure for, to process the wet gas. The oil is easier, and it's also in the shallower zones. So from a pace standpoint, we like where we are. I think when we get something done with the midstream, which we're confident we will do, it's going to give us some more flexibility. So we like the balance we have and what the whole portfolio brings. Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Thanks for that. And then my follow-up is just on the completions optimization you mentioned. Is there any additional detail you can give us on the Midland spacing and stage design side? Any comments on that? And if there's anything else to watch for in terms of testing in the near term would be helpful. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: In general, I'd say just keep watching our results. I mean we've done a lot of work with fiber and a lot of technology that is helping us with things we're doing. We're working on the optimization side. A lot of it has to do with the clusters and some things there, so \u2013 and spacing. Not necessarily just more sand. It's just placing it in the right places, doing things to understand our frac geometry and understand the reservoir. And I think once you align those two, you get smarter, and it helps you optimize. I don't know, Tim, if there's anything you want to add? Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Yeah, just a little color to add to that. Really it's allowing us to maximize our available pump time. And the cost reduction, we're seeing about a $220,000 cost reduction per mile of lateral length. So it's very significant. And then of course it reduces the time it takes to get our wells back online. But we've done early results, we've done dip-in fiber, and we've done some modeling work. And we're seeing equivalent or better inflow from these wells. And another thing that we've done also is we paid very close attention to our pad moves. And we've been able to take 20 hours off our pad moves from rigging down to moving to rigging back up. And with 42 pads a year, that's about two months of frac crew time that we can eliminate. Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Great. Appreciate the detail. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Yeah, hi. I have some unrelated ones. With respect to the monetization of the Alpine High midstream, are you still planning to keep a large equity stake, because you had mentioned that I think in the past? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Yes, John. I mean, clearly, when you look at \u2013 and Steve alluded to it in his comments. I mentioned it. We are deep in a process. It is going very well, and there's a tremendous amount of interest. I think the thing that we recognize is, is that this asset is unique, because of the column that we have. We've got 6,000 feet of pay. And really the value of this infrastructure is going to grow significantly over the next five, six, seven, eight years. And so unlike other midstream assets, where you're developing one or two zones, this has a built-in set of wells and capital that's going to drive value. So we will want to hang onto a large piece of the equity and keep that exposure, because ultimately it's our upstream capital that's going to be driving that. So we're very encouraged. I think we're going to be able to maintain control. I think we're going to be able to eliminate the future spend. And I think it's something that's going to be value accretive for our shareholders. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Okay. Great. Next one is on the improvements in the fracking that were mentioned. How much of it was development related, versus how much of it was design related to the well specifically? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, it's \u2013 that question, they go hand in hand. Because your design is impacted by your development. And I think that's the point is, is by getting into the pads with the pattern and the spacing test \u2013 and I'll say it again. We're doing a lot of things with fiber and a lot of high-end things with the micro size and others and the tracers, which is letting us better understand the frac geometries in what you're doing there. And I think those are the keys is understanding the rock, understanding the well spacing, understanding the number of landing zones. And as we've said, you take the rock. It's not as generic as everybody wants you to believe. You can move over in some areas. Wolfcamp A and B are separate. Some areas are going to communicate. You have to go in and do the work and test the rock and understand it. And I think once you start to grasp where the geometries are, then you can optimize those. So it really goes hand in hand, and it's why we stress the importance of the section and pad level development and return metrics. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Great. Last one on Egypt. When do you think you'll have all the seismic done and processed? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Yeah, it's going to take it \u2013 we're making good progress, but this is going to be ongoing for quite some time. And we've got two brand new concessions. We're highly excited about what it's going to bring on the new acreage, as well as what the new technology brings on our existing acreage. So you go back and look, Ptah and Berenice were two discoveries we had in late 2014, which really enabled us with the 25, 30 wells to pretty much keep our production flat on the oil side and grow it. So and that's really a strat trap sitting right under our nose out there. So we're really excited about what the new broadband is going to do. And \u2013 but it's going to be \u2013 it's something we're going to be doing for a while. I mean it's going to go on into 2019, 2020 potentially before we get all of it shot. But we're getting a lot of it back right now. We've high graded the areas. And it's going to have an immediate impact on our drilling programs. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Great. Thanks, John. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Morning, John, to you and your team there. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Good morning, Charles. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Yeah, I wanted to ask, to go back to these \u2013 the four-well Chinook pad. And that looks like it was one of the encouraging results out of Alpine High. And I'm wondering if you can elaborate a bit on if that \u2013 how those well results fit with what you expected going in? And I imagine you guys are still learning new things at Alpine High and will be for a while. And I'm wondering if you could talk about if your results at Chinook changed anything about the way you guys are seeing the resource there? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, the thing I would say about the Chinook pad, number one is, is in industry vernacular, those would be child wells, because we've already had parent wells in the section. So we're really pleased with it shows you the spacing assumptions. It shows with us getting into the pads. The cost is the big thing. We've always talked about the Woodford, and I think everyone acknowledges it's the best source rock in the world. And so the key here with us and what's going to differentiate Alpine High is going to be the cost structure. And so I think getting well costs down, starting to be able to put the patterns in place, and then seeing the results. And quite frankly, we still are working through the infrastructure build out and bring up. So we got a lot of things on last quarter, but we still don't have everything opened up fully. So well results, they look very good. They're very encouraging. I think spacing, we've been conservative. It kind of confirms we've been conservative on our spacing assumptions. And there's just a lot of rock and a lot of landing zones. And we're thrilled with the results, and those are short laterals too. So... Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Got it. That's helpful detail, John. And then secondly, this might be going a little bit further down the line. I appreciate your comments about how you guys are going to look at what you're going to do with the extra cash, if and when it shows up. But when you get to the point where you're evaluating adding to capital spending or adding to your activity levels, can you \u2013 do you have any thoughts you can share now about where in your portfolio those added dollars and added activity would go? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean clearly it's going to go into returning those dollars to shareholders. And then, two, it's going to go into the discretionary or what we'll call the impact areas. And those are going to be the oilier and more liquids rich portions of Alpine High or into our Midland Basin or Delaware Basin. So those are the areas. We've got a lot of very encouraging results. And we're going to have a pretty big pick menu to choose from, so very excited. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Thank you, John. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Morning, Brian. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Wanted to ask on the CapEx trajectory for the rest of the year, I think you highlighted that one of the reasons for first quarter CapEx being a little higher was some of the efficiencies that you're seeing. You maintained the full year budget. How do you see the rest of the year playing out? And is there a decision that would need to be made if those efficiencies continue in terms of letting that lead to higher CapEx, versus potentially reducing activity? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, first of all, we did come in a little hot. We ended up keeping 100% of Garten. That was the last well we drilled with the WilPhoenix. And I think we all celebrated when we finally ended that three-year rig contract, so that's going to be very helpful going forward in the North Sea on our CapEx numbers. But I mean honestly, one of the other factors is, has been the completion time. And as Tim alluded to, we've eliminated a lot of time in terms of between pad moves and things. And so one of the things is, is you're always seeking to strive that balance, completion crews with rigs and rig count. And efficiencies, they run in \u2013 they don't run in parallel all the time. And so our completions have taken a step forward. It's enabled us to choose some days off and pull some wells forward. And we will have a decision to make, if on the drilling side the pace doesn't quicken there, which that could happen as well. Then we will have a decision to make on, do we add another rig or two with our frac crews? So it gives you some flexibility. But we've got some time in the schedules right now. And later this year we'll have to make some \u2013 a decision on that. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. And then my follow up is back to the midstream monetization. Can you talk at all about the type of long term contracts or commitments that you need to make? And the longevity or magnitude of those to be successful with your monetization plans? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, I think first and foremost is, it's a very thoughtful process where there's a lot of due diligence being done on us, and we're doing a lot of due diligence on the potential partners. So you won't see big volume commitments. You'd see acreage dedication. And quite frankly, you'll see us controlling. So we're open to what the structure looks like. We recognize that the infrastructure investment really should sit in a different structure, where there is a different true cost of capital. We also recognize that we want to maintain as much of that equity as we can, because of the value we're going to create with our capital spend from the upstream side. So I think very creative in the parties we're talking with and the potential structures vary. So but I'm very encouraged by where we are. We're very deep into the process. There's a tremendous amount of interest. And we're very confident that we will do something very attractive in 2018. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Leo Mariani with Nat [National] Alliance. Leo P. Mariani - National Alliance Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Just wanted to follow quickly on the Garten discovery. You guys talked about having 700 feet of net pay there in multiple reservoirs. Obviously that's a very, very significant number. Is there any type of ballpark contribution that we should think about here? Can this thing do 10,000 barrels a day of oil as we work our way into 2019? Anything you can sort of say along those lines? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Leo, it's very material. I mean we have 700 feet of pay. This is in the Beryl sands, which is some of your most prolific sands there. It's got a lot more scope to the structure than something like Callater has. We did not find the water saturations. We kept drilling and quite frankly, we could've kept drilling deeper. So it's going to be pretty material. And we'll come back with that. We just haven't given any color or any guidance. But you see very high rate wells come on. This will be light oil. And it'll be pretty impactful to our Beryl area. And I think the important thing is we own 100% of it. Leo P. Mariani - National Alliance Securities LLC : All right. That's helpful. And I guess just (51:15) here. Obviously you guys talked about your methodical plan to really focus a lot on the wet gas in Alpine High in the short term. You got to get those volumes up to get the infrastructure sort of working. But as you kind of think through the three-year plan, just trying to get a sense of whether or not you start to see more of a shift to oil. Is that more of a 2019 move at Alpine High? Or is it more 2020? What can you sort of say about the way you progress the development in terms of phase? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean I think the important thing is, is we've got a very rigorous plan. And as we've stated, we've kind of put Alpine High in three settings. There's actually a couple more than that, but we put it in the Northern Flank, the Crest, and the Southern Flank. And two things I'll say. Number one, the Northern Flank, the acreage is more checkerboarded. So we're drilling shorter laterals. And we have more near term lease obligations. And also is where the dry gas window is at the bottom of the Woodford. So you've seen some of our early capital tilted there. As we move to the Crest and to the Southern Flank, we move up the column. And actually at Alpine High, if you remember, it gets a little cooler in the Southern Flank, which will also yield more liquid and potential for oil. So I think you're going to see just the Woodford and the Barnett, as time moves on, they're going to get more oily. They're going to get more liquids rich. And they're going to get more rich gas. Secondly is, as we've stated there is a lot of proven oil; we've shown that. We had five parasequence wells. There will be more. And quite frankly, with our discretionary capital, we will continue to advance those. And so we've said all along that we plan conservatively with Alpine High. And it will get more oily as time progresses. And you'll see more from us. Leo P. Mariani - National Alliance Securities LLC : All right. Thanks, guys. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good morning, John. Morning, everybody. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Good morning. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : John, I've got one on the Permian and one on Egypt, if I may. So starting with the Permian, the comment you made about Wolfcamp C and expanding the inventory. Obviously you're clearly doing the right thing delineating and securing your acreage in Alpine High. But at what point would you have greater flexibility? Because obviously, when you started this process, oil wasn't trading where it is with the kind of differentials we're seeing. So I'm just curious how you think about on a sort of one-, two-, three-year view, how your incremental spending will switch between the Midland/Permian versus the Delaware/Permian, given the increase, potential increase on location gap? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, there's no doubt over time you will see more from us on the incremental side. It's going to be going in two places. It's going to be going into the oil zones at Alpine High. It'll also be going into the Midland Basin. And part of that, Doug, is making sure we have the infrastructure in place in both places, where we are maximizing the returns. Because in the end, it's the returns that matter more than the top-line oil production. And so the beautiful thing about Alpine High is, is that we have exposure to dry gas, wet gas, and obviously oil, and a lot of rich gas. And clearly, as we get the infrastructure in place, and we get more of the infrastructure in the Midland Basin in place, then we're going to have the flexibility to toggle and put that in incrementally, where we think it's going to drive the best returns. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I don't want to labor the point, but obviously oil is up a bit. You've been extremely capital disciplined. But it seems you have a lot \u2013 like you did today. It seems you've got a lot more flexibility to pivot to the oil opportunities you have today. So are you sticking with your spending budget? Or were you tempted to pivot a little bit more to oil in the near term? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Today, what we reiterated is our spending budget. And we came in a little hot, as we said, on the completion side. And if we were to change that, we would obviously come back and give you some guidance on that. But today, that's what our \u2013 we increased our guidance on our current CapEx budget. It is going to be a little more oily because of the performance that we're seeing. And clearly, we've got things that we can do. So it's a good situation. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I appreciate that. Yeah. So my follow-up, and hopefully I won't take too much time on this. But a few years ago, actually probably it was seven or eight years ago, we published a detailed report on Egypt talking about how you had cracked the code of seismic and the legacy you had there and so on. And my question is really about in this oil price environment, I think most people think of Egypt as a cash cow to feed the onshore U.S. I'm just curious how you think about Egypt's relative competitiveness as potentially a more meaningful growth area. We don't normally think about conventional location turnout (56:36), at least I don't think U.S. investors do in the way \u2013 the context of the Permian. But what is the opportunity set like? And why wouldn't you accelerate, given the very favorable PSC you have over there? And I'll leave it there. Thanks. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean clearly, Doug, you hit on one of the key points. I mean Egypt is great rock. It's kind of Permian with conventional delivery. And clearly with two discoveries, Ptah and Berenice, we're producing tremendous volumes over a three-year period and still are today, about 30,000 barrels a day. We think we see Egypt as a place where we can continue to grow the oil volume and grow the cash flow. And so we think it's a place we can have our cake and eat it too. And that's why we are investing in a new state-of-the-art 3D, and I think it will uncover many, many opportunities that we can tie back into infrastructure. So we see Egypt as an area that in the future we can do both, grow and grow the free cash flow. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : John, how quickly do you get your money back in the PSC? John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: It depends on the well. Some of those are very, very short. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple quick ones on my end. I guess first on the Wolfcamp C result in the Midland Basin, commentary there of several hundred additional potential locations from that well. I'm just curious, like what other work you've done on your acreage to assess the Wolfcamp C? And what sort of follow-up activity we should expect on that front? Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Yeah, Michael. First of all, we're very excited about the well. There have not been a lot of Wolfcamp C wells drilled to date. Keep in mind that this is just a mile lateral and had good 30-day IP. But we've mapped the Wolfcamp C. And we've got tens of thousands of acres underlying it. So we feel very comfortable that we're going to have quite a bit of inventory that will spin off from this. But as I mentioned, it's very early days, and we're still evaluating. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Any plan in the near term to follow up that initial result with additional tests? Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Yeah, we're going to evaluate this well right now. This is at Azalea. And we've got other areas that we do want to test the Wolfcamp C as well. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Okay. And then another topic I guess, just following up on the infrastructure or the marketing detail you provided. On the gas side I'm just curious, those percentages that you provided, are those on current volumes, planned volumes? Or how should we think about those? Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Those are planned annualized volumes for 2018. For the full year. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Okay. And what are the term lengths on the contracts and dedicated sales? Any color you can provide there? Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yeah, they're all over the place. It's a whole portfolio of contracts, because this is the entire Permian Basin. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Sure. Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: What we provided in this, and just to be really clear, is that any contract that expired or would expire during this year is included in the uncommitted \u2013 that portion of it is included in the uncommitted production wedge. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Okay. Okay. That's helpful. Appreciate it. Thanks, guys. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Thank you. Operator : This does conclude our Q&A portion for today's call. And I would like to turn the call back over to CEO John Christmann for any closing remarks. John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, and finally, I'd like to thank you all for joining us today. I want to leave you with three key takeaways. First, Apache's off to a great start in 2018. We established a new Permian Basin production record, exceeded U.S. production guidance in the first quarter, and raised our outlook for the remainder of the year. Second, we are realizing greater capital efficiency through cost control and continuous productivity improvement. This is a direct outcome of our methodical approach to delineation and development, our application of technology, and our measured activity pace in the Permian Basin. And lastly, we are very pleased with our progress toward completion of an Alpine High midstream transaction, which will enable us to return additional capital to shareholders and/or increase our upstream investment program. That will include today's call. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to Gary and his team. And we look forward to reporting on our progress next quarter. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call, and you may now disconnect.",

My name is Natalia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Please limit your questions to one question and a follow up. Thank you. I would now turn the call over to Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin, sir. Gary T. Clark - Apache Corp.: Good morning, and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's second quarter 2018 financial and operational results conference call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann, Executive Vice President of Operations Support, Tim Sullivan, and Executive Vice President and CFO, Steve Riney. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 25 minutes in length with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our second quarter financial and operational supplement which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. On today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly-comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John. John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will begin with commentary on Apache's second quarter production results and our outlook for the second half of 2018. Then I will provide an overview of the progress we are making in our key regions. Tim Sullivan and Steve Riney will then provide some additional operational details and summarize our second quarter financial performance and guidance before turning it back to me for closing remarks and a comment on the status of our midstream transaction. 2018 has been a year of continued progress on important strategic initiatives and operational performance. On the operational side, we have made several significant advances including drilling efficiencies, strong operational runtime, base decline mitigation, new well outperformance and a step change reduction in Permian Basin completion costs and cycle times. All of these have contributed to our positive production trends year to date. This is most evident in our strong second quarter U.S. results, where solid execution and an increasing pace of activity enabled us to exceed guidance by 7,000 BOEs per day. The Permian Basin was the primary growth driver in the quarter with oil production in the Midland and Delaware basins up almost 6,000 barrels per day from the first quarter. As highlighted in last night's press release, based on this performance, we are raising our full year 2018 U.S. production guidance to 260,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and we are raising full year 2018 Permian Basin guidance to approximately 210,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Both of these are above the high end of our prior guidance, which was increased in May. In our international operations, second quarter production was roughly in line with expectations. We are updating full year 2018 guidance to approximately 134,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from a previous range of 130,000 to 140,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Despite a relative limited capital expenditure program, we have made tremendous progress this year in preparation for long-term growth in Egypt and sustainability in the North Sea. As we look further ahead, our progress this year brings us significant upside bias to our 2019 and 2020 production guidance, both in the U.S. and internationally. We will provide more detailed updates on this in the coming months. During the first half of 2018, we invested $1.45 billion in our upstream operations and approximately $230 million at Alpine High midstream. We anticipate maintaining an investment pace in the second half of the year that will bring our full year 2018 capital outlook to approximately $3.4 billion versus our prior guidance of $3 billion. The majority of this incremental capital is being directed to the Permian Basin where we are increasing investment to align and optimize our drilling and completion programs. Production growth will be an outcome of this investment. However, the primary objective is to deploy capital in the most efficient manner and improve rates of return. I will discuss these points a bit more in my regional commentary. A combination of higher production volumes and higher than budgeted oil prices this year provides more than enough cash flow to fund the incremental capital. Moving now to region performance, beginning with the Permian Basin. In the Midland Basin we remain focused on pad development in the Wolfcamp and Spraberry formations. Results are exceeding expectations as strategic testing continues to enable efficient and optimize full field development. Apache continues to make great strides on capital efficiency. We have implemented a significant change in our Midland Basin completion program which is delivering a step function reduction in both costs and cycle times. This saves about $400,000 on the average completion and has reduced cycle times to the point where we need to rebalance our drilling rig to frac crew ratio. We addressed this in the immediate term with a temporary holiday in June and July for one frac crew. As that crew returns in the third quarter, we will also bring two additional drilling rigs into the Midland Basin to rebalance our drilling and completions pace. This will primarily benefit production volumes in 2019. Addition of these rigs is the most operationally efficient, cost-effective and return-maximizing approach to development. It represents a significant portion of our incremental capital investment this year. In the Delaware Basin outside of Alpine High, we are developing the Wolfcamp/Bone Spring formations in our Dixieland area and delineating acreage in a slope play further to the north. The strong well performance we are seeing from this program is also driving the need for incremental capital to expand production facilities. Turning now to Alpine High where progress towards a value optimized full field development program is continuing as planned. As we described in the February earnings call, our 2018 Alpine High drilling program consists of pad and pattern development tests, ongoing geographic delineation and some required acreage retention drilling. We have chosen to effect a more material transition from one and two well tests to larger pad drilling this year. This has created longer lead times to first production and a completion schedule that is weighted more heavily to the back half of the year, but it is clearly the most efficient way to deploy capital into the drilling program. It is also accelerating our learnings, which we are incorporating into full field development. We've spoken in previous quarters about evaluating our progress at Alpine High through a framework of well cost reductions, well productivity and inventory expansion. And I would like to update you on those now. Beginning with well costs. We continue to drive well costs down despite ongoing upward pressure on service costs. We previously stated our goal of reducing average drilling and completion costs by approximately 25% in 2018. Year-to-date, our average cost per treated lateral foot is down by approximately 25%, so we are on track to beat our goal. In terms of well productivity, the next phase of optimization at Alpine High is underway and involves testing spatial positioning within and between target intervals. We are also making tactical refinements to landing zone targeting drilling longer laterals where practical and increasing the use of larger stimulations based on positive results we have seen from tests conducted last year. Results from these optimization efforts have been very good, and you can see that in the productivity of some of our recent wells. We will have more to say about this in the future. Lastly, in terms of drilling inventory, our location count today stands at more than 5,000 wells. Landing zone and spacing tests thus far have confirmed that this inventory count is conservative based on original assumptions. We will update this inventory periodically as strategic testing and optimization progresses. We are moving up the learning curve quickly at Alpine High and the transition to more pad drilling is accelerating this process. In 2018, we plan to place approximately 90 wells on production. As I previously indicated, our completion schedule is back-end loaded this year and will result in a steep production ramp in 3Q and 4Q. This ramp is now well underway. At the end of July, net production at Alpine High was approximately 54,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, representing a nearly 70% increase from the second quarter average. For 2018, our Alpine High production is on track to achieve 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is the midpoint of our previous guidance range. The benefits of pad drilling coupled with continual progress on well costs and well productivity are driving a positive bias to our production outlook for next year. As a result, we anticipate that 2019 production from Alpine High will trend towards the high end of the 85,000 to 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day guidance range that was established back in February. Turning now to our international operations, beginning with Egypt. Apache continues to generate strong drilling results and maintain relatively flat gross production rates in Egypt. We recently added a third new concession consisting of 650,000 acres in the East Bahariya area, bringing our total Egypt footprint to more than 6 million acres. Activity has already begun on our new concession as we are currently drilling our first two wells and have planned drilling activity on all three concessions before year-end. Apache is the largest oil producer in Egypt and our objective is to grow production and free cash flow there for many years to come. In the North Sea, we had a good quarter despite fairly limited activity. We are currently running two platform rigs, one at Beryl, along with one floater, the Ocean Patriot, which recently reset to a substantially lower day rate. Given the timing of our capital spending and well completion cadence, we placed only one new well on production during the second quarter, which led to flat production in the North Sea. With the implementation of an integrated water flood management program, we are seeing improvements in our underlying base decline rate in the Forties field. It is still early, but there is tremendous potential for improved recovery from this massive oilfield. Every 1% improvement in EUR represents 50 million barrels. Looking ahead, our next development well at Callater is scheduled to be on production early in the fourth quarter and our initial well at Garten is expected early in the first quarter. These two high volume wells will bring a significant increase in oil production and provide tremendous momentum as we enter 2019. Before turning it over to Tim, I would like to conclude with a few brief comments on our exploration activities. In Suriname, we have ordered long lead items in preparation for initiating a drilling program at Block 58, which is on trend with recent industry discoveries offshore Guyana. We also have a portfolio of exploration projects in various stages of evaluation where we are seeking large scale highly economic opportunities in the Lower 48 consistent with our organic growth strategy. With that, I will turn the call over to Tim Sullivan, who will provide some operational details on the quarter. Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Good morning. My remarks will briefly cover second quarter 2018 production and operations performance including drilling highlights and activity in our core regions. Operationally, we had a very good quarter and saw improvement in many key areas. We achieved second quarter company-wide adjusted production of approximately 390,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 16% increase from the same period a year ago and up 6% from the first quarter 2018. The Permian Basin remains the primary driver of our growth, where oil production increased 25% and total production grew 39% from the second quarter a year ago. These increases reflect the ongoing development of oil production in the Midland and Delaware Basins and the continued ramp up at Alpine High. We averaged 17 rigs and 4 frac crews in the Permian Basin during the quarter. In the Midland Basin we placed 22 wells online in the second quarter, all of which were on multi-well pads. Results are exceeding our expectations and the information we are gathering is critical to optimizing full field development plans. During the quarter, we drilled a number of notable pads, and I would refer you to our financial and operational supplement for more details on these results. Moving to the Delaware Basin and our Wolfcamp development in the Dixieland area, we placed on production 11 high-rate oil wells that are also in our supplement. We are seeing impressive results with only one mile laterals. We have two proven targets in the Upper Wolfcamp and plan to test two additional targets later this year. At Alpine High, our well connections are heavily weighted to the last seven months of the year. We have included a chart in our quarterly supplement that illustrates this cadence by month, which as John noted, will lead to a sharp production increase in the back half of the year. Also in our quarterly supplement, we have provided a slide that shows some impressive recent well results from key tests at Alpine High. Recent completions include a 12 well pad at Blackfoot, which is testing 660 foot spacing in three landing zones, all within the Woodford. The pad is currently flow testing 93,000,000 cubic feet of gas and 200 barrels of oil per day gross and is still improving as it continues to clean up. A three-well Woodford pad at Fox State testing longer laterals near the central crest with early flow back test rates of 19 million cubic feet and 321 barrel of oil per day gross and the Mohican #201, a Barnett wet gas test in the northern flank which recently flowed at 9.4 million cubic feet of gas and 420 barrels of oil per day. On the last call we noted the impressive production profile at our six-well Dogwood pad. This was our first multi-well development pad designed to assess down spacing potential at Alpine High. The Dogwood wells went online around the beginning of the year and continue to deliver at a stabilized gross rate of nearly 50 million cubic feet per day. This pad has been producing for more than 180 days with cumulative production of 11 Bcf, and we see no signs of interference. We believe that this performance on 660 foot spacing in the dry gas window has positive implications for future additional inventory in the source interval where we have assumed 800 to 1,000 foot spacing in our current location count. We continue to make progress on our cost reduction goals at Alpine High. In the northern flank and central crest, we are moving from single well appraisal drilling to pad development with a focus on cost reduction, lateral length and completion optimization to maximize net present value. For this year, we are targeting well costs below $1,380 per lateral foot, which is an approximate 25% reduction from 2017 costs. Our recent second quarter drilled and completed wells at Alpine High were ahead of target, averaging less than $1,260 per treated lateral foot. On the operating cost side, we are making great progress building out our water handling infrastructure. To supply our frac water needs, we have installed an extensive network of facilities throughout the northern half of Alpine High which significantly reduces our need for incremental new water sources and dramatically reduces our dependence on expensive trucking services. This includes 43 miles of water gathering and distribution facilities with five water recycling centers that are currently handling 90% of the produced water from Alpine High. During the second half of 2018, we plan to conduct tests in the southern flank of Alpine High to further delineate the play. Internationally, in Egypt we drilled and completed 35 gross wells with an 83% success rate. Noteworthy results are included in our supplement. These are high-rate oil wells with Brent index pricing. Our seismic acquisition in the western desert continues with the first surveys completed over the West Kalabsha and Shushan basins. To date, we've acquired close to 1 million acres of a planned 2.6 million acre seismic shoot. Early processing indicates a considerable uplift in imaging capability and reservoir characterization. Moving to the North Sea, production averaged approximately 54,000 BOE per day during the quarter and was temporarily constrained by maintenance on compressors in the Beryl area. Quarter-to-quarter production was flat as we brought online only one well. During the third quarter, North Sea operations will be impacted by annual turnaround maintenance which will reduce our production approximately 3,000 BOEs per day. This is planned activity which occurs every year at this time. Production is expected to bounce back and accelerate in the fourth quarter with the benefit of new wells scheduled to come online. We anticipate achieving our highest average production rate for the year in the North Sea during the fourth quarter. We just TD'd our fourth development well in the Callater field at Beryl's. This well logged over 580 feet of Cormorant pay with virgin pressure. We anticipate an online date in early Q4. This well should have a positive impact both on production and reserves. Apache owns 55% working interest. To sum up operationally, we remain on track for a good year and are focused on building on the success in quarters ahead. I will now turn the call over to Steve. Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Thank you, Tim. As noted in the press release issued last night, under generally accepted accounting principles, Apache reported second quarter of 2018 net income of $195 million or $0.51 per diluted common share. Adjusted earnings for the quarter were $192 million, or $0.50 per share. Second quarter financial performance was good across the board. Production volumes were strong as John outlined previously. Average realized oil price was over $69 per barrel as nearly 70% of our global oil production received Brent or Gulf Coast linked pricing. Costs remained under control as LOE, G&A, DD&A and cash taxes were all consistent with or better than latest guidance. Capital investments in the quarter were $833 million, bringing the first half total to $1.69 billion. As John noted, we plan to invest at a similar pace in the second half of the year, which will bring our total planned capital in 2018 to approximately $3.4 billion. This represents about $400 million of increased investment relative to prior guidance, which can be characterized as follows. The majority of the increase, roughly two thirds, is attributable to incremental drilling, completions and facilities investment in the Permian Basin including Alpine High. This reflects the two Midland Basin rigs we are adding in third quarter, the costs for longer laterals and larger stimulations in Alpine High and a slightly higher well count throughout the Permian due to the efficiencies in our drilling program. Approximately $145 million of the incremental investment will be at Alpine High and $120 million will be elsewhere in the Permian. For all of the reasons John outlined previously, these increases will maximize capital deployment efficiencies and will help drive incremental production in late 2018 but more materially into 2019 and beyond. Approximately $75 million of the additional capital is attributable to general service cost inflation in excess of what we budgeted for the year. The remainder is associated with a number of smaller items. This includes incremental investment at Garten due to a 100% retained working interest and upsizing the topside facility to handle larger production volumes. It also comprises long lead items for our anticipated Suriname exploration program and various other investments mostly associated with our unconventional exploration portfolio. With the combination of higher production volumes and improved oil prices, cash flows have been very strong. Our cash return on invested capital for the first half of 2018 was 20% on an annualized basis and we ended the second quarter with nearly $1 billion of cash on hand. We anticipate the recent price environment and our outperformance on production volumes will continue. Both will contribute to a strong cash flow performance for the year with full year free cash flow being better than originally planned even with the increase in capital investment. We will also likely see some small non-strategic asset divestments in the second half of 2018, which will further strengthen year-end liquidity. To summarize and expand on our production guidance, estimates for our third quarter volumes are as follows : total Apache adjusted production of 398,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 8,000 from second quarter; international adjusted production of 128,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 6,000 from second quarter, primarily due to routine maintenance activity in the North Sea; U.S. production of 270,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 15,000 from second quarter; Permian Basin production of 220,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 18,000 from second quarter; and Alpine High production of 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 18,000 or more than 50% growth from second quarter. We have also updated all of our full year production guidance. John referenced much of this in his remarks, so I will not repeat them. One thing I would note, clearly our U.S. production guidance reflects strong trends in performance. It could easily go unnoticed, but our international production has also done very well. Our updated guidance for international production is at the midpoint of our original guidance for the year. This includes a negative impact that the strong Brent pricing has had on our Egypt volumes. Without that price impact, our international volumes would have been near the top end of our original guidance range. Please refer to our quarterly supplement for information on all guidance updates. I will conclude with some views on how we are dealing with Permian takeaway and realization issues. We are clearly in a period of tightening takeaway capacity and therefore widening differentials. Ultimately, more takeaway capacity is the only solution. The entire industry is working on that situation and Apache is certainly playing our part. We recently announced material participation in projects involving oil, gas and NGLs. Good progress is being made and relief will start showing up next year. For the time being, we focus on the current situation day by day in a very pragmatic way. We take steps to make sure our product flows to market and gets the best possible realized price. We have included in our quarterly supplement a summary of our Permian oil and gas marketing positions for 2018 and now for 2019 as well. Let me touch on just a few things quickly. On the oil side, we had some success in second quarter by moving 12% of our Permian oil volumes from evergreen contracts subject to cancellation to term contracts. We now have 50% of our Permian oil for both 2018 and 2019 on term sales contracts that are backed by firm transport arrangements. As we outlined previously, approximately 30% of our production is West Texas sour. We continue to see very little flow risk with these volumes as they are sold to regional refineries specifically equipped to run sour crude. We manage the remaining 20% of oil production very closely and do not currently believe it will result in any production shut-ins. With respect to differentials, we added some Midland oil basis hedges in second quarter. We are currently exposed to Midland oil basis movements for just under 60% of our 2018 Permian oil volumes. In 2019, absent any further hedging, that will increase by about 10%. With respect to Permian gas, our risks related to takeaway and basis differentials did not materially change in the second quarter. Nearly 90% of 2018 volumes and over 80% of 2019 volumes are on term contracts or have access to firm transport to other markets. 65% of our 2018 Permian gas volumes are subject to movements in Waha or our El Paso Permian differentials. In 2019 this falls to just under 60% as new transport capacity becomes accessible. In summary, we see the current situation as transitory and are participating in some of the key solutions. We have heard the discussions and in some cases seen decisions to reduce Permian rig count. We see this as a logical choice for those at risk of materially curtailed production. We do not anticipate that situation for Apache. To the contrary, we believe the long-term value created by advancing progress at Alpine High and other Apache assets in the Permian Basin more than offsets the potential impact of short-lived weaker basis differentials. Consequently, absent a significant change in the basis differential outlook, we will not materially revise our planned capital investment and we will most likely stay the course. Now I'll turn the call back over to John. John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Thank you, Steve. I would like to sum up by emphasizing that 2018 has been an exceptional year thus far in terms of strategic progress and operational execution. The capital efficiency of our drilling and completion programs is improving throughout the Permian Basin. We are running at an optimized activity level and pace demonstrating good cost discipline and generating high rates of return. At Alpine High, now we have our primary infrastructure in place and are in the early stages of a significant long-term value accretive production ramp. We are seeing some excellent well results and our cryogenic processing is on track for a mid 2019 start-up, which will drive a significant increase in liquids production, cash margins and returns. In the Midland and Delaware Basins, our wells are outperforming and unconventional oil production is the primary driver of our U.S. production guidance increase this year. Notably, in less than one year, we have completely replaced the 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of the vested Canadian production with Permian volumes. This strategic portfolio rotation is positively impacting our margins and is a great example of Apache's returns-focused portfolio approach. We continue to generate substantial free cash flow in Egypt and the North Sea as these regions benefit from premium Brent crude prices as well as higher realized NGL and natural gas prices than the U.S. And lastly, I know that many of you are curious about the status of our midstream business. We have been engaged in a very thoughtful and deliberate process with regard to creating and realizing value for our Alpine High midstream assets. As you have seen in our recent announcements, we have secured equity options in five transportation projects that will move oil, gas and NGL to the Gulf Coast from the Permian Basin. These options are very strategic for Alpine High, Apache and the Delaware Basin in general. We have worked the timing of these options to coincide with consummation of a larger midstream transaction to leverage their fully integrated value potential. We are in the advanced stages of a transaction that we anticipate will close before year-end and we'll come back to you with more details on this as soon as practical. And with that, we will turn the call over to Q&A. Operator : Your first question is from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Question on the Alpine High. In the past, in recent past, you've guided toward the typical Alpine High well at say, 9 to 15 Bcfe, that upper range, 16 to 21 Bcfe. But those were at 4,400 foot laterals. So my question is two part, one, how should we think about these more recent 8,000 foot laterals in terms of EURs? And two, can you guide us directionally toward the typical well versus the upper range well? Where are the arrow bars on what those EURs could ultimately be? John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Bob, good morning. It's a great question. I will tell you that we are early in changing the completions, as we've alluded to. That's one of the reasons on the capital side. We now have enough data going back to last year that confirms some of the strategic testing on the larger fracs is making a bigger impact as well. And so we're kind of shifting gears and we're early in those and for now I want to leave those because our location counts all kind of tie back to that. But we will be coming back with, as we get some more of these wells on and we do some more testing, you're going to see numbers go up as the productivity improves. So we'll come back to you with those and update, in general, the whole impact of that. Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: But should I think of things in terms of EUR per foot or should I just wait? John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: EUR per foot, I can tell you, we're seeing is translating pretty equivalently. So the longer laterals are going up on the lateral side, but I think with the opportunity to see even more changes is going to be on the completion designs which we're about to start doing on some of these pads. So for now, lateral foots, you can probably translate to what we've shown. But we'll come back to you when we've got more data to prove it. Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Quick follow up. What are you doing exactly to save $400,000 on the completion side? Is it efficiencies or technology or some combination? Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Bob, a lot of it is just operational efficiencies. On the completions side, we've really been able to reduce our pump time substantially. We're drilling out our plugs even quicker and we've even made progress just on frac crew moves. And this is related to, it's given us a 20% reduction in our cycle time, which is on a mile and half lateral is about $400,000 savings. So it's primarily just completion efficiencies. John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: And, Bob, I'll add to what Tim just said. If you go back, I mean we realized in early May we were running into it was going to create some challenges. And the good news is, we set a frac crew down in the Midland basis for two months, both June and July, and still been able to come in ahead of guidance on the numbers. So I really have got to give a lot of credit to the operational folks and the teams for the progress that we're making. And we said this would happen. I mean this goes back to the strategic testing we did last fall when we started doing pads on half section tests in the Midland Basin, you're seeing those results and now you're seeing us also doing similar things at Alpine High. So really, really credit to the field folks and the engineers and technical support. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James. John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi, guys. John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Good morning, John. John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So the first question related to Alpine High midstream, and I'm just wondering if you can kind of talk about how you sort of think about the trade-off with any potential deal where you're trying to remove future CapEx while also trying to retain as much equity as possible given the knowledge that, as Alpine High volumes ramp pretty dramatically in the next few years, the value of the Alpine High midstream goes up considerably as well. John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean in a lot of ways you just kind of answered your question. But I'll say a few words here, a little more than in the prepared remarks. We're deep in the process and we are very confident that we will get something done by year-end. Clearly the number one objective has been to remove capital from where it's competing directly with our upstream capital, which and moving it into a separate funding vehicle, which we will do. The second thing, as you pointed out, we want to maintain as much of this enterprise as possible purely because number one, I think everybody's going to figure out that it's much more valuable to Alpine High, to Apache, and even the whole Delaware Basin than people realize. And secondly, we see that value as growing and accreting significantly over the next several years. So we'd like to hang on to as much of it is possible from that standpoint. On the timing, we've had to kind of coincide this with some of the equity options that we've been announcing and as we alluded to in the comments, there's now five of them, so we've kind of had to run those in parallel paths. But we're now deep into the throes and clearly we want to be able to hang on to as much of it as possible. John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, John, and then my follow-up, just on looking at the revised CapEx budget, the changes on the U.S. side makes perfect sense. When I'm looking at the international CapEx number, which actually didn't change despite the increased kind of fast tracking on Garten, and then what's happening with Suriname, is there some other areas internationally that either are getting less capital than previous or you're just doing better on some costs? Or just, what allowed international to stay flat despite what's happening with Garten and Suriname? John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: I think that's just kind of in the round off. I mean the big thing is capital is actually going up in the North Sea with Garten as we now have 100% of it. But the other thing is, some of it's timing of the Ocean Patriot and we've reset that rig contract now to a significantly lower number than we've been burdened with the last three years. So it's kind of getting caught in the round off there, but it actually has gone up as we accelerate Garten on the capital side. John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks, John. Nice quarter. John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Good morning, John, to you and your team there. John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Good morning, Charles. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: I wanted ask a question about the Blackfoot pad and what you guys are seeing on the early flow-back there. I know you talked a little bit about in your prepared marks and you put some stuff in your slide presentation. But I wonder if you could share any more color on where you are on the flow back of that pad, if you're almost done cleaning up or you're still in the early stages of cleaning up on some of those wells. And what, if anything, you're seeing between, what kind of variation you may be seeing between the upper Woodford landing zones and the lower Woodford landing zones? John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, Charles, I'll say it's dynamic. I mean, first thing is as you know, this is 12 wells in the Woodford in a half section. So this would translate into a full section of 24 Woodford wells only, which is a lot. They're on 660 foot spacing. We are not seeing any interference. I will tell you, it's is very, very dynamic and we're very early. In fact, we went to print yesterday with our numbers and this morning, the Blackfoot now is at 102 million a day from the 93 that we had in there. So that shows you kind of the trajectory that it's on. We still do not have everything unloaded. So it's climbing very well. It's performing very strongly, so we're very, very excited about what we're seeing. And changing quickly, so tomorrow I'd have a different answer for you. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you, John. And then on the other side of the Permian, I wondered if you, Tim went through a lot of detail on how you've changed your, not just your designs but also your operational pace on that side. And I wondered if you could talk about the Lynch pad, which is that 8 well pad in the Wildfire area that you guys brought online. It had some good rates, but is that benefiting from these new designs, the new approach? Or maybe just add a little color to what was happening there. Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Yeah, on the Lynch pad, it's an 8 well pad that's in the Wolfcamp B. And this was really a spacing test. We did some 10-bys and 8-bys in this pad, 7,300 foot lateral length. And you can see the rates are good, 1,275 barrels of oil equivalent per day and mostly oil from the IP. And we continue to do spacing tests. We've got another 10 wells that are online and some of them are Wildfire as well, very early stages of flow back, but they are on 6-by spacing. So we'll share results with you about that next quarter. But these are spacing test wells in the Wolfcamp B and we're going to compare them to 6-by next quarter. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: And so, I'm sorry, just real quick clarification, Tim. The 10-by spacing, so that's spacing equivalent to 10 wells across a section? Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: That's correct. Part of the pad is 10 wells per section spacing and part of it's 8-by. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you, Tim. Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: You bet. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Good morning, guys. John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Good morning, Scott. Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. Can you talk about how you're looking to go about Alpine High right now? It sounds like you're starting to move into some optimization based on what you've seen. But I know early on you were trying to do things like separate various factors, right, lateral length, frac that you're putting on this to get a good sense of really what's driving performance. Where are we with that? And how does that sort of drive you for these 60, 70 completions you've got at the end of this year and maybe into 2019? John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean, it's exciting because now we've got data and we've been deliberate on those tests. And as you've correctly noted, we weren't moving many dials, except one usually for a reason, so we have a good baseline. It's clear to us now that we're going to be increasing the frac size. It's clear to us that we can go tighter with the current frac designs. And now, we're moving into the pattern and spacing tests, where we're testing things between zones, between formations, both aerially, spatially and so forth. And so, now you'll see us start to move some of those dials as we crank up the completions. So we'll continue the very deliberate process. It just takes time to do it right. If you jump out there and go drill too many wells and pump too big of fracs and you get a lot of interference, then you got to go back and try to figure out how you unwind that. And so, what we've been is very deliberate with it and we're moving into that next phase. And we've got a plan. We've stuck to it and you're starting to see the benefit come and we're really excited about the results and the learnings that we continue to incorporate. Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : All right. Great. Appreciate that. And a follow-up on the Egypt, with some of this enhanced seismic imagery you've gotten back, it sounds like you got some of it back, how much now maybe you had it in your hands to take a look at it? And what are you seeing now versus maybe what you had thought of it going into it? John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, I haven't seen the new data. I've seen snippets of the new data. We've actually compared it to some of the 2013 vintage stuff. I'm looking at one of my ops guys over here, but I will tell you, I've heard now we're seeing some fault lines in some of our existing fields, which probably sets up more drilling, so you could see some things at Ptah, Berenice. I'll be over there in the fairly near future. We'll get to review some things, but we're excited about it. It's what we thought it would be. It helps us see image better, the subsurface, which is going to lead to more wells, stronger results and a better understanding. And plus, we're going to have a better handle on some of the recoveries and things. So, it's a whole new lens and it's going to be very helpful. Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks for that. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jeoffrey Lambujon with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. My first one is on what I guess a midstream monetization could mean for the budget this year. Are you able to eliminate some of the planned incremental spend with a deal and for parts of the budget that have been spent ahead of an announcement or a closing? Is there an opportunity for rebates or reimbursements for at least the Alpine High piece? John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Jeoff, obviously, we could make it look however we want to look. I mean, we could take a lot of cash out. We could eliminate capital and we could make the effective date whenever, whatever we want that date to be. So we've made pretty clear in here that our CapEx guide for the year-end still includes 100% of the midstream spend. We've made it clear that getting something done could pull some of that back and there's opportunity there. So I'll just say wait with us. It's going to have an impact but wait with us until we're in a position to disclose more because we're deep in the process, so. Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Got it. And then just digging into the incremental Alpine High piece by itself, should we think of that as all or just maybe primarily longer laterals and completion enhancements? Or is there a portion related to midstream spend that was accelerated into this year from next year's plan initially? John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: It was a little bit of the midstream that we were looking at trying to accelerate cryo, but as we've said, most of the two thirds of the CapEx increase is going into drilling completions and it's new activity. When we made very clear that two thirds of it's new activity that will be incremental. Most of it is this back half of the year, which is why it'll impact 2019 and 2020. There's a little bit of impact on 2018, but not much. There has been a little bit of inflation, about I'd say just under 20% is, and we budgeted a 10% to 15% rise, but anything that has to do with trucking, people, steel, or chemicals, there are some headwinds out there. And so there's a portion of it that's tied to that. And then we mentioned some on the exploration side, so. But most of it's new activity and two-thirds of it in Permian and it's new activity. Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Thanks. You're gathering a lot of water at Alpine High. Are you going to be able to recycle any of it? John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: John, everything we're gathering, we're recycling. And the beauty of our transgressive source center rolls, it doesn't produce very much. So it's really the frac water that we're gathering. We produce it back, is load, and then we recycle it and reuse it. So I'll let Tim jump in on some more details. Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Yeah, we've currently got five water recycling facilities out there and we are currently recycling about 90% of our produced water right now. That really is only about half of our frac water needs currently. So we do have to have makeup water and we do use brackish source for that. But by year-end, we feel like we'll be able to utilize about 80% of recycled water for our fracs. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Okay. Great. Next one for me is on Dixieland. You had slightly stronger well results in the first quarter at Burnside and one other, and I was wondering how much heterogeneity do you have? Like Burnside and Bull Run were a little bit stronger than some of the other wells. So I'm not worried about everything always staying at the same level, but I was wondering how much heterogeneity do you see since you're basically doing similar type completions? John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: So, John, as you know, that's why we talk about Bone Springs and Wolfcamp as being pair sequences. Geologically, you have heterogeneity. Tim, do you want to add anything specifically to that area? Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Yeah, I mean, we only have seven sections there. It's not like it's a big area, so it's fairly consistent. We've got two proven landing zones. We will be testing two additional landing zones out there. We brought 20 wells online here in the first half, 11 in the second quarter, and they're about 1,500 BOE per day. And these are just mile laterals, actually 4,400 foot laterals. So it's been a very, very economically attractive program for us. So we think we've still got a pretty bright future for the next couple years. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Okay. Great. Thank you. John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning. John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Good morning, Brian. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: In Alpine High, how do the results of some of the efficiencies, lateral length and spacing tests in areas like Dogwood change the relative rates of return and prioritization of the wet gas versus dry gas drilling? And how, if at all, does that influence your focus areas over the next few quarters? John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean if you look at the wet gas, dry gas, the breakevens on the wet gas are still going to be much better just because of the amount of the liquids. So it won't really change the pecking order there, but what it really changes is is number of wells we need to drill and some of those things in terms of the plan. So it can change the cadence and the sequence as you look at the capital that's going to the, what we'll call, retention wells versus the impact wells. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you. And then you've highlighted across the portfolio, but particularly in the Alpine High various efficiencies. And I wonder if you could talk about where you see these efficiencies going from here, whether we've just had a surge or whether you think this pace is going to continue. And how do you draw the line on when you let those efficiencies play through to higher CapEx versus just choose to become more narrowly focused within the portfolio? John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean I think if you look at our Permian, Brian, we've been running 17 rigs since the second quarter of last year. And so we're at what we think's a pretty darn good baseload. Clearly the frac efficiencies took a step function forward and we've seen that. Now we're seeing the drilling time and the footage take a step function move forward, so this is a continual ebb and flow as you continue to get better reduced cycle times and so forth. But if you step back and look at our program and then you look at the results over the last year, Permian's up 39% year-over-year and oil's up 25% year-over-year and we've been pretty steady on the program. So what's changing at Alpine High is the completion design and more on the spacing tests, but when you look at the size program we're running, you look at the size cash engine that we're building to fund it, those are the things you have to factor in and you have to continue to integrate your learnings and be continuous improvement. And we stress to our folks to continue to get better in everything we do. And so you're going to have times where we're going to have to make adjustments as we continue to incorporate learnings. But it was a pretty easy call here as we look at what the engine for this thing looks like going into 2019. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Is it fair to say that if there is a free cash buffer to offset efficiency driven or even inflation driven increases in CapEx with no further change in activity, that that would be sufficient for you to further increase your budget? John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean I don't think you can assume everything on the free cash side goes to budget, right? I mean what we're trying to do with our efficiency programs and what you've seen with the size is ultimately it's returns and value driven. And so that's the big factor. I mean, you look at our activity, it's really hasn't changed and it's not going to change much going into the fall. We've got to sprinkle a few rigs in to kind of keep it there with the frac crews and so forth. But we're getting to a point in the, we get the midstream deal done in the very near future with the engine that we've built that we actually see free cash flow. And it puts us in a position where we can start to truly, for the first time since coming out of this downturn, we can look now at other things to do. And those are things that we're very excited about because we can see a pathway to it, pretty near future. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Leo Mariani with National Alliance Securities. Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities : Hey, guys. I was hoping that you could delve a little bit more into some of the exploration efforts that you guys alluded to on the call. You guys did mention kind of an unconventional U.S. exploration program. Just trying to get a sense of maybe what the dollars are that are exposed to that in next year's budget. And also was hoping for a little bit more detail on Suriname in terms of when you guys might spud a well there. What's your working interest there, as in what do you see as the potential in Suriname? John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, a couple things, Leo, and thanks for the question. I mean, number one, I'll address them kind of in the order. On the unconventional side in the U.S., there's not a lot of dollars. What we're looking for there is large impact, large scale opportunities that are in various stages that we could acquire at low cost. And much like when we put something like Alpine High together, we put together 350,000 acres out there for less than $1,300 an acre. So it would be those types of things, but there's not a lot of capital at this stage but if you're looking in the right places, it doesn't take a lot of capital to go a long way. So not a position to say a lot more than that, but we do have some things we're working on on the unconventional side. As it relates to Suriname, clearly what we've said, we've got 2 blocks in the offshore there, Block 58, we own 100%. It's about 1.4 million acres. We have 45% of Block 53. We will definitely commence a program in 2019 and we've started to purchase the long lead items. We got the 3D back and we're very, very excited about the potential. We're on trend with the success that's happened across the water boundary in Guyana and it's exploration that could be very, very impactful for Apache and currently today we own 100% of it. Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities : All right, guys, thanks. John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Your final question is from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, John, good morning. I got a couple to close us out here, it looks like. My first one is on Egypt. As we understand it, in the last six or nine months, the government's gone through quite a lot of change in deregulating its gas market. It's removed subsidies from local industrial prices. You know everything that's going on there, and it's incentivizing exploration. I'm curious if any of that is filtering through to what you're doing, especially in your new concession, how you see the prognosis for seeing us maybe starting to see an uplift in your exploration activity translating to higher price realizations? And then I've got a quick follow up, please. John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean I think the key for us, Doug, is number one, all the activity, all the gas coming on has been very beneficial for Egypt, which is a good thing, and that translates into the country's just financial wherewithal. So things are going extremely well. I think the key for us is, is we've been able to pick up new concessions for the first time since 2006. We're shooting a large 3D. We're in between areas where we know there are big structures and really, really fertile ground. So we're very excited about that. We're excited about the opportunity to continue to grow the free cash flow and we think we can be in a position to also grow our volumes in Egypt, and especially on the oil side. So I think in general, it's a very promising environment for Apache and things are going extremely well and we're very excited about the future. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just to be clear, has the new exploration acreage come with come with different terms as it relates to realized gas pricing? John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: All the concessions are, you bid those. The thing I will say is, is we've kind of stuck to our guns historically, which is why you went through a drought where others came in and picked up other concessions. We've stuck to our guns in terms of how we've approached it. So we feel good about that. We feel good about the new concessions, and we like the terms. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Understood. My follow up, if I may, is just jumping back to Alpine High very quickly that it's kind of a follow-up to Bob's question earlier about the 4,500 foot laterals and getting bigger and so on. Clearly it seems that there is upside risk to the guidance you gave us a couple years ago. How would you think about what that, how that translates to your production profile through 2020? Do you have lower decline rates by choking back the wells, for example? Do you have faster acceleration? Just if you could characterize how all of that plays into the infrastructure plan and so on, and I'll leave it there. Thanks. John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, we have just a tremendous resource. And as we've said on today's call, we would tend to the high side of the previous guidance that we gave earlier this year. And clearly, productivity is improving. Wells are performing extremely well. We're shifting to pads. So I would just steer to the high side numbers as it relates to 2019 is what we've said now and we'll come back with some updated numbers as the year moves along. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great stuff. Thanks, fellows. Appreciate you taking my questions. John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Thank you all. I just want to wrap up and like to leave you with three key takeaways from today's call. First Apache had another great quarter. We exceeded guidance and raised our 2018 outlook. Second, looking ahead to 2019 and 2020, there is a significant upside bias to our production outlook due to the added capital, which will benefit primarily 2019 and 2020, the capital efficiency improvements and strong well performance all in our Permian Basin. Additionally, total capital spending is likely to come down in 2018 to 2020 with the completion of our midstream transaction. And lastly, at Alpine High, we are seeing very good results from our strategic tests and production growth has entered the acceleration phase. I look forward to sharing our ongoing progress with you in the future. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Clark - Apache Corp.: Good morning and thank you for joining us for Apache Corporation's Third Quarter 2018 Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. We will begin the call today with an overview by Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann. Tim Sullivan, Executive Vice President of Operations Support, will then provide additional operational color. Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO, will summarize our third quarter financial performance. Also available on the call to answer questions are Apaches Senior Vice Presidents : Brian Freed, Midstream and Marketing; Mark Meyer, Energy Technology, Data Analytics and Commercial Intelligence; and Dave Pursell, Planning Reserves and Fundamentals. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 25 minutes in length, with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunctions with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our third quarter Financial and Operational Supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website, at investor.apachecorp.com. On today's conference call we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt's tax barrels. Finally, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discussed today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John. John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Good morning and thank you for joining us. On the call today, I will discuss Apache's strategic positioning, provide a preview of 2019, comment on our strong third quarter performance and review our key focus areas. Apache is a very different and much improved company from four years ago when oil prices began their prolonged downturn in the fall of 2014. We acknowledged very early on that the industry including Apache needed to make significant changes, not only in terms of reducing activity levels and overall cost structure, but equally to reestablish long-term returns discipline in the capital program. At that time, we chose to significantly curtail our drilling program, allowing production to decline rather than pursue growth in an environment where commodity prices and costs were not properly aligned. We refrained from participating in high-cost acreage acquisitions in the heart of proven plays, choosing instead to build our unconventional exploration capabilities An important outcome of this strategy was the discovery of Alpine High. We have frequently stated our philosophy that an E&P company should be capable of living within cash flow from operations, generating sustainable long-term reserve and production growth while also returning capital to shareholders. After significant upfront investment at Alpine High and the pending completion of our Altus Midstream transaction, Apache has turned the corner and is well positioned to deliver on this philosophy for many years to come. We continue to generate steady production growth on a flat activity set and are poised to deliver positive free cash flow in 2019. This can be sustained over the long term through development of our extensive inventory. It will be supplemented by organic exploration, including discoveries in hand today, and a refreshed portfolio of new opportunities. Lower F&D costs, increasing returns and continual portfolio hydrating will accompany our growth and drive sustainable shareholder value growth through time. This is the investment proposition Apache offers and it is one that we strongly believe in, as evidenced by our decision to begin repurchasing shares in September under an existing authorization. Recently, our Board of Directors approved a new authorization for the repurchase of 40 million shares, which represents more than 10% of shares outstanding. Now I would like to provide a preview of 2019. For more than a year, Apache has operated at a relatively constant upstream activity level, which has enabled us to deliver operational efficiencies, effectively control costs and generate sustainable liquids production growth. We anticipate maintaining a similar activity level next year, but on a lower capital budget. If changes in expected cash flow dictate, we have the flexibility to reduce our activity levels accordingly. In 2019, assuming commodity prices in line with the current strip, Apache expects upstream capital investment of approximately $3 billion, which is consistent with our current guidance and is lower than 2018. Adjusted production at the high end of our 410,000 to 440,000 BOEs per day guidance range, representing more than 15% growth in the U.S. and 10% growth overall, positive free cash flow and continued return of capital to shareholders. This is well-aligned with the philosophy I outlined at the beginning of the call and we look forward to providing a more detailed 2019 outlook in February. Our performance-to-date in 2018 underpins our confidence in this outlook, as we have demonstrated excellent growth and exceeded our guidance for three consecutive quarters. In the third quarter, we delivered very strong earnings and cash flow, driven by our significant Brent and LLS oil price leverage, robust NGL realizations and solid production results. We've seen our positive production trends continue into the fourth quarter and are again raising our full-year 2018 U.S. guidance. Notably, we expect a meaningful increase in fourth quarter oil volumes. Internationally, we delivered robust cash flow in the third quarter of production that was in line with guidance. In Egypt, our drilling program continued to achieve a high success rate and gross production remains relatively steady. While net adjusted production was reduced by the impact of higher oil prices, on our production-sharing contracts, cash flow trended higher in the third quarter on strong Brent oil prices. In the North Sea, production was impacted by routine seasonal maintenance, but was also in line with expectations. We anticipate significant growth in the fourth quarter, with positive momentum continuing into 2019. Turning now to Midstream. We achieved an important milestone during the third quarter, with the announcement of Altus Midstream Company. Altus accomplishes the primary objectives that we have previously articulated to the market; it enables Apache to maintain control of the midstream infrastructure buildout and establishes an entity capable of funding all future midstream investments at a lower cost of capital. Since the announcement, we have spoken with many of our largest institutional shareholders. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and we look forward to the closing of the transaction in November. Now I would like to provide a strategic overview of Apache's key operating areas. In the Midland and Delaware Basins, the strategic testing we have conducted over the past three years is paying dividends, as we shift a much greater percentage of our capital to full-pattern development. This is generating significant improvements in cost and productivity. And today we believe that we are drilling some of the best wells in both basins. In the Midland Basin, development drilling continues in the Powell, Wildfire and Azalea areas with excellent results. We recently expanded our activity outside of these areas as we focus on increasing Apache's inventory of high-graded opportunities. In the Delaware Basin, we are delineating acreage in the New Mexico Slope play and adding landing zones in our Dixieland and Pecos Bend areas in Texas. Our drilling inventory in these areas continues to increase and will support a multi-rig program for the foreseeable future. Moving on to Alpine High. While testing and delineation activity will continue for some time, given the magnitude of the total resource, we are transitioning now to a multi-well pad development designed to optimize spacing, pattern and completions configurations. We have previously discussed the framework for monitoring our progress at Alpine High in the context of well costs, well productivity and inventory. On well costs, we have achieved an approximate 25% reduction in drilling, completion and equipment costs per lateral foot year-over-year through the first three quarters of 2019, which is in line with our goal. In terms of well productivity, we are beginning to extend our laterals where applicable, and we are seeing a high correlation between productivity and lateral length in our Woodford and Barnett wells. We are also beginning to modify completions design, including higher profit loads, which is delivering a step change in well productivity. Turning to our delineation program in the shallow Wolfcamp Bone Spring sequence formations, we recently began flow back on a 10 well pad which incorporates larger frac geometries and is designed to test the productivity of patterns and spatial relationship. The pad is developing roughly a half section and contains four wells in the Wolfcamp A, four wells in the Wolfcamp B and two wells in the Bone Spring formation. Aggregate production from the eight Wolfcamp wells is currently around 3,300 barrels of oil per day. We are very encouraged by the performance of these wells, which are still cleaning up and have not reached peak IP rates. We are in the early stages of bringing the two Bone Spring wells online and will provide an update on the progress of this pad in the future. Tim will provide some more detail on our Alpine High program in his remarks. Turning now to the international region. In Egypt, we have been investing at a pace that has maintained gross production at a relatively flat level. Our drilling success rate is very high and very consistent, while our inventory of opportunities is growing significantly through the addition of new acreage concessions and high density 3-D imaging. Egypt delivered some of the best returns in the portfolio, and we are confident this region can return to growth in production of free cash flow for many years to come. Our current drilling program in the North Sea consists of two platform rigs and one semi-submersible, which we believe is an appropriate pace to deliver our strategic objective of sustaining production and free cash flow generation. Capital efficiency has improved significantly in the North Sea and we anticipate delivering higher production in the fourth quarter and in 2019 with a flat capital profile. Production growth will be driven by the tie-in of three significant wells in the barrel area : a development well at Caliber, a discovery well at Store (11:46) and our discovery well at Garten, which we have now accelerated into 2018. Longer-term, the Garten discovery has lowered the risk profile of several analogous exploration prospects, some of which we will likely test in 2019. Moving on to exploration. In Suriname, we continue to progress our technical evaluation and are looking at a multitude of prospects. We will initiate a drilling program next year on Block 58, where Apache currently owns 100%. This block is untested and adjacent to the Exxon Mobil operated Stabroek Block in neighboring Guyana. In the U.S. we have a strategy of expanding our portfolio through organic growth opportunities at a low entry cost. On-shore unconventional exploration teams are acquiring acreage in multiple respective areas focusing on oil. Our third and fourth quarter capital reflects some incremental activity in this regard. Before turning it over to Tim, I'd would like to address reports that Apache is actively marketing certain assets in our U.S. portfolio. We regularly review the strategic value of holding assets in our portfolio. If another party is willing to fund assets that are not attracting capital for Apache and an opportunity exists to increase value for our shareholders through a sale, our approach has always been to notify the market upon execution of a sale agreement for any material asset disposition and refrain from commenting prior to that. To the extent we do complete asset sales, return of capital to shareholders is a high priority use of proceeds. With that, I will turn the call over to Tim Sullivan who will provide some operational details on the quarter. Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Good morning. My remarks will briefly cover third quarter 2018 production and operations performance, including drilling highlights and activity in our core regions. Operationally, we had another very good quarter and saw improvement in many key areas. We achieved company-wide adjusted production of approximately 401,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 13% increase from the same period a year ago and up 3% from the second quarter 2018. The Permian Basin continues to drive our growth. Compared with the third quarter a year ago, oil production in the basin increased 16% and total production grew 38%. These are impressive growth rates on a large production base, which reflect the success of our ongoing development in the Midland and Delaware Basins and the continued ramp up at Alpine High. We averaged 18 rigs and five frac crews in the Permian Basin during the quarter. Compared with the preceding period, we held our oil production steady, up 1%, and with the completion schedule skewed toward the back half of the year, there will be a larger contribution to oil growth in the fourth quarter and even more so in 2019. In the Midland Basin, we placed 13 wells online in the third quarter, all of which were on multiwell pads. This includes a nine-well pad at our Powell field, comprising a mix of mile-and-a-half and two-mile laterals. In addition, we drilled a four-well strategic plan pad in our Hartgrove field in Reagan County, testing four separate Wolfcamp landing zones with very encouraging results. In the Delaware Basin at Dixieland, we placed on production 10 high-rate wells with one-mile laterals. Eight are producing from two proven-Upper Wolfcamp landing zones, while the remaining two successfully tested two additional landing zones in the Lower Wolfcamp, adding inventory across the field. Please refer to the Quarterly Supplement for production details. Production at Alpine averaged approximately 49,000 BOE per day during the quarter. We are currently producing approximately 55,000 BOE per day on a net basis. For the full year 2018, we are tracking toward 44,000 BOE per day net, down slightly from our 45,000 BOE per-day guidance. This reduction results primarily from a processing upset that sent moisture down the pipeline, requiring a two-day field shutdown to dig the lines. At Alpine High, we placed 27 wells on production during the third quarter. We will remain on track to place more than 90 wells on production this year. John mentioned the results we've seen thus far on our 10-well Cypress pad, so I will note a few other results year. Recent Barnett completions during the quarter include the Mohican 201, which averaged a 30-day initial production rate of 7.7 million cubic feet of rich gas and 319 barrels of oil per day; the (16:30), which averaged a 30-day IP rate of 7.3 million cubic feet of rich gas and 256 barrels of oil per day. Both wells were completed with laterals averaging 5,700 feet and standard proppant loads of 1,970 pounds per foot. They produce extremely rich gas with an average BTU content of nearly 1,300. And assuming cryo-processing, we yield up to 160 barrels of NGLs per million cubic feet of gas. We have many analogous Barnett wells scheduled for multi-well pad development in our 2019 drilling program. I also wanted to provide an update on the 12-well Blackfoot pad which we discussed last quarter. Recall that the Blackfoot tested 660-foot spacing in three Woodford landing zones. These wells were relatively small completions, treated with only 1,600 pounds per foot of sand. The pad peaked at a 30-day IP rate of nearly 105 million cubic feet of gas and 280 barrels of oil per day following our last quarterly call. The majority of the gas is being recovered from the upper two Woodford landing zones. Based on our frac geometry and production results, we believe we can recover most of these reserves with fewer wells and larger fracs, which will significantly enhance pad economics. This strong performance from the upper Woodford landing zones on tighter spacing has a positive impact on our location count. On the cost side, Apache is successfully navigating a challenging inflationary environment in the U.S. Our initial 2018 budget contemplated a 10% to 15% average surface cost increase. However, steel tariffs, rising fuel and chemical prices and higher labor costs, particularly trucking and construction, have resulted in incremental inflation. We are managing these dynamics with improved wellbore and completion designs, longer laterals, multi-well pad drilling and proactive investment in water management infrastructure. As we look into 2019, we are likely to see a continuation of higher labor, steel, fuel and chemical costs. However, as we move through the tender process, we are realizing reduce costs for rigs and pressure pumping crews. Net-net, we believe these cost trends roughly offset each other in 2019, and we plan to budget for a relatively flat or slightly down year-over-year service cost overall. Internationally, in Egypt we drilled and completed 24 gross wells with an 83% success rate. Noteworthy results are included in our Supplement. These are primarily high rate oil wells, all with Brent Index pricing. Our seismic acquisition on the Western Desert continues. To date, we have acquired close to 1 million acres of a planned 2.6 million acre seismic shoot, completing acquisition in our legacy West Kalabsha and Shushan areas. We have recently initiated seismic acquisition in our new Northwest Razzak Concession. Fast track processing is bringing very exciting results. We are seeing faults in geologic surfaces, especially in the deeper section, that we could not image before. We have identified several new leads and prospects just from this initial data review. Moving to the North Sea, production averaged approximately 51,000 BOE per day per the quarter as operations were impacted by maintenance turnarounds. Production has begun to rebound in the fourth quarter and should continue to ramp up. In late September we brought onstream our fourth development well at our Callater Field at Beryl. This well is having a positive impact both on production and reserves and is currently producing 3,500 BOE per day net to Apache. Apache owns a 55% working interest. Also, as John noted, we have accelerated development at Garten. The Beryl near field discovery we announced in March with first oil expected later this month. By locating this test well near existing infrastructure, we have been able to reduce our cycle time, minimize development costs and bring this well into production in only seven months for $80 million, which we expect will translate to a very attractive F&D cost of less than $10 per barrel. We anticipate achieving our highest average production rate for the year in that North Sea during the fourth quarter. To sum up, operationally, we remain on track for a very good year with growing momentum heading into 2019. We are focused on building on this success in quarters ahead. I will now turn the call over to Steve. Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Thank you, Tim. As noted in the press release issued last night, under generally accepted accounting principles, Apache reported third quarter 2018 net income of $81 million or $0.21 per diluted common share. Results for the quarter included a number of items that are outside of core earnings, which are typically excluded by the investment community and published earnings estimates. The most significant of these is a $75 million after-tax loss we incurred as a result of the bond tender exercise in August. Excluding this and other smaller items, adjusted earnings for the quarter were $244 million or $0.63 per share. Third quarter financial performance was good across the board. Production volumes were strong and we anticipate this will continue into fourth quarter and 2019. Our average realized oil price exceeded $69 per barrel in the third quarter as nearly 70% of oil production received Brent or Gulf Coast linked pricing. NGL realizations were also very strong, up 18% from second quarter. Costs continue to trend well both on a per unit basis for LOE and DD&A and on a gross basis for G&A and exploration expense. All are tracking below previous full-year guidance ranges, which we have reduced accordingly. Note that cash tax guidance has been increased for the year to reflect higher income levels internationally, primarily as a result of the strong Brent oil prices. Capital investment in the quarter was $966 million dollars, which includes $122 million for Alpine High and Midstream. As highlighted in our financial and operational supplement, upstream activity level for the prior four quarters have been remarkably consistent. Upstream capital investment has averaged between $700 million and $750 million per quarter on a steady global rig count. We plan to maintain a similar level of baseline activity through 2019 resulting in typical quarterly capital investment of around $750 million. As John indicated, this would result in a $3 billion capital program for 2019. We believe this is a prudent level of investment and remain prepared to reduce it further should industry conditions warrant. Through a combination of the timing of capital activity and some incremental lease acquisitions and extensions, third quarter upstream investment was $844 million. Fourth quarter upstream investment will be approximately $800 million, which also includes some significant lease acquisition investments. With the combination of strong operational performance and recent price levels, financial returns have improved and will continue to do so. Our cash return on invested capital through the first three quarters of 2018 was 23% on an annualized basis. We ended the third quarter with $593 million of cash on hand. In terms of balance sheet management, in the third quarter we took certain steps to improve our debt portfolio. We issued $1 billion of new 10-year senior notes, repurchased $731 million of outstanding debt and paid off $400 million of maturing debt. These actions extended our debt maturity profile, reduced our average cost of debt, modernized our standard debenture terms, and reduced debt by $131 million. This is in addition to the $150 million debt reduction we affected earlier in the year. I will conclude with comments on midstream and marketing. There continue to be many concerns about transport, and now fractionation capacity to accommodate growing Permian Basin production volumes. For the upstream industry in general, these concerns are well-founded, and the underlying situation is likely to extend through much of 2019. The good news is that much of the Midstream investment is already underway, and Apache has taken the necessary steps to mitigate the short-term impact of these issues. As an interim solution, we entered into swaps on Waha gas basis back in late 2017 and early 2018 to lock in an average $0.51 differential on a significant quantity of gas production through much of 2019. As a part of the longer-term solution, Apache's midstream business is contracted for transport on multiple pipeline projects across all three commodities. In many cases, our contracting was critical to enabling FID on the project. As such, the midstream business was able to secure equity participation options in those projects and will become an important piece of Altus Midstream Company. We have talked extensively about the gas and oil transport projects. With the recent concerns around NGL transport and fractionation, let me share a few more details on our agreement with Enterprise. This agreement will accommodate NGL transport and fractionation, ramping up to 205,000 barrels per day, beginning with the commissioning of the Chinook NGL Pipeline Waha lateral. The agreement has a 10-year primary term with a very attractive fixed transport and fractionation fee structure. At Apache's option, the agreement can be extended under the same terms for two additional five-year periods of time. The pipeline's lateral is anticipated to be operational shortly after the completion of the first Cryo facility at Alpine High. We are currently with working with Enterprise and other parties on interim solutions in the event the Cryo facility is operational before the pipeline lateral is commissioned. The Enterprise agreement will access attractive Mont Belvieu pricing for our NGLs and contains certain options that enable further margin expansion possibilities. In 2019, the value of the NGL margin uplift for Alpine High will become much more apparent. We are closing out 2018 and entering 2019 in a very strong financial position and with great momentum : lower debt, robust cash flow and increasing returns, all goals we set at the beginning of the year. I look forward to reporting on our full-year financial performance in February and further discussing our outlook for 2019. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We'll pause for just a moment to compile a Q&A roster. And our first question comes from the line of Gail Nicholson from Stevens. Your line is open. Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC : Good morning, everybody. You guys had really strong Permian NGL price realizations this quarter. I was curious, what percent of your Permian NGLs are ethane? And then how is that to change post the Cryo facilities coming online in Alpine next year? Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Hey, Gail. So this is Steve. So I don't have at hand an exact number of the percent of NGLs that are ethane. Might see if we could get that before the end of this call. But that obviously will be impacted quite a bit as we actually bring on three Cryo units in Alpine in 2019, the first one by the middle of the year and then two more before the end of the year. In aggregate, we produce about 60,000 barrels a day of NGLs in the U.S. and most of those \u2013 those are all basically priced based on net back Mont Belvieu type of pricing, with a deduction for transportation and fractionation costs. And quick turnaround on the first part, about 42% is F8 in the Permian. Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC : Okay. Great. And then the market we tend to be overly focused on your U.S. onshore execution, but you have some really high-quality international assets. Can you just talk about what could potentially be on the horizon in the North Sea and Egypt in 2019, specifically maybe in Egypt as maybe you return that asset more to a global asset. Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yes, Gail. Thank you. If you look at Egypt, we've got a big three-day program that's underway and we've got a lot of new concessions, and so, it's a 2.6 million acre shoot. We shot over 1 million of it. Things are progressing well and, I tell you, the early looks on the seismic are very exciting. There's just a lot of rock to deal with out there, it's high productivity, and we've got such a massive infrastructure, backbone in place, that it will be easy to bring things on. So, we are very excited about Egypt and we are excited about getting more of the 3-D in and starting to migrate our inventory there, which really has become very robust. Historically we have about two years of inventory that we could see because it took so long to build. Today we've got a much, much longer time horizon on our Egypt portfolio, and gives us the ability \u2013 you know, we believe we are going to be able to grow the free cash flow as well is grow production over the next several years on the new acreage. So that's the first thing. If you look at the track record in the North Sea, Garten this year was a big discovery for us, and as we said on the notes this morning, we are going to be accelerating that from early next year into the fourth quarter. So we are excited about that. It will be a very high rate well, it's a big structure, and there's potential in there, we'll just have to see how it outperforms, even add more wells. But most importantly, it also de-risked several other structures that are very similar to Garten. So we continue to have success in the barrel area with tiebacks. We've got store coming as well, in 2019 we brought on another well in Callater. So we've got a lot of momentum going into 2019 in the North Sea, not to mention the work we are doing a 40s as well with the water injection. We are really starting to see some stabilization of the decliner rates there, and flattening of that which has big ramifications. So, you know international portfolio has provided a tremendous amount of cash flow, it's Brent pricing and we get really high gas prices in the UK as well, and we're excited what that's going to continue to do for us for the foreseeable future. Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC : Great. Thank you so much. Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Your line is open. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Good morning, John, to you and your whole team there. John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Good morning, Charles. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: I wanted to \u2013 I feel like you guys talked a little bit about that para sequence test you have, and I think Tim said that was the Cyprus state pad, did I catch that right? John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: You did. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Okay. And so, John, I recognize it's early days there, but can you give a little bit more color. I know you said the wells are still cleaning up. I did a quick math and it looks like those four Wolfcamp tests are right now a little bit over 400 barrels a day of oil each. I wonder if you would talk about how much water you are seeing? Where you think that, what would be a good result in your view on where those wells go? And also maybe you could talk a little bit about the decision to do all eight wells at onetime, rather than just kind of weigh generally into that test? John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, first of all, Charles, we are very excited about it. It's a 10 well oil pad test. There are four Wolfcamp A's, there are four Wolfcamp B's and two Bone Springs. Really, really high productivity. It's very early. I will tell you we were gas lifting all eight of the Wolfcamp wells. There's extreme deliverability and productivity and they are really just starting to cleanup. So, they started cutting oil pretty early. There's a tremendous amount of fluid to move, and we are very optimistic and encouraged by those. They are still short laterals, larger fracs, about 4000 pounds a foot. This is really 10 wells in a little over a half section. So it's like we've talked about the name of the game is getting the pad development, understanding the spacing from a spatial and pattern position. And we're excited about these. They are going to continue to clean up, when we look at the IPR curves, there's a lot of room for these wells come up and we expect them to hold in for quite a while. So we're very encouraged. The two Bone Springs we've just really started and we've run sump pumps in those two wells. So \u2013 and they're both cutting oil but just really getting started. So it's early and is 40 gravity oil, it's black oil and well costs were very reasonable for the size jobs we pumped, and we're very optimistic. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Got it. It sounds promising. We'll just have to stay tuned on that. And then if I could go back and touch on \u2013 you guys talked about the CapEx outlook for 2019, but that's really a piece of the free cash flow outlook for 2019. And you guys also talked about the possibility of asset sales, and that would be the scenario which you'd look to return more cash to shareholders. So I think you guys already have a dividend. You've maintained it through the whole downturn, but can you give us a little bit of your thoughts? Are you thinking about, how would you \u2013 if you did have more free cash flow through an asset sale or just through sustained strength in quality price, how are you thinking about maintaining or increasing your dividend going with a special dividend? And then also, you guys announced this $40 million share repurchase authorization. Can you give us how those priorities sort out in your mind? John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, Charles, that's a lot of questions. I'll try to summarize in a couple points and then give you a chance to come back if we didn't answer them. But first of all, as we look to 2019, we've been running a pretty flat activity set, going back to the back half of 2017. So we're very comfortable what the capital forecast is going into next year. We figure for $3 billion, we can deliver pretty fat flat activity set, which sets us up very nicely when you look at the corporate level in the U.S. growth which, of course will be driven by Permian. So we also believe that we will be in a position to generate some free cash flow and clearly, a high priority with that free cash flow right now, especially with where share price is would be to supplement our dividend policy which we've maintained through the downturn. I mean we're one of the few that did not cut our dividend, and so we see that buybacks is something we can do to supplement our dividend policy as we return incremental cash flow to the shareholders. So everything I'll say about the capital program going into next year that can easily be flexed up as we have significant inventory to do that. But also it'll be very easy ratchet back if things change in the environment. So we'll have more color on the call in February, but very comfortable with the rates and pace we've been running at. I think we're set up for a really strong 2019 after a really good 2018, and we do see us being able to increase the stuff back to shareholders. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Thanks, John. That was the overview I was looking for. Go ahead. I'm sorry. Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yeah, sorry, Charles. I'll just add to that. Just in terms of what potential we might have on that, we ended the third quarter with $600 million of cash, with positive free cash flow planned at strip for 2019. Through the end of 2019 and after paying the dividend and after retaining a bit of cash on the balance sheet for operational purposes, you're probably looking at as much as $500 million to $1 billion of cash available, depending on price, available for either debt reduction or further share buybacks. And that would exclude any proceeds from asset sales. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Thanks, Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning. Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Good morning, Brian. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Wanted to touch on Alpine High well productivity. You talked to some of the success and endeavors you're taking, extending laterals and also greater proppant loads. Can you add a little bit more color on what you're seeing, and more specifically whether when you talk about the improvement in productivity that is increasing EURs in recovery rates, or that is just bringing forward production? John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Yeah, Brian. I think the thing we've determined and we now have substantial flow time on it is that the larger fracs are definitely increasing productivity. We're also seeing that in the Woodford and the Barnett, and longer laterals are pretty much one to-one in terms of lateral foot for the productivity. So in both cases we're getting benefit from longer laterals as well as the bigger fracs. The last pad we brought on, the Blackfoot, was the smaller fracs. We did that even knowing going into that we knew the larger fracs were doing more but we needed to see the data point in terms of the number of landing zones and the spatial placement between those. And it's confirmed what we believed that we're probably going to be able to develop at Woodford with two landing zones, drop the As and Bs a little bit lower with a little larger fracs. And then we've got to come back and pump the bigger fracs on those to then figure out the optimal number of wellbores. But the good news is our location counts have had very conservative assumptions. We've proven that at less than 2,000 pounds we can place the wells 660 feet apart and our well count assumptions were 925 to 1,000. So well count is going to go up when we come back and quantify that, but we've still got some more work to do in terms of what's going to drive the greatest return and PV per capital dollar invested with how we develop these patterns. We've got the 12 wells in the Blackfoot. We're going to come back right now. We're in the process of completing 10 wells in the Barnett and at a later date you'll see us come back with a pair sequence. So at the Mont Blancs right now we're in the process of flowing back or starting to flow back some Woodford and Barnett tests, which have a little larger fracs. So there's a lot of data that's coming and has been designed to help us yield what's going to be critical to the development scenario. So a lot of good work and a lot of progress, and at some point we'll come back and unfold a lot of that for you. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you for that. And then my follow up is with regards to use of capital Permian and M&A. Can you just kind of talk to, to what degree M&A opportunities are competitive or not competitive relative to share repurchase for use of free cash and where the Permian outside Alpine High plays into that if at all? John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean, I think if you look at us today first of all, as I said in the closing part of my comments, if there's an asset that we're not funding and there's an opportunity for somebody else to put capital in that asset, then there may be an arbitrage and the ability to create some value for shareholders. So we're constantly looking at the portfolio and you've seen that historically with us. We exited Canada last year. So it's something we're constantly looking at. Clearly, right now, if you look at our portfolio, we're very excited about where we are in the Midland Basin. We've been predominantly working three areas and, as Tim mentioned, we branched out past those three areas in the Permian. But if you look at those three areas, it's less than 20% of what we'd call our core Midland Basin acreage and we've really developed less than 20% of the locations we see in those. So there's tremendous amount of running room in our Wolfcamp and Spraberry locations in our Midland Basin. And then if you look at our portfolio from an expiration standpoint, we believe today you're better served \u2013 the best impact's going to be through organic well-designed expiration. And Alpine High was a result of that. We've put together a tremendous portfolio over the last few years on the conventional side. We've got a block down in Suriname that we're very, very excited about and we've also got some new plays that we've been working on the unconventional side. As you know, it's a depleting business and you have to continue to find areas, and we think organically through the expiration if you can do it with low-cost, high-impact areas, we think that's the best way to create value. And it's also why we also like our share price right now. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Herrlin from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Your line is open. John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : Yes. Thanks. Just one quick one for me. Are you going to be buying puts for next year's oil production? John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: John, historically we've put things in place to protect our programs. And I think fundamentally we like to stay away from hedging unless we feel like we need to do something. And at times when we felt like we had a capital program like the midstream and Alpine High we've done things to protect that cash flow or through acquisitions there's ways to fund those. So I think as we go into 2019 we're in a position today where with the capital program, we can ratchet that up or down if necessary. So it's just something we'll have to kind of look at. John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : Okay. No, that's fine. I didn't figure you'd be putting any on, but I was just asking. And then Altus closes this month, end of month, mid-month, or... John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Yeah. I'll let Brian... Brian W. Freed - Apache Corp.: Yeah, this is Brian. The proxies were mailed out on October 22 and we've got the Shareholder Meeting scheduled for November 6 with the close and funding scheduled for November 9, and at that point in time the ticker symbol will change to ALTM and the name will change at closing to Altus Midstream from Kayne Anderson Acquisition Company. John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. John, I wonder if you could help me with really a bit of a production visibility question for next year, and it's really about how we should think about the fractionation start-ups and how we could see your liquids yield evolve from the wet gas you've got currently. Because, obviously, that's going to be a pretty significant catalyst, I think, for your step change in cash flow as you go over the next year or so. John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Yeah, I think, Doug, clearly 2019 will be an inflection-point year for the NGLs at Alpine High. If you look at 2018 to 2020, we showed a transition where our NGLs would grow from 10% in 2018 to 30% in 2020. We've got one Cryo coming on in the second half \u2013 or the back end of the first half of the year. Then, we got two coming on in the second half. So, it'll all happen, kind of start happening second and third quarter of next year. Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yeah. And, Doug, I'd just add to that. Our contract with Enterprise provides for a ramp-up of volumes to 205,000 barrels a day and that's a fixed contract. They've got to take it. It's a fixed-fee structure for transportation and fractionation. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we actually have some options to even further enhance margins beyond just a Mont Belvieu mixed NGL barrel pricing netted back to Alpine High. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Steve, just to be clear, when would you expect to fill that capacity? I know it's a bit of a stretch question, but can you provide any visibility as when you would expect that volume to be achieved? Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: No. Not at this time, Doug. I think what I'd recommend is let's wait until the next plan rollout in February and we could probably have a better view of that kind of stuff. But, obviously, I'll just state the obvious and that is as we \u2013 we're bringing on three Cryo facilities in 2019, two more in 2020. That won't be the end of it. But, obviously, as we bring on Cryo facilities, the goal would be to have a drilling schedule that fills those as quickly as possible. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. My follow-up, John, I don't know how you want to deal with this one. It's on Egypt. It's about, I guess, seven or eight years now since everything kind of went toes up in the country and things have changed dramatically, as you know. I'm just curious, we haven't really had a formal update on your plans for Egypt with the new seismic program and so on. The visibility for the sustaining business sort of growth plan going forward. And it strikes me that the market could probably benefit from getting a refresh on that. I'm just wondering if you can update. Do you have any intention of doing that and any high-level plans that you can share as you think about the next several years? John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean, if you look back, we've been able to maintain our Egypt production level with a much lower rig count. We were running 28 rigs in Egypt in 2014 and we got down as low as six or seven. We've been running around 12 rigs, and we've been able to really stabilize that, and that's with the (48:22) starting to get towards the point where it would go on decline. So we've done a really, really good job. And I think our productivity and capital efficiency in Egypt has gone up significantly, and that was really two discoveries Ptah and Berenice, which helped drive that, which we had in early 2015. If you look at the new seismic, I think, as we \u2013 with the new concessions, and we get the new seismic back, we would be in a position, Doug, to kind of unfold some of that as well. So, we've expanded a lot over the last three years. We've landed a lot of acreage in Egypt. And as I mentioned earlier, we've got great infrastructure and a great track record. And so we look at Egypt as an area we can continue to grow the free cash flow. You can't underestimate what we've done with that and what it's been able to do for us over the last several years and grow our production. So Egypt's actually an improving position for us as well, and we've got better there over the last couple of years. And I think once we get the new seismic back, and then we would be in a position to unfold that a little. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just one closing comment from me, John, if I may. It's just an observation more than anything else. This asset obviously throws off a lot of free cash. The market still seems to apply a data discount to that asset. And if you could provide some visibility on the sustainability of that free cash, I think it would really pay dividends. That's really what I was getting at. So I appreciate your answer. Thanks. John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: That's a great comment, Doug. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani from Nat Alliance. Your line is open. Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities : Hey, guys. I wanted to dig into the forward plans at Altus a little bit. Obviously, I know the vote is a handful of days away. I guess you've got a central closing coming up soon as well. But assuming everything closes as planned, how do you see, sort of, the progress over the next couple of quarters? I know you guys have some significant options to purchase some equity interests and some rather large pipelines. I know you guys have talked about our other organic growth opportunities. Can you just, kind of, refresh everyone in terms of what you plan to do here in the short term when all this post close? Brian W. Freed - Apache Corp.: Yeah, this is Brian Freed. I'll address that a little bit. I mean, quite frankly, what we have in front of us, we've got a lot to say grace over in front of us in terms of the work we've got in front of us. We've got the Cryos that John mentioned that need to come on in 2019 and the equity options that we will start exercising by the end of this year. We've got a supplement out on the website that shows when some of those option exercise dates are, so you can dig into the details there. So I won't burden this call with all of that. But we do expect to start exercising these options by the end of the year, and then we have a lot of gathering and processing to continue to build out through the rest of this year and into 2019 as well, too. Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities : Okay. That's helpful. And I guess just jumping over to Suriname, obviously an area you guys are quite excited about here. I wanted to see if you could give us a little bit more color on, sort of, the capital plan there for 2019 in terms of how much money you plan to throw at it and how many potential wells you guys could drill. John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean, it's a large area. We've got about 1.4 million acres. There are number of prospects that are very high quality. We will drill at least one well in 2019, and there will be options to make that program much larger. So that's one of the things we're looking at. But we'll include at least one well. Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities : Okay. That's helpful. And I guess, is that well likely to, kind of, come by midyear? What can you tell us on timing there? John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: I would \u2013 I'd probably say late second, early third quarter, likely, but... Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities : Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis from Capital One Securities. Your line is open. Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.: Hey. Thanks. Good morning, John. Just a couple of questions on the exploration side. I know that's not a topic discussed all that much in E&P land these days. But regarding the planned Surinam well next year, how are you able to use that data from the other recent unsuccessful wells drilled offshore Surinam by all the operators? And then you had your own well there. How useful was that data in trying to plan your 2019 well? John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean, I think if you go back and look at our Block 53, the two wells that we've drilled over the last, call it, three years, we've learned a lot from both of those. You look at 58, it's positioned differently. It's in a different part of what's a very large basin. It's a very large block, so we feel like that Block 58 is ideally positioned. And it really \u2013 the results outbound the Block 58 will not have an impact on our view of Block 58. Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.: Okay. John. Thank you for that. And then just to continue with exploration, you talked a little bit about expiration potential in the portfolio. What areas globally look interesting to Apache at this point, either as operator or non-operator? And what percentage of the budget, as you start to generate the excess cash flow moving forward, 2019 plus, what percentage of the budget could expiration represent going forward? John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, it's something you've got to keep in check. If you look on our international portfolio, of our international capital, we spend some expiration dollars in both the North Sea and in Egypt, right, so. And those are continual programs that we've had great results from, so there's a small portion there. Suriname is the one place outside where we operate today that we will be active next year. And then on the unconventional side, it's more you U.S. focused and it's more oil focused, and those are things where we don't spend a lot of money because we're looking at things that are off the radar from other companies where we think we can add value, pick up meaningful acreage positions at low cost that could have a really high impact. And so that's how we approached the unconventional side. But you've got to keep it in check. You've got to have the lion's share of your capital going into your development programs that are driving your returns and your volume growth and the cash flow. John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: That's it for me. Thanks a bunch, John. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Hall from Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is open. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Maybe following up a little bit on the last couple on Suriname and exploration. How are you thinking about ownership on that Block 58? You currently have 100% on it. Is that something you likely want to sell down? And is that probably something you'd do before, or would you wait for the results after the first test on that block? John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Michael, it's something we own 100% today; there is quite a bit of interest in the block. And so that's just something we'd have seen the future. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Okay. Sounds like you're up for taking the full interest on the first well? John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: We're definitely prepared. We like the risk to upside profile. Wells are not real expensive. You're probably $55 million to $60 million tops for one of the deeper water wells. So it's something we can easily do a couple wells on. So we'll just see. It's a block we are very excited about, and we'll just kind of see how it unfolds. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Okay. That makes sense. That's helpful. Thanks. And then I guess bigger picture, just thinking about the 2019 outlook relative to the kind of back half experience here in 2018. I know obviously, we've been \u2013 you've been executing on production, taking that up, pointing to the high-end of the 2019 production guide or prior guide. But at the same time, capital has also been moving higher in the last couple of quarters. How do we get comfortable with that planned ramp down and quarterly spending rate? What are the key drivers of giving you confidence in planning around that at this point? John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Yeah, I'll let Steve give you some specifics. But if you look at our last six quarter, we've been running a pretty flat activity set. And if you look at the actual EMP capital, it's been pretty flat. I mean you saw little bit of a rise in the back half this year and that's been toward acreage, but I will let Steve give you little bit more color. Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yeah, I think that's the story, Michael. I mean for four quarters in a row, leading up to third quarter, we've spent less than $750 million per quarter on upstream capital, if you just set aside the Midstream stuff and Alpine High. In the fourth quarter, of 2018, we've guided to $800 million, but $65 million of that is going to be exploration land acquisition, kind of a one-off land acquisition, so really we're under $750 million underlying kind of baseline upstream spending in the fourth quarter of 2018. The third quarter, there's a bit of a lumpiness to it. Again, there's about $800 million excluding land acquisitions in the third quarter, and that's just a bit of lumpiness, why that's over $750 million. There's a lot of lumpiness around activity on completions. Remember, we took the completion holiday and we had some backlog there. We upsized quite a number of those completions, so there's some lumpiness and some facility spending and some other type of stuff. So I would say that the exception was the third quarter at $800 million on an underlying baseline upstream spend rate as opposed to the second half. The other way to look at it is second half of 2018, we'll spend, in round numbers, $1.65 billion. We've got a little over $100 million of land acquisitions, lease extensions and acquisitions, so we're just \u2013 we're a little bit over $1.5 billion in the second half of 2018 and running at about $1.5 on a half year basis going into 2019. So I just, I think that the number in the third quarter was the anomaly and the exception. It's not underlying, we're spending at or even possibly slightly below for most of the last four quarters $750 million a quarter in the upstream. And we're not meaningfully changing activity levels here. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Okay. And I guess on that land acquisition site in the fourth quarter, that $65 million you highlighted, sorry if I missed, where is that roughly? Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: We have not, Michael, we have not disclosed that. It's part of our unconventional programs that would be areas that at some point in the future we would talk about. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : In the U.S.... Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Some portion of that, Michael, is lease extensions ending and some of it is new lease acquisition. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. John Christmann. John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, thank you all for joining us today. I would like to leave you with three key takeaways from today's call. First, Apache had an excellent quarter both operationally and financially. We significantly exceeded consensus earnings and cash flow estimates. We beat and raised our production guidance for the third quarter in a row and we outlined a strong 2019 view. Second, we are planning a year-over-year reduction in upstream capital in 2019 and upon closing, Altus Midstream will fund our Alpine High infrastructure spend. This creates good visibility to free cash flow for which a high priority will be share repurchases. And lastly, we are realizing significant benefits from our diversified portfolio and strong leverage to oil prices. In 2019, as we ramp are wet gas volumes at Alpine High in conjunction with Cryo installation, we will see a step function change in margins and cash flow from the play. I look forward to sharing our ongoing progress with you in the future. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache Corporation Fourth Quarter 2018 Results Conference Call. All lines have been place on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].  Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Gary Clark : Good morning and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial and operational results conference call. We will begin the call with an overview by Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann. Tim Sullivan, Executive Vice President of Operations Support, will then provide additional operational color; and Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO will summarize our fourth quarter and full year financial performance. Also available on the call to answer questions are Apache\u2019s Executive Vice Presidents : Mark Meyer, Energy Technology, Data Analytics and Commercial Intelligence; and Dave Pursell, Planning Reserves and Fundamentals. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 30 minutes in length, with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our fourth quarter Financial and Operational Supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website, at investor.apachecorp.com. On today's conference call we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt's tax barrels. Finally, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John. John Christmann : Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today\u2019s call, I will review Apache's fourth quarter production results, recap our key accomplishments in 2018, update and provide color on the 2019 outlook we issued a few weeks ago and conclude with some high-level direction out to 2021.  Our fourth quarter total adjusted production of 421,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter was in line with guidance. Strong international volumes offset slightly lower than expected US production. New wells in the North Sea at Callater and Garten drove international outperformance, while production in Egypt was generally in line with our expectations.  In the US Permian Oil production continued its trend of strong performance and sequential growth, significantly exceeding our guidance for the quarter. Natural gas and NGL volumes were lower than expected for several reasons, which Tim will outline in a few moments.  Our fourth quarter momentum has carried over into the current quarter, prompting an increase in the lower end of our full year 2019 production guidance range, as noted in yesterday's press release.  Before moving on to discuss our outlook for this year, I would like to briefly recap some of our key accomplishments in 2018. Each of our regions made great progress last year, and contributed to Apache\u2019s strong growth, returns and financial performance.  Operationally, we grew total adjusted production 13% and Permian Oil production 18% over 2017, increased well productivity throughout the Permian basin and reduced drilling and completion costs offsetting much of the inflationary pressures that built in 2018.  Formed Altus Midstream Company, an entity capable of independently funding ongoing midstream investments at Alpine High, discovered and commissioned the Garten field, which increased our daily North Sea production to its highest level in two years, received three concession awards in Egypt over the prior 18 months comprising 2.2 million acres adjacent to our existing footprint, made tremendous progress our large-scale high-density 3D seismic acquisition and new prospect identification program in Egypt, and completed a comprehensive petroleum system assessment offshore Suriname and met numerous, large, drill-ready prospects on Block 58.  2018 was also an excellent year financially for Apache, as we increased cash flow from operations 56% year-over-year, delivered an approximate 22% cash return on invested capital, generated robust cash flow from our international operations of $2.4 billion and returned nearly $1 billion or 25% of our cash flow from operations to investors through dividends, share repurchases and debt reduction.  Overall, 2018 was a very good year. As we turn to 2019, the lower price environment has prompted us to reduce our capital investment program. We will focus investment on projects that balance near-term cash flow generation with long-term returns and value enhancement. In 2019, we are planning upstream capital investment of approximately $2.4 billion, which represents a 22% reduction year-over-year. Despite this decrease, our production growth will remain resilient.  As disclosed in our press release on February 7th, we are projecting fourth quarter 2018 to fourth quarter 2019 production growth of 6% to 10% on a total company adjusted basis, 12% to 16% in the US, and 5% for Permian Oil. Internationally, we are projecting a decline of 2% to 4% over the same time period. This however, is heavily skewed by the strong fourth quarter 2018 volumes we reported in the North Sea, due to the timing of new wells at Callater and Garten. Comparing what we laid out for 2019 a year ago to our current outlook, our capital program has been reduced, our production outlook has moved to the top half of our previous guidance range, and our Permian basin oil production has been and will continue to be significantly higher. Overall, we can deliver attractive and sustainable growth under a reduced activity set due to a high quality diversified portfolio, relatively low base production decline rate, and continuously improving capital investment efficiency. It is important to note, however, the growth at Apache is an outcome of our returns focused investment approach, and not the overarching objective. The changes required to deliver this plan are already being implemented.  Following the oil price downturn late last year, we have decreased our operated Permian rig count to 13. This compares to a range of 16 to 18 rigs that we have been running since mid-2017. With this and other activity reductions, we are projecting first quarter upstream capital in the low $600 million range. This is approximately $200 million below our fourth quarter 2018 upstream spend and puts us on a level pace to achieve our full year 2019 target of [$2.4 million]. Let's now look into some of the regional dynamics underpinning 2019. Our US capital program is heavily concentrated in the Permian Basin with a focus on rich gas at Alpine High and oil in the Midland and Other Delaware. We plan to run an average of 12 rigs and 4 frac crews in the Permian this year, with roughly half the activity allocated to Alpine high, and the other half predominantly to the Midland Basin.  Maintaining critical mass and proper rig frac crew ratios in these two key areas will enable us to deliver a very efficient capital program given the reduced budget. Apache's US oil production comes primarily from the Permian, including the Midland Basin, the Delaware Basin and Alpine High. This year, we will continue to develop all three, but at an appropriately reduced pace. Our oil drilling will focus primarily in the Wildfire, Powell and Azalea areas which comprise only a small percentage of our total prospective acreage in the Midland Basin. Investment in these areas will continue to leverage the tremendous productivity gains over the last three years, as well as the existing infrastructure. To-date we have drilled fewer than 25% of our known-drilling locations at Wildfire, Powell and Azalea. So there is still a tremendous amount of running room in these areas alone. We have also initiated delineation activities in the nearby Benedum and Hartgrove areas in Upton and Reagan counties. This work enables us to begin planning and installing the facilities to efficiently develop these assets. The strong well results to-date indicate the potential for significant additions to future core growing inventory. In the Delaware Basin and Alpine High we are deferring oil-focused activities, however, substantial future opportunity remains. Apache\u2019s Permian Basin program has improved tremendously over the last three years. We\u2019re now producing at record levels, both in terms of total production and oil volumes. We have accomplished this with far fewer rigs and significantly less capital deployed in our prior production peak in late 2014.  Moving on to our rich gas development program in Alpine High, our focus this year will be on multi-well pad development drilling primarily in the Northern Flank of the field. With 600 million cubic feet per day of nameplate cryogenic processing capacity scheduled to come online in the second half of the year, we should realize a significant uplift in cash margins and cash flow generation.  We are decreasing our activity this year at Alpine High to five rigs and one frac crew. We\u2019re deemphasizing dry gas drilling which will no longer be needed for blending purposes to meet pipeline specs following cyro processing installation. This will naturally result in lower volume growth than previously projected, but will increase our percentage of NGLs.  Apache\u2019s new 2019 Alpine High production volume outlook is 85,000 to 90,000 BOEs per day for the year with the targeted year end exit rate in excess of 100,000 BOEs per day. Our projected year end NGL mix will approach 40% of net Alpine High volumes, up significantly from the previous guidance of 30%, which we provided a year ago.  Internationally Egypt, in the North Sea continue to play important roles in our diversified portfolio. Despite the lower commodity price environment, both regions will continue generating significant free cash flow. This year, we will maintain our activity set in the North Sea, which consists of one floating rig and two platform rigs.  In the Beryl area we plan to bring our store discovery online in the second half of the year and spud a second well at Garten.  In the Forties field we will focus on our waterflood and base decline management program augmented by platform rig activities. In Egypt, we continue to advance our large-scale seismic shoot from which a substantial number of attractive new targets have been identified thus far. We are also drilling exploration and delineation wells in each of our new concession areas, thereby, laying the foundation for potential future growth.  Turning to Suriname, we have completed a substantial geologic and geophysical evaluation of Block 58 and have a large number of high quality prospects across multiple different play concepts. We recently contracted a drillship and anticipate spudding our first well around midyear. Block 58 which Apache owns 100% is truly a world-class opportunity. This block is adjacent to the ExxonMobil operated Stabroek Block in neighboring Guyana and is on trend with numerous oil discoveries. To wrap up our view of 2019, I want to emphasize that we are committed to returning to investors at least 50% of any free cash flow, inclusive of asset sale proceeds before increasing planned activity levels. While we have a deep drilling inventory and long list of projects we would like to accelerate, as we have done in the past, Apache will remain disciplined and flex the program subject to available cash flow. Should we encounter a further downturn in commodity prices, we have the flexibility to reduce our capital program.  Importantly, with the benefits of a diversified portfolio, Apache is capable of breaking even at WTI oil prices in the mid-$40s, while continuing to fund its dividend. We have included a slide in our supplement, if you would like to review our assumptions behind this metric in further detail. I will conclude my remarks today by outlining our longer term view to 2021. Assuming WTI oil prices in the $50 to $55 per barrel range, we envision an annual upstream capital program of $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion. While the overall capital allocation and activity set will likely be similar to 2019, the specifics of the program will remain fluid as we incorporate learnings.  We believe this investment level is capable of generating continued attractive production growth and returns with the US as the primary driver and international flat to slightly down. As in 2019 we will continue to manage for cash flow neutrality, and return 50% or more of any free cash flow to investors. Permian Basin oil and Alpine High rich gas will be the primary drivers of US production growth over this timeframe, with NGLs comprising the fastest growing product stream.  In the US our deep inventory of development opportunities will continue to drive production growth, lower F&D costs and increasing returns for the long-term. This will be supplemented by our continuing organic exploration programs in the Lower 48.  Our longer-term international production outlook is characterized by a modest decline in the North Sea and flat to potential growth in Egypt. Our new concessions and seismic imaging in Egypt help establish the foundation for an appropriately paced long-term exploration and development program. This is good for the country of Egypt and for Apache as we believe our operations are capable of growing both production and free cash flow.  In closing, 2018 was a year of strong execution across the portfolio which translated into our best financial performance in four years. We are off to a good start in 2019 and have a disciplined plan to deliver long-term returns and growth, supported by a deep inventory of development locations and exciting exploration opportunities in the US and internationally.  Over the next three years Apache is committed to cash flow neutrality and we will continue to return meaningful capital to our investors.  With that, I will turn the call over to Tim Sullivan, who will provide some operational details on the quarter. Timothy Sullivan : Good morning. My remarks will briefly cover fourth quarter 2018 production and operations performance and activity in our core regions. I will also provide some details on our planned activity in 2019, and touch on our outlook for US service costs.  Operationally, we had another very good quarter, led by the Permian Oil production and the North Sea. We achieved companywide adjusted production of approximately 421,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 5% increase from the third quarter 2018 and up 16% from the fourth quarter 2017. In the US, Permian Oil was our biggest growth driver with an increase of more than 8,000 barrels of oil per day or 9% compared to the third quarter. The Midland Basin, Delaware Basin and Alpine High, all contributed to this sequential Permian Oil increase.  Total production for the Permian was up 6% for the third quarter, despite several events across the region that reduced production by approximately 10,000 BOE per day in the fourth quarter. This included excessive downtime due to outages at third-party facilities in the Midland and Delaware basins and weather disruptions.  At Alpine High, gas volumes were impacted by a field-wide shut down for several days that pressured on gas sales lines and completions timing. Apache averaged 16 drilling rigs and four frac crews in the Permian Basin during the quarter, drilling and completing 65 net wells up from 44 net wells in the third quarter. In the Midland Basin we placed 26 wells online, all of which were on multi-well pads. Our results are benefiting from a consistent, steady operational cadence across the Midland Basin.  In 2018, approximately 75% of our drilling program was focused on development drilling in Azalea, Powell and Wildfire areas, yielding predictable and economically robust drilling results.  One example of the type of longer-term results this program is yielding is the nine-well Wolfcamp pad at Powell, which we discussed last quarter. After 245 days online this Wolfcamp pad has cumulative production in excess of 1.5 million barrels of oil and 2 BCF of gas and continues to produce approximately 4,000 barrels of oil per day and 9.5 million cubic feet per day of gas. The remaining 25% of the program in Midland Basin consisted of delineation drilling on other acreage blocks.  Most notably, in our Benedum area located in Upton County, this four-well pad was 2 mile laterals targeted four different landing zones and achieved an average 30 day IP of 1,646 BOE per day per well with nearly 80% oil cuts. We\u2019re excited about these results as it sets up a number of locations for future drilling.  Shifting to the Delaware Basin we drilled a four-well pad in the Palmillo area of Eddy County, New Mexico, which averaged the 30 day IP of more than 1,700 BOE per day, 79% oil and these were drilled with 1 mile laterals. We plan to drill 20 wells in the area during 2019 and we will still have many years of inventory into play.  Please refer to the quarterly supplement for production details on these and other wells highlighted from the quarter.  At Alpine High our net production for the quarter averaged approximately 58,000 BOE per day. We exited the fourth quarter producing approximately 70,000 BOE per day on a net basis. We placed 26 wells on production in the field during the fourth quarter, bringing total wells placed on production for the year to 94. Highlights during the quarter include six wells at the Mont Blanc pad in the Northern Flank, which targeted two zones in the Woodford formation and averaged a 30 day IP of 16.1 million cubic feet equivalent per day of rich gas. This pad advances our learnings from the previously disclosed Blackfoot pad and demonstrates improvements in capital and production efficiency, utilizing improved configurations and larger fracs from fewer wells.  Also in the Northern Flank, we drilled the Iroquois State 201AH, which targeted the Barnett formation and averaged a 30-day IP of 7.6 million cubic feet of rich gas and 213 barrels of oil per day. These wells are indicative of the drilling program that we have planned for this year and we're looking forward to processing the rich gas to our new cryogenic facilities coming online in the second half of the year.  Our lease position at Alpine High is approximately 300,000 net acres as of year-end 2018. Consistent with our October 2017 webcast, we let a portion of our leasehold with known higher geologic risks expire. These areas were never included in our previously disclosed location counts.  Turning to service costs, in the Permian we have successfully locked in attractive rates for rigs, frac crews and sand for 2019. We\u2019ve budgeted for slightly lower year-over-year service costs overall at $53 WTI oil price forecast. We continue to monitor the marketplace to secure cost competitive and high-performance services and supplies. Before commenting on our international operations, I would like to address our US production trajectory for 2019. Production in the first half of the year is expected to be relatively flat with Q4 2018 volumes, as we've reduced our operated rig count and implemented a three month frac holiday with one of her two frac crews in the Midland Basin. We then see a fairly significant second half volume ramp resulting from the cryo commissioning at Alpine High, accelerating completions with return of the second frac crew in the Midland Basin and the startup of development in the North Sea.  As we stated in our press release a few weeks ago, we expect robust 4Q exit rates in 2019, giving us good momentum into 2020. Internationally, in Egypt, we drilled and completed 24 gross operated wells with a 96% success rate during the fourth quarter, and 110 total wells for the full year. Our 3D seismic acquisition in the Western Desert continues. To-date we have acquired data over 1.25 million acres completing acquisition in our legacy West Kalabsha and Shushan areas. Seismic acquisition in our new Northwest Razzak Concession is in progress for completion later this year.  More than 40 new lease have been identified thus far from early data processing and we are currently drilling our first prospect based on the new 3D in our West Kalabsha area.  Over the next couple of years, we will continue to build our high-quality inventory in Egypt as a result of the new concessions and acquisition of the new 3D. This will make our drilling program more capital efficient and set the stage for future potential growth in oil production and free cash flow.  Moving to the North Sea, production averaged approximately 63,000 BOE per day during the quarter, a 25% increase from the preceding period as turnaround activity was completed in the third quarter, and we realized a full three months of production from the fourth development well at Callater and the startup of the Garten development in November.  Garten has already produced over 1 million barrels of oil and 1.3 BCF of gas and is currently producing at 11,500 barrels of oil per day and 12 million cubic feet of gas. We\u2019re planning on second development well for Garten, which we will spud later this year. We\u2019ve also identified two geologic analog prospects, which we are assessing for inclusion in our 2020 drilling program. Operationally, we\u2019re off to a good start and anticipate another strong year in 2019.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve. Stephen Riney : Thank you, Tim. Today I will review our fourth quarter financial results, briefly touch on Apache\u2019s 2018 highlights and provide some further color on our 2019 financial guidance. As noted in the press release issued last night under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Apache reported fourth quarter 2018 net loss of $381 million or $1 per diluted common share. These results include a number of items that are outside of core earnings, which are typically excluded by the investment community and published earnings estimates.  The most significant of these items were various impairments taken during the quarter. In the US onshore we took an after-tax impairment of $253 million for oil and gas properties, primarily in the Anadarko Basin. In the offshore we took a $90 million after-tax impairment on a legacy investment in the Gulf of Mexico specific industry consortium.  In Egypt, we took an after-tax impairment of $63 million on three concessions that are unlikely to recover certain carry-in costs prior to the end of term due to inadequate remaining revenue potential. And in the North Sea we took an after-tax leasehold impairment of $71 million on a previous discovery, which no longer has certainty of future development.  Due to the nature of this property, this impairment is found in exploration expense. Excluding these and other smaller items, adjusted earnings for the quarter were $119 million or $0.31 per share.  Other than the production results previously outlined by John, most of the quarter's performance was as expected. Exploration expense was higher than normal, primarily due to the North Sea impairment I just noted and the write-off of other costs associated with the same item. Looking at 2018 as a whole, I would highlight it was a very good year in terms of delivering on guidance and expectations, improving our ability to live within cash flow and improving our return to investors.  When compared to our original 2018 guidance provided last February it was a consistently strong performance on production volumes as US production exceeded our original midpoint guidance by 4% and international production delivered as guided.  On the cost side nearly all major items were in line with or better than the guidance we provided a year ago. Meaningful exceptions for UK cash taxes, which were higher than guided due to the strength in Brent oil prices and financing costs they were up due to some cost incurred to restructure a portion of the debt portfolio. Capital spending came in higher than original guidance, driven primarily by increased activity in the Permian Basin. This included incremental drilling to optimize completion deficiencies, higher completions intensity, facilities investment and additional testing.  In November Apache completed the Altus Midstream transaction. Apache had funded approximately $1.1 billion of midstream investment at Alpine High since announcing the discovery in 2016.  In addition, we had acquired valuable equity options in five pipeline projects to transport product from Alpine High to Gulf Coast markets. Altus now provides a separate vehicle to fund both the ongoing midstream buildout, as well as the near term required investment in the joint venture pipeline projects. This significantly improves Apache's forward-looking ability to fund upstream capital spending at an appropriate level commensurate with the price environment.  Financially, we delivered materially improved returns for the year, continued to strengthen the balance sheet and increased return of capital to investors. For the year, we paid out $382 million in dividends, repurchased $305 million of Apache common stock and reduced debt by $281 million.  I'll now move on to guidance for 2019. I won't go through each component, but I would like to highlight a few key items. We have reduced our 2019 upstream capital to $2.4 billion, of which approximately 75% is allocated to the US and 25% to international, which includes Suriname. Consistent with the past, we expect our growth patterns in the US to continue supported by a slightly declining international production.  As Tim outlined, our production growth will come primarily in the back half of 2019. This is driven by a combination of a frac holiday during the first quarter in the Midland Basin, the timing of large pad completions throughout the Permian Basin, and the volume uplift from cryo processing in Alpine High.  For the first quarter of 2019, adjusted production is expected to be approximately 425,000 BOEs per day, 287,000 BOEs per day in the US and 138,000 BOEs per day internationally. Upstream capital spending will be around $625 million.  We have provided details of both our first quarter and full year guidance in the Financial and Operational Supplement, which can be found on our website.  In conclusion, we closed out 2018 well and have great momentum transitioning into 2019. We are executing on our strategy to sustain our international businesses for long-term free cash flow generation and to focus growth investment in the Permian Basin. We also have a tremendous exploration portfolio, which provides great optionality for the future. We are committed to maintaining financial discipline and living within cash flow in a $50 to $55 WTI environment, investing for long-term returns and returning capital to investors.  With the current portfolio and a separate Altus Midstream Company, we are well-positioned to deliver on those goals.  And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from line of Bob Brackett from Bernstein Research. Your line is open. Bob Brackett : Yes, I had a question on North Sea operating cost. I noticed a pretty significant step down in that asset. Is that something we should expect on a going forward basis? John Christmann : Well that\u2019s just going to be predominantly the production coming on at Garten in the Beryl area, so I think it will continue end of -- early part of '19 and the well comes off a little bit before we drill offset, it probably starts to go back up. So that's more driven the BOEs rather than the fixed dollars. Bob Brackett : And can you talk about the reserve revisions, is that related to some of the write-downs, or is there something happening there on maybe a five year plan and you\u2019re taking down some puds? Dave Pursell : No -- this is Dave Pursell. The revisions were across the board and independent of impairments, a little bit here and there by region. We did have some basis differentials took some puds off but nothing that would be -- we point to as material, it\u2019s more end of year bookkeeping. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets. Scott Hanold : I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color on Alpine High and it seems like there has been a bit of a shift in some of the focus more NGLs I guess deferring some of the oil drilling and specifically deferring some of the oil opportunities. Can you give us a little bit of color on sort of what drove that decision, was that more of trying to be more disciplined in spending in the near term, or was it more geologic based on what you seeing as you go forward in your plan? John Christmann : No, Scott, it\u2019s purely a function of the capital program. What you see is as we paired back a little bit internationally, I mean the world has changed from where we were on the last earnings call and we\u2019ve taken CapEx down as you know for 2019 and then the 2020 and \u201821. So it\u2019s really more a function of the program and what we've done is allocate that capital in a way that we can most efficiently invest it to drive the best long-term returns. You'll see continued programs, Egypt and the North Sea where we sustain and then in the US specifically we\u2019ve kind of looked at how spin that Permian capital and we were dropping rig count from a 16 to 18 range to 12 and you're going to see if five-rig program focused on Alpine High mainly on the rich gas today as we can defer some of the other things. And you will also see a very tidy program in the Midland and Delaware where the rigs and frac crews are allocated to kind of maximize our productivity and capital efficiency. So it\u2019s really just the luxury of being able to defer, will push back some timing on some testing and you\u2019re going to see really two focus programs : Rich gas and then an overall oil program. Scott Hanold : So would we expect that if oil price are higher than and you do have free cash flow that obviously previously you talked about getting back to shareholders, but as you look at increasing organic activity, would testing some of the old zones be a high priority for you all in Alpine High? John Christmann : I mean I think as you look at our portfolio today, we\u2019re committed to returning a minimum of 50% of free cash flow to our shareholders and that would be inclusive of any asset sales. But secondly we paired back in Egypt our Permian Midland and Delaware as well as Alpine High. So there's really three areas that we\u2019ve got some pretty strong programs that we would prioritize and think how do we start to put activity sets back but I mean it would be a combination of those areas. And it's a nice thing about having a portfolio with a low decline rates. We can gear down and still grow and generate strong long-term returns. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Gail Nicholson from Stephens. Your line is open. Gail Nicholson : You guys talked about a slowdown of activity in Alpine and the deemphasizing of drydock developments. Are you still achieving a very healthy exit rate in '19 with more NGLs? But as we look at 2020 with that deemphasize of that dry gas developments, can you just talk about how that any changes to previous 2020 growth outlook and how we should think about composition in 2020 Alpine? Stephen Riney : Well what we've done Gail is focused our programs and prior to having cryos coming on we were -- because the gas is so rich we will have to drill some of the dryer gas zones to blend on the pipelines back. So we will no longer have to do that and in 2019, 2020 and 2021. So even I think the key products is, is the program which we lay out a microenvironment it's pretty volatile today on a $50 to $55 world we've kind of laid out CapEx with likely or could be in the 2.5 billion to 2.8 billion ranges 2020 and \u201821, if you look at where we will exit '19, we\u2019re going to exit '19 going into '20 in a much stronger place than we ended '18, coming into '19. So capital probably looks pretty similar as a carry forward and we\u2019re confident that we can deliver mid single-digit to corporate rates at a minimum and there's a lot of factors that could cause that to improve as we start to look at that. Gail Nicholson : And then look just at the advancements that we've seen kind of in technology as well as seismic processing, has that helped you identified prospects better in Suriname, North Sea in Egypt and does any of those advancements changes your confidence level in success regarding what is your exploration target in those three areas? John Christmann : Clearly, technology is driving a lot of change and if you look at Egypt where we've added new acreage in order we're shooting the moves state-of-the-art broadband 3D. We've shown pictures in the past in some of our investor deck so what the 2013 seismic look like versus the current seismic. So there's no doubt that we\u2019re seeing a lot shakeout of that look in the Western Desert, I think our West Kalabsha we have identified now over 40 new prospects. So I think it's going to bear a lot of fruit and that's why we're pretty confident with the newer acreage and the new seismic in Egypt. It\u2019s going to give us more inventory to really return Egypt to potentially growth area for Apache. Clearly in Suriname we've got the 3D, we\u2019re excited -- that's a whole other topic about what Suriname can be, but 3D is a big piece there and then we continue to use 3D in our unconventional and onshore as well. It's been very key and was instrumental in the discovery of Alpine High and it remains a key piece as we go forward with the development plans. Operator : Your next question comes from line of John Freeman with Raymond James. Your line is open. John Freeman : The first question, you all provided the base decline rate for the overall company. Would it be possible to get that broken down for the US versus international? John Christmann : No, we haven't broken that out. I think what you've got is we're in the low 20s, and it's going to improve over the next couple of years, and we've got some conventional assets in the Permian that help and we\u2019ve also got some unconventional that have a little higher more characteristic decline. So it's kind of a combination of the asset basis but we haven\u2019t broken that out as of yet by area. John Freeman : Okay and then I just had a -- my other question is sort of in regards to that, Slide 12 you have, sort of set out for \u201819, kind how you come up with the capital plan and sort of what happens if the oil price does or the commodity price does better than plan and how you kind split up the amount goes to the investor versus increased activity. I\u2019m just trying to think about, make sure I\u2019m on the same page that we\u2019re thinking about. When you go into a year so let\u2019s say in 2020 if we\u2019re sitting here and oil is $70, does the plan get\u2019s at some discount to where the strip is and then if the oil price does better than that\u2019s upside or you all sort of think about it more from what your maintenance capital level is and then the plan is set at something just above that. I\u2019m just trying to think about the way it sort of gets flexed up or down according to the commodity environment? John Christmann : I mean I think the first is, we\u2019re taking a multiyear look here and then in today\u2019s world we\u2019re $50 to $55 and we think as an industry to improve our competitiveness with other industries we\u2019ve got to prove that we can deliver more capital to shareholders through the cycle. And so what we\u2019ve said we will deliver a minimum of 50% to investors because we think that's a meaningful number. John it could be more and what we\u2019ve said is that we would deliver a minimum of 50% before we increased activity but it\u2019s clearly things we can get after. So I think in general, the point is as we\u2019re damn serious about returning more capital to shareholders before we scale up our activity and our operations. Stephen Riney : Yes, John. This is Steve. I would just add to that saying that, that Slide 12 is actually poured from the actual plan we have in place for 2019, so it\u2019s based on the 2.4 billion capital program and it\u2019s based on the pricing environment that we find ourselves in today. And as John said previously in a $50 to $55 world out through \u201820 and \u201821 and we would have the capacity to spend $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion in that price environment still be cash flow neutral. It doesn\u2019t mean that we would spend that much, but we could and still be cash flow neutral. If we woke up and found ourselves in a $70 world in 2020 we have to keep in mind that this maintenance capital would have some sort of an inflationary effect on that. I would imagine, and so this chart holds for the 2019 plan and it holds for a $50 to $55 price environment but when you get into a different price environment we just need to contemplate that kind of stuff. Operator : Your next question comes from John Herrlin from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Your line is open. John Herrlin : Regarding Suriname, John, will you be drilling [8 ace] or you\u2019re going to have a partner? John Christmann : John today we own it a 100%. We\u2019ve got a drillship coming this summer. We will drill a minimum of one wells up to potentially three additional. We are prepared to go a 100%. We also are willing to listen to proposals and things where somebody might talk us into letting somebody else participate with us. So but for now we\u2019re a 100%. John Herrlin : And then regarding the US impairments with Anadarko Basin since that was a prior acquisition, not to your administration. Is that something that will then be put up for sale? John Christmann : When we look at the portfolio, we historically haven't announced when we were going to monetize assets and if you look at Canada, we usually came back and said we're going to do something after the fact. I think that we\u2019re always looking at the portfolio and assets that we are not funding. If there's an opportunity for somebody to create value by putting those assets into their hands in a way that we think would make sense we would be open to do them and we will probably talk about it after we had done that if that were the case. But we\u2019re always examining everything in our portfolio and looking at, does it belong and is it going to get funding or is it better off in somebody else's hands. John Herrlin : And then with the GoM was it that self-insurance thing? David Pursell : John, the GoM was the consortium that was put together back in 2011 for companies that were active in the Gulf of Mexico to respond to well incidents. John Herrlin : Okay. Yes, the insurance thing. Okay. David Pursell : We\u2019re clearly not active in the Gulf of Mexico anymore so\u2026 Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeoffrey Lambujon from Tudor, Pickering Holding Company. Jeoffrey Lambujon : In the past you mentioned slowing down in the Midland and legacy Delaware to progress learning in the Alpine High, it looks to be showing up an improved performance. So I was hoping if you could just speak to some of those more meaningful learnings as you\u2019ve kind of progressed further on that? John Christmann : Well I think Jeoff it boils down to, you go back in 2015, 2016, when we really went through a reset, we did a lot of strategic testing both in the Midland and the Delaware. We focused on pad development what is the special relationship between wells both vertically and horizontally. We focused on completions. And what you've seen is the use of technology, the learnings and the implementation of that you are now seeing that paid off in spades in our Midland and Delaware Basin programs. We've also been in the middle of that process at Alpine High, and we were conducting that with some of the key tests that we've talked about, our Blackfoot pad, our Mont Blanc pad. So it's a process that we continue and then I think the important thing is we've always talk, you need to think about things in terms of whole sections, full-scale of development and you have to keep integrating those learnings and you also have to recognize that the geology in each play is a little different and it's going to be in the [Elgin] Reservoir going to be key components in getting the what we call an optimized development program, and it's also why this year we\u2019re going to be running nearly two focused programs when we look at it. There\u2019s going to be a rich gas program at Alpine High, and you are going to see an oil focused program predominantly in the Midland and in Delaware. Jeoffrey Lambujon : And then separately on 2020, I appreciate the thoughts there on spending and how you are planning to exit 2019 with this year's plan. But as we dial-in next year, is there a good production range to think about that's associated with the 2.5 billion to of 2.8 billion that you've highlighted for next year? John Christmann : Well, I would just say, what I said earlier, we will exit '19 and go into '20 on stronger footing than we've come into this year and in a similar price environment capital allocation likely would look pretty similar. Those things can change, the productivity can change. But we think our floor is going to be mid single-digits at the corporate level. And we think that can improve as we\u2019ve proven in the past with efficiencies, some capital allocation, some other things. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Brian Singer : As you flow the dry gas piece of Alpine High a bit, can you just talk about the financing options at the Altus Midstream level? It seems like that\u2019s still in-house there but given the capital needs there and any risk of the need for equity infusion outside from other players like yourselves or others? John Christmann : There is going to be a call, we want to collect a day on Altus, Brian. So I would just advise you to tune in there for the Altus call. Brian Singer : I guess from an Apache perspective any comment on that or just wait for that call? David Pursell : Brian I would just say from an Apache perspective, obviously we worked very closely with the Altus team and we don't anticipate any type of capital call on Apache none whatsoever, Altus is actively working their forward-looking capital program and looking at options and they see options for financing as some pretty attractive ones and I think they will be going forward with that. And again referring it to the call this afternoon to get more detail then. Brian Singer : I appreciate that color from the Apache perspective. And then as you slow the dry gas development at Alpine High and the oil delineation to focus more on wet gas and to be capital disciplined, do you ultimately see that oil delineation and dry gas production happening but at a later date and/or when you think about any excess cash flow above the 50% you would return to shareholders, do you see opportunities -- would you consider opportunities to bolster the portfolio broadly through bolt-ons or acquisitions? John Christmann : Today clearly with what our opportunities set is, is we\u2019re not looking to bolster the portfolio with acquisitions. We've got some very attractive programs that we have deferred. We will eventually resume some of that testing and there is quite a bit of ability to add activity in our Midland non-Alpine High, Delaware, and at Alpine high as well as on the international front in Egypt. So not seeing as we have not over the last four years thought about making to do something on the acquisition side. Operator : Your next question comes from Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Your line is now open. Charles Meade : I wondered to ask a question about Alpine High. And perhaps we will have to wake at to 1 o'clock for this but you mentioned in your press release that you guys had field wide shut down and some facilities came online a little later than was planned. So wondering if you could just give a narrative on what happened in the quarter, whether those two events are connected, perhaps and if there is anything different that we should expect going forward over the course of 2018 for the built out? John Christmann : I\u2019ll let Tim jump in, in just a second but Charles the answer you got a one-time offset and we ended up putting a lot of water into the gas lines which required us to have to shut down the entire field for longer period. And then it took longer to get everything cleaned out, so it\u2019s not an event that will occur in the future. And then the other was just purely timing of the way of moving the pad back. So I'll let Tim to give you some more details, but we exited the year kind of where we thought we\u2019d be. It just was a little slower getting a few things on. Timothy Sullivan : Yes, Charles just a little more color on that, on the unplanned field wide shut-in, that was due to, we had a failure on the highway where we put some water down the sales line, so we had to shut the field in for a few days, we had to dig the line and then we\u2019d to re-pressure that line, and then it just took a little longer to get everything up and running and back to full production. So, that was a big portion of it. Then John mentioned the deferrals too and that was really because of the rich gas drilling we had done and the MOUs that we've got, we were running into the BTU spec issues. So we had to delay the development of a number of rich gas wells to put some dry gas wells online to get our BTU spec back in place and that causeed the main issues at Alpine High. There were some minor timing issues just on new facility startups. But the first two were the main issues. Stephen Riney : Charles, this is Steve. I'd just add the obvious point and that is when your -- you've got an asset that's growing at the pace of Alpine High and you're bringing large pads on, movements of events in the quarter can actually make a big difference to a quarter. To state the obvious. Charles Meade : Always appreciated. Timothy Sullivan : All these issues have been resolved and we hit accelerate that we anticipated as well\u2026 Charles Meade : Got it. And then Tim, maybe this is a question best for you. But I -- on your Midland Basin results in the quarter, one of the things that struck me is, curious or maybe a little countertrend it to what I've seen in the rest of the industry is that you guys have had better Wolfcamp results down in Upton County than you did in your June Tippett pad in Southern Midland. And it seems like for most of rest of the industry that productivity relationship was actually being reversed, the better wells have been up Northern Upton Southern Midland. So wondered if you could talk about what's going on there, and if it has any implications for the way you guys are going to rank your priorities going forward? Timothy Sullivan : Yes, we've had good results from both areas. The Upton County wells in particular the Powell and then the latest test that we did in Hargrove have been outstanding wells. And a little bit is based on some of the testing that we have done. That we\u2019ve gone to development mode and we changed our spacing, most of our wells have been drilled in Upton County to-date, and that's what we've advanced our learnings the most. And I think we've got our spacing completely figured out there and our well completions. And as a result, we've seen it in our results. And I think we're going to see that same evolution up in Wildfire when we start drilling more wells there as well. Operator : Your next question comes from Arun Jayaram from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Arun Jayaram : I wanted to talk a little bit about Suriname. You guys have completed your seismic on Block 58 and presumably have the geo mapping it has those Exxon Hymera gas county discovery, which is on the Surinam line. What do you think will define the oil leg of what has -- and perhaps you could set the stage for your initial prospect that you will drill midyear? John Christmann : Arun, we kind of talked internally, we need to make sure we send them a Christmas card. What it proves is you got hydrocarbons in the system. Clearly in a conventional setting you\u2019re going to expect to see the condensates and the lighter hydrocarbons in the upper sections. I think what I would say is as we look at where they are and I understand they are also continuing to drill deeper themselves in that well, but we would -- so lot of our targets will be deeper where we would anticipate they will be oily as is the case over on the Stabroek block. It\u2019s very, very encouraging. The thing we said in the script though I want to point out is we've got multiple play sites, more than a handful. The thing that\u2019s unique about our block is, is you got shallow and deepwater access and there is both pre-and post unconformity plays. So we\u2019ve mapped many, many high-impact prospects and we\u2019re very excited what this could mean for the country of Suriname and Apache. Arun Jayaram : And just a follow-up John. We\u2019re reading into your capital allocation in the Permian in 2019 where we didn't note a little bit more activity in your Other Delaware and we\u2019re just trying to think about -- respect the fact that Altus will put their topic later today but they did reduce their overall guidance from 19 to 21 so just trying to read into that what the capital allocation for Alpine High could look like over the next couple of two, three years? John Christmann : Well as we said we\u2019ve reduced rig count this year, we\u2019re going down from seven or eight rigs at Alpine High to five. I mean we\u2019re reducing our Permian rig count from 16 to 17 down the 12 to 13 and so both programs are going to be reduced as we said. Alpine will get its fair share but you're going to see two very focused programs where we can set up our rigs and frac crews appropriately to deliver optimal value for the capital investment. And we like the pace, we like the programs. We\u2019re both are going to be very focused and pretty similar to what we've been doing fruitfully. Operator : Your next question comes from David Deckelbaum from Cowen. Your line is now open. David Deckelbaum : Just curious as you look at the -- you give the guidance around mid single-digit growth into 2020 and \u201821 with the $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion budget. I guess this year we saw the double-digit production growth coming out of US onshore. Should we assume that that continues sort of within that high-level model over the next couple years and is there a point in \u201820 and \u201821 program where we would see more growth capital going in Egypt following some of the acreage expansions and seismic activity that you\u2019ve had there? John Christmann : I mean I think there is no doubt we\u2019re going to have the opportunity to put more capital into Egypt as we get through the 3D and the processing, but we also believe that just through the high grading and the inventory and the quality of the prospects, we can grow that free cash flow and grow that investment in Egypt simultaneously. And if you look back to the last four years and if I take you back to 2014, we are running 28 rigs in Egypt, so we got down to a handful. We've been running about 12, 12 rigs. And really over that time period there's two discoveries Pithom and Berenice, which enabled us to keep Egypt pretty flat at 340,000 BOEs a day on the gross side. So with the new seismic and the new acreage we\u2019re optimistic that there will be several new types of areas like that will let us put more capital in and that efficiency will help us drive more cash flow and help really change the trajectory in Egypt. David Deckelbaum : But that's not necessarily embedded into that \u201820 and \u201821 capital programs? John Christmann : Not at this point. David Deckelbaum : Allocation is more similar, okay. John Christmann : Not at this point. David Deckelbaum : And my second question is just, when we go back to some of the conversations you were having around spacing and particularly in Alpine High, and if you guys could revisit some of the results from the Blackfoot pad. I know you talked about it last quarter just the spacing at 660 and developing long and wider spacing with larger fracs. So can you talk to us a bit about your learnings there and what you think it means for how you are going to space the wells in that Northern Flank? John Christmann : Well, I mean what we've done is we were pretty, we were sticklers on keeping our frac, I'll call it frac jobs similar, so we know what the rock was telling us, and what we learned at the Blackfoot pad is we placed 12 Woodford wells and a half section there were Woodford day 4Bs and 4Cs and we used the same recipe we have been using because we were trying to understand the inter-related most of it. And what we learned there as we would likely can get away with 4As and 4Bs on 660 with those size frac jobs, but we also wanted to test the Mont Blanc, a little wider spacing and a little larger frac jobs, and we will measure those as the flow back over time. I mean what's important everybody gets dialed in on 30 day IPs and you have to look at how wells perform over 3, 6, 9 months, 12 months and I think what you'll see is us probably going a little wider. You're going to see multiple landing zones in the Woodford and larger fracs, some combination in there and that's part of the learning process that we've gone through in the Midland Basin. And as Tim pointed out that's why you're starting to see those same results come through as we continue to very scientifically evaluate every well in our patterns and are doing this in a way designed that\u2019s going to drive improved productivity and capital efficiency. Operator : And this concludes our Q&A session. I'll now turn the call back to John Christmann for closing remarks. John Christmann : We appreciate all of you for joining us today. And I like to leave you with three key takeaways from the call. First, the world has changed significantly since our last quarterly earnings call. The drop in oil prices necessitates conservative budgeting and capital management. Apache is currently delivering attractive returns and growth rates and can achieve cash flow neutrality and sustain production inclusive of our very strong dividend down to about $45 WTI oil using some fairly conservative assumptions. Second, in 2019, year-over-year, we will sustain relatively flat production internationally and generate approximately 15% growth in the US with our capital heavily concentrated on two programs : oil growth in the Midland and Delaware basins and rich gas development at Alpine High.  And lastly, we have entered 2019 with very good momentum and expect to enter 2020 in a even stronger position. As a result, we plan to sustain at least mid single-digit 4Q to 4Q exit rate growth through 2021 at $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion annual spending. Growth will come from a balanced program of Alpine rich gas development in Midland, Delaware oil with significant upside potential from our exploration portfolio including our US onshore unconventional, Egypt and eventually Suriname. Thank you and we look forward to sharing our ongoing progress in the future. Operator : Ladies and gentleman, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day. My name is Christie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache Corporation First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Clark, you may begin your conference. Gary Clark : Good morning and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's first quarter financial and operational results conference call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John Christmann. Tim Sullivan, Executive Vice President of Operations Support, will then provide additional operational color; and Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO will summarize our fourth quarter and full-year financial performance. Also available on the call to answer questions are Apache Executive Vice Presidents, Mark Meyer, Energy Technology, Data Analytics and Commercial Intelligence; and Dave Pursell, Planning, Reserves and Fundamentals. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 25 minutes in length, with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you've had the opportunity to review our first quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. On today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt's tax barrels. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John. John Christmann : Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will provide an overview of Apache's first quarter results, discuss our production outlook and comment on our first exploration well in Suriname, review our upstream capital budget and Apache\u2019s commitment to return incremental cash flow to investors and highlight our progress on non-core asset sales. Apache had an excellent first quarter in terms execution, well performance and delivery against our production and capital guidance. We exceeded our U.S. production target, my 5,000 BOEs per day and our international target by 7,000 BOEs per day, on a capital budget of less than $600 million. In the Permian basin, we maintained oil production near fourth quarter levels despite placing one of our two completion crews on a frac holiday for the entire first quarter. At Alpine High, where we also had a relatively low number of completions, production was up significantly from the fourth quarter and was in line with our guidance of 70,000 BOEs per day. Overall, we delivered a 5% sequential quarterly increase in Permian basin volumes. This is an impressive accomplishment given that we placed only 39 wells online in the first quarter compared to 60 wells during the fourth quarter. Strong operational execution and well performance coupled with minimal facilities downtime drove these results. International production was up 6% compared to the fourth quarter. In the North Sea, we benefited from strong early production rates from two wells at Gartner and Callater. A continuation of good results from our revamped Waterford program in the Forties field and high facilities uptime across our operations. In Egypt, gross production was down slightly in the quarter but adjusted production net to Apache was up primarily due to the timing of cost recovery around year end. Looking ahead, second quarter Permian oil production is projected to be down slightly due to completions timing with growth anticipated in the back half of the year is the number of completions increases significantly. At Alpine High production volumes will be impacted in the second quarter by the voluntary gas deferrals we discussed in our press release last week. I would note however, that temporary deferral of this production is expected to improve our short-term net cash flow. Construction of Altus Midstream\u2019s first two cryogenic plants is proceeding ahead of schedule with the first plant currently commissioning and expected to flow gas this month. The second plant is expected to be fully in service during July and the third plant remains on schedule for the fourth quarter. By year-end, Altus will have a total 600 million cubic feet of nameplate rich gas processing capacity, capable of producing more than 60,000 barrels of NGLs per day. Kinder Morgan's GCX pipeline is also expected to be in service beginning in October, which will give Apache access to Gulf Coast pricing on 550 million cubic feet per day of gas from the Permian. These processing and transportation catalysts will drive a significant uplift and Alpine High liquids production revenue and cash flow on which Steve will provide more detail in a few minutes. On the international side, production will decrease in the second quarter as planned. The North Sea will experience natural declines from high production wells at Gartner and Callater while only one new well is being brought online during the quarter. In Egypt, we expect gross oil production to increase as we ramp up activity and our new East Bahariya concession. However, the impact of higher oil prices on our production sharing contracts coupled with natural gas production declines will result in lower volumes net to Apache. Looking out to the end of the year, our projected growth rate guidance from fourth quarter 2018 to fourth quarter 2019 is unchanged. We continue to expect 6% to 10% growth on a total company adjusted basis consisting of 12% to 16% growth in the U.S. and a 2% to 4% decline internationally. Permian oil production is still expected to grow 5%. In Suriname, we have contracted the drillship and continue to anticipate spreading the first well on Block 58 in Suriname around mid-year. The Noble Sam Croft, which is working in the Gulf of Mexico will deploy to Suriname upon completion of its current assignment. We have secured this drillship for a one well commitment and have an option on three additional wells. While Apache is preparing to drill the first well on block 58 at 100%, we have received and are evaluating numerous proposals from potential partners. Turning now to CapEx. Our first quarter upstream capital investment was below guidance and was down 27% from fourth quarter levels. We began preparing for an activity reduction back in November, which was critical to enabling such a material change in our activity pace in less than one quarter. As planned, our second quarter CapEx will increase slightly from the first quarter as a result of increased completion spending in the Permian associated with the return of our second frac crew in the Midland basin and the timing of large pad completions of Alpine High. The timing of exploration spending mostly on Suriname, but also related to some activities in the lower 48 and lease payments at Alpine High where we are exercising some extension options due to the slower drilling activity. Despite some inflationary headwinds related to the rise in oil prices. We remain on track to deliver our 2019 planned activities set for $2.4 billion. We were experiencing cost increases in labor, trucking, fuel and chemicals, but have thus far been able to offset these through efficiency gains. We previously stated Apache's commitment to returning at least 50% of our incremental cash generation from all sources to investors before increasing our planned activity set. In keeping with this commitment, our 2019 planned capital activity and budget remains unchanged and we will began returning incremental cash to investors in the coming months. This is of course in addition to our current regular dividend. Steve will elaborate further. With the success of our organic growth and exploration program, we find ourselves with some assets in the portfolio that we do not envision funding over the next several years. These assets will be more valuable in the hands of different owners. Accordingly, we recently entered into sales agreements totaling approximately $300 million, most of which is related to an exit of the SCOOP/STACK which will close in the second quarter. In summary, 2019 is progressing very well. Overall production was strong in the first quarter and we are demonstrating excellent capital discipline and cost control. The North Sea and Egypt continued to deliver robust free cash flow with their leverage to premium Brent crude prices and higher natural gas and NGL net backs. In the Permian, we are poised to deliver attractive oil growth in a substantial cash flow uplift at Alpine High in the second half of the year. We will also be advancing our differential exploration initiatives most notably in Suriname. In closing, Apache continues to deliver on the strategy we established four years ago, which is to fund the capital program, capable of delivering long-term returns and sustainable growth, live within cash flow at reasonable oil prices, and continue to return meaningful capital to shareholders. We can accomplish this due to our high quality drilling inventory and attractive exploration portfolio, relatively low base decline rate and continuous focus on improving capital productivity and efficiency. With that, I will turn the call over to Tim Sullivan who will provide some operational details on the quarter. Timothy Sullivan : Good morning. My prepared remarks on this call will cover first quarter 2019 region highlights and a review of the excellent progress we are making at Alpine High on cost reduction initiatives and rich gas pad optimization. Operationally, we are off to a very good start with all regions performing well. Companywide adjusted production was up 4% from the fourth quarter 2018 and up 19% from the same period in the prior year. The Permian was the largest growth driver with production up 5% and 36% respectively over the same time period. As John noted, these results are particularly impressive giving our reduced activity during the quarter. Our well completions in the U.S. were down 35% from the fourth quarter, which was the result of timing and a frac holiday in the Permian Basin. We have recently added back a cleaner, cheaper natural gas field hydraulic frac fleet. In the Midland Basin where we continue to drill high productivity oil wells, our primary activity in this quarter was an 8-well Wolfcamp B pad at Powell and a 6-well Lower Spraberry pad at Wildfire. In the Delaware Basin, we completed and brought on line a 4-well Wolfcamp pad at Dixieland, and at Alpine High, we brought on line 17 wells with the primary focus on rich gas in the Northern Flank. In Egypt, as a result of our recently awarded concessions and our ongoing broadband seismic acquisition program, we have generated several hundred leads and prospects in both legacy and new concession areas. In the New East Bahariya concession, we brought on line three exploration wells that achieved the combined peak rate of nearly 4,500 barrels of oil per day and have cumed more than 125,000 barrels of oil. These are low cost, short-cycle wells that typically payout very quickly. We also continue to have exploration success on our legacy acreage. One notable well on our Seawall concession in the Faghur Basin achieved a 30-day average flow rate of 5,200 barrels of oil per day. In the Matruh Basin, our Tango North exploration well tested at a rate of 4,000 barrels of oil per day and will go on line around mid-year. We also had a very successful Q1 development drilling campaign in Egypt with 14 producers, nine of which have tested in excess of 1,000 BOE per day. As we continue our G&G work, we expect to identify and drill many low-cost high rate oil prospects throughout the Western Desert, such as the ones we drilled this quarter. Turning to the North Sea, we drilled our first development well at Storr, which was the site of our 2016 exploration discovery. This well encountered 232-feet of net pay in the Nansen and Eriksson formations similar to the results from the discovery well. As we explored deeper, this well also encountered an additional 84-feet of net pay in the Kahraman formation, which is the same sand that is highly productive at Callater. First production at Storr is expected late in the fourth quarter. At Alpine High we will reach a significant milestone this month to start up of Altus first cryogenic plant in the next two to three weeks. Before Steve walks you through the significant cash generation in margin uplift we will receive. I wanted to highlight the significant progress we have made with both costs and our rich gas optimization initiatives on the upstream side. Since Alpine High is delineation phase began in 2017, Apache has made steady efficiency gains, drilling costs per foot or down approximately 20% from 2017 through the end of the first quarter. Over the same time period, we realized that 30% reduction in completion costs per lateral foot. These costs improvements have come with only a modest increase in average lateral length. We expect to generate further efficiencies as lateral links increase over time and the average number of wells drilled per pad increases. Multiwell pad optimization has now begun at Alpine High. We are evaluating optimal pattern and spacing relationships within a section to recover larger volumes of hydrocarbons with fewer wells and less capital. As an example, we recently conducted spacing and pattern tests on two rich gas pads on the Northern Flank situated in adjacent sections. By adjusting the horizontal spacing between wells, the vertical location within target zones, and an improving our frac design. We are seeing cumulative recoveries from our 6-well Mont Blanc pad significantly outperform our 8-well Blackfoot pad. 6-wells producing from the Woodford A&B formations on the Mont Blanc pad achieved 150 days gross cumulative production of 10.5 Bcf of rich gas compared to 9.7 Bcf and the 8-well Blackfoot pad in the same Woodford A&B formations. In combination with cryogenic processing each pad was also have cube in excess of 800,000 barrels of NGLs. With 2 fewer wells, the Mont Blanc pad has not only outperform but has also realized cost savings of $12.7 million as a result of fewer well bores. Capital efficiency is vital to success in resource play development and the trends are certainly positive for Alpine High. We believe there are substantial additional cost savings to be realized through ongoing optimization initiatives which include longer laterals and larger pads. Apache has also made considerable upfront investments in water handling and reuse facilities at Alpine High, which will drive cost savings for many years to come. Our primary target formations, the Woodford and the Barnett produced very little institchu water, thereby eliminating the need to contract costly water handling trucks and salt water disposal services. We believe the Alpine High is well on its way to being the lowest cost, most efficient and most environmentally friendly rich gas play in the country. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve. Stephen Riney : Thank you, Tim. On today's call, I will review first quarter financial results, update the status of gas production deferrals at Alpine High. Provide a few guidance changes for 2019, highlight the cash generation capacity of our rich gas production at Alpine High following cryo startup later this month and GCX startup later this year and outline our current thinking around capital return to investors. As noted in the press release issued last night under generally accepted accounting principles. Apache reported first quarter of 2019 consolidated net loss of $47 million or $0.12 per diluted common share. These results include a number of items that are outside of core earnings, which are typically excluded by the investment community and their published earnings estimates. On an after tax basis the most significant items include a $35 million unrealized loss on derivatives, a $31 million tax adjustment related primarily to evaluation allowance on deferred tax assets and $18 million of leasehold impairments. None of these items impacted cash flow in the quarter. Excluding these and other smaller items adjusted earnings for the quarter were $38 million or $0.10 per share. Highlights for the quarter include upstream capital investment of less than $600 million, which demonstrates our commitment to running a discipline program and meeting our full-year upstream capital budget of $2.4 billion. For 2019, we have locked in pricing on much of our capital costs such as drilling rigs, pressure pumping services in sand. However, as John indicated, trucking, labor, fuel and chemical costs are trending higher with oil prices. First quarter operating costs, we're generally in line with guidance. LOE per BOE costs came in a bit higher than expectations, primarily driven by Egypt. Offsetting this gathering, processing and transportation costs were less than guidance. As we look at the remainder of 2019, let me first discuss our temporary production deferrals at Alpine High. Beginning in late March, for a variety of reasons, Permian Basin natural gas dipped to extremely low, and at times negative pricing. In response, Apache chose to defer a portion of our guest production at Alpine High. In the month of April, these deferrals averaged approximately 230 million cubic feet per day of gross wellhead gas. The deferred volumes are comprised of both lean and rich gas. And now we anticipate a continuation of week gas prices, until more transport capacity comes online later in the year. We currently plan to restore all of our rich gas production as we commissioned our first two cryo facilities over the next eight to 10 weeks. Apache is cognizant of the impact that gas deferrals have on Altus Midstream Company and has agreed to reduce certain shared overhead costs. We believe this is in the best interest of both companies. It has a negligible net impact to Apache and ensures that Altus remains in a good position to deliver on the critical near-term infrastructure build out at Alpine High. With this situation and other impacts in mine, we have updated our forward looking guidance on a number of items. Taking into account, a range of potential production deferrals for the remainder of the quarter, our second quarter Alpine High production outlook is 45,000 to 55,000 BOE per day. This is projected to increase to 85,000 to 95,000 BOE per day in the third quarter, which still includes the potential for some deferred volumes. Our 2019 rig schedule and completions activity is not impacted by the deferrals. As a result, we still expect that fourth quarter and year-end exit rates from Alpine High will exceed 100,000 BOE per day. In addition to issuing at 2019 quarterly guidance at Alpine High, we have also introduced quarterly Permian oil guidance and international guidance. The details of which can be found in the supplement on our website. For upstream capital investment, we are expecting the second quarter to be in the $650 million to $700 million range and full-year capital investment remains at $2.4 billion, as originally planned. For LOE, we are increasing our guidance to recognize some additional costs in Egypt as well as the impact of lower volumes in Alpine High. Our full-year LOE is now expected to average around $8 per BOE. Next, I would like to review some upcoming changes, which will significantly improve the cash flow generation from Alpine High. While we have been clear that Alpine High is a diversified resource with all three hydrocarbons phases at its core, it is an enormous rich gas play and the key to value creation is full recovery and monetization of the NGL stream. Today we'd process rich gas through mechanical refrigeration units, which are not very efficient, so we don't recover the full NGL stream. The resulting small volumes of NGLs are currently truck to a facility where they can be transported to Mont Belvieu and fractionated. This temporary setup is relatively high costs and significantly squeezes the cash margin. Finally, we are selling most of the residue gas at Waha, which as we spoke about previously, prices at around zero today. The result is extremely low margins and minimal cash flow net to Apache. That is the reality of Alpine High today. But that is all about to start changing because of the preparations that have underway for nearly two years. By the end of this quarter, we will generate much higher NGO yields as we transitioned to cryo processing. We will receive much better NGL margins through transport and fractionation under our long-term fixed price contract with enterprise. And in a few months, when GCX is placed in service, we will transport residue gas out of the basin and receive Gulf Coast pricing. And our supplement, we have included a slide illustrating the cash generating potential at Alpine High, assuming full utilization of a single cryo unit with 200 million cubic feet per day of nameplate processing capacity. To summarize the key takeaways, 200 million cubic feet per day of gross wellhead gas process through Altus\u2019 cryo facilities is capable of generating $270 million to $300 million of annualized revenue under a very reasonable range of commodity price assumptions. Note this is net revenue to Apache after royalties. After further netting out all gathering, processing, fractionation and transportation fees as well as projected operating costs and state severance taxes, Apache\u2019s annualized net cash flows from a single cryo facility are expected to range from $135 million to $165 million. So this transition will begin in the next few weeks and will carry on through the rest of 2019. By the end of this year, we will have three of these cryo facilities in service with all three of them expected to be operating at full capacity sometime in 2020. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to address our thoughts on returning cash to investors. Coming into 2019, we committed to returning at least 50% of excess free cash to investors, before increasing capital activity. With the stronger than planned year-to-date oil prices and the coming proceeds from asset sales, we will soon be in a position to begin that process. We will accomplish this through debt reduction, share repurchases or most likely a combination thereof. To the extent we choose to include some debt reduction that would likely begin with retiring $150 million of debt that matures in July, all of this is of course in addition to our ongoing dividends. Also, just to be clear, we have no plans to change our capital activity set. In conclusion, we have began the year well, building on the momentum from 2018. We continue to execute on our strategy of delivering returns-focused short cycle growth in the Permian Basin, sustaining our international businesses for long-term free cash flow generation in building growth opportunities for the long-term through exploration. 2019 will be a promising step forward. Alpine High is on the doorstep of generating significant cash flow with the startup of cryo processing and transported gas to the Gulf Coast, and we will commence exploration activities on Block 58 in Suriname this summer. While we are prepared to proceed on a sole risk basis, we are actively considering proposals from numerous would-be partners. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research. Robert Brackett : Hey, good morning. I had a question on Block 58 in Suriname. It looks like the lease expires the initial exploration term June 24 of next year. Can you talk about the renewal process or the extension process on that lease? John Christmann : Bob at this point, we've worked with the government of Suriname. We've got a one rig or one well, commitment kicks us into the next phase. And obviously we will commence that well ahead of that time schedule, so it'll kick us into the next phase and that's all we've shared publicly at this time. Robert Brackett : And the next phase is a \u2013 it\u2019s two to three-year extension, and is there any relinquishment involved? John Christmann : It kicks us well into Phase II and at this point, we have not given any more color on Phase II. Robert Brackett : Okay. Appreciate it. John Christmann : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from John Freeman of Raymond James. John Freeman : Hi, guys. John Christmann : Good morning, John. John Freeman : Following up on Suriname, given the unsolicited sort of interest you've had from potential partners, and you all talked about, you'd be willing to proceed on an individual basis. Does this in any way sort of possibly delay when you spread the well while you kind of review all these proposals before you spread it? John Christmann : Not at all. I mean, we're on a path. We're prepared \u2013 we\u2019ll be prepared to drill multiple wells, and we\u2019ve said we\u2019ve got a one well commitment with the rig and three optional wells, and we're prepared to head down the path we're on. So not at all. John Freeman : Okay. And then just on \u2013 the follow-up for me on Slide 11 on Alpine High and the cost improvements that you all broke out when you look at sort of pad development versus the other wells. Can you remind me what percentage of the activity right now is on pads versus the rest of the wells? John Christmann : I mean the bulk of it is shifting to pads. What you've got in there is just the quarter numbers. It was kind of 194 versus what it would have been in terms of the pads at 153 type numbers. So we're shifting in the pads, but it's some of the testing and some of the other wells would drive that. But you're seeing us move predominantly into pad development with some larger pads coming. John Freeman : Great. Thanks guys. Appreciate it. John Christmann : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Douglas Leggate of Bank of America. Douglas Leggate : Well, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. John, I wonder if I could pull this a little bit on Suriname. I would understanding is that when the well was drilled in the adjacent block, there was down or on up dip oil well that was tied by that well, which obviously bodes very well for your blog? So my question is, how have you chosen the location of the well and given that - assuming not correct. Why wouldn't you drill the location right up against the Guyana border? John Christmann : Well, I mean, the first thing is we know we've got an active hydrocarbon system Doug. We've got seven plays when you look at our block, I mean it's just an unbelievable walk and as we've said more than 50, very large prospect. So we obviously have chosen our first well location. We have not disclosed that. But clearly we've taken into account any information we have through public means that's out there. Douglas Leggate : Would it be reasonable to assume that would be, how can I put it one of the top two or three targets on the block to basically try and make sure your side of it? John Christmann : I wouldn't want to assume anything about the top three targets on the block, but clearly you've got a discovery a that is on the lease line and that's your bodes well for us. But I hate you assuming anything. Douglas Leggate : Understand. My follow-up is also about Suriname if you don't mind that. It really goes to your point about 100%. These wells and the adjacent block are quite an expensive relatively speaking $50 million to $100 million given the potential impact on farmed and value in the block. Why wouldn't you drill it 100%? John Christmann : Well, I mean, as of today we still on the block 100% and that's the path we're marching down. So I mean the reason we wouldn't is because somebody talked us out and doing that. Douglas Leggate : Fair point. Forgive me. I was going to try one final one. Out of sign beat on the road, talking a little bit about this on the prospect backlog and just share with everybody what you see as your risk prospect by lock in the block. And I will leave it there. Thank you so much. John Christmann : I mean I just think it's a phenomenal block. Our timing and when we picked it up, we were just fortunate that we picked this at the middle of 2015 when there was not a lot of activity, a lot of interest. We were able to do it but before Exxon drill laser and before we drilled our first well and it was a really, really low price in terms of the commitment at the time and it is very well-positioned as we've said. There's multiple plays. We've got both shallow and deepwater targets that we can get to. And I mean, when you look at the size of this 1.44 million acres, I mean, that's larger than range county just for perspective. And there's more than seven different plays and 50 plus very large prospect. So we're anxious to kind of get going. Douglas Leggate : Good luck, John. Appreciate the answers. Thank you. John Christmann : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Gail Nicholson of Stephens. Gail Nicholson : Good morning, everybody. Can you talk about where the decline rate is at the 40 field now in North Sea with the Waterford management that you were doing and how that has changed maybe any near-term PNA you would have it Forties? John Christmann : Gail, I mean, I think what you've seen as we've changed philosophically how we approaching that and we really are managing the Waterford. I do not have the particulars off the cuff, but we are seeing long-term trends that are flattening that decline. If you look at the abandonment timeframe, even prior it's been in the 2032 to 2035 time reframe, I think this pushes that back And most importantly, it just provides stability, to the rights out there. So but I don't have those \u2013 we\u2019ve not what's been done. I would say you could look at some of the work that would Mac I think recently updated some of their work that is starting to reflect some of that. But I don't even think their report captures all of what we see. Gail Nicholson : Okay. Great. And then just looking at the improvement you guys have seen in the Alpine High well cost. You've only done a slightly longer laterals. Can you just talk about how you envision lateral link progression over them, the next I guess several years and what you think that the farther I do from a cost improvement standpoint on the drilling aspect? John Christmann : Well, I mean the big thing we've got down there as you don't have a lot of shallow production you're having to deal with. We also don't have a lot of chirrup and hard rock like you have up in the Oklahoma area. So you can get down quickly. We've been able to eliminate some casing strings. Clearly, the land position will dictate some are lateral lengths. The other big factor we've got in the source interval as you do not have water. And so with your longer laterals, you're going to get the productivity increases on a relative as you increase your lateral foot basis. Most of our wells have been shorter in the north because that's where our land, retention has been. And so that's what you're saying. But clearly, as we get the opportunity to drill longer laterals, you'll see, us transitioning mayor and I think you're going to continue to see costs come down. If you look at our numbers, we've had great progress and we continue to see progress is those programs have continued this quarter, so a lot of really good things happening on \u2013 at Alpine High. Operator : And our next question comes from Mike Scialla of Stifel. Michael Scialla : Yes. Good morning. Steve, walk us through some pretty good detail on the uplift you expect to see with the cryo plants coming on Slide 12. Just wondering with Waha Hub gas prices where they are, was there any discussion with all this to maybe potentially delay a ramping up that first cryo plant until the GCX a line goes into service in October? Can you just talk about that and if not, how does that ramp at the first cryo plant look in terms of the timing? John Christmann : Yes. So the back part of your question first, the cryo number one is \u2013 it is being commissioned now, and it should be a \u2013 it should be full by the end of May. In terms of \u2013 well cryo number two will be \u2013 it's actually moved up in the schedule and be commissioning in June. It will be full by the end of July. In terms of considering the possibility of moving those back in the schedule, no, we did not consider that at all. We want to get those things up and running. We want to get the rich gas flowing again and we want to get those things working to the full extent possible of extracting that NGL content out of that rich gas stream. We've got enough gas today or fill cryo number one, and we will have enough gas, by the end of July to fill cryo number two. So those will be fully functional and full of rich gas, on the day they're ready to go full. The primary reason why we didn't, as you can look at that that slide, in the pack that we gave out, you can see the gas is certainly an important part of the full operating cash margin from the rich gas at Alpine High, but it's not the dominant piece. There's some oil content in those rich gas wells and there's the NGL yields. And there's \u2013 even if gas is selling at zero, you can see that that's still above a breakeven cash flow situation. Once we get those things fall. So we want to get them operational. We're going to get them up and running and GCX is not far away. Its official startup date is October 1 and that's not that's not too long away. Michael Scialla : Thanks for that. And maybe a follow-up, can you just talk about your outlook for NGL prices over the next couple of years, obviously a key component as you said to the economics at Alpine High? David Pursell : Yes. Hi, this is Dave Purcell. If you look at wide grade today and you look at Slide 12, we're running about current spot prices in the strip. It's about $24 a barrel that's really suppressed mainly by the light ends, particularly ethane. If you look at the ethane fundamentals going through the end of this year and into 2022, two things are going to happen. There's going to be more cracker capacity added on the Gulf Coast. There also be more dot capacity for exports added. So as you look through the next 18 months, we think there's much more upside and downside to the current ethane price and we think that will start to move the overall wide grade higher. Michael Scialla : Thank you. John Christmann : Thanks, Mike. Operator : And your next question comes from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Charles Meade : Good morning, John to you and your whole team there. John Christmann : Good morning, Charles. Charles Meade : If I could ask two questions on Alpine High. One just the quick one, real quick is to clarify. So when you have this cryo startup in July, you may still have some issues with the natural gas pricing. But your NGL pricing at that point you're connected at the tail pipe to get Gulf Coast pricing at that point for your engine. John Christmann : Yes. It will start moving to Mont Belvieu through our enterprise agreement. So we'll start see an immediate uplift. Charles Meade : Got it. And then the second question, this gets more on the well spacing and those kind of intriguing results you guys put out with the Mont Blanc and the Blackfoot pad. I recognized this early, but does this suggest that there's going to be any changes to the type curve \u2013 individual well type curve in the number of locations that you guys have in the Woodford or is this perhaps instead just something that's going to be localized to these areas? John Christmann : No, I mean, I think it shows the process, and the methodical process we've taken to kind of break the rock down and get to what we think is the optimal development scenarios. In both cases, we drilled some Woodford C because we needed to see as thick is the column is as much rock as we have to deal with, we needed to see how the A's, B's and C's performed together. We clearly went a little wider spacing, a little larger fracs at the Mont Blanc, you're seeing some pretty impressive results. So some of that's also about changing. So as we've said, in the future you're probably going to see us drop the A's a little deeper, drop the B\u2019s a little deeper or eliminate the C\u2019s and a little wider spacing and then we'll continue to learn on the fracs. But I think, the big thing is the last location count we put out was fall of 2017, I think, October, 2017, and we're still in a position where location count would go up given the assumptions we've got in place. And that's why we've been very careful to do our testing and understand it. We never assume more than two in the Woodford or the Barnett. And we're very confident in those numbers. And you're seeing some strong performance. Charles Meade : That's helpful context. Thank you, John. John Christmann : You bet, Charles. Operator : And your next question is from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer : Thank you. Good morning. John Christmann : Good morning, Brian. Brian Singer : I wanted to touch based on a couple of items, the first on exploration outside of Suriname. Can you just give us an update on how that's progressing and any expectations for making any of the ideas you're pursuing open to the public market? And then also a follow-up on the comments you made on assets sales to what degree are you pursuing and how meaningful could further assets sale will be? John Christmann : Well, I mean, I think from the get-go, we've always said we were going to differentiate ourselves through exploration. And we do have a Lower 48 program, it\u2019s focused DUS, it's focused more oil, it's focused more on conventionally, and our strategy has always been to try to build positions of scale and size where there was an opportunity \u2013 and low cost, where there was an opportunity to try to do in order to create meaningful value for our shareholders. So we have a program there. With the appropriate time, we'll talk more about that. As far as your second question on the asset sales, clearly we have over $300 million now that's under contract. As we said, the bulk of that is our SCOOP/STACK position. And I think the point there, Brian, as we look at our portfolio and we look at the things that we will be funding to the extent there's things that we will not fund in the future and if there's an opportunity for somebody else to own those and create value by purchasing those then we're not afraid to do that. And that's where we find ourselves today with the success we've had through our organic expiration program. We continue to take a long-term view through our portfolio model at our areas and what's going to attract capital. And we did not see the SCOOP/STACK is an area where we would be putting capital and therefore, we have it under contract. Brian Singer : Great. Thanks. And if I could ask one more. On Slide 8, you highlight a trajectory in the Permian relative of the timing of completions and as you show in both 2018 and 2019, you've had a couple of quarters of frac holidays? Is that's kind of the way you're planning going forward to achieve desired growth there to basically try to batch completions into two quarters of the year or is that just the way it's ended up? John Christmann : No. It's just really coincidental with the way - the programs is lined up. When you go to larger pads, it becomes a little more lumpy. I think the key here for us is early in 2018, we had to put a crew on a frac holiday because we'd had the drilling efficiencies and picked up and in terms of the \u2013 on the - well I'll say the completion efficiencies and picked up and they're drilling rates hadn't caught up yet. And so we had to set up frac crew down and what\u2019s you saw as the timing of that. The one going into this year was really his prices dropped in November. We anticipated that we needed to drop a couple of rigs. We put a frac crew on holiday, that's really so we could deliver the capital budget that we have set for this year. So I think those were actions we've taken to level low the activity set to where we need to be for this price environment. And so we dropped a couple of rigs and put a crew on holiday. The trade-off there is as your second quarter production. We'll dip a little bit. But we think in the grand scheme of things, I would rather have more of a level loaded program throughout the year, which is how we positioned ourselves. Stephen Riney : Just adding to that a little bit, Brian. John commented on the lumpiness of the activity said. That just becomes a lot more visible when your capital program is reduced to the size of what we're \u2013 where we are today. The lumpiness of an efficient drilling and completion had level activity set just becomes a bit more visible. That's all. Brian Singer : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Scott Hanold : Thanks. My first question, hopefully pretty quick on the NGLs. Once a cryos are on, could you remind us what the product breakdown of that NGL basket is going to be for you guys? Stephen Riney : Yes. I don't think the NGL yield in Alpine High is going to be any different than the NGL yield anywhere else. We have an operated these types of cryo units before. So that would probably be a good question for a second or third quarter results when we've actually operated a couple of them for a bit. Scott Hanold : Okay. I understand. Thank you. And that sort of the \u2013 so just certain average barrels which you're basing that $24 a barrel assumption right now that you put out there? Stephen Riney : Well, we just stuck an assumption out there on the pricing at $24. We just said 40% of WTI, that's about where it's trading today. That's a reasonable assumption. We think that's conservative for the long-term for multiple reasons that Dave Pursell laid out earlier. And just on a mixed NGL barrel basis, 40% of WTI is probably especially if you look back in time it moves around a lot obviously, but 40% is probably a conservative assumption. Scott Hanold : Okay, fair enough. And my follow-up question is regarding the free cash flow, you all talked about ones these cryos start coming on online or at least the cash flow generation and also the asset sale proceeds and utilizing that. When you step back and look at him in a Apache stock is compared to say the last call it five years, it's at a pretty low point? Does it make sense to like, as you look to return cash to shareholders to be a little bit more focused on share buybacks right now or in how does that's potential Suriname well sort of play into that decision? Stephen Riney : Well, I don't think that Suriname well plays into that decision for 2019. Let's get the transactions close, which will happen in the second quarter. We'll proceed slowly, but we said we would return the excess free cash at least 50% of that shareholders before we changed our activity level. I think we said it a couple times in the prepared remarks. We'll say it again. There's no change in activity level for 2019. We're still on the 2.4 billion capital program. And I just remind everybody that the startup of the cryo facilities and the cash flows from those were in the plan for this year. So those aren't necessarily delivering excess free cash flow. They're delivering the plan free cash flow to the extent they start early, to the extent that NGL prices improve. To the extent that they give us a greater yield than we may have planned. And those types of things deliver excess free cash flow, but not just the startup from them. And we will look at I think as we get to the second half of the year, which is a going to be upon as pretty quickly, that's when we'll get into the discussions about how do we use that excess cash flow. And I could assure you that both the debt reduction and a share buybacks will be on that agenda. And in that conversation you were likely to do some of both there's some debt maturing 150 million of debt maturing in July. If we choose to paydown any debt, then that would probably be where we would start. Scott Hanold : Understood. Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from John Aschenbeck from Seaport Global. John Aschenbeck : Good morning everyone and thank you for taking my questions. John Christmann : You bet, John. John Aschenbeck : Thanks John. So there's been a lot of commentary around 2019 spending. So I apologize if I missed this. But just thinking about the remainder of the year, if I run and admittedly over simplified exercise and take your Q1 spend and your Q2 guidance, it would just indicate that spendings coming down in future quarters. So is that an accurate assessment? And then secondly, it just \u2013 how should we think about the cadence of spending and the second half of the year? Thanks. John Christmann : Well, I mean, I think the first thing is we're down 27% over fourth quarter and we actually came in right at 25% of what we guided for the year. So first quarter was pretty evenly run for how the year would pan out. We walked through in the prepared remarks, some things that could cause second quarter would be a little higher, which is kind of why we guided there, but there are more exploration driven. So I think from our perspective, we took the bigger decision in November and December to drop some rigs and put a crew on holiday to kind of do that now. And it puts us in a nice position for the back half of the year. So we're very confident in the capital number. We will come in under \u2013 or at the $2.4 billion for this activity set and feel really good about it. John Aschenbeck : Okay, great. That's helpful John. So just to make sure I clarify there Q2 has some one time spending a lot of it exploration activity that you just wouldn't expect to repeat and future quarters. Is that fair? John Christmann : I would just say that in terms of the timing of how we \u2013 what we have budgeted for a Suriname and the exploration, a big chunk of that is in Q2 and the other thing you need to look at is if you look at our first quarter numbers, we do have some assets sales. We've had a couple of rigs running up there too. So our run rate for Q1 would have even been a little lower on what are going our existing asset base remaining will be. John Aschenbeck : Okay, great. I'll go ahead and leave it there. Thanks for the time. Operator : And your next question comes from Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities. Richard Tullis : Thanks. Good morning, John. Two quick questions. John Christmann : Good morning. Richard Tullis : Going back to the M&A, I know you touched on this a bit little earlier, but as you look at the North Sea, I know the market there seems a little more active. How do you view those assets in your portfolio today? Given the healthy margins there, but balancing that with maybe a more healthy M&A market in the North Sea? John Christmann : Well, I mean I think the big difference with us is, as opposed to what's being divested by some of the other parties is we invested in the infrastructure. If you look at our efficiency and our up times and our run rates and our LOE, we're very competitive. I mean we typically lead in production efficiencies and low cost and it's because, we were fortunate that after we bought these properties in the 2003 with BP for 40s and then 2011 with Beryls. We invested heavily in rebuilding the infrastructure, which really puts us in a nice position. So you look at those two assets. They're fantastic assets. They're different. 40s, we've just got a massive 5 billion barrel in place. Field is produced over 2.5 and it just continues to give. And so it's real easy to manage that for the long-term with the water flood work we're doing, and we love the Brent pricing. We love the margins and it's not like we have a lot of stuff looming that would require you to want to move out of it. If you look at Beryl, it's a totally different asset, very prolific in its own right as you've seen. The way we've been able to leverage the infrastructure with the subsea tie backs by bringing on Callater and bringing on Beryl or Gartner. And now you into the Beryl facility and now you look at the Storr well, we just announced, I mean, we found a whole another section there in the cormorant that we were not expecting. So there's a lot to do up in the Beryl area and we've got nice infrastructure. It's been invested in. It's in great shape and it gives us a differential advantage. So we love the cash flow. We love the Brent pricing exposure. Your gas receives a higher price. So it's an asset that we quite frankly, I liked the cash flow profile from. Richard Tullis : Good insight John. Appreciate that. And just lastly, what's the current outlook for Alpine High natural gas to be sold into the Mexican market, say, over the next year or two? John Christmann : Well, I mean, I think the first thing is, if you look at how we're positioned physically for gas to flow, we couldn't be better. But I think we recognized from the get-go that, you don't want to be trying to develop a resource play and waiting on Mexico or dependent on Mexico for your gas deliveries. And so that's why we work the options to the Gulf Coast and what you'll find is Mexico will be an option for on down the road, which I think can become a premium. But today it's not something we're counting on. I mean, that's why we work the Gulf Coast options. We will be mainly insulated from Waha here pretty quick, which is going to put us in a differential advantage on our gas. And, and really it's the NGLs that really make this thing fly. The NGLs cost structure and the lack of water or the things that really differentiate the rich gas played at Alpine High. Richard Tullis : Very good. Thanks John. Appreciated. Stephen Riney : Yes. Richard, if I could just add to that. I don't know the exact numbers, but today Mexico takes about 4 Bcf a day from the U.S. via pipeline. And 3 to 3.5 of that comes along the Gulf Coast. And so while we've got these great pipelines running by Alpine High, those are for the future more than the current. And so I think your question was related to the near-term. The near-term is we get gas to the Gulf Coast with the startup of GCX this year and Permian Highway next year. You can easily access the Mexican market and you might imagine that we probably have been considering that are working on that. Richard Tullis : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Jeoffrey Lambujon of Tudor, Pickering. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Good morning. Thanks. First question is just on gas coverage with Gulf Coast Express. Once that system comes online and thinking about your capacity there, can you speak to how long you are able to receive Gulf Coast pricing for 100% of your Alpine High volumes? Stephen Riney : Sorry, Jeff, can you just repeat that question? Jeoffrey Lambujon : Yes. So once GCX comes online, just trying to get a sense for how long you expect to receive Gulf Coast pricing for your Alpine High production? Stephen Riney : How long before we receive it or how long will we receive it? Jeoffrey Lambujon : How long will you receive coverage for 100% of your production? Stephen Riney : Well, with Gulf Coast Express, we will pretty much be selling all of the residue gas at Gulf Coast pricing with the startup of GCX and then Permian Highway comes a year later. So Gulf Coast Express, we have 550 million a day of capacity, and then with Permian Highway, we have another 500 million. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Got it. And then just a follow-up on the liquids front. Appreciate the color on ethane, Dave, and sorry if I missed any follow-on comments on the LPG outlook, but could you just speak to what you're seeing there over the near-term? David Pursell : Yes. So Jeoffrey, you're talking about \u2013 define near-term for me? Jeoffrey Lambujon : Next 12 to 18 months. David Pursell : Yes. Again, if you think about the NGL barrel, the bottom end of the barrel is going to trade with crude and gasoline and gasoline has been much improved over the last three or four months. So we're really thinking about butane and pentane, that's a call on crude and gasoline. So I'll leave that to you. Propane and ethane, we're going to see improvements in the fourth quarter in dock capacity through this and really through the summer and we think that'll help relieve some of the congestion with better exports. And then on ethane, in addition to better export capacity, we're seeing later this year and into 2020 more cracker capacity coming on line, and significant percentages of total \u2013 of current capacity. So at least in the next 18 months, I can envision a much more robust NGL pricing environment, particularly given improvements in ethane and propane. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Arun Jayaram : Hi, good morning. Just a couple of quick questions. One, have you guys quantified the production impact from the planned SCOOP/STACK asset? So I was just wondering to know and does that already included in the guidance? John Christmann : Arun, it\u2019s not included, once it closes \u2013 but if we look at the first quarter numbers, it would've been about 10,000 BOEs a day, and about 13% oil, it's mainly gas. Arun Jayaram : Mainly gas. Okay, that's helpful. And just a question\u2026 John Christmann : And more importantly, Arun, our lease up income was about 14, we spent half of that just in CapEx. So I mean it's a\u2026 Arun Jayaram : It's not a big free cash flow again. John Christmann : It\u2019s not a big impact on the EBITDA. Arun Jayaram : Fair enough. And just a question for the participation on the equity on the pipes, do you guys have an estimate of what the cost would be to Altus to participate in the pipes? Just the CapEx. John Christmann : I think at 1 o'clock when the Altus is called is on Arun, you got to pop on and you can get Mr. Bretches at that time and you\u2019ll feel that one, so. Arun Jayaram : Okay. All right. Fair enough. Thanks a lot, John. John Christmann : Appreciate it. Operator : And we have passed the top of the hour. I'll now turn the call back to John Christmann for closing remarks. John Christmann : Well, thank you for joining us. So just want to end on a couple of points. We're executing extremely well, delivering on both capital and production and are reiterating our $2.4 billion capital budget for the year. Alpine High will hit at an inflection point in the very near future as the three Altus cryos come on line and we'll generate a substantial cash flow uplift. And lastly, we're looking forward to the initiation of our exploration program at Suriname very soon. Operator : And thank you all for joining today's Apache Corporation first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin, sir. Gary Clark : Good morning and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's second quarter financial and operational results conference call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John Christmann. Tim Sullivan, Executive Vice President of Operations Support, will then provide additional operational color; and Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO will summarize our second quarter financial performance. Also available on the call to answer questions are Apache Executive Vice Presidents, Mark Meyer, Energy Technology, Data Analytics and Commercial Intelligence; and Dave Pursell, Planning, Reserves and Fundamentals. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 20 minutes in length, with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you've had the opportunity to review our second quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations Web site at investor.apachecorp.com. On today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our Web site. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt's tax barrels. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our Web site. And with that, I will turn the call over to John. John Christmann : Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will provide an overview of Apache's second quarter results, comment on our production outlook and capital investment program for the remainder of the year, outline our current position and initiatives in the Permian Basin, Egypt, North Sea, and offshore Suriname, and conclude with some thoughts on capital allocation in the context of the current macro environment. The second quarter Apache's total adjusted production exceeded guidance with upstream capital spending of just under $600 million. Through mid year, we have invested less than 50% of our four-year budget of $2.4 billion. We are focused on strict capital discipline which is achievable given our level loaded activity set and relatively stable operational pace over the last couple of years. Permian Basin oil volumes drove our guidance in the second quarter for a few reasons. Tim will provide more details. But in aggregate we brought online 15 fewer wells than anticipated and incurred a significant delay in initial production from several other wells. Most of these items are just timing related from which we will fully recover by yearend. Internationally and at Alpine High, volumes in the second quarter were in line with our adjusted production guidance. Construction and commissioning of Altus Midstream's first two cryogenic processing plants were on budget and ahead of schedule. The first cryo plant has already exceeded nameplate capacity. The second plant is fully in service and ramping inlet volumes. And the third plant is scheduled for startup around year end. For the remainder of 2019, capital will be at or below our second-half budget of $1.2 billion. With activity more heavily weighted toward completions, this should result in good production momentum as we exit 2019. We have revised our second-half Permian Basin production guidance to reflect the delays we experienced in the Midland and Delaware as well as projected third quarter gas deferrals at Alpine High. Our fourth quarter Alpine High production target of 100,000 BOE per day is unchanged from prior guidance. This is based on a plan to return all deferred production to sales by the beginning of October with the GCX pipeline startup. It also assumes that Altus Midstream's cryo units are operating in full ethane recovery mode. We will prioritize value over production volumes and depending on the prevailing gas and NGL prices may to choose to reject ethane at Alpine High, which would impact our reported fourth quarter volumes. Internationally, we continue to expect third and fourth quarter volumes to be in line with prior guidance. With that, I would like to offer some specific comments on our key operating areas of the Permian Basin, Egypt, and North Sea as well as offshore Suriname. In the Permian Basin, Apache has one of the industry's largest acreage footprints and a diverse inventory of opportunities. For more than two years now, we have been running a six to ten rig program focused on oil development in the Midland and Delaware basin, and a five to nine rig program focused on Alpine High. In the Midland and Delaware basins, we are in full development mode delivering highly productive top tier oil wells at very competitive cost. We have a large inventory at oil prone locations that continues to expand with ongoing improvements and understanding of the resource base. This position will support a higher base right count should we choose to add or reallocate capital from other areas. At Alpine High, we have a very large resource base, much of which has been advanced to development ready inventory. With that accomplished, Alpine High must now compete for capital with the rest of our Permian assets. In the short term, Alpine High economics were adversely impacted by very depressed gas pricing at Waha. In response, we are continuing to defer the majority of our lane [ph] gas and a portion of our rich gas production until the GCX pipeline enter service in late September. From a cash flow and returns perspective, it is far more viable to wait a few weeks and produce into an improved price environment. At current gas and NGL prices, some portions of Alpine High are less competitive than other opportunities in our portfolio. If this pricing situation does not improve, some capital will be re-allocated to areas with more leverage to oil price most likely elsewhere in the Permian Basin. Turning to Egypt, Apache is the largest acreage holder in the Western Desert and is the country's leading oil producer giving a strong leverage to Brent pricing with a substantial increase in our acreage position over the past two years and a 3 million acre broadband seismic acquisition program nearly two-thirds complete. We anticipate a significant refreshed inventory of oil focused opportunities. This should help increase capital efficiency and returns as we continue to generate a high level of free cash flow. Egypt provides tremendous long-term sustainable oil production potential. In the U.K., North Sea Apache has some of the industry's best assets and one of the lowest cost operations, production recently reached a two-year high driven by continued exploration success in the barrel area and a shallower oil decline rate in the Mature Forties Field resulting from a sharpened focus on water flow and activities. Annual capital investment has been less than $300 million and with strong leverage to Brent oil prices, the North Sea is consistently generating substantial free cash flow. In the fourth quarter, we will bring online another exploration discovery at store in the barrel area in a second development well at Garten. We have plenty of exploration running room in the North Sea with the ability to tie discoveries back relatively quickly and inexpensively to leverage existing infrastructure. In Suriname, we currently anticipate receiving the Nobel Sam Croft drillship during the second half of August and spudding our first exploration well on Block 58 in September. We have secured this rig for a one well commitment with an option on three additional wells. We believe that Block 58 offers tremendous potential and multiple wells across the block will likely be warranted for proper evaluation irrespective of the initial wells outcome. While we intend to drill the first well at 100% working interest, we have continued interest from potential partners. To summarize, our current portfolio Apache has an extensive inventory of high quality assets ranging from significant identified resource ready for short cycle development to large scale highly prospective exploration. This includes at scale in both conventional and unconventional resource covering the full spectrum of hydrocarbon potential from oil to liquids rich gas tilling gas. When we began 2019, the commodity price environment was volatile but planning based on a $50 to $55 WTI and a 250 to 280 Henry Hub for the long-term felt prudent, if not slightly conservative. Oil prices so far are delivering on that expectation. But gas prices are significantly weaker. Additionally, NGL prices took a material downturn in the second quarter and are now trading near historic lows around 35% of WTI. In this volatile commodity environment, a high quality diverse portfolio with the flexibility to redirect capital is a significant advantage. As we progressed our longer term planning process, we are closely monitoring macro commodity fundamentals and evaluating many capital allocation scenarios for 2020 and beyond under a number of different pricing decks. We look forward to sharing our preliminary thoughts on this in the coming months. In closing, our strategy for creating shareholder value is straightforward. Flex our capital allocation and leverage our portfolio commensurate with the prevailing commodity price environment live within cash flow at reasonable oil prices and generate free cash flow to return to investors, fund the capital program capable of delivering a sustainable combination of long-term returns with a moderate pace of growth, execute on our differential high impact conventional and unconventional exploration opportunity set. I'm confident Apache can deliver on this strategy given our diversified and well-balanced portfolio, high quality drilling inventory, relatively low Permian oil base decline rate, attractive exploration portfolio and continuous focus on improving capital productivity and efficiency. With that, I will turn the call over to Tim Sullivan who will provide some operational details on the quarter. Tim Sullivan : Good morning. From an operational perspective, Apache's highlights for the second quarter 2019 include larger pads with longer laterals in the Southern Midland Basin, strong Barnett results at our Mont Blanc pad and Alpine High an oil discovery on one of our new concessions in Egypt and steady development work in the North Sea at store and garden. Please refer to our second quarter financial and operational supplement for drilling pad and well highlights across our portfolio. Company-wide adjusted production was down from the first quarter 2019 reflecting the sale of mid-Continent assets during the period and deferred production at Alpine High. Year-over-year production was roughly flat. In the second quarter, we drilled and completed 67 gross wells, 54 in the Permian Basin, 11 in Egypt and 2 in the North Sea. In the U.S. second quarter 2019 production totaled 264, 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. As John mentioned, Permian Basin oil production was impacted by some one-off events or pads and wells are commencing production later than planned. We are trialing a new electric-powered frac fleet however, commissioning of the fleet took longer than expected and it arrived on our first location 30 days late impacting not only the initial pad but follow on pads as well. We have since fracked 11 wells on four different pads with this fleet operational efficiencies are improving and on a single well basis, we realized more than $250, 000 in diesel savings alone while reducing emissions an estimated 90%. Also in the Midland Basin an early sidetrack during drilling operations coupled with flow-back limitations on the pad delayed peak production nearly a month from the Black Dog pad, which includes 9 wells drilled with 2 mile laterals. This pad is now producing as expected. In the Delaware Basin, we drilled 5 wells at Dixie Land and have deferred the completions, while we remediate mechanical issues at two of the wells. We are working our completion schedule and expect to place these wells online later this year, but the precise timing is uncertain. The impact of these production delays has affected second quarter results and will linger into the third and fourth quarters. We expect to be caught up with all this year's plan completions by year-end and we anticipate fourth quarter oil production to come in between 100,000 and 105, 000 barrels per day compared to our prior guidance of 105,000 barrels per day. We are also benefiting from the start up of Altus Midstream, new cryogenic processing plants at Alpine High. Drilling and completion costs at Alpine High continue to improve on a cost per foot basis as we execute more development activity. Pad development continues to drive down costs into our projected range, drilling completing and equipping costs on one mile laterals are approaching $5.5 million per well. International adjusted production of 132,000 BOE per day came in as expected. In Egypt, we drilled our first lower Bahariya discovery and our new East Bahariya concession the well flowed at an initial test rate of 3900 barrels of oil per day. This success of a number of additional low cost short cycle drilling locations, we are also building inventory with our 3D seismic survey across 3 million acres in the Western Desert, where we have completed over 65% of the shoot. Turning to the North Sea third quarter production will be impacted by annual turnaround maintenance with production rebounding in the fourth quarter. The subsea tieback development at store remains on schedule for first production in the fourth quarter. We also expect to have a second producer at Garden drilled and completed by year-end. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve. Stephen Riney : Thank you, Tim. On today's call, I will briefly review second quarter financial results and a few updates to 2019 guidance. Discuss the impact of our recent asset sales, and our continuing debt management initiatives and update the status of our promise for returning capital to investors. As noted in the press release issued last night, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Apache reported a second quarter 2019 consolidated net loss of $360 million or $0.96 per diluted common share. These results include a number of items that are outside of core earnings, which are typically excluded by the investment community and they're published earnings estimates. On an after-tax basis, the most significant items include $220 million for asset impairments, most of which were associated with our recent asset sales, $114 million of evaluation allowance on deferred tax assets, and $59 million for a loss on extinguishment of debt. Excluding these and other smaller items, adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $41 million or $0.11 per share. Upstream capital investment was less than $600 million for the second consecutive quarter, demonstrating our commitment to running a level-loaded disciplined capital program and meeting our full-year upstream budget of $2.4 billion. Capital spending in the third quarter will be biased slightly higher than the fourth quarter due primarily to P&A work in the Gulf of Mexico, and development spending on store in the North Sea. LOE per BOE for the quarter was above expectations, primarily due to higher salaries in Egypt driven by in-country inflation and increased diesel consumption in both Egypt and the North Sea. Looking ahead, we have increased our full-year LOE per BOE outlook to capture the impact of these higher cost trends and ongoing gas deferrals at Alpine High. Offsetting LOE costs, gathering, processing, and transportation costs were below guidance in the quarter. And our guidance for the full-year has been revised downward. This is primarily driven by the sale of assets. In May and in July, Apache completed the sale of midcontinent assets in two separate transactions, resulting in $560 million of net cash proceeds after typical closing adjustments. A portion of these proceeds was used to retire $150 million of bonds that matured in early July. During the second quarter, we refinanced $546 million of debt maturing over the next five years to enhance near-term liquidity. We also refinanced $386 million of higher coupon debt of various maturities to lower our cost of borrowing. Combined with the debt paydown the net result of these actions is that we reduced overall leverage and extended our debt maturity profile, significantly reducing near-term debt maturities. In February, we announced our intention to return at least 50% of our incremental cash generation to investors before any increases to planned capital activity. In keeping with this commitment, we began returning incremental cash to investors with the debt paydown in July. In the meantime, our 2019 planned capital activity has not changed, and we have no plans to do so. While oil price and sale proceeds helped create capacity for further capital return to investors, the combination of historically weak gas prices in the Permian, a result in production deferrals, and now extremely weak NGL prices have more than offset the oil price benefit. We will monitor anticipated 2019 cash flows and will continue to prioritize returns to investors over increasing capital spend. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Michael Scialla with Stifel. Michael Scialla : Hey, good morning, guys. John, you mentioned\u2026 John Christmann : Good morning, Mike. Michael Scialla : You mentioned Alpine High is going to have to compete with the rest of the portfolio with lower than expected NGL and gas prices. Just wondering what your preliminary thoughts are for next year in terms of the midstream, do you go ahead with any additional cryo plants there or how you're thinking about 2020 at this point for Alpine High? John Christmann : Well, I mean if you look at where we were when we reported this year's plan we had an oil price of $53, and gas was at $2.80, and propane and ethane were at high levels, $0.75 and $0.30. So the gas and the ethane and propane have come down significantly. I think with where we sit today, Mike, and Altus will have their call at 1 :00 o'clock. But with where we are today with cryo, two coming on now and three coming on in the fourth quarter, we're in pretty darn good shape on that front. So I think they'll be in a good position to have the infrastructure in place we would need for the capital we look at. Michael Scialla : And then I wanted to see if you had any updated thoughts on the offset well at Haimara discovery and Suriname, and any thoughts there on any additional color you can\u2026 John Christmann : Well, yes, as far as Suriname, I mean we're obviously anxious. Looks like we're going to get the rig here in a couple of weeks, kind of mid to late August, so it's coming, and we should spot our first well in September. Obviously, from the public data we've analyzed everything we can. We've got 2D data and have looked very closely at all the activity that's going on next door, and we've kind of rolled that in. We have the benefit of a very state-of-the-art 3D with very good resolution. So we've worked our block very, very hard and in detail, and been doing it for multiple years. So we're obviously anxious. If you look at the Block 58 it's a very large block, it's 1.44 million acres today. We have planned to start our program at 100%, and but there is continued interest in the blocks, I will say that. But when we look at it we have not given specifics on where the location will be. I will tell you we have a number of wells permitted. We have a pretty good idea where it's going, obviously with us about to get the rig, but there's seven play types, there's over 50 large prospects, and there's a pretty good chance that you'll see us lining up some of those targets with where we will choose to drill the early wells. I will tell you, it's going to take multiple wells in this block to fully evaluate it. Michael Scialla : Very good. Thanks, John. John Christmann : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James. John Freeman : Hi, guys. John Christmann : Hi, John. John Freeman : So sort of following up a little bit on Mike's question, when we look at sort of the really strong margins that you all are getting internationally, and I guess if gas prices and NGL prices sort of remain depressed, I guess just sort of how you're thinking about potentially increasing possibly the allocation of capital that goes international sort of on a go-forward basis now that you're basically saying that Alpine High will have to start competing more on a return basis going forward? John Christmann : Well, we have a very elaborate dynamic planning process, and it's turned into kind of a 365-day-a-year process. And we're in the throes of that now. And when we look at the portfolio I think the first thing I'll say is we have a very diverse portfolio with many investment options, and none of those have been funding it full capacity over the last couple of years. So we've got a lot of opportunity. Secondly, I would say is that we have a very deep understanding of our asset base, which gives us the ability to make sure we're making those right calls on where we're going to put that capital. And the big thing is we're going to allocate capital to drive long-term value. So when you look at where we sit today there are numerous places where we have been under investing where we have leveraged oil. Obviously our Midland and Delaware oil positions are two places. We've had a great track record of results there. Those are areas we could go to. When you look at Egypt, we're in the middle of working through the big 3D shoot, and so we're kind of anxious to see what comes out of that shoot, but I can tell you the early returns look very promising. So there are places we can do that as well. There are other oil zones up at Alpine High. And we've got some other places in the portfolio as well. So we have an abundance of deep places where we can put capital, and we'll work through that under normal course and come back later in the year on our plans as we see going forward. John Freeman : That's great. And then just my follow-up question, you've done a great job on the CapEx front, and obviously are tracking below what would have been expected so far this year. And I guess when you sort of talk about anticipate spending at or below the $2.4 billion budget, I just want to make sure I'm sort of on the same page as the way you're thinking about it. So is it that you're sort of being conservative and you want to wait to see another quarter play out to make sure things still track the way they have so far this year, or is it possible that some of the savings that you're generating you're considering maybe reallocating, reinvesting back somewhere across the portfolio? John Christmann : Well, there's a lot of factors that come into play. I'll say number one, we took a frac holiday Q1. Secondly, when we brought in our clean fleet, it was a lot -- 30 days late on the commissioning. So we actually are kind of back in loaded in the Permian and we are going to bring on, I think, 60% of our wells in the back half of the year in the Permian. So that's a little bit of a John. Secondly, we've got the Suriname oil out there that is moved. We've always thought most would be third quarter and fourth quarter span, but it's shifted a little bit, so some of it's timing. There are areas where we're seeing it Alpine High, our well costs come down. And so, we're seeing some areas that are helping us a little bit, but there's just a lot of factors that kind of leave us in that position. I think the point to underscore though, is you will not see us increase the activity set. And we feel very confident that we can deliver that activity set for the $2.4 billion or potentially less. John Freeman : Thanks, John, I appreciate the answers. John Christmann : You bet. Operator : So our next question is on the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles Meade : Good morning, John to you and your team. John Christmann : Good morning Charles. Charles Meade : Hey, I want to just pick up where you just left off there. Just a quick question, in Suriname, in answering the last question, you said the Suriname well, at least I think I heard you say that. But either guys are getting this rig in next couple of weeks for the September, you're going to have time on the calendar to drill at least one more well, so. So how many wells are in your plan or in that -- in the capital budget as it exists right now? John Christmann : Well, in the 2.4, we had budgeted one well a 100%. So we have a one well commitment with the rig, we have an option for three additional wells. And, realistically, we've got one in the budget. And, that's where I'll leave that. Charles Meade : Okay, got it. Thank you. And then John, going up back to Alpine High, wondering if you could talk us through the process of two things, what is the -- what's the sequence? And what's it going to look like for you guys? And what are you going to be focused on as that Gulf Coast Express comes on beginning of October, maybe mid of September? And how is that going to interact with your decision to recover or reject ethane? John Christmann : Well, I mean, obviously, we have to watch the dynamics. I mean, we think GCX coming online is a big event for the basin, it's a big event for us and a big event for Alpine High, is we have a quarter of the volume on the 2 Bcf over from like 550 of the 2 Bcf a day is going to move. So, for us, first thing is we want to see what happens to differentials. We want to see the impact that that might have or the follow-through on the NGO prices. So we will be watching that very carefully. We want to make sure we're looking out and looking at longer-term views on things because you can't be shifting capital around need your short-term decisions, but -- so we're going to take a very methodical and deliberate approach. But we'll be cognizant of how those things, kind of play out over the longer-term and what it looks like they're going to do will dictate, how we run some of our capital programs. And we've got the flexibility with the inventory to plan for some multiple scenarios. And so, we'll be ready to go with multiple scenarios. And we'll kind of watch and see how that all unfolds. I think it's going to be good for the Basin. Dave, is there anything you want to add? Dave Pursell : No. John, the one thing I'd add is on the ethane rejection side. The crowds are up and running. They've operationally flexed them for full rejection and full extract, ethane extraction mode. And so, we'll have the operational flexibility to react at the field to Waha pricing and Waha gas and Gulf Coast NGO prices. So, John is right, we're going to make long-term capital decisions based on long-term views but we will be able to react on a relatively short basis on the -- with the cryo operations. Charles Meade : Thank you. That's helpful, Dave and John. Thank you. John Christmann : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is on the line of Gail Nicholson with Stephens. Gail Nicholson : Good morning, everybody. Question on the North Sea with the final agreement in barrel, can you talk about the potential opportunity set that there and what you guys are looking for with that first well in the fourth quarter? John Christmann : Well, I mean. Again, we're excited about the North Sea. We've done a really good job over the last few years of being able to generate strong free cash flow from our operations, or you've seen the track record, with calendar and then Garten in terms of tie backs to the infrastructure. You know, what we've been able to do is leverage some of the little further out acreage; we've got a nice tertiary play there. And, you know, we had 100% of that acreage. And so, we are not able to bring a partner in, and we'll get a couple wells carried that I think are, are upside kind of to our picture, but we're very excited about there's been some tertiary discoveries, and we've got some very nice looking prospects that will be able to get drilled as you move into later this year, and then the next year. Gail Nicholson : Great. And then, one for Steve a housekeeping question. How much PNA CapEx is in 3Q for Gham [Ph]? Stephen Riney : Yes, there's Gail. I don't remember the exact number, but it's in. I think it's in the $50 million to $100 million range. It's probably a little bit less than that $50, around $50 million, Gail. Gail Nicholson : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Robert Brackett : Hey, good morning. I had a question on the line field process at Gulf Coast Express. I understand we're undergoing line field now. Is that a benefit to you guys in terms of either volume or price? John Christmann : Bob? I would just say yes. Robert Brackett : Okay. Second question, then the September spot in Suriname or that -- is that a 40 day well? John Christmann : Well, it could be as short probably as 30. Or, we kind of looked at 30 to 60. But we'll see. Robert Brackett : Okay, so 30 to 60 days. And would you plan to announce results immediately on TV, or is that something you'd wait for a conference call to announce? John Christmann : We just have to see. So I mean, it's -- there's -- there will be multiple targets? And I'll just leave it -- it will kind of play that by year. Robert Brackett : And by multiple targets, does that mean, you think you could hit perhaps Miocene and Cretaceous reservoirs with a single well born or maybe a sidetrack? John Christmann : I won't get into as much detail but I think we will be able to stack several of our objective plays. Robert Brackett : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Douglas Leggate : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, John. John Christmann : Good morning, Doug. Douglas Leggate : John. I wonder if I can just take a twofer. If you don't mind, first of all on Alpine High in Midland, can you -- philosophically, it sounds like you're kind of rationalizing a pivot towards the more oil part of the basin. If that's the case, can you touch on the inventory that you have in the middle inside? And also the trajectory then for Alpine High would the objective then be to basically fill the cryo funds and hold it flat after that or what are you thinking about it? John Christmann : Well, I mean, I think what you're -- what we're going to do is basically allocate capital based on how we see the commodity price dictate. And then, we've got the luxury to do that, we're at a point today at Alpine High, where we now have that luxury, we hold a lot of the acreage, it won't take a lot of drilling to hold the acreage that we view is very perspective for really rich gas NGO and gas production. And so, we're at a point today where we can let the economics and leverage our portfolio. So there's a couple different scenarios. I think the cryo is recognizing that we own 79% of Altus. And factoring that in is something we will factor into our calculus of how we look at the value proposition there with those -- with prices. As far as the depth of inventory in the Midland Basin, we feel very good about that, we've been predominantly focused, and we've run more rigs than we run at a day in three areas in the Midland Basin Powell, Wildfire and Azalea. And in there we've drilled somewhere between 20% and 30% of the locations that we see there. We are now adding more landing zones. But you got to understand that that's really only about 20% of our acreage footprint. And you look at the other areas, we've gone out and drill some test wells, Benedum and Hartgrove fantastic results. So we've got a really deep inventory in the Midland Basin. We've been focused on getting to pad development. We went through a period, where we did a lot of testing and slowed down and make sure we get spacing, right, understood gas-oil ratios, where we could move forward and you're seeing the results of those programs. And so, we have a lot of inventory there that is sitting - ready to drill and we just kind of weigh that with the integrated economics in the price deck of how we look at the options in our portfolio. Douglas Leggate : I appreciate the full answer. My follow-up is on, obviously is on [indiscernible] I just wonder if it sort of run something past get your sense of the - so it seems to me that when we think about the probability of geological success of the Exxon Haimara has basically de-risked some of the parameters that we contributed, particularly hydrocarbon system obviously, how do you guys think about the PG, the probability of geological success on the wells that you're going to drill and if that's the case, can you confirm or could you maybe speak to -- it seem to me that it wouldn't make a lot of sense at this point to drill in the immediate offset well behind Haimara. So, are you going to drill in offshore or is it's a completely independent prospect? And I'll leave it there, thanks. John Christmann : Well, I mean, first of all, it is exploration. So if I try to pin my guys down there. I'll tell you, you're no better than one in four and that's just because it's exploration. Now that being said, they've moved into a phase where they're better than exploration right next door to us and you have a discovery on the International Water boundaries. So clearly that does two things. It proves that there are hydrocarbons in the system. When we look at the views across by kind of stitching together the 2D and the 3D data, you'll find that the geologic setting is not changing much, but you know, it's exploration. So I'm not going to come out and tell you that it's any higher than that at this point. But we're obviously very anxious to get started. And we're very comfortable going forward at 100% with our interest. Douglas Leggate : John, just to be clear, any of the four wells potentially planned direct offsets to higher MRO? John Christmann : We have multiple wells permitted, Doug. And we'll - I'll just say, we'll play them as we go and as we learn. Douglas Leggate : Awesome, thanks for the answers. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Scott Hanold : Yes, thanks. I was curious, you know now that I guess the cryo plant I, it has been up and running for a bit and the number two is obviously getting some traction here. Do you have a sense that you know what -- if you were normalized kind of commodity prices like, where do you all think sort of the mix of that NGL basket would be in terms of products? Dave Pursell : Yes, this is Dave Pursell. Right now, these are the technology used in the cryos, we're removing almost 100% of the ethane. So as a result, if you compare it to an average NGL barrel, this will be a little more heavily weighted to ethane and propane. We're still lining amount - we would anticipate, as we move forward. We'll get a richer gas stream kind of the inlet of the cryos and so, ultimately the NGL barrel will look a little closer to what the traditional Midland barrel looks like with maybe a tad more ethane in it. Scott Hanold : Okay, so that's sort of the next batch command, you'll get a better sense of that. Okay and then just to stand\u2026 John Christmann : One other thing there too Scott, it's going to change based on the formation. We're into a lot of what we're flowing through there right now is, and as you get into the bottom edge, it's going to get a little heavier as well, but so there is, a lot of dynamics that will, dictate that going forward. Scott Hanold : Right, and that's all part of the capital allocation process for the future. All right, okay and so then if you look at what do - are some of those product prices, need to do to make Alpine High say compete to say your standard oily Midland. Well, I mean how much, how far off? Are we forward to being more competitive today? John Christmann : Well, I mean, where we started this year, when we were kind of thinking 53 oil and 280 gas and we have $0.75 on propane $0.30 on ethane. We like the mix where we have. So, we're obviously not there today with where the NGLs have come down and gas specifically. So, clearly that's going to be somewhere between where we were and where we are today. Scott Hanold : Okay, well that's a good benchmark to give us a sense of where it shifts. I appreciate that, thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer : Thank you. Good morning. John Christmann : Good morning, Brian. Brian Singer : Just one question on our end, which is with regards to Egypt, you talked about this new discovery on the Bahia area. Can you just add some greater color, on how we should think about the resource potential? How that competes in the portfolio and any impact that could have to either capital investment or growth in Egypt? John Christmann : Well, I mean if you step back and look. Egypt has got some of the highest returns in our portfolio. So it competes very, very well. We are shooting a large area in the nice thing about Egypt is, it's stack pays. But, they're conventional rock and so you can get a 3,000 or 4,000 barrel a day IP from a vertical well. It's going to cost you $2 million to $3 million. So it's tax out very, very nicely in the portfolio, and I think with the new seismic. If you look back over the last two years, we really kept Egypt flat with two discoveries at Peter and Bear Nice and just drilling offset wells there. So it doesn't take a lot to have a real impact on us and we're obviously anxious to get 3-D. The 3-D back, we think our capital productivity, can improve is the quality of the prospects goes up and we love the leveraged Egypt. Brian Singer : I mean, I know you manage to cash flow and not the production mix, but as the wet gas picks up in Alpine High is there,-- any interest in kind of offsetting that with greater investments in either Egypt or the North Sea both to improve cash flow and mix? John Christmann : I mean, we will look as we talked about, as I talked about answering some of their Rick questions. We'll look at the whole portfolio and we'll balance that and look at where you can move short term. It's easier to move into probably our Midland Delaware Basin. But we'll, clearly that will be factored into our capital. We love the Brent price, we love the Brent price exposure in the cash flow or on the international side. Brian Singer : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of David Deckelbaum with the Cowen. David Deckelbaum : Good morning, John and team. Thanks for taking my questions. John Christmann : Yes David Deckelbaum : I just wanted to follow-up on some of the discussion around your sensitivities next year and you commented on the NGL prices at Alpine High and gas prices. I guess with TCX coming online and they have to be a day that, you have on there? I guess how do you think about the asset, in terms of minimum activity that you'd be willing to pursue and may be considering the asset as a marketing asset near term to take advantage of that spread and I guess how wide would that spreads have to be for you to us this kind of treated as something where you would just benefit from the marketing margins for the time being? John Christmann : Well, I mean I think that the thing you look at number one Alpine High. We like the asset, it's a large resources, we've proven there is tremendous rich gas potential. We now have a lot of the infrastructure in place that we need. And quite frankly, we hold a lot of the acreage that is important to us. So from our perspective, we're in a position where, we can continue to high grade acreage and maintain that footprint and keep the optionality. I think as GTx comes on line, we've been waiting for that, I think it's a big event for the gas help here that's kind of why we've elected to curtail some pads, that we're bringing on and wait until it does come online because, there were such a short time away from seeing some increased cash flow. So it's an asset that, we will look to leverage and try to maximize but the important thing is, we have a portfolio. When we only have limited capital, we can put in. So we have to balance that, in regard with our other assets. David Deckelbaum : Got it. Thank you, guys. And you were successful in the mid-count asset sale, anything else in the hopper these days that you guys are looking at selling? John Christmann : Not anything that I would call major that we'd have out there, but we're always looking at the portfolio, always looking to trim if there's things we're not going to invest in, if there is areas that others would put, what we would view as good value on our premium value. We're not afraid to turn things loose. David Deckelbaum : Thanks for the color, guys. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Arun Jayaram : Yes, good morning. Perhaps for Steve, I was wondering Steve, how you think your gas and NGL realizations will trend call it relative to benchmarks post the startup of GTx in the Permian of corporate wide. Dave Pursell : This is David Pursell, Arun. Once GTx starts out, it would be our anticipation that Waha starts to trade in a more normal position relative to Gulf Coast less transportation. So I think our Permian and we think that will normalize some of the other hubs in the basin. So, you're likely going to see the Permian Basin realizations track in line with the Gulf Coast benchmarks less transportation. Steve, would you add anything to that. Stephen Riney : Yes, the only thing I would add, David, is that there are some, significant events in terms of increased source or new sources of demand both for gas and for NGLs and for export capacity of NGLs coming online later this year. That would certainly potentially have some impact on pricing both on the Gulf Coast in back to Waha and back to the Permian Basin as well. Arun Jayaram : Okay. And my follow-up is, you guys announced kind of an agreement which near on an LNG type pricing structure. I think, is in the beginning, I'm wondering if you could maybe shed some light on that and talk about maybe some of the longer term implications from that? Dave Pursell : Yes, we're probably not going to shed a whole lot of details on that, but basically its structure. So first of all, it's 140 million a day, 140 million cubic feet a day. So, it's not a significant amount of volume that, we're producing and gas that's priced based on that. But it was, it's consistent with what we've always been talking about around Alpine High in the Permian Basin more generally and that is we want, to get a diversified portfolio if you will marketing based sources of realized price for the gas coming out of the Permian Basin and particularly Alpine High. And that's 140 million a day that gives us some flexibility in accessing various LNG markets around the world and getting netback from realized prices at landing points. Arun Jayaram : Okay. Any details, just on the mechanism just trying to understand maybe the financial impact on that 140 million a day? Dave Pursell : The mechanism is it's a relatively simple one. We have flexibility as to where the product goes in terms of pricing and it's a net-back based on tolling arrangements and shipping costs. Arun Jayaram : Okay, fair enough thanks. Operator : Your final question is from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy. Michael Hall : Thanks, good morning or good afternoon. Yes, I was just curious what the base case assumption; our thought process is on extending the rig to drill to follow-up wells in Suriname at this point? Well, you guys go ahead and drill those three wells. Is that kind of the base thought, or is that dependent on whether or not you secure JV partner in the area. John Christmann : It's purely an option, Michael, and all we've said is we're committed to want to, we have the option to take the rig and drill 3 more and that the block is going to be going to need additional wells. Michael Hall : And if you were to extend it and take and go kind of heads up on that on your own, is that - how would that kind of fall in the pecking order in 2020 in terms of capital allocation given that it's - there is no clear - commodity linkage yet. John Christmann : I'll just say it would be exploration dollars with material upside and I'll leave it there. Michael Hall : All right, fair enough. Thanks guys. John Christmann : Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions. I will turn the call back over to John for closing remarks. John Christmann : So first, I want to end on a -- just a couple of points, approximately 60% of our planned 2019 Permian oil weighted wells will come online in the second-half of the year, giving us confidence in our year-end oil production exit rate. Second, our 2019 upstream capital spending is on track and will be at or below $2.4 billion. Next year's capital plan, assuming current strip around these levels will be $2.4 billion or more likely less. And lastly we are closely monitoring oil, NGL and natural gas fundamentals and we'll allocate capital within our portfolio in response to the longer-term price signals. Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes today's earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Nicole, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to hand the conference over to Mr. Gary Clark. Please go ahead, sir. Gary Clark : Good morning and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation\u2019s third quarter financial and operational results conference call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John Christmann. Due to a personnel matter, Tim Sullivan is unable to join us today, so Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President of Planning Reserves and Fundamentals will provide additional operational color. Following that Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO will summarize our third quarter financial performance. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 20 minutes in length, with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday\u2019s press release, I hope you\u2019ve had the opportunity to review our third quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. On today\u2019s conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today\u2019s call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt\u2019s tax barrels. Finally, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John. John Christmann : Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today\u2019s call, I will discuss Apache\u2019s approach to delivering value in the current environment, provide high level direction on our 2020 capital budget, and conclude with some comments on our third quarter performance and fourth quarter outlook. The market has come to view the lower oil and gas price environment that has been in place since 2014, a structural in nature and unlikely to improve for the foreseeable future. Compounding this, investors are frustrated with excessive capital investment by U.S. producers and pursued the growth which is common with expense of both return on and return of capital. For these and other reasons, the broad energy sector is out of favor and there is very little investor interest in publicly traded E&P companies. In response as an industry, we must generate more free cash flow and return it to investors on a more consistent basis while continuing to operate responsibly and increasing our focus on emissions reduction. In this regard, Apache\u2019s primary objectives are simple and straight forward, deliver competitive risk adjusted returns with a long-term moderate pace of growth, improve our free cash flow yield to level consistent with mature industrial sectors, and progress our sustainability initiatives. As we have done for the last several years, Apache will budget using a conservative price tag, influx our capital program in response to price volatility. We have taken a number of steps to adapt to the lower commodity price environment of the last five years. These include streamlining our portfolio, making substantial improvements to our capital allocation process, and significantly reducing our head cost. Apache has historically employed a decentralized region focus approach to operations. In recent years, we have centralized certain key activities and today see an opportunity to capture greater efficiencies by taking further steps in that direction. To accomplish this, we have initiated a comprehensive redesign of our organizational structure and operations that will position us to be competitive for the long term. This process which began in late summer should be largely completed by the end of the first quarter. We are targeting at least a $150 million of combined annual savings and look forward to updating you on our progress in the future. As we look ahead to 2020, our capital planning process is underway and we will disclose a final budget with our fourth quarter results in February. Based on current strip prices, we anticipate a 2020 upstream capital budget that would be 10% to 20% below this year\u2019s program of $2.4 billion. This will enable Apache to generate organic free cash flow that covers the dividend and puts us on pace to fund a multiyear debt reduction program while also delivering modest year-over-year oil production growth. We anticipate directing the vast majority of our Permian Capital in 2020 to more oil weighted projects in the Midland and Delaware Basins. In Egypt, we have taken significant steps to build and enhance our drilling inventory and assessing the potential for increase investment in the future. And in the North Sea, we intend to maintain a consistent level of activity year-over-year. Turning to Suriname, we have retained the Nobel Sam Croft drill the second and third wells on Block 58 in 2020, with an options still outstanding on a fourth well. We are planning to drill these wells at a 100%, but that might change should we choose the farm down our interest. As we progress through the 2020 planning process, we continue to monitor commodity fundamentals and evaluate multiple capital allocations scenarios under a number of different price tags across our diverse portfolio. We look forward to providing details on our outlook in February. Next, I will comment briefly on our third quarter performance and fourth quarter outlook before turning it over to Dave for more details. In the Permian Basin, our oil production in the second half of the year has been moderately impacted by some unplanned downtime events and to ways in our completion schedule and well maintenance timing. Consequently, we are now projecting fourth quarter Permian oil volumes of approximately 100,000 barrels per day. At Alpine High, we have reduced our drilling activity to two rigs and have chosen to defer some fourth quarter completions into 2020. This lower activity set combined with a decrease production outlook on one of our multi-well pads has results in an approximate 5% reduction in our fourth quarter Alpine High guidance. Internationally, third quarter production was in line with guidance and our outlook for the fourth quarter is unchanged. Egypt continues to deliver excellent well results and a high drilling success rate. In the North Sea, we have a significant exploratory success coming online at store this month and a second well at Garten coming online around year end. The log on the Garten well shows a much larger than expected hydrocarbon column and should generate positive production momentum as we enter 2020. In Suriname, we spud the market central number one in late September and expect to TD the well in November and a depth of approximately 6,325 meters as measured from the deck of the drillship. The well is designed to test multiple targets and is located roughly seven miles from the Suriname/Guyana maritime border. With the recent exercise of our option to drill a second and third well on Block 58, in conjunction, some optional future well commitments, Apache has the ability to retain the entirety of Block 58 with no relinquishment requirements until June of 2026. This provides sufficient time to execute a comprehensive exploratory program over this large block and initiate development activities as warranted. In closing, we are taking numerous decisive actions to improve our performance and positioning in this difficult macro environment. Apache has several key differentiators that enhanced our investment proposition. Our diversified portfolio affords the flexibility to allocate capital across to all three hydrocarbon streams and among conventional and unconventional assets as warranted by market conditions. We have a deep and diverse acreage position across the Permian Basin. Our international assets generate strong and stable free cash flow driven by premium pricing for oil, gas and NGLs. The returns generated by these assets are highly competitive within our portfolio and tend to be less sensitive to downside commodity price volatility. And lastly, Apache has excellent organic exploration opportunities in each of its three key regions as well as a potentially transformational position offshore Suriname. With that, I will turn the call over to Dave Pursell, who will provide some operational details on the quarter. Dave Pursell : Thanks, John, and good morning. Our strong operational results for the third quarter reflect the benefits of the diversified portfolio. Adjusted production of 391,000 barrels of oil equivalent is nearly flat with the previous quarter, which included approximately 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from assets in the Mid-Continent region that we divested during the second quarter. We are advancing a number of exploration programs both internationally and in the U.S., and development activities continue at a steady pace and our legacy U.S., North Sea and Egypt regions. During the third quarter, we drilled and completed 64 gross wells, 48 in the US, 14 in Egypt and two in the North Sea. U.S. third quarter production totalled 266,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the Midland Basin, we continue to drill high productivity oil wells. Our third quarter activity included an 11 well, 1.5 mile pad at Azalea located in the Midland County. This pad produces from the Lower Spraberry shale, Wolf Camp A and B and Lower Cline formation. The Lower Cline well tested in new landing zone with favourable results, achieving an average 30 day IP of 1,270 barrels of oil equivalent per day at 72% oil. Plans are underway to drill future Lower Cline wells to further delineate the Cline potential across our Midland Basin acreage. In Reagan County, we drilled the five well 2 mile pad. In the Hartgrove area, producing from the Wolfcamp B1 and B4 formations, 30-day IP averaged 1,150 barrels of oil equivalent per day with 79% of oil with D&C cost averaging a very efficient $7.2 million per well. And in the Delaware Basin, we drill five wells with 1 mile laterals at Dixieland at an average cost per well of less than $5.3 million. As we outlined last quarter, we are still feeling the effects of completing timing on our Permian oil production. We are on pace to put all 88 plan Midland in Northern Delaware Basin wells online, but many of them pushed back throughout the year. We have 25 wells schedule with online dates in November or December, which based on their timing, will add only minimum production to the fourth quarter. At Alpine High, we brought 15 wells online during the quarter. This included several wells from our 14 well Blackfoot Barnett pad in the Northern Flank. We have now drilled four large multi-well pads in this area and this most recent Barnett pad has thus far underperformed relative to the adjacent Mont Blanc, Barnett pad. All 14 Blackfoot wells were completed sequentially before commencing flow back operations. As a result, the significant volume of frac water was pumped into the small areas of reservoir, which may have impacted well productivity. We took advantage of a shutting period to soak this pad for approximately 60 days. The wells have been return to production at higher rates, additional modelling is underway to better understand the performance of these wells. Moving to our international regions, adjusted production came in a little higher than projected at 125,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In Egypt, following up on the discovery announced last quarter in our new East Bahariya area, we have received the development lease and have drilled the second well the Cobra-2, which is producing approximately 3,000 barrels of oil per day. We are currently drilling a third well with plans for a fourth well later this year. In the Matruh Basin, the Biruni-1X well tested 5,000 barrels of oil per day from the AEB 6 reservoir plus 6 million cubic feet of gas and 228 barrels of condensate per day from the Safa reservoir. We are currently drilling and offsetting the future expansion potential. And in the Shushan Basin, we had a recent exploration success the Anti-1X which tested 47 million cubic feet and 1,700 barrels of condensate per day from the Shifa formation. Turning to the North Sea, third quarter production was impacted by annual turnaround maintenance from which we expect the significant production rebound in the fourth quarter. We have had extremely successful drilling campaign this year, having drilled 10 producers with no dry-holes. Our latest North Sea success at the Garten-2, which encountered approximately 1,200 feet of net pay, in the prolific Beryl reservoir across three fall blocks, this compares favourably to the Garten 1, which came online in November 2018 to the 30-day IP of 13,000 barrels of oil and 17 million cubic feet of gas per day from 700 feet of pay. The Garten-2 is expected to be online around year end. Apache holds the 100% working interest in the Garten complex, which will have several follow on wells. The first well at our store development is scheduled for initial production next month. This is a high rate gas condensate well which we anticipate will initially produce over 30% oil. The well will be tied back to the existing infrastructure that connects to the Beryl alpha platform. We plan to drill second production later next year. More detail drilling pad and well highlights can be seen in our third quarter financial and operational supplement. Thank you. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Steve. Steve Riney : Thank you, Dave. On today\u2019s call, I will review third quarter financial results, provide a few updated to our 2019 guidance, and briefly share some thoughts on 2020. As noted in the press release issued last night under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Apache reported a third quarter 2019 consolidated net loss of $170 million or $0.45 per diluted common share. These results include a number of items that are outside of core earnings which were typically excluded by the investment community in their published earnings estimates. The most significant difference was a $53 million valuation allowance for deferred income tax benefits. Excluding this and other smaller items, adjusted earnings for the third quarter were a loss of $108 million or $0.29 per share. Production volumes were strong, but oil and NGL realizations weaken during the quarter. Gas prices increased a bit with some improvement at Waha hub, but generally remain very low. All major expense items were in line with or below our guidance for the quarter with the exception of DD&A, which rose to $17.30 per BOE. This was primarily due to reduced proved reserves at Alpine High associated with the recent deterioration in the NGL and natural gas prices. Both the GCX gas pipeline and the Shin Oak NGL pipeline were commissioned during the third quarter. With transport capacity on both of these pipelines, Apache now has access to attractive marketing margins over and above the pipeline test. In terms of full year 2019 guidance, we are increasing our annual DD&A to $15.25 per BOE for the impacts previously described. There are few other smaller changes to full year 2019 guidance, all of which can be found in our financial and operational supplement. As John indicated, we are deep into the planning process for 2020 and beyond. As in past years, we will take a conservative approach to pricing assumptions. We will plan for free cash flow over and above our normal dividend. At current strip pricing, this would indicate a 10% to 20% reduction in capital from 2019. Through the pricing cycle, we believe this approach can combine an attractive free cash flow yield with a moderate pace of production growth. For the next few years, most free cash flow will be used to reduce debt. Our debt maturity profile is now in good shape with just under $1 billion of debt maturating in the 2021 to 2023 timeframe. Our plan is to retire all of this debt as it comes due. As a reminder, for reporting purposes, Apache consolidates Altus' long-term debt. This debt non-recourse to Apache and amounted to $235 million at the end of the third quarter. So as we look forward to 2020, Apache is in a good situation, while the gas and NGL price environment will cause a slow down at Alpine High. We have a well diversified portfolio to allocate capital towards more oil focused opportunities. We will continue to be long-term returns focus with an appropriate balance of free cash flow and moderate growth. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : John, I wonder if I could hit a couple of things first of all, at a high level, I understand you haven\u2019t given guidance for 2020, but will you see modest growth, what is that mean? John Christmann : We don\u2019t see any modest any this point, Doug. We\u2019re in the middle of the planning process, kind of pace, we\u2019ve been on what is leave at the modest. Doug Leggate : Okay. I thought that would be quick answer, but so appreciate you\u2019re trying to at least no answering the question. My second one is on Suriname, much and you\u2019re going to get low on this. But I wanted to ask a very specific issue around Suriname, you\u2019ve said for sometime the Apache had a differentiated view of the block. My question is that, you've never released the result of the Popokai well, but a couple of your engineers did talk about the Popokai changed your view all to be thermal maturity of your block. So wonder if I could ask you to characterize, what are the type of targets you\u2019re looking for and address specifically whether you believe this is our predominantly gas prone area that you\u2019re testing? And any color around the spud specific issue would be really appreciated? John Christmann : Well, the first thing I\u2019ll say Doug is, the team was very impressed with the work that we did from the data that\u2019s out there. So, we thought you do a fantastic job on your report. We said that we have seven different play types on Block 58. The Maka-1 Central well is going to be targeting two of those play types. They\u2019re in the Cretaceous. And I will just suggest that we obviously feel like the, we would be in an oil window or we wouldn't be placing a well there. Doug Leggate : I appreciate that. Last one very quickly, as I wonder if you could just address the recent management change and followed by price capabilities in Suriname, and I would note that I believe you saying the PSC before Mr. Kim and joined Apache. So if you could just over some clarification that would be great? John Christmann : Actually, we picked this block up in 2015. Steve had been on board with us, but he was not working the conventional exploration stuff at that time. So, this is something that actually we did on my watch early in 2015, before any other results were down in Guyana or our wells. So, Steve did not have anything to do with us getting into Suriname or taking this block. Secondly, I want to thanks Steve for his time here. He made great contributions to the organization and is truly a world-class explore. As we disclosed on the call today, I have been thinking about a long-term vision for the Company and working on some significant organizational changes. Steve's remaining tenure was shorter than the time I was planning for. So that require he and I to have a conversation around succession. I propose an appropriate transition in very simply he just elected to resign, but it had nothing to do with Suriname. Operator : The question is from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James. John Freeman : Hi, John. The first one on, just sort of the initial commentary that you've provided on 2020, so just, it sounds like from I guess the high level when we think capital allocation, you basically said just assume kind of North Sea would be kind of flat year-over-year. Egypt based on the success you\u2019ve had and I assume additional information you\u2019re giving from the seismic shoot that you should see an increase investment there. And then it just sounded like in terms of kind of Permian/Alpine High just more of a shifting of capital there some of the more oiler areas at Midland, Delaware. So, when I think about just as overall region, when I think historically all kind of 70 :30 kind of U.S. international. Just I guess how much that could kind of change, as it sounds like just really international the only kind of directionally going up? John Christmann : Yes. I would say, John, first and foremost, we spent more money at Alpine High and that capital is going to come down, so that in itself will change those the parentages of pie. The exploration spend in Suriname could be a little larger as well, so that also would tilt the international. But -- and then, we stated that the Permian capital is going to come down, but in general the oil drillings is going to go up, so... John Freeman : And then just the follow-up until we\u2019re given any additional information, can we just contain to assume for these additional, these other two Suriname wells around that $60 million to $65 million per well somewhere to the first? John Christmann : Yes. I mean the spread shouldn\u2019t be changed in much. I mean we\u2019ve got Nobel Sam Croft. Rates were negotiated and there is actually another extension we could take and have just preserved that option for the future. So, it's going be pretty similar. A lot of that will just depend on what we do and how long we\u2019re on the wells and how much testing and all those things will drive that cost. Operator : The next question is from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer : I wanted to see, just a follow-up on John\u2019s question there. More a bigger picture, if you could paint a picture of how Suriname success or lack of excess is going to impact your capital allocation strategy? So, in success case, would you finance development fully and entirely via selling down a stake? Would there be openness to outspending cash flow? Would you need to issue equity? Would you think about just reducing activity elsewhere in the portfolio? And in a lack of success case, what would be your interest for need for inorganic portfolio replenishment? John Christmann : Well, Brian, we feel good about the portfolio with or without Suriname. So I think we got a very diverse portfolio, we\u2019ve got great optionality, we\u2019ve got lots of onshore unconventional inventory that is all weighted as well as some optionality on the rich gas side. We got good inventory both on our international areas and then obviously Suriname offers a new playground for us. So, we feel good about the inventory and feel good about the direction of the Company, I think that\u2019s one thing. If you look back over the last four years from where we sit today, from where we were, we have a lot of more inventory than we have on all fronts. So, as far as financing or success case at Suriname, we still have a 100% equity in that block, and we made a very clear that our intent would be to likely bring in a partner, and we feel like it that would play a role and how that would be funded. So, I am not in a position to give you a lot more color than that, but I don\u2019t see us having to stop some of the other things that would be doing or significantly stressing our balance sheet. Steve, do you want to add anything. Steve Riney : No, I think that\u2019s good John. Brian Singer : And then, the follow-up is with regard to the onshore inventory you mentioned, some improved performance or economics on the Cline. Can you just talk to what you\u2019re seeing in terms of supply cost coming down either by cost reduction or improve performance in the Permian? And then any update on exploratory efforts in the onshore? John Christmann : At this point, we do not have anything that we prepared to update on the onshore exploratory side. I will say in general, cost are, it's kind of mix bag, some things are coming down and some of the services there has been some slowdowns. Some of it remains tight, so we\u2019re managing that, so it's really a function of the individual services. I think what you\u2019re seeing now is having been in kind of a development mode with those pads. A lot of the synergies and things were drive out or in the cost to really more function just the efficiencies that come with the larger scale, pad development where you have all the infrastructure in place. I\u2019ll put it over to Dave to comment on the Cline. Dave Pursell : Yes. So, thanks John. The Cline well just a little more color than in the prepared remarks. It's one well that it\u2019s been online for 120 days. We\u2019re happy with its performance. We look at our portfolio when we think we have opportunities under a couple of field at least. And so, you\u2019ll be hearing more about that as we kind of get to the end of 2020. Operator : The next question is from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Bob Brackett : Good morning. I\u2019m looking at that TVD of the Market Central at 6,325 meters, that's considerably, say, several thousand feet deeper than Haimara, which is maybe your closest offset well from the industry. Does that suggest you\u2019re trying to tap the top of the Jurassic? Or is that landing somewhere in the Cretaceous? John Christmann : I would just say at this point that would you know most of our targets, the two plays will be testing here are in the Cretaceous. Bob Brackett : Bob here, but I appreciate the compliment. A quick question then, what about the Miocene? You didn\u2019t mention that as one of the play types? John Christmann : At this point where you've gone through a full evaluation of all of the play types, so, Bob that\u2019s where we are I mean this is two in the Cretaceous in a very nice sticks section. Bob Brackett : Yes, concurred. In terms of the modest oil production growth that you highlighted, should I stay specifically into focus on oil production growth and the gas will be sort flat or down or just gas track with that oil? John Christmann : We would be emphasizing the modest oil plays. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles Meade : I wanted to understand that there is a lot of focus on this first well, but I wonder if I could get you to talk a little bit more about these next two wells that are going to come after. My guess would be that since you've already got the -- the rig going to drill these back-to-back that you already have those two locations mapped out and that they're going to be independent of your result on this first well. But can you talk about whether that's right? Or how you -- how those next 2 wells are going to go? John Christmann : Charles, we actually permitted nine different wells. So, there is multiple, multiple target. I\u2019ll just say since it is the first well in this area that we\u2019ll be gathering data and there are some decision through things we\u2019ll do based on the data we collect. So, we\u2019ve got a pretty good idea where we want to go, but information and confirmation is certain things will drive the exact thoughts and process. Charles Meade : And then if I could go back to the Blackfoot pad in the Alpine High. Dave, I appreciate the comments you made about that in the prepared remarks, but I was curious you mentioned -- I believe, I heard you mentioned that you left the frac water soak on those -- on that pad for, I think, 60 days. Can you talk about -- is that -- has that been a standard procedure at Alpine High? Is that something new or different view you chose to do? Or maybe just -- maybe it was just the timing? Can you talk about whether that's the standard plan whether it's a one-off? And what you're going to learn going forward from this? Dave Pursell : Yes, Charles, good question. We\u2019ve had some opportunities in the past to soak wells, really do the facility constrain so what we found in some cases and well performance improve of soak. When we frac the 14 well Blackfoot pad remember that was, the wells were all completed sequentially. So, we put a lot of produced water into a relatively compact part of the reservoir. And we thought, well, let's taken the advantage of well commodity prices, initiate a 60-day soak. Really trying to understand is that relative permeability issue? Or what are the mechanisms for the underperformance? We\u2019ve had the pad back online for about 30 days. The gas rate came back above. The pretty soak rate and it's actually holding in pretty flat, which say or was some impact in the condensate rate came up, higher than the pre-soak rate. So, what we\u2019re doing Charles, we\u2019re evaluating that, we have a team of folks doing some detail work on the Blackfoot and all of the multi-well pads that we've drilled and completed today. Operator : The next question is from the line of Gail Nicholson with Stephens. Gail Nicholson : I am looking at Egypt, you guys had a really nice results there this quarter. When you guys look at cash 2020 and CapEx, do you guys have any idea -- an updated idea what maintenance CapEx is Egypt would be to keep adjusted 72,000 flat? John Christmann : Gail, we\u2019ve got results from the new 3D that we're starting to see from our prospect inventory should improve is what we\u2019re excited about. So, we don\u2019t really look at rig count to keep things flat because we\u2019re just working on what\u2019s project are going to be best in terms of the allocation. But as we\u2019ve said, with the new inventory and the things we\u2019re seeing, I think there is a potential to actually return Egypt on the oil side to grow and so, we\u2019re tired about that. Gail Nicholson : And then just looking the recent exploration at the [indiscernible] G12 and the [indiscernible] condensate discovery. How does that I guess maybe change future potential gas development in Egypt? John Christmann : Well, we\u2019ve got a lot of infrastructure from Qasr. And so, there is the nice thing about some things is they can be tied in. Most of our drilling will be focused on oil, but we do have a lot of gas infrastructure and capacity. So, it\u2019s not a big deal, and if we find it and it still very economic for us is as we get about 265 NIM for that. Operator : The next question is from the line of Mike Scialla with Stifel. Mike Scialla : Just wanted to see if there anything you could say about what you've seen so far in the Maka Central wells at this point? John Christmann : I\u2019d say we\u2019re drilling ahead that we are now in the shallower targets. And Mike, the only thing I\u2019ll say at this time point is, is that, we have not seen anything that would be unexpected. Mike Scialla : And just wanted if you could give any more color on the organizational initiatives that you put in place? John Christmann : Yes. I think we see an opportunity to reduce kind of take a $150 million out of the system. I think it's going to unable to deliver more proactive planning and improve capital allocation, which is something we strived to continually do. I think it's going to enable us to advance our resource progression from access to exploration to the development and operations is going to allow us to right size both the corporate and regional offices to more efficiently support the new organization. We\u2019re going to minimize duplication, eliminate some redundancies and it also is going to help us really enable the collaboration on the value adding technology adoption. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Neal Dingmann : John, my question is based on the early strong Lower Cline test that you've seen in that Driver Schrock pad. Do you have plans to increase activity targeting this zone? Or I guess maybe I\u2019ll ask a different way, could you all just maybe discuss your upcoming multi-zone development pad around the Midland Basin? John Christmann : Yes. I think we\u2019ve got our inventory so lined out, but it doesn\u2019t impact the next couple of pads. But what it does is, we\u2019re constantly dipping down and testing things that we can add in the future. And so, we can\u2019t jump around next pad and move here. I mean we\u2019ve really got this machine lined out and we\u2019re in an execution mode. But we factor that in, we\u2019re testing things that we think and add material inventory and then we will start planning that into our future pads is the way I think about that and is kind of where we approach things. Neal Dingmann : And then just one follow-up, could you all discuss any upcoming lease requirements that you might have at Alpine High as you slowdown activity in the play? John Christmann : Yes, I mean that\u2019s one of the big things where you've kind of challenged the team to do that is work through a plan that helped to determine what acreage we want to maintain for optionality purposes. So, that\u2019s the process we\u2019re working through, and we will be very deliberate and work through what it is, we think we have to maintain for optionality in the future. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with KeyBanc. Leo Mariani : Just wanted to follow up a little bit there on Alpine High, obviously, you guys are kind of cutting back activity, but still looks like you have a pretty nice growth ramp here into fourth quarter. Just kind of wanted to get a sense with sort of 2 rigs out there in '20, how should we think about Alpine High production? Obviously, you've got significant production there. I mean is that's something that can kind of be maintained kind of at sort of year-end '19 levels? Or would you start to see some declines there with a couple of rigs? John Christmann : Well, we\u2019ll come back in February with the, when we have better view exactly what the plans is going to look like. But I do know we deferred some completions in early 2020 and we got some docs. So, it\u2019s not going to drop massively, but we\u2019ll come back with the shape for the curve next year that\u2019s comments through with the activity level that we\u2019ll go forward with. Leo Mariani : And I guess, obviously, there's significant infrastructure there and clearly we'll get, I guess, another gas pipeline and Permian Highway coming sometime in early '21. I mean, I guess, what type of kind of future gas and NGL prices do you guys kind of want to see to where you may harvest kind of more of that resource? Any color on that would be helpful. John Christmann : Yes. Thank you, just step back late 2018, we went in the more what I called the development stage and as Dave mentioned in prepared remarks we initiated pad drilling on four multi-well pads. Concurrently this spring we had a natural gas and NGL price is really materially lower and that happen as we started to bring on some of the infrastructure. So we\u2019ve got the pads to evaluate and we\u2019ll just come back with that view as well. Leo Mariani : And I guess, just lastly on Egypt. Certainly, I noticed that your gross liquids volumes primarily on the oil side in the third quarter were kind of down versus 2Q kind of roughly 9% on my math here. Just wanted to get a sense if there was anything anomalous going on in 3Q on the gross oil volumes in Egypt that may have driven that reduction? Dave Pursell : Yes, this is Dave Pursell, really what drove that were declines in Qasr and Berenice. Leo Mariani : Okay. Dave Pursell : Remember those -- just for some color, those fields have been producing for a wild now and it held much better than anticipated. So, we\u2019re expecting declines at some point and we saw here in the third quarter. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities. Richard Tullis : Just a couple of more on the Alpine High, John, could you talk a little bit about reserve write-downs that you took in the quarter related to the lower commodity pricing? Dave Pursell : Yes. This is Dave Pursell. So, we\u2019ll -- there\u2019ll be more color at the end of the year in the K and there maybe some commentary in the Q, but what you see any price revision was primarily on gas and NGLs in the Permian Basin. There were very modest or performance vision, so the price revision were due to low basin gas and NGL prices and primarily focusing on Permian Basin. Richard Tullis : And Dave, do you expect any additional year end write-downs in addition to what you referenced in the 3Q? Dave Pursell : Yes. I think, if you -- yes, it\u2019s a good question. If you look at the trailing four quarter pricing, we\u2019re still benefiting somewhat a high fourth quarter 2018 price. So, as we roll forward and if you look at the future prices for the fourth quarter of 2019, we lose the benefit of the one high quarter that\u2019s in the averaging right now. So, if the forward prices hold we would envision there would be some additional price revision in the fourth quarter. Say again still so hard to quantify those to get the actual in, but that\u2019s kind of where we see it now. Richard Tullis : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And just my last question also related to Alpine High. Do you have any sort of minimum volume commitments with Altus that you have to maintain? Dave Pursell : No, acreage dedication. Operator : The next question is from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Scott Gruber : So circling back on the CapEx split between U.S. and international, just back of the envelope here, it appears that the 4Q shift will see the U.S. international split move towards 65 :35 based upon the updated annual guide for 2019. Is that broadly how we should think about the split in 2020, overall, would yield the modest spending growth abroad, is that how we should think about it? John Christmann : I mean what I would say, I hate that, you just look at the one quarter, right, because things move around. But I would say in general, our CapEx is going to come down as we set. You\u2019re going to see last rich gas drilling at Alpine High and you\u2019re liable to see pretty flat pace in the North Sea compared to where we are, and we actually have some exploration wells. So that number might come down a little bit. Egypt should be flat to slightly and our oil projects in the U.S. are going to be a little higher as well. So, we\u2019ll give you more color in February when we come out with our final 2020 plans. Scott Gruber : And then just on the UK given the production momentum heading into next year, what are you guys looking at in terms of production over the full course of 2020? Can you generate some growth from the UK next year? John Christmann : Once, again, we\u2019ll hold off on the 20s specifics until we come out with the plan, but we\u2019re very excited about the program. They\u2019ve done a tremendous job this year at Garten 2, absolutely exceeded our expectations. We\u2019ve got an entire fault block there that looks just fantastic that we had upside at the Storr well. So, we\u2019ve got some big things coming on and it sets up as Dave said in his prepared remarks, set ups some additional drilling at Garten in the future. So, the shape of the curve going into 2020 is going to have a lot of momentum for the North Sea. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ryan Todd with Simmons Energy Ryan Todd : Maybe a follow-up question on Alpine High and Altus in particular, I mean, given the reduction activity at Alpine High, I know you have MVC. But how do you think about the go forward options at Altus longer-term in terms of future capital to spend on the G&P side, potential options to address the value and/or structure of the entity? John Christmann : Ryan, I\u2019ll ask you it's not too bigger than inconvenient so just hop on the Altus call this afternoon at 1 o'clock, and we'll let Clay and team there handle all of those questions directly. Ryan Todd : Maybe one follow-up on Egypt, I mean, you've mentioned the possibility to generate long-term growth as opposed to just holding volumes flat in the region. I mean, what would you need to see the move in that direction? Would you need to see continue the exploration success? Have seen enough already? And is there anything else that would dictate kind of how aggressive you would or could be there? John Christmann : No, I mean, that's we got very large position, right; and we\u2019ve got a very large base, I think the technology that we\u2019re applying the new acreage we picked up with the new 3D puts us in a position for pretty interesting looking inventory. And I think it's going to be more driven off the inventory and the opportunity set than anything. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : Just wanted to follow up on some of the Egypt questions, I make sure I got some of your remarks correct. So, in your prepared you've indicated that you\u2019re building and enhancing drilling inventory there. And so, can you provide us with an update on what the current capital efficiency looks like because that might have changed over the past couple of years as you're spending below maintenance? And then, how productive the first call and incremental capital sounds like, because it seems like there could be some exploration? I know you said there is already some gas facility there, but not sure what\u2019s there on the oil side in order for you to increase production? John Christmann : Yes, Jeanine, I thank if you look at Egypt, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve been under investing. So, that\u2019s the first thing I\u2019d say, I think we\u2019ve been investing in appropriate pace. We had a very large discovery in Qasr, many, many years ago, which is pretty unique. And so, if you take that out and look at the portfolio, we\u2019ve been on a really good pace. You look at the Ptah and Berenice discoveries, we had in late 2014 early 2015; things have been going quite strong. So, we\u2019ve got a big footprint. We\u2019ve been there a long time. We spread out over a very, very large area. And my point on the other tie ends is, we just have a lot of capacity there for more gas yields. And so, I think things are going quite well and we do see the potential to improve our productivity with the new inventory. Jeanine Wai : My second question is on the Alpine High, in terms of giving away some Alpine High CapEx to other early play. At what commodity prices do you think that Alpine High can beat your capital? And I guess what we\u2019re thinking is just that, you\u2019re takeaway contracts specifically for Alpine High for NGLs and crude, those are acreage dedications so you have a ton of flexibility there. The gas takeaway I believe has that MVCs, but I\u2019m pretty sure that you wouldn\u2019t have an issue arbing those out. So, just trying to really figure out kind of what the push and pull is on CapEx allocation to that play? John Christmann : I mean it's purely going to be forward look at the incremental economics. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Michael Hall : Thanks. A lot of been address, I guess maybe going back to Suriname. Now, you\u2019ve got the Mako Well location out there. Is there any additional color you can provide as to why this was the first of the test of the nine wells you\u2019ve permitted and any additional color on the thought process there? John Christmann : Well, I mean it\u2019s first of all in the block, right. So -- and it\u2019s a well that we like, some of the prospect there its ability to test two of them and that\u2019s why we chose it. Michael Hall : And were there any risks in the other wells that you were mitigating with the selection of this well? John Christmann : With the exploration and your first well in, it\u2019s a process right. So, there is -- since it has the word exploration by, there's always risks that you're assessing and you learn from. And so, but this was the order of the first well we thought we should drill, and from there, we got numerous options to go. So, but there is -- as we said all along, there are seven different play types. There are many, many significant very good looking prospects, so we just had to get started somewhere. Michael Hall : And then I guess just to come back on the Alpine High economics side of thing, I think in the past you\u2019ve talked about mid-$0.20 or 7 handle on propane as kind of the level to think about where Alpine High will compete for capital. Are those still fair levels to watch? John Christmann : Michael, we\u2019ll come back on that. I mean once again, we've got four pads that we\u2019re evaluating, and it really is going to boil down to now that we have the infrastructure in place. It's more about the incremental economics relative to our other portfolio opportunities. Operator : And with no further audio questions, I\u2019ll hand the floor back to John Christmann for closing remarks. John Christmann : So, thank you. In closing, Apache is taking significant steps to lower our cost structure and to further optimize our capital allocation. Our goal is to improve free cash flow yield inclusive of the dividend, increase returns, and continue our pace of modest oil growth. We have some very attractive exploration opportunities throughout the portfolio that make Apache a differential investment opportunity. Thank you and happy Halloween. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today; Gary Clark, Vice President Investor Relations. You may begin. Gary Clark : Good morning and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's Fourth Quarter Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. We will begin the call with an overview by; CEO and President, John Christmann; Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO will then summarize our fourth quarter and full year financial performance. Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President of Development, Planning, Reserves and Fundamentals will also be available on the call to answer questions. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 15 minutes in length with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our fourth quarter financial and operational supplement which can be found on our investor relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. Finally I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that I will turn the call over to John. John Christmann : Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will recap Apache's 2019 accomplishments, discuss our fourth quarter performance and conclude with an overview of our strategic approach for the next few years. For Apache 2019 was a year of both progress and challenges. Our most significant challenges were associated with Alpine High which I will discuss in a few minutes. Our progress however was on many fronts. We took steps to advance key environmental, social and governance initiatives, met our corporate goals around capital spending reduction and cash returns, further streamlined and repositioned our portfolio and strengthened our balance sheet. Specifically, over the last year we enhanced our global sustainability efforts by linking ESG goals, directly to short-term incentive compensation, initiated alignment of ESG disclosures with SASB and TCFD recommendations and began to earmark capital specifically for ESG projects. We launched a comprehensive corporate redesign to further align our organization work processes and cost structure with lower and long-term planned activity levels and we reduced upstream capital investment by 23% from 2018. We also delivered cash return on invested capital consistent with our corporate incentive compensation target of 19% and continued to streamline our portfolio with the divestment of assets in Oklahoma and the Texas, Panhandle. Internationally, we generated a substantial inventory of new drill-ready prospects in Egypt through our recent seismic and acreage evaluation initiatives. We sustained production levels in the North Sea with a 100% drilling success rate and achieved first production from our store discovery which was on-time and on budget. And at year-end, we signed a joint venture agreement with Total in Block 58 Suriname which brought in a world-class offshore operator and established a substantial capital access framework. This enabled Apache to retain a 50% working interest in the Block, while significantly reducing our exposure to potential large-scale appraisal and development spending. Moving now to the fourth quarter, oil production in the Permian Basin exceeded guidance and averaged the highest quarterly rate in Apache's history. Since mid-2017 we have operated our unconventional oil-focused program at a relatively steady and deliberate pace. This has generated highly competitive well results, solid returns and an attractive oil production growth rate in the Permian. This year we plan to reduce our Permian operated rig count and deliver a low to mid single-digit oil growth rate. At Alpine High, results were disappointing on a few fronts. In our second quarter 2019 earnings release, we spoke about the impact of the natural gas and NGL price collapse on the economic competitiveness of further investment in Alpine High. In the second half of 2019 extended flow data from key spacing and landing zone tests indicated disappointing performance of our multi-well development pads. While these tests are not fully conclusive for the entirety of Alpine High, given the prevailing price environment, further testing is not warranted at this time. As a result, we dropped the remainder of our drilling rigs in the fourth quarter and chose to defer some previously planned completions. In Egypt, gross production in the fourth quarter was relatively flat with the third quarter. Adjusted production volumes in the quarter were adversely impacted by a onetime cost recovery settlement agreed to by our partner in one of our non-operated concessions. This should have no ongoing impact on future production volumes. Strong drilling results in Egypt during the quarter position us well for 2020 and we look forward to testing some high-impact oil prospects on both new and legacy acreage beginning around midyear. Production in the North Sea increased significantly following seasonal platform maintenance turnarounds in the third quarter and first production from our store discovery in November. Startup of the Garten two well was delayed into the first quarter as previously disclosed. This well is now online and will drive a further production increase in the first quarter of 2020. Turning now to Suriname. We drilled our first well in Block 58 the Maka Central number one during the fourth quarter and subsequently announced a significant oil discovery in January. We are now working with our partner Total on an appraisal plan which will be submitted to the state-owned oil company Staatsolie in the coming months. In January, the Noble Sam Croft drillship moved from Maka to our second exploration prospect Sapakara West. As we noted in last night's press release the Sapakara well is drilling ahead to the Santonian interval as planned and we are encouraged by what we have seen thus far. Following Sapakara, we will drill a third and likely a fourth exploration test in Block 58. Looking longer term, Apache's differentiated asset portfolio and disciplined approach gives us confidence in our ability to continue to improve returns and deliver competitive share price performance relative to our peers. As demonstrated over the last few years, we clearly have a significant inventory of high-quality investment opportunities in the Permian Basin, Egypt and the North Sea. In Suriname, we have a very large-scale asset in Block 58, which may be transformational and capable of driving long-term volume growth at a very attractive return on capital. We have made the strategic decision to prioritize funding Suriname over the next few years, with a portion of the capital that would otherwise be directed towards shorter cycle growth opportunities elsewhere in the portfolio. As a result, our near-term production growth will be a bit slower than it otherwise could be but we believe the long-term potential far outweighs any short term impacts. Over the coming years our strategic approach will center around retaining free cash flow in excess of the dividend for the purpose of reducing debt, continuing to prioritize long-term returns over growth, aggressively managing our cost structure and advancing our exploration and appraisal activities in Suriname. One of the primary financial objectives is to reduce debt over the next several years. We will do this with cash that is primarily sourced from operating cash flow. As a result, our upstream capital investment will be determined by the oil price environment. For 2020 we are budgeting $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion which allows for an uncertain price environment centered around a $50 WTI oil price. In terms of capital allocation, Alpine High will receive minimal to no funding and we are shifting some capital from Permian oil projects to Egypt which is better insulated from weak oil prices due to the production sharing contracts. With this plan in 2020, we expect to maintain our current dividend payment which is yielding approximately 3.5% retain free cash flow to initiate progress on our debt reduction goals allocate, approximately $200 million to exploration and invest $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion of capital including exploration which will result in flat- to low-single-digit corporate oil production growth year-over-year. To the extent oil prices continue to fall, capital will be reduced, as will our near-term production outlook. That said if oil prices move materially higher, we will prioritize further debt reduction over increasing capital activity. Moving now to our corporate redesign initiative. We are well down the road with the process of both rightsizing and reorganizing our technical, operational and corporate support functions. The rightsizing is a recognition that we will not be returning to past levels of capital activity and need to make a permanent reduction in headcount. The new model which is enabled by a more focused portfolio is more centralized and will tie incentives to asset team performance rather than to regions. It is designed to enhance collaboration and enable greater mobility of technical personnel as capital is redirected across the portfolio. We expect to achieve at least $150 million of annual savings from overhead and operating cost reductions associated with this initiative. Over the coming months we will provide more information around the structure of the new organization. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney, who will provide additional details on our 2019 results and 2020 outlook. Steve Riney : Thank you, John. My remarks this morning will provide a few more details covering Apache's fourth quarter and full year 2019 results. The progress to date on our organizational redesign and our 2020 financial objectives and guidance. I will also comment on our recent efforts to reduce long-term gas transportation commitments in light of the changing capital plan for Alpine High. As noted in our news release issued yesterday, under generally accepted accounting principles, Apache reported a fourth quarter 2019 consolidated net loss of $3 billion or $7.89 per diluted common share. These results include a number of items that are outside of core earnings. The most significant of these are noncash impairments of $1.4 billion related to Alpine High wells, facilities, leasehold and other upstream assets; and $1.3 billion for Altus Midstream, gathering, processing and transmission assets. We also recorded a $528 million impairment of Alpine High unproved leasehold assets, which is included in exploration expense. Excluding these and other smaller items, adjusted earnings for the quarter were $31 million or $0.08 per share. During the fourth quarter and throughout 2019, Apache maintained a very steady pace of capital activity and spending. Upstream capital investment was less than $600 million in each quarter of the year, putting us below our full year budget of $2.4 billion. Total production during the fourth quarter exceeded our guidance most notably for Permian oil, which benefited from good well performance and the timing of pad completions. From a financial perspective during 2019, we continued to fund our $376 million dividend payment, which is one of the highest yields in our peer group. We generated full year cash return on invested capital, consistent with the corporate incentive compensation goal of 19%. We paid off $150 million of debt and we refinanced a portion of our long-term debt significantly extending our maturity profile while lowering our average borrowing rate. As you may recall, anticipating Alpine High volume growth, we contracted for around one Bcf per day of long-term natural gas transportation capacity out of the Permian Basin. Consistent with our decision to substantially curtail investment in Alpine High, we are taking steps now to reduce those commitments. To-date we have eliminated approximately 310 million cubic feet per day of take-or-pay obligations and we have more in progress. As John noted, we are also making good progress with respect to our organizational redesign. We will substantially complete the redesign for our technical functions by the end of the first quarter while work on the corporate support functions and field operations will likely continue through much of 2020. We remain on target to achieve our goal of at least $150 million of annual savings and we'll get to this run rate of savings sometime in the second half of 2020. This effort will, of course, result in some one-off costs, $28 million of these costs were recognized in 2019 and make up the majority of the $33 million of transaction, reorganization and separation costs in the fourth quarter results. The remainder of these costs will be recognized in 2020. Turning now to 2020, one of our key financial goals for the year is to retain free cash flow after the dividend. This will be used to begin funding our longer term objective of paying down $937 million of debt maturing over the next four years. While the softening price environment is making this increasingly difficult, debt reduction is a key priority and we are committed to flexing the size of the capital program to ensure progress in 2020. To conclude my remarks, I would like to provide some commentary on full year 2020 and first quarter guidance, the specifics of which can be found in our fourth quarter earnings supplement. For the full year, the allocation of our capital budget is intended to balance two competing objectives, funding a proper pace of activity to test the significant long-term potential of Suriname Block 58, while at the same time investing in near-term development to sustain or grow total oil production. As John noted, we expect to deliver on both of these objectives with our $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion upstream capital program this year. Natural gas and NGL production will decline year-over-year, primarily due to the activity reduction at Alpine High. In the first quarter, Alpine High volumes will be slightly below fourth quarter 2019 levels of 95,000 BOEs per day and we expect this to decline to around 50,000 to 60,000 BOEs per day by the end of the year. These numbers do not include the impact of potential production curtailments due to negative Waha hub pricing. Turning to the cost side, because the organizational redesign will impact both the level and timing of cost savings, we are providing only first quarter estimates for G&A, LOE and exploration expense. We will update our guidance on these items as we progress through the year. On a final note, primarily as a result of the fourth quarter impairment charge, we are projecting a material decrease in DD&A. We expect DD&A per BOE for 2020 will be around $13.50. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is open. John Abbott : Good morning. It's actually John Abbott on for Doug, like it he's on a plane right now, and he's listening in on the webcast. John Christmann : Good morning, John. John Abbott : Yeah. We just have a couple of questions here. Staying with Suriname, you said that you like what you so far see from the shallower target. But you're also planning multiple tests. Can you elaborate on what you have seen so far? For example, have you encountered hydrocarbon bearing reservoir sands? John Christmann : Well, as -- thanks for the question. In general, we don't like to comment on specifics about a well while it's drilling. So, what I will say is as we have drilled through the Campanian. And as I said, we are encouraged by what we have seen. We are headed on to the Santonian. And as we put in the materials last night the plan would be to run open hole logs fluid -- capture fluid samples, cores pressure, tests and so forth. John Abbott : All right. And then for our follow-up question on the appraisal of Maka Central, what's the expected timing? Should we see a result in 2020? Can you provide any context on lateral footprint sand thickness, as we're trying to confirm our view that the Block 58 might be the deposition center of the basin? John Christmann : At this point what I will say is we are working very closely with our partner Total. I'm not in a position to give any color, because we have to work up that plan. There's a time line where we need to deliver that to Staatsolie, which we will do. We're excited about it. We're working on it jointly and we'll be able to talk about that more in the future. John Abbott : I appreciate, and thank you for taking our questions. John Christmann : Your bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Your line is open. Bob Brackett : Yeah. I'll try a different tactic to the former question. You mentioned fluid sampling on the Sapakara West. Do you routinely fluid sample formation water? John Christmann : Bob, we would -- that is not something we would typically do. But I mean, it all depends on what we've seen in running the right tests according to what we've seen in the well. Bob Brackett : Okay. Appreciate that. A quick follow-up. You mentioned $200 million of exploration. I imagine that's dominantly Suriname, but could you break out any other interesting aspects to that exploration budget? John Christmann : Yeah. I will say the lion's share of that is Suriname. We do have some things on the unconventional side that we're slowly watching and working. But the majority of that will go to Suriname. Bob Brackett : Great, appreciate it. John Christmann : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Scialla with Stifel. Your line is open. Mike Scialla : Yeah. Good morning, everybody. I don't normally do this, but I have to give Bob kudos that was in my 20 years probably the best asked question I've heard. John Christmann : It was a good question Mike. Mike Scialla : Yeah. It definitely was. Steve, you had said you're reducing your commitments on from Alpine High. Just wondering what that looks like? Does that take place at the Altus level? And are you able to actually sell some of the firm's transportation that you've taken on Gulf Coast Express and Permian Highway. Steve Riney : Yeah. Mike, so I'm not going to be able to speak to specific pipelines. We've got multiple contractual arrangements for moving gas out of the Permian Basin. And so, it's not -- also not specifically related to Alpine High in terms of the gas evacuation. It's just gas evacuation from the Permian Basin. Let me just step back from that a little bit. We mostly sell our equity production actually in basin, and therefore like on the vast facts that you received with our earnings announcement what you see is the realized price in the Permian Basin at Waha or at El Paso Permian. We have a marketing team that then recommends and implements taking actions around how do we make sure that basin prices are connected to the broader market over the long-terms? And example of an action that they might recommend and did was we need to get some pipelines built to the Permian Basin -- from the Permian Basin to the Gulf Coast, and we helped FID, the two pipelines that you talked about in doing that. And that did well, and it did for a while and it will help connect the Permian Basin to the Gulf Coast. Our marketing organization then manages the exposures associated with those assets. And so, we typically manage that by purchasing gas in-basin and transporting it to meet our obligations on those pipes. We have chosen now to reduce our longer-term exposure. We've accomplished getting those built by participating in the FID process. Those are obligations that do not involve Altus Midstream. That's an obligation of Apache Corporation and we've decided that we want to start reducing some of those exposures and we have initiated that process. As I said in my prepared remarks, we've contracted away. Basically we've contracted with counterparties to take over our obligation of up to 310 million cubic feet a day. That doesn't start immediately, so we still maintain some exposure to that in the short term and that's probably a good thing at this point in time. But we're taking away the longer-term exposure on some of the pipeline transport capacity that we have in the Permian Basin. And at this point we're still working on a bit more of that. We would like to bring that down just a bit more. Mike Scialla : That's great. Thanks for the detail. And I guess sticking with Alpine High. John, how are you thinking about it now? Do you keep that as a long-term option on gas? Or do you think it makes sense to consider a divestiture there at some point? John Christmann : I mean, what I'll say Mike, I'll go back and just take a few minutes here. But when Alpine High was announced in 2016, we had great hope for what it could mean for Apache. It had all the key ingredients of an impact play, large-scale, low-cost of entry and we had acquired the heart of the play. And in the end, a number of factors were problematic at Alpine High. First, as you just recognized gas NGL prices fell to less than half of the prices we anticipated for long-term economics. Second the lack of infrastructure prolonged the period to test full development. And this along with the sheer stratigraphic size and aerial extent increased the cost and time to do so. Third, the lack of cryogenic processing capacity did not allow us to test the NGL mix and yields until the middle of 2019, when we actually got the cryos on through Altus. Fourth, we anticipated a meaningful uplift in well productivity and a significant decrease in well cost as we move to pad and pattern development as is the case in almost all unconventional resource plays. We were able to drive cost down below our goals but the uplift in productivity did not materialize. So today it \u2013 we've got about 240,000 acres, there's about 200 of it that will kind of expire over the next three years and there's some optionality there. But if you look at the macro environment today, if we got back to an NGL market, where we were late 2018 then there's definitely some things that would be economic but how does it compete in our portfolio is another question. And so that's why we made the decision we made today. Mike Scialla : Very good. Thank you. John Christmann : You bet. Thank you for the question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gail Nicholson with Stephens. Your line is open. Gail Nicholson : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Two things. One in Egypt, in my opinion the market still continues to discount the Egyptian asset, can you talk about the inventory running room that you guys have identified post the seismic analysis in Egypt? John Christmann : Yes Gail, what gets lost in the shuffle is you've got conventional rock what has the stratigraphic column and the aerial extent of greater than the Permian. We have over 6.2 million acres. I think with the new acreage that we've added and since 2016 and the new 3D that we're shooting, and then you look at our operational footprint, we have a very large business over there which gives us a nice backbone to kind of fill in off of. What I'm excited about is we used to be maybe six months of inventory. Today we see years of inventory and we've really high-graded some very interesting things that if they work could be game changers. And so we're very optimistic about where we are with Egypt and some of the things we've got on the drill schedule. They're off to a really good start. As we said in the prepared remarks it drove some really nice wells, Q4 and we've got some very interesting things to test. But it's Brent, the PSC really insulates you which is another nice factor as we mentioned today, we're going to be shifting a little more capital into Egypt. But I think it's through the productivity and the opportunity set that we've identified. And quite frankly, we just have a lot more inventory that's kind of drill-ready that we can prioritize and get after. Gail Nicholson : Great. Thank you. And then on Slide 13, you guys show the 4Q 2019 on operating cash margins. Just to clarify, does the Permian cash margin include Alpine? And if so, if you remove Alpine from that number what would be non-Alpine Permian cash margin be? John Christmann : And yes, it does include that. And in terms of with all the reorgan stuff we're doing, our numbers are going to be reported that way. So we didn't really want to break it out but Gary can probably get back with you on a follow-up or something and give you some insight. Gail Nicholson : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade of Johnson Rice & Company. Your line is open. Charles Meade : Good morning, John, you, your whole team there. John Christmann : Good morning, Charles. Charles Meade : I wanted to -- first off thanks for bringing -- or for giving us the detail on the Garten well. I believe that's slide 12 of your presentation there. And it looks like really stout rate. I wonder if you could just give us one discrete data point which is what would your net be off of that growth rate? Dave Pursell : Charles, this is David Pursell. That's 100%. We have that prospect we have well. Charles Meade : Got it. Got it. And -- thanks for that Dave. And then John there's been some discussion in the reports in the news media about I guess A&D opportunities in Egypt. And particularly in light of you guys reallocating some capital in that direction because of the attractiveness you see there what how would you characterize your appetite for more assets in Egypt? John Christmann : Well, I mean, what I would say Charles is that we don't typically comment on A&D activity. I think today with the plan we have and in the market where it is today you wouldn't see us coming out-of-pocket for something. But there's an asset base over there. We have a very nice footprint. And there might be a way to do something creativity-- on a creative side. Charles Meade : Okay. Thanks for that John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brian Singer : Thank you. Good morning. John Christmann : Good morning, Brian. Brian Singer : Moving back to Suriname you mentioned the fourth exploration test would be likely. Can you just talk about the timing for making that decision? And then what next steps would be from a rig and decision-making perspective for further exploratory testing? John Christmann : Well with the rig we've got today the Noble Sam Croft, we've got one well we've already exercised the option on and then there is another well we can drill. As I said it's very likely we will do that but we don't have to make that decision yet. And so it's an option we just haven't pulled the trigger on. But after -- if we were to elect that option which I said is likely you would -- we would finish the current well we're on we would drill the third well and then potentially the fourth well and then we will release the rig. And I'll just say that in the appraisal plan at Maka will come back with a different rig and a different time line when we're in a position that we can talk about that. Brian Singer : Great. Thanks. And then back to the North Sea when you kind of put together the recent well and Garten declined et cetera how do you expect your production trajectory for oil to look over the course of the year? John Christmann : It's going to be early. I mean the first quarter is going to be strong with Garten we delayed from Q4 into Q1. So it -- Garten 2 I think it's going to continue to be lumpy. We've got more wells to drill at Garten. We've got some other prospects that are interesting as we tie back. So North Sea is going to continue to be fairly lumpy based on when we bring these high rate wells on. Brian Singer : Great. Thank you. John Christmann : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Leo Mariani : Yeah. Hey, guys. I know it's a bit difficult to sort of know for sure. But I guess I was just looking to kind of get a high level time line in terms of when you guys might kind of finish drilling and then some of your analysis that you talked about on the Sapakara well. Is that kind of a roughly one month type of thing 45-day type of thing? Can you just give us maybe a high level in terms of when you might be able to give us a full suite of information on that? John Christmann : Yes, Leo as I said we don't typically like to comment on a well while it's drilling but we did learn our lesson in December at least to not to give you a little bit of an idea in terms of a comment so that's why we've said we're encouraged. We're through the Campanian we've got the Santonian to drill. And then after that we'll have some time to do the evaluation. So not also going to give you a definitive time line but we'll get to that as soon as we can after we TD the well. Leo Mariani : Got it. Understood. Okay. And I guess just with respect to the Permian seemed like you had some very strong wells in Lee County New Mexico that you guys had reported supplemental information. Just wanted to get a sense of what the depth of your inventory is in that general area there in New Mexico? Dave Pursell : Yes, Leo this is Dave Pursell. I think generally if you look at our unconventional inventory we have more activity in the Southern Midland Basin side than when you look at New Mexico in the Delaware Basin generally. But we have deep inventory across both basins. And as you look out we've -- we're just drilling a small fraction of our total footprint and we feel good about the long-term inventory depth both in the Southern Midland Basin and the Delaware Basin. Leo Mariani : Okay. So I guess a lot more inventory in Southern Midland versus New Mexico? Is that the way to interpret that? Dave Pursell : Yes, I would interpret it that way. Leo Mariani : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Arun Jayaram : Yeah. Good morning. John in Total's 4Q update they talked about a $2 per barrel kind of cost of acquisition. Presumably, you guys maybe approved that type of language. So I was wondering if there's any read through? I know that we're very, very early in the delineation appraisal of Suriname, but of -- sizes of potential discovered resource at this point, using that $2? John Christmann : I would just say that is the language they put in and how they characterized it. I mean, it -- I'll just leave it at that. Arun Jayaram : Got it, got it. Fair enough. And then, just maybe my follow-up, could you maybe elaborate, John, you talked about an appraisal plan that you'd be working on? What goes into that? And can we make any clues regarding when we could achieve first oil if your delineation efforts prove successful or the path forward to first oil? John Christmann : Arun, what I'll say is, there's -- the agreements with the concession terms lining out a time line that you have to follow. So, you have a discovery declaration. And then, we have a window where we have to submit the discovery notice. And then, we have a window where we have to submit the appraisal plan and then, the development process. So there's a time line that we're on there. And we're working through it expeditiously. And I think, the -- us and our partner will try to accelerate those things as quickly as we can, based on the results that you get from the appraisal program. Arun Jayaram : Okay. Thanks a lot, John. John Christmann : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities. Your line is open. Richard Tullis : Hey, thanks. Good morning everyone. John, given the lower CapEx budget that kind of fits the current times and the allocation for the Suriname activity, of course, any assets that you see in the portfolio that may slip into the -- maybe, the better to monetize category? John Christmann : Yes. I think, today, we look at the portfolio and we really like the balance. We've done a lot of that over the last couple of years. I mean, if you look at the, I'll call them, gas rich or gas heavy assets we divested in Canada, I'm very glad we got our SCOOP/STACK and our Mid-Continent sold last year. So, you look at the portfolio today, we're -- it's tight. We're in nice areas. There's always some small little things that we do from time to time, even within the Permian, either trades and swaps and acreage here and there that we're willing to monetize if people were interested. So, we're constantly looking at that. But I don't think there's anything that's big that we'd say, today, we need to move, or would move right now in this price environment. Richard Tullis : That's helpful, John. And just a follow-up. How many wells were drilled to date in the Alpine High? And how many of those wells are online currently? David Pursell : Yes, Richard. This is Dave Pursell. I don't have the exit numbers, but it's kind of in the low-200s that we've drilled and around 200 that are online. Richard Tullis : Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate it. That\u2019s all for me. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Your line is open. Neal Dingmann : Good morning, John and team. Congrats on bucking this disastrous energy trend right now. My first question is on your Permian, you all continue to do a great job of having one of the more stable plans that are in the play. And I'm just wondering, while I assume the change in oil prices probably won't impact your pace, I'm just wondering, John, will that have an impact on how you think about spacing some of these multi-zone developments? John Christmann : No. I mean, I think, the key for us was, we spent really -- 2016 and 2017, really very thoughtfully and methodically understanding how to develop and we got the pads early and really work through that work at that time. And so, what you've seen is, a very steady plan. I mean, we've got about nine months of rig activity just kind of lined out and it gives us the ability to work the infrastructure, do all the things we need to do ahead of that. So I don't see any changes in terms to our development approach. What we have the luxury of doing though, is backing off that capital, because it's short-cycle in nature. This is not something we have to drive forward in this price environment. So the only thing you might see, as we mentioned, the price is down where they are today, even below the range we talked about, you might see a little further slowdown, just because we had the luxury and can do that. I think it's also important to keep frac crews working and a couple of rigs working. So I'll call where we maintain our execution fitness and we continue to work on the continuous improvement to drive those results. But it's been all about getting the pads, doing the testing, looking at the long extended flow periods and really unlocking that, so we understand how the wells can perform, so you can really invest that capital as efficiently as possible. Neal Dingmann : Great details. And then, my second question, just on the North Sea. I'm just wondering -- maybe you've already said, but I'm just wondering about, well, your potentially the same amount of downtime and I think it's 3Q and then the plan to run -- continuously run the three rigs? John Christmann : Yes. I mean, I think, if you look today, we've had a platform rig running both at Barrel and 40s and we've had the Ocean Patriot. We will have the Ocean Patriot this year. We actually did an exploration arrangement, where we're getting carried on a couple of wells in the North Sea out there in the Barrel area which helps a little bit on the capital this year, but a similar program is what we would envision for 2020. And you do have your traditional maintenance season, which we usually get in the third quarter summer months when the weather gets a little better. Neal Dingmann : So that will just be the typical maintenance you think, John? John Christmann : Yes. And then really weather. I mean, it was weather is what kind of drove us to have to wait to bring Garten-2 on. So you came out of maintenance turnaround, and then we got into some pretty rough weather in the fourth quarter and that was what kind of had us kick some things back. Neal Dingmann : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Your line is open. Jeanine Wai : Hi. Good morning everyone. John Christmann : Good morning. Jeanine Wai : Good morning. My first question is on maintenance CapEx, maintenance mode. At the 2020 CapEx budget level, you're around maintenance mode at the low end I believe. And so looking forward to 2021, are you able to maintain flat year-over-year production at a similar $1.6 billion CapEx budget? Or are there some one-offs this year that are kind of driving that number lower? So, I guess, what I'm getting at is that next year there could be some incremental cash flow from Altus with the pipelines, so that can help fund Suriname CapEx? Steve Riney : Yeah, Jeanine, this is Steve. So I think the first thing we got to do is there's a lot of people out there like to talk about maintenance capital and lots of uses of that terminology. And I think we like to think about things like that in a purist way, and so we need to be clear what we're talking about. For us maintenance capital, means, we maintain all the volumes and we pay the dividend, but not necessarily any free cash flow creation. It's equally important that you look at how those definitions vary over a time frame. You're going to have a maintenance capital, some people think of maintenance capital as well it's just the next year. And the next year that's one of those cases of well, how long can you hold your breath. And maintenance capital for a year can be pretty darn low. We like to think of maintenance capital at least in a five-year to 10-year time frame and so that includes ongoing asset integrity spend and that includes spending on inventory progression so that you can maintain production over that five-year to 10-year period. But you can also think of maintenance capital over a longer-term 20-plus years, and then you need to start introducing exploration spend as well. And so we don't bother with the one-year definition, because we don't want to test how long we can hold our breath. We just wouldn't bother with a one-year maintenance -- maintenance spend program. In the five-year to 10-year time frame, we've been pretty consistent for the last five years saying, we're somewhere around $45 WTI. We can pay the dividend, maintain oil production volume with no free cash flow retention. And is it 44%, is it 46%? It's somewhere around the $45 WTI range. It's been there for a number of years now. If you go to the 20-year plus definition, that's probably in the $48 WTI range. That gives us enough money to spend on exploration like we're doing now and we've specifically budgeted for 2020 $200 million of exploration capital. And so that's the way we like to think of it. Another way to think of it for us is that if you're in a $50 to $55 world for the long-term, for the next several years, we can continue to fund the dividend, we can fund some cash to pay down debt as we are talking about, we can sustain oil production volume or grow it slowly over that four-year period, and we can fund Suriname to First Oil. And I think that's an interesting way to be thinking about maintenance capital as well. And, of course, success in Suriname is going to significantly lower that maintenance capital level on WTI prices, because of the structure of the capital carry that we have in our joint venture agreement with Total. So you get out a few years from now that maintenance capital falls way below that $45 to $48 WTI price environment, because of that capital carry. In terms of specifically looking at -- there are a lot of different ways you can look at what we've talked about for 2020. If you go to the $1.6 billion capital range, the low end of our range, that's contemplating a $46 to $47 WTI price. It means, we still pay the dividend and we fund the $200 million of exploration spend out of that $1.6 billion, and we're probably sustaining production volume at that level pretty flat for 2020 year-over-year. At the high end, the $1.9 billion capital, you're probably in the $53 to $55 range. You're paying the dividend and spending $200 million on exploration. You're retaining $150 million to $200 million of free cash flow for future debt pay down. And in that case you're growing oil production in the low to mid single-digits for 2020. That's a long-winded answer, but I hope that ticks all the boxes for you. Jeanine Wai : Oh no, I think, I definitely appreciate all the detail there. That's very helpful to know how you're thinking about it. Maybe just a short follow-up on that, following up on some of the other questions and some of the things that you just mentioned. You said potentially earlier in the call about accelerating the development process in Suriname if you had the opportunity to do so. So what are the key -- what of the governors are facing kind of medium-term Suriname CapEx. You mentioned prioritizing Suriname. It sounds like from what you just said, you're committed to funding Suriname out of free cash flow. We have seen prior precedents, where folks try to pre-fund big major capital projects like this with asset sales. So I just wanted to clarify whether you're committed to funding Suriname out of free cash flow? Or a combination of free cash flow plus any sale proceeds? Steve Riney : Yeah, Jeanine. So number one, hopefully I didn't say anything earlier that would lead anyone to the conclusion that we're trying to accelerate development in Suriname. I think, it'll take its proper pace and that's what it will be between us and our partner as we agreed to that. So in terms of funding the activity in Suriname, first of all by our joint venture agreement with Total, it should be clear we were willing to spend 50/50 heads up on exploration, because we are very excited about the exploration opportunities in Suriname and we believe obviously that they'll continue to be successful. When you get into appraisal and development and that's where the capital carry kicks in and starting with appraisal of Maka and any development spend that might come from that and appraisal from any further exploration successes, the $0.875 of every $1 will be spent by Total and $0.125 by Apache. And so we intend to fund any of that for the next four years out of operating cash flow. We don't think we'll have any problem doing that. If we have a problem doing that that means we're doing a heck of a lot of appraisal in development and that would be a great problem to have. Jeanine Wai : Okay, great. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Out next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is open. Scott Gruber : Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. John Christmann : You bet. Scott Gruber : So turning to the cost out program, how should we think about the $150 million roughly splitting between overhead and ops? And do you think you'll be able to achieve the full run rate of savings by year-end? John Christmann : I think at a run rate base, we'll be able to get there. I mean, lion share of that is likely going to come out of the overhead piece but we're well on our way and working through that and we should be able to get to that type of run rate later this year. Scott Gruber : Got it. And then you took some upfront charges associated with the program in 4Q. How do you think about upfront charges they potentially hit in 2020 as you restructure the business? Steve Riney : Yeah, we'll obviously be taking the one-off costs associated with that. We'll be recognizing those on a quarterly basis. We did recognize some of that I think the number was $28 million in the fourth quarter, out of the $33 million that were in that one line item on our P&L. And we haven't put out an estimate of the total cost but we'll probably do that as we go through the next few quarters. Scott Gruber : Okay, that\u2019s it from me. Thank you. John Christmann : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum with Cowen. Your line is open. David Deckelbaum : Good morning guys, and nice job and nice update. Thanks for the time. I just wanted to ask you, you outlined what the cost guidance was in the first quarter just in terms of your margins, as I guess the year progresses here and you have growth coming from several other areas and Alpine High declining, how do you look at those cash costs I guess on LOE and GP&T by the fourth quarter of 2020 relative to that $825 million and $75 million in the first quarter? Steve Riney : Yeah, David, we intentionally just gave one-quarter of guidance on that, and I'd prefer not to get into any more than that at this point in time. We'll give more guidance as we go through the year as we get more clarity on what those costs are going to be given the ongoing cost focus program and the pace of change of that program. So let us do that as we go through the next few quarters. David Deckelbaum : Sure. I'll be patient, but appreciate it. If I could ask I guess secondarily to the other adding on to that. What are you all assuming I guess for the annualized decline out of Alpine High? And those total volumes that you have in the U.S. that are only down slightly on an annualized basis? Dave Pursell : Yeah. So this is Dave Pursell. When you think about Alpine, we're not adding any completions this year. So you're going to see effectively the unconventional blowdown. So you'll have a steep decline in the first year and then every year after that the decline will moderate. So think about something in the -- on an annual basis in the mid-30% for the first year and then it will moderate in the -- in years two, three and four. David Deckelbaum : Got it. Thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotia. Your line is open. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Good morning. Two questions. On the $150 million on the restructuring do you -- restructuring saving, do you have a rough estimate between how much is on the P&L side and how much in the capital cost? Steve Riney : No, we don't have an estimate of that at this point in time. Paul Cheng : Okay. On the -- on Permian in 2020, you're going to be five to six rigs. Do you have a split between the Midland and Delaware Basin? Dave Pursell : Yes, Paul, this is David Pursell. On a -- if you think about it in terms of gross completions, it's about 60% Southern Midland Basin and 40% on the Delaware side. Paul Cheng : Okay. A final one for me. North Sea if we look at your portfolio say over the next five years I mean Suriname is very exciting and Egypt looked like you guys have some high hopes. And look like North Sea is probably not necessarily going to receive a no capital attention from that standpoint. So, should we look at North Sea say five years from now you're still consider as a core part of your long-term portfolio? Or that you may need to be revisiting that? John Christmann : And I think today if you look at what we're doing in the North Sea, I'm quite proud. I mean we can look out and have three years of pretty stable production between the two. The volumes at barrel are lumpy as we're bringing on subsea tiebacks into our kind of our infrastructure there. 40s is all about the water management program and flattening that decline and managing our cost side. So, I think today we look out and quite frankly we've made a lot of progress over the last three to four years on North Sea and the outlook for the next several years looks as good as it's looked from a planning perspective as I've seen in a while. Paul Cheng : Okay. But I mean are you going to put more capital into that? Or that the essentially has seen some one of the maintenance mode? John Christmann : I mean we're definitely spending capital. In terms of is it an area we're going to go out and try to consolidate and buy more properties and add that no. But I think we've got a lot of left -- life left in these assets and there's a lot we can do on the cost side. And Steve you'd something you want to add? Steve Riney : Yes, I'd just requote that famous quote of \"rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated\" when it comes to the North Sea. In 2003, when Apache bought the North Sea assets the 40s field it was scheduled for abandonment in 2012. Today, it's scheduled for abandonment in the 2030s and that keeps moving out. So, there's a lot to do in the North Sea. And I wouldn't worry too much about the next three to five years. Paul Cheng : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy. Michael Hall : Thanks. A lot's been addressed. I guess I just want to kind of circle back to the comment in the prepared remarks around just the longer-dated growth outlook being moderated as you're trying to bring Suriname on? Is It right then to just think about basically what we're seeing with the 2020 program is basically what we should hold flat until we think about Suriname coming on? And basically the businesses are in maintenance mode. And with that you can then fund the work that's required to bring Suriname to fruition? Is that the right way to think about it big picture? John Christmann : Michael, it's really going to depend on what the prices do in between because we gave a range on the capital at $1.6 billion you're closer to that mode at $1.9 billion. We're going to show a little bit of growth. And so and quite frankly if we need to go lower we will. And if we needed to let things move down a hair we are not afraid to do that because we're going to prioritize paying the dividend funding Suriname and paying down some debt. So, we're very comfortable with where we are. We've got a differential asset base. We've got lower decline rates because of the conventional assets in a lot of our areas. And so we feel very comfortable with kind of where we are over the next three to five years with that. Steve Riney : Yes. I just Michael I'll just add -- this is Steve just going back to the comments I just made a few minutes ago. For the next several years at $50 to $55, which other than today people have been generally talking about that's kind of the right price environment, should be posting on with all recognition appropriate recognition of where prices are today and where they're headed. At $50 to $55 we can do all of those things John just talked about. We can pay the dividend. We can fund Suriname to First Oil. We can retain enough free cash flow to pay down debt the $937 million of debt that will mature over the next four years. And we can sustain or even grow. You get to the $55 price environment -- we can grow oil production slightly over that time period. Michael Hall : Okay, that's helpful. And that's kind of contemplating like a similar four-well per year type exploration program. Is that reasonable? Dave Pursell : Well that's just that's assuming $200 million a year spent on exploration. Michael Hall : Okay. And then on a more near-term basis just kind of curious on the kind of cadence I guess in the Permian on the oil program there. I mean is it basically just flat all year? Or is there a low point that we ought to be considering in the 2Q, 3Q timeframe before you kind of bring things back up in the back of the year? Just curious. John Christmann : No, it's a steady program, right? So we've got our unconventional program growing and we've got some of the CBP and some of those things slightly declining. So \u2013 but it's a pretty steady program. That's the one thing. If you go back to mid-2017, we've been real steady with the program and as a result it puts us in a pretty even cadence. Michael Hall : Great. That's helpful. Appreciate it guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Silverstein with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Josh Silverstein : Two quick questions for you guys on Suriname here. On the Maka well you mentioned that the \u2013 I guess, the joint design wasn't to optimally place the well in the thicker zones there. I was wondering if that was the same thing at Sapakara? Or if you guys are trying to target somewhat differently there? John Christmann : Yeah I would just say, Josh, it's a function of \u2013 you've got your seismic ties and you're working in. This was really our -- Maka was our first well and two Block 58. And so you learn things as you go. And what we've got is we have multiple stack targets in there and we lined it up to kind of drill what we thought would be optimal on the few of them and we kind of validated that. So just \u2013 so \u2013 just the point was had we moved over we would have probably had a different number in terms of net fee to pay and so forth. And \u2013 but you learn that and that's what the appraisal programs will tell you as you start to work through any potential discovery that you have. Josh Silverstein : Got it. Thanks for that. And then maybe, we haven't talked much about the rest of Suriname and obviously Block 53 is a smaller working interest I think you're at 45%. But let's just say you guys have additional success in the second third and fourth wells on Block 58. Any reason why you guys wouldn't go and test Block 53 next year as part of the exploration program? John Christmann : No. And we'll have a decision to make on Block 53. We have a 45% working interest in there with our two partners and we do believe there's potential in Block 53 and it's something we'll talk about in the future. Operator : Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions. I will now turn the call over to John Christmann for closing remarks. John Christmann : Thank you for joining us on our call this morning. In closing, I'd like to leave you with these final thoughts. If you look at Apache today we have a diversified portfolio and are able to shift capital as appropriate for the commodity price environment. We are foregoing short-cycle near-term growth and prioritizing long-term returns, sustaining the dividend and debt paydown. Guyana Suriname is proving to be a super basin where we hold an anchor block with a world-class partner and have created an advantageous capital structure for appraisal and development. We're encouraged by what we have seen so far in our second well and we have a third and likely fourth well to follow in 2020. We look forward to sharing more information in the future. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants\u2019 lines are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Gary Clark : Good morning and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation\u2019s First Quarter Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. We will begin the call with an overview by; CEO and President, John Christmann; Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO will then summarize our first quarter financial performance; Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President of Development, Planning, Reserves and Fundamentals will also be available on the call to answer questions. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 15 minutes in lengths with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday\u2019s press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our first quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today\u2019s call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. Finally, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John. John Christmann : Good morning and thank you for joining us. As we review our first quarter results today, many Apache employees around the world are continuing to work remotely as part of our COVID-19 response. I would like to wish all of them and those of you, who are doing the same good health as we worked through a very trying time. I also want to acknowledge and thank the Apache team for their dedication and hard work in the face of a very challenging economic and operational environment. They are successfully and safely delivering day-to-day business activities in the face of a sudden and unprecedented change to life as we knew it. My heartfelt appreciation goes out to every one of our great Apache employees and contractors as well as our partners and stakeholders. The global economy and the energy industry have been deeply impacted by COVID-19. as we navigate this crisis, Apache\u2019s primary priorities are keeping the health and safety of our employees and the communities, in which we operate paramount in our decision-making and preserving the inherent value and optionality of our diverse asset base for the long-term. Thus far, our efforts have been successful, and we\u2019re very fortunate to have seen only a few isolated COVID-19 cases throughout the organization. We acted quickly to close offices and implement work from home processes as well as stringent operational protocols in the field. We also have in place contingency plans to ensure continuity in the event Apache incurs a more widespread or sustained impact. In the rest of my prepared remarks, I will discuss the primary actions we are taking to preserve the value of our assets and protect our balance sheet. Summarize our long-term objectives, which have not changed, and lastly, comment on our outlook for the remainder of 2020. While the current crisis is much more severe and complex, some key lessons learned from the 2014 oil price collapse are informing the decisions we are making today. In late February, we communicated our initial 2020 budget at an assumed WTI oil price of $50 per barrel. This seemed appropriate given prevailing supply and demand fundamentals and strip pricing at the time. In early March, OPEC+ failed to reach consensus on supply cuts and it became apparent that COVID-19 would cause an unprecedented amount of demand destruction. Apache responded to the old price drop associated with these events quickly and decisively. On March 12, we announced a plan to reduce activity in Egypt and the North Sea and to eliminate all U.S. drilling and completion activity. This resulted in a $650 million decrease in our 2020 upstream capital budget, which is now down nearly 55% from 2019. We also announced a 90% reduction to our dividend that\u2019s preserving $340 million of cash flow on an annualized basis and strengthening our liquidity. To protect cash flow from further downside price dislocation, we entered into substantial oil hedge positions primarily for the second and third quarters, which we believe have the most volatility risk. We implemented deeper cost cutting measures announcing on April 1, an increase in our estimated annualized cost savings to $300 million, up from $150 million a month earlier. Apache benefited from the significant progress already made on our organizational redesign, which commenced in the third quarter of 2019. This enabled us to make the incremental cost reduction decisions confidently without compromising safety, asset integrity or our ability to resume activity when warranted. Finally, we have conducted a thorough price sensitivity analysis and operational evaluation of oil producing wells across the company, which is now informing the methodical and integrated approach we are taking to rolling production shut-ins and curtailments. This process will enable us to preserve cash flow in this distressed and vulnerable price environment and protect our assets. All of these actions were carefully planned and none were taken lightly. While very difficult, they were necessary to preserve liquidity and ensure ample runway to return to a more sustainable and profitable price environment. Next, I would like to reiterate our longer-term objectives, which still hold true despite some of the short-term impacts of the current situation. First, Apache will budget conservatively, aggressively manage our cost structure to ensure free cash flow generation and prioritize debt reduction to strengthen our balance sheet. We will maintain a balanced and diversified portfolio, and continue to invest for long-term returns rather than production growth. In the Permian, we will continue building economic inventory and maintain optionality, and in Egypt and the North Sea, we will flex activity to preserve free cash flow generation. Lastly, we will continue to enhance our portfolio through exploration. Our recent success, offshore Suriname is a prime example of this strategy and Block 58 remains a clear priority for Apache. As we look to the remainder of 2020, there are a number of fundamental uncertainties. The most important of these is the timing and magnitude of a recovery in demand for oil is supply response alone cannot solve this problem in the short-term. For Apache, the best course of action is to aggressively reduce our cost structure, protect our balance sheet, and manage operations to preserve cash flow. Our diversified global portfolio gives us the ability to optimize capital allocations as market conditions change. Just as we did following the oil price crash in 2014, we have left intact a higher proportion of international capital investment, which offers better returns than the U.S. in a lower price environment. To wrap up, Apache is taking the necessary steps to manage cash flow and protect our balance sheet. We have ample liquidity and a long runway to carry us through to a better price environment, and will maintain the flexibility and capacity to increase activity in a thoughtful manner as conditions warrant. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney, who will provide additional details on our first quarter in 2020 outlook. Steve Riney : Thank you, John. My remarks this morning will provide a few more details on first quarter 2020 results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. I will also comment on the strength of Apache\u2019s liquidity position, which is more than sufficient to bridge this significant and potentially prolonged downturn. As noted in our news release issued yesterday, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Apache reported a first quarter 2020 consolidated net loss of $4.5 billion or $11.86 per diluted common share. These results include items that are outside of core earnings, the most significant of which are non-cash impairments totaling $4.5 billion. Impairments were driven primarily by the impact of weak oil prices on the carrying value of our proved properties. Most of these impairments were in legacy vertical developments in the Permian basin, excluding these and other smaller items adjusted earnings for the quarter were a loss of $51 million or $0.13 per share. G&A expense in the quarter was $68 million, which was considerably below our guidance of $120 million. Some of our stock award programs are cash settled and each quarter accounting rules require us to mark-to-market the accrued liability for these awards based on changes in our share price. Typically, this has not been material, but it resulted in more than a $30 million reduction in G&A expense for the first quarter due to the significant drop in the share price during the quarter. Capital investment and operating costs in first quarter were also below guidance, as a result of the spending reduction efforts we have instituted as. As with G&A costs, there will be more significant impacts in future quarters. Apache\u2019s adjusted production for the quarter was below our most recent guidance; reported gas production in the Permian basin was materially impacted by commercial arrangements at some gas processing plants, where the operator takes volume in kind as reimbursement for power costs. In lower gas environments like in the first quarter, the impact on reported volumes can be significant; in this case, approximately 24 million cubic feet per day. Permian oil volumes were also below guidance caused by the rapid reduction in activity due to the oil price downturn. As we look to the remainder of 2020, our full-year upstream capital investment program will be around $1.1 billion, approximately 60% of which will be in our international businesses. For the second quarter, upstream capital investment will be approximately $230 million, a sharp reduction from the first quarter. With respect to other typical guidance items, there are many uncertainties on a forward-looking basis. As such, we are not providing second quarter guidance and we are removing the full-year 2020 guidance, which we provided in February. In terms of production volumes, we are in the process of implementing a shut-in and curtailment program, which is already impacting second quarter volumes. The size and duration of this program will depend on many factors and is therefore difficult to forecast at this time. In closing, I would like to touch on our substantial liquidity position, our efforts to protect that position and how we will put it to use. When this downturn began, we quickly implemented actions to match spending reductions with the deteriorating oil price environment. As a result of those actions, Apache can achieve free cash flow neutrality for all of 2020 at an average WTI oil price in the low-30s. The original plan for 2020 required a WTI oil price closer to $50. Our goal is to achieve cash flow neutrality in order to minimize drawing on liquidity to fund our day-to-day operations. We entered this downturn with a tremendous liquidity backstop. We have a $4 billion revolving credit facility, which matures in March 2024 with a one-year extension option. Following our credit downgrade by S&P, we posted letters of credit for North Sea abandonment obligations utilizing a sublimit in the credit facilities specifically established for such purposes. This currently reduces the availability on the credit facility by $800 million. In terms of debt, one of our key financial goals for the year was to generate free cash flow to reduce leverage through debt repurchases. This remains a longer-term priority that is more challenging for the near-term given the price environment. Over the last two years, we eliminated $1.6 billion of debt in the near-term maturity window through paydown and refinancing efforts, leaving only $937 million of bond maturities over the next three years. Absent refinancing or retaining free cash flow to retire these bonds, we\u2019ll use the revolver to pay them down. Conservatively, assuming all three years of debt maturities go on the revolver, we would still have $2.3 billion of remaining liquidity to manage through this downturn. In summary, we have taken significant and decisive actions to preserve liquidity, protect the balance sheet, and retain asset value for the future. These recent steps combined with those of the last few years give us sufficient capacity to bridge to a more sustainable and profitable price environment. And with that, I will turn the call back to John for some closing remarks. John Christmann : Before we go to Q&A, I\u2019d like to make a few comments regarding the durability of our production base in a reduced spending environment. As planned 2020 capital investment levels, our adjusted international production should be roughly sustainable from 2019 to 2020 on an exit rate basis. Assuming no material curtailments were shut-ins. In the Permian, where we have eliminated activity for the remainder of the year, the unknown magnitude, timing and duration of our curtailment and shut-in program makes it premature to provide a high confidence near-term outlook. I would note, however, approximately one-third of our Permian oil production comes from legacy vertical wells that have a base decline rate of around 10%, hits are over all Permian oil decline rate is significantly [Technical Difficulty] basin average. As we look ahead to 2021, our Permian decline rates will moderate and the capital investment required to sustain year-over-year production volumes will fall significantly. We will provide more details around future production as price volatility recedes and we have more visibility. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Bob Brackett from Bernstein Research. Your line is open. Bob Brackett : Hi, good morning, guys. I appreciate that you can\u2019t talk in great specificity around the trajectory for Permian production, but can you kind of frame it in terms of what it could look like if you split out the legacy vertical versus kind of the shale? I mean just very wide goalposts as it were. John Christmann : I mean, Bob, hope things are going well. I\u2019d say in general, we\u2019ve got two pieces there, and our conventional is a third of our oil production in the Permian. And as I said there at the end, it\u2019s got kind of a 10% decline rate. The other two-thirds is unconventional, and I will say that we have been running a pretty flat pace. If anything, we moderated our activity pace in 2019. It was down from 2018. So, we\u2019re going to be at a little lower unconventional decline rate, just because of the pace relative to our percentage as compared to most. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color on that. Bob Brackett : And on that legacy vertical, are there any \u2013 what\u2019s the inventory of wells that have just gotten to the point, where they\u2019re not economic in sort of a two to three year recovery window? When would you abandon those? Or do you just not have that many in the portfolio? John Christmann : Yes, I think, and I\u2019m going to let Dave talk a few minutes on the process we\u2019ve gone through on the shut-ins, because it\u2019s something I\u2019m \u2013 we\u2019ve really put some time and effort into. But I think the important thing to know is, is that we\u2019ve taken a very, very methodical approach. I think we\u2019ve shut-in around 2,500 wells produce an average of about three barrels a day and about 150 barrels of water a day. We\u2019ve done this in a way that we can kind of roll the wells and preserve the asset integrity. So, we feel pretty good about being able to bring those back, cost structures coming down. But we\u2019re going to manage near-term for free cash flow and we think shut-in as long as it makes sense, but they wanted to give some color and climb maybe on the shut-in process that we\u2019ve gone through. Dave Pursell : Sure. Thanks, John and Bob, thanks for the question. And Clay, will jump in here in a second. But as John said, it\u2019s a pretty robust process and it involves operations. It involves our production and reservoir engineers, our land team to understand the lease obligations, marketing to understand existing contracts and then our planning group and asset teams to really stress some of the economic parameters on the wells. John gave you some numbers on wells that are currently shut-in. We would anticipate as we go through May and into June those numbers likely increase, but you can see the kind of wells that were shutting in. There\u2019s another bucket of wells is that when they break we\u2019re opting not to fix them, and we\u2019ve dropped our work over rig count by 80% since the beginning of the year and really tightened up the economic criteria in this market for those to justify working those wells over. And so the bucket that John talked about, most of those wells are wells that were overtly shut-in, but some of those are wells that we\u2019ve opted not to repair. I think when you think about it, would any of these wells be permanently shut-in that that\u2019s a function of longer-term price, but because we have a methodical process, because we have a reservoir production facility engineers involved in the process. We\u2019re shutting these wells in, with the anticipation that they\u2019ll ultimately be brought back online. So, we\u2019re doing the right kind of chemical treatments before we shut them in and Clay can talk about that in a second. Some of the other considerations when you\u2019re thinking about the economics here, wells that produce a little more gas than others, like to get a benefit in today\u2019s gas market. And then when we think about our Permian exposure, we have some marketing agreements where a meaningful percentage of our Permian production goes to Corpus on the Epic pipe and are exposed to Brent link pricing. So, we have a number of considerations there. And finally from me, the other thing that we\u2019re doing our subsurface teams of engineers and geologists have taken this opportunity to do some interference testing and some of our unconventional plays as we\u2019re defining some production, we found historically that interference testing is one of the best ways to really understand well spacing and well placement in these three dimensional and conventional plays. We\u2019re doing some of that starting imminently and again, we feel very confident that when things get better, we\u2019re going to come out of this, a whole lot smarter than we were going into it. I had probably longer answered than you wanted, but I\u2019m going pass it over to Clay to add some color. Clay Bretches : Yes. sure, Dave. This is Clay Bretches and let me pile on a little bit with what Dave was saying and actually, add some color. Dave was talking about the shut-in wells and the reduction in work over activity and that is all true and that\u2019s all something that, it was temporary until we bring those wells back on. In the meantime, while we do that, we have to make sure that we focus on preservation and so we make sure that we preserve and pickle the wells to reduce as much corrosion as possible. We also have to preserve the surface facilities and make sure that our tanks are preserved properly or rotating equipment is preserved so that when we do come back and flip that switch and it\u2019s time to produce again, all of that production can come back on. And one of the things that we talked about, and John has alluded to this many times, a lot times in shut-in wells, especially for a long period of time, you have a lot of surprises when you turn them back on. Some of them are good and some of them are bad. The bad side and what can happen is you can end up with a lot of corrosion if you have not done everything in your power to make sure that you preserve those when you set them in. So, we\u2019re taking great pains to make sure that preservation is going correctly. The next I wanted to talk about is cost structure. And in the opening remarks, John mentioned that we\u2019re looking at a $300 million reduction, which is up two-fold from the $150 million that we had now announced a month earlier. And so I want to give some color on that, because most of this is permanent cost reduction and a change of the cost structure. You heard Steve talk about how we could operate as we go forward from what, prior to this great reduction in oil prices, it was a $50 oil world. We can go now to a $30 per barrel oil world. And so a lot of this has to do with the initiatives that we were already engaged in, about $150 million worth, which was announced after the end of the year. $150 million was largely G&A associated with our headquarters functions and with our various technical functions, in our offices, in our Houston, and Cairo and Aberdeen, Midland offices. But with the reduction in oil price, we had to take a lot of action to find other permanent cost reductions, and we did. So, what we see now are these permanent cost reductions, a lot of that has to do with field employee reductions, contractor reductions in the field, a lot of supply chain initiatives. Our supply chain group has been doing a great deal of work in order to get new contracts. And these contracts are more long lived than what we believe to be, hey, this temporary reduction in prices. And so we\u2019ve been able to get some really good contracts, renegotiate those contracts and take advantage of the price environment that we\u2019re in right now. And then the last thing I would mention, and I think this is really, really important, because this is a bottoms-up approach, but we went to our offshore installation managers, we went to our area operations managers in the field and the onshore, and we asked them for their initiatives, and how they could reduce costs? And how they can reduce costs in a meaningful way. And it was a very thoughtful process and a lot of work has been done to identify areas, where we can reduce costs, whether it means reducing redundant activities, reducing field offices automating processes that heretofore were more manual in nature. Those are the actions that we\u2019re taking, and it\u2019s led to this significant increase in these permanent cost reductions that we\u2019re now pushing up to $300 million plus. So, I\u2019ll turn it back over to John. John Christmann : I appreciate that long thorough response. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Your line is open. Charles Meade : Good morning, John to you and your whole team there. John Christmann : Good morning, Charles. Charles Meade : Yes. I appreciate that you guys probably aren\u2019t \u2013 won\u2019t, don\u2019t want to speak about this. And don\u2019t laugh at my pronunciation of the Kwaskwasi. I think that the one that\u2019s currently drilling, but I wondered if you could \u2013 if there\u2019s anything that you could \u2013 that you could offer about maybe, what you guys have continued to learn from your first two discoveries there offshore, Suriname, Maka and Sapakara West as you continue to analyze the \u2013 whether it be the course or the fluid samples or whatever else you might care to share. John Christmann : Charles, thanks for the question. We remain very excited about turn-on. I think most importantly now that we\u2019re two for two on both Maka and Sapakara from the wells, and actually, two for two in both the Campanian and the Santonian formations. We\u2019ve proven, we\u2019ve got an active hydrocarbon system. It\u2019s the oil, with some gas condensate in some of the shower, campaigning zones in both Sapakara and Maka. But we\u2019re very excited. You look at the distance between the wells are separate features. We\u2019re now drilling Kwaskwasi is, you mentioned it is another separate feature. It\u2019s actually in between the two. And then we will be moving back to Kwaskwasi for the fourth well, which is on the other side of Sapakara. So, I think it just shows, there\u2019s not just one feature out there, we\u2019ve got 1.44 million acres, the block is highly prospective. We\u2019re only in two of water now, eight play types when things were going very well. So, we\u2019re excited about, what\u2019s in front of us. We\u2019re currently working the plans with our partner, total on the appraisal program for Maka. We\u2019re due to submit that to the government of Suriname later this month, which we will do. So, we\u2019re anxious to kind of push forward there. We\u2019re also working on the plans at Sapakara and it\u2019ll fall sometime later this summer. So, we\u2019re very encouraged. Things remain kind of on track and it was turning out to be everything that we hoped it could be. So, a very strong petroleum hydrocarbon system has got a long charge, that\u2019s got locked charged. Charles Meade : Got it. Thanks. Thanks for all that detail, John. And then going back to your prepared comments, you guys just gave a really lengthy and detailed answer about these the shut-ins, but I just want to clarify something. When you talked about the rolling curtailments in your prepared comments, was that specific just to these 2,500 vertical Permian wells or is that also happening in other parts of your portfolio, whether it be horizontal Permian or international? John Christmann : I mean, I think today Charles, we have around 2,500 wells shut-in all of the fields are going to be handled in a rolling way, and/or they\u2019re going to be pickled and done very methodically. So, we\u2019re working through that based on what we think is the best way to operate those. And so it\u2019s a very methodical approach. As Dave mentioned, one of the things we\u2019re also doing is, we\u2019ve really thought through what data we can collect and how we can do it. I mean, you don\u2019t have the luxury when you\u2019re running a program sometimes of taking the time and doing the interference tests and the things that really help you understand spacing, and pattern alignment and so forth on the unconventional side. So, as Dave mentioned that as we get into June, the numbers going to grow a little bit. But a lot of the may stuff\u2019s kind of already cast, but we\u2019re taking a very bottoms-up, a very detailed approach and it will be designed to protect the wells and also learn as much as we can, because I think that\u2019ll help drive our capital efficiency when we do kind of get back to work. Charles Meade : Thank you, John. John Christmann : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Your line is open. Doug Leggate : Excuse me. Thank you. Good morning everybody. Hope everyone\u2019s doing well out there. John I got a couple of follow-ups I guess to \u2013 maybe I\u2019ll kick off with Suriname. Your \u2013 my understanding is, you\u2019ve got 120 days from when you disclose the discovery to the governments that I would preview actually by right around now. So, I\u2019m interested to know are we really end of the month, are we eminent? And can you give us some scope as to what you\u2019re looking to do in the appraisal plan in terms of drilling or further interpretation of seismic or whatever that might look like? John Christmann : Yes. actually, we\u2019ve got the \u2013 the obligations are, we have 24 hours to make a discovery notice. And then we have 30 days to submit the official discovery report and then that clock starts. So, we actually are going to be the end of this month, Doug, when we \u2013 when we do submit the first plant. So, there\u2019s actually the 30-day window between discovery and the official discovery notice is probably the 30-days that you\u2019re missing in there. Yes, our partner and us are both continuing to do lots of things. As you know, with now two penetrations down on the seismic, there\u2019s a lot of work we\u2019re doing, which I think will be informative, a lot of reprocessing and things and will continue to do throughout the process. And really that some of the work we\u2019re putting into the appraisal program is, how we design it to gain as much information as we need to make the proper decision. So, we\u2019ll be in a position to submit something later this month to the government. And then they\u2019ve got a 30-day period of respond back to us. So, it\u2019s all systems go. Doug Leggate : Well, thank you for closing the gap for me. The 30 days I wasn\u2019t deed missing, but I guess if I could just try to, a little bit on this overview, at least is that you\u2019re sitting on the depositional center here. Can you at least give us some idea of what the feature looks like relative to what we\u2019ve seen next door? Because, I think there\u2019s still some debate as to whether, there\u2019s a viable development here. Is there anything, any color you can offer in that? Now, get on to the\u2026 John Christmann : Yes. I would just say that the features are very large as always said. That\u2019s why we\u2019re working on the appraisal plans on how we want to appraise them. But the nice thing is they\u2019re large and you\u2019ve got obviously stacked pays, both that we\u2019ve already discovered thus far in both the Campanian and the Santonian. So, it\u2019s not disappointing in any way on that front and we\u2019re excited about it. Doug Leggate : My last one, if I may, is just changing geographies completely to Egypt. And one of the things that I guess continues to not get a lot of attention is the extraordinary expiration success rate you\u2019re having there, 94%. I guess this last \u2013 last quarter run. Can you just walk us through what the go forward plan is in this lower oil price environment? And it may actually be a question for Steve, because I\u2019m really interested to know how the PSC allows you to hold up your volumes in this very low oil price environment in the context of cost recovery barrel, legacy cost recovery entitlements that you have. So, any kind of column in the go-forward plan on the volume support you can get to the PSC would be helpful. Thanks. John Christmann : Well, Doug thanks for noticing Egypt. Yes, we\u2019re \u2013 you\u2019re look at that program, I think what you\u2019re saying is the early fruit from the acreage we picked up, the seismic we shot; we spent the last several years. In fact, we\u2019re still shooting a very, very large acreage. We reshot a lot of our old existing seismic, the price \u2013 the previous shoot was done I think in 2013. So, a lot to change on that front and you\u2019re seeing the fruits with some of the discoveries that we\u2019ve announced this year, or we have infrastructure and tie in. We have some very, very impactful targets yet to drill that we\u2019re excited about this year on the exploration front. And so what you\u2019re saying is we\u2019ve migrated the capital, we\u2019ve ratcheted back a little bit in Egypt. It\u2019s the area we\u2019ve ratcheted back the least though, as we said on the international side. It\u2019s also an area that we\u2019ll want to put capital in, kind of first as you start to put capital back, because we\u2019ve \u2013 just it\u2019s what you\u2019ve got is you\u2019ve got six million acres, you\u2019ve got multiple basins and the difference between it and an area like the Permian, you\u2019ve got as much stack pay, but you\u2019ve got conventional rock. And so that\u2019s what differentiates it. The second thing I\u2019ll say, and Steve may want to add some color, but these PSCs were designed and created in a much, much lower price environment. And so the way they work, things work very well in the price environment we\u2019re at today. And so that\u2019s how and that\u2019s why Egypt continues to be an area that we can lean on. And that\u2019s really one of the advantages to having an international portfolio. You\u2019ve got rent, pricing, you\u2019ve got the PSC structure and it\u2019s not just the loan, unconventional treadmill that you have in the Permian. So, anything Steve, you want to add on the PSC? Steve Riney : Yes, I just, Doug, what I did is, I maybe point it to the supplement. We\u2019ve got a page in there on the Egypt volumes that breaks it out pretty clearly. And what you\u2019ll see is when you compare gross production volume to the net production volume that goes to the concession holders, us and Sinopec, we\u2019ll find them. The vast majority of the barrels actually still go to Egypt, which is the way it ought to be when you\u2019ve got a drilling program as John was talking about, that is just highly economic when you can \u2013 we can drill for the cost of these vertical wells and you get the types of oil rates that you can get out of Egypt. So, Egypt does end up with the vast majority of the volume, but what that does allow is that when you\u2019re in a very low oil price environment, like today. We do get first call on cost recovery barrels. And so those barrels \u2013 some of the barrels moved from Egypt over to the concession holders in order to get cost recovery and cost recovery, it will vary. We\u2019ve got 25, 26 some odd concessions there, different PSC contracts and all of them are slightly different from each other, but they\u2019re pretty similar. And the way cost recovery works is during the period, which is a quarter \u2013 you will get full recovery through oil volumes or gas volumes for all of your in-period expense costs. And then you also get a quarterly share of amortization or depreciation if you will on historic capital. And the PSEs do vary slightly, but most of them are either a four-year or a five-year amortization of the capital spend. So, every quarter you do have a pretty significant hedging benefit from the PSC effect if you will, a built-in hedge. And so that\u2019s why you see our adjusted barrels went up in the first quarter from fourth quarter, because of the price roll. you\u2019ll see that again, most likely in second quarter from first. Doug Leggate : That\u2019s what I was getting at, Steve. could you put some order of magnitude on the bump given that oil price? can you give some order of magnitude to the bump given the oil price? John Christmann : No. We\u2019re not going to give that at this point in time. I think you could probably do a rough calculation of from fourth quarter to first quarter with your assumptions on what prices will be in the second quarter. Doug Leggate : It seems that there\u2019s a pretty big number. That\u2019s why I was trying to get it from you. But guys, thanks so much\u2026 John Christmann : So, very nice benefit of the PSC structure, it does, in a high oil price environment, it cuts the other way. Obviously it\u2019s a double edged sword, but in the low oil price environment, it does provide a very nice natural hedge. Doug Leggate : Got it. Thanks, guys. John Christmann : Thanks, Doug. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gail Nicholson from Stephens. Your line is open. Gail Nicholson : Good morning. I\u2019m looking at the other permanent cost reduction that you guys discussed earlier in the call. Can you just talk about what the split between those is U.S. versus international and then the savings that achieved to date in the permanent cost reductions; have they been more skewed to one region than the other? John Christmann : I\u2019ll start out, Gail. A lot of those, we started \u2013 I mean we were fortunate in that we started kind of an operational redesign last September. So, we were six to seven months into a total revamping of our operating model, where we were closing some offices and really centralizing a lot of functions. What this enabled us to do in mid-March was just take a much, much deeper cut. And so a lot of those cost savings are going to be G&A related. They\u2019re kind of across the board, a lot of it even on the corporate side. So, a big chunk of that is geared towards the overhead side and the G&A side. Secondly, the cost saving efforts have been kind of across the board, and I can let Clay give a little bit of an idea on the operational split, but you\u2019ve got a lot in the Permian is we\u2019re probably the lion\u2019s share of that is, and then other things we\u2019re doing in the North Sea and Egypt. I\u2019ll say one thing with some of the COVID protocol that we put in place; we\u2019re doing a lot more screening. We\u2019ve kind of reduced down to critical folks that we need on the platform. So we\u2019re actually adding some things in some areas too is, we\u2019ve gone to a very specific approach, but any color Clay, you want to give on the splits. Clay Bretches : now, I think you nailed it, John, as far as the order and where we\u2019re seeing the biggest cost savings is U.S. being the largest, we saw a significant savings with the permanent closure of the San Antonio office and a lot of the reduction in expenses that we had in the NAUR region. But we also have seen a lot of reduction in expenses in the Permian basin excluding in NAUR. So, we\u2019re seeing good reductions there. Same thing in the North Sea, we\u2019ve had some reductions there as far as both headcount and contractor headcount that\u2019s been substantial and ongoing. And then in Egypt, we\u2019re really starting to pull the covers back on Egypt and understand that better. So, we think that there\u2019s some low hanging fruit there that we can go after and attack. So, we\u2019re not through cutting cost at this point. We think that there\u2019s \u2013 there are other cost initiatives that that we can gain from and we\u2019re working on that right now. Gail Nicholson : Right. And then\u2026 Steve Riney : Gail, it\u2019s Steve, if I can give it a little bit more color on that as well. We talk about $300 million of identified sustainable cost reductions so far and that\u2019s both in G&A and OpEx. And as John said, we had started the G&A focus last year. And so we\u2019re ahead of the OpEx side. The OpEx started really in earnest with the oil price downturn. On the G&A side, G&A reductions so far are more than two thirds of the $300 million identified. G&A will include costs in the corporate center obviously, but also G&A related costs in the regions, and not to confuse things too much, but the G&A goes to three different buckets on our financial reports. A portion of it will show up in G&A expense on the P&L. Some of it shows up in LOE, because it\u2019s allocated that way. And then some of it will go to the capital program. So, it\u2019ll show up in capEx, but it\u2019s all dollars of reductions and spends, regardless of where, where it goes. And then in addition to the sustainable reductions, which as I said, are approaching about $300 million identified. There will be some costs that we\u2019ve identified and began the process of just deferring things that can just wait until a later point in time. Gail Nicholson : Great. Thank you for that incremental clarity. And then looking at the \u2013 in the quarter, you guys made a solid profit on purchased oil and gas. How should we think about this going forward? John Christmann : Yes. so, this is the first quarter, where we have separated out the purchase \u2013 the sale of purchase oil and gas and the purchase costs of purchased oil and gas. And the reason for that is because this is the first time that it\u2019s become material to our P&L and it\u2019s become the cause of the pipeline \u2013 the long haul pipeline transport contracts that we\u2019ve entered into. And this just gets down to the basics of how we run the business. We \u2013 the product that we produce, we sell in basin just as a general role. We sell all of the hydrocarbons in basin. We have a marketing organization, who amongst the many other things that they do. One of the things they do is they help us keep basin pricing connected to the larger broader market and we obviously had some events over the last few years that were disconnecting the Waha and El Paso Permian pricing from NYMEX Henry Hub, Houston Ship Channel type of pricing. And so the marketing organization recommended and we took them up on it of helping pipelines like GCX and PHP go from concept to FID and to reality with GCX now. So, we actually entered into contracts on those pipes and then we helped them get them get across the line. Of course, we also took an equity option, which Altus Midstream owns now in those pipelines, but getting those contracts \u2013 getting those contracts in place helped to help the pipelines get built. And in the marketing organization now manages are exposure to those transport contracts and what you see is the on our P&L now is the effects of the marketing organization purchasing product in basin or along the pipelines. It\u2019s not necessarily at Waha or El Paso Permian, it could be anywhere along the pipeline or where they have access to the pipeline and then selling it at the other end of the pipeline or in other offloaded locations along that pipeline. And so they basically manage that exposure through purchasing and selling product. And since it is becoming material now, we need to separate that out and you see that the marketing organization made $22 million in the first quarter on that primarily, because of the differential promotion of the quarter between Waha and Houston Ship Channel. Gail Nicholson : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Scialla from Stifel. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning and thank you for taking my call. John Christmann : Good morning. Unidentified Analyst : This is actually [indiscernible] in for Mike. My question is a follow-up of a previous question on that 24 million cubic feet per day impact from a processing contract, and maybe, you could provide additional color into what am I look like going forward? John Christmann : Yes. So, the most important thing to understand on that is that it has \u2013 it has no economic impact. So, we\u2019ve got a contract, where we have to have gas processed to make it \u2013 to get it to pipeline spec. And we have a contract with a third party and then the third party charges us a fee plus power costs. And this is very typical of these types of arrangements, because power can be pretty variable costs. And in order to not take the risk of fluctuations and volatility and power costs, I just pass it on as a means of pricing the contract. And so what this \u2013 what this gas processor does with us and it did with many other parties too. Because like I said, this is a very typical term in these types of contracts. they take in kind portion of the gas that flows through the plant. And then they effectively take the revenue from that gas as payment of the power costs, and because of accounting rules, we can\u2019t report that as produced volume, because it doesn\u2019t belong to us. It effectively belongs to someone else. And so that\u2019s the only reason why it\u2019s just a \u2013 if we didn\u2019t have this contract, this term, in this contract, we would report more volume, report more revenue, but then we would have an equal amount of more processing costs on the P&L, it has a zero financial impact. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. So, it is expected to continue about the same amount going forward? John Christmann : It\u2019ll \u2013 it fluctuates with gas pricing. And so it\u2019ll \u2013 if you can predict gas prices, then you\u2019d be able to predict the volumes. It\u2019s because gas prices got so low this quarter that the volume went so high. This will \u2013 this may, it occurred last year also in the Permian area and it certainly will occur in the future most likely, but it\u2019s something, it\u2019s not a norm. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019re going to take our next question from Jeanine Wai from Barclays. Your line is open. Jeanine Wai : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. My first question is on activity and maybe, trigger points for pricing, the operating cash margin in the U.S. continues to lag the North sea and just pretty, pretty meaningfully. And I know the U.S. is kind of a mixed bag of operating subareas. but at what oil price would you consider reactivating activity in the Permian? And we\u2019re just asking because \u2013 the trigger price might be a little different for you than others given Apache\u2019s strong international portfolio and maybe, wanting to maximize cash flow, because you\u2019ve got to continue to fund Suriname and then you\u2019ve also got the debt maturities coming due. John Christmann : Jeanine, you actually answered your own question, but we will, I mean, if you think about our priorities of first thing I\u2019ll say is, we will be slower to go back to work when we were shutting things down and we\u2019re going to be very methodical with it. our priorities are going to be one, debt; two, would be dividend. As you start to think about capital, we\u2019re going to continue to maintain the exploration and the appraisal program, and Suriname, Egypt would sit next and then you kind of get into the ducts in the Permian, North sea. And then we\u2019d start thinking about the rig lines in Permian. the nice thing about our unconventional acreage is most of it, we don\u2019t have any lease obligations. It\u2019s not going anywhere. We\u2019re not losing anything in that option. So, it\u2019s all just a function of timing. And I think for us, we want to be very methodical. If you look back to how we kind of went back to work post the 2015, 2016 shutdown. And we\u2019ve kind of been through this drill before as we went from 93 rigs before by second quarter of 2016 at that time period. We started the latter part of 2017 ratcheting back up and went to an eight-rig program and on the unconventional Permian side and we\u2019ve been scaling back a little bit. So, I think we\u2019d want to see higher longer deck and definitely, the advantages we have is the portfolio and we\u2019re going to be managing cash flow. That\u2019s it. Jeanine Wai : Okay. Well, really appreciate the detailed responses. That\u2019s very helpful. My second question and the follow-up is regarding the debt maturities and adjusting those over the next three years. Do you have an estimate of what price oil needs to average in order to pay those off strictly out of free cash flow? And maybe, we\u2019re just getting a little 2Q here. I know it depends on a ton of different factors that may not be known today. So maybe, an impossible question, but any commentary you might have around the free cash flow trajectory for Apache would be helpful. I know that you can pay the maturities in the revolver and you can fall back on that, but that might not be ideal. John Christmann : Yes, Jeanine. Yes. We\u2019re not going to give a lot of guidance or insights into free cash flow in the out years. All I\u2019d say is in 2020, we are \u2013 we\u2019re basically running free cash flow neutral with the current capital program. If you were running that at about $30 WTI, and so if you take the dividend, the reduction, the capital spending we\u2019re on right now, the pace of capital spending we\u2019re on right now, the cost reductions, the $300 million of cost reductions. and we\u2019re at about a cash flow neutral WTI price of about $30. John indicated that reducing debt is certainly one of our highest priorities for future free cash flows. We\u2019ve indicated in the past that our sensitivity to a dollar movement in oil prices is somewhere in the $50 million to $60 million range. So, you could probably use those and now get to a solution point on what the \u2013 what it might take to be able to pay down $937 million of debt over the next few years. Jeanine Wai : Great. That\u2019s actually really helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann from SunTrust. Your line is open. Neal Dingmann : Good morning. Just another one, you guys talked a little on Egypt and my question is more just on Egypt and North sea, specifically, just wanted, how do you guys think about maintenance caps there? I know that\u2019s, you probably spending more there in Egypt and the maintenance cap, but I\u2019m just wondering, could you talk about how you view that now as those become more efficient and potential free cash flow of each, let\u2019s just use sort of the strip-ish prices? John Christmann : Neal, when we look at those two areas, we\u2019ve typically needed $700 million to $800 million or so to kind of hold them flat, combined. And those are \u2013 that\u2019s net \u2013 our net portion of the \u2013 for the JV in Egypt for Sinopec. So, when you think about that, we\u2019re slightly under that level this year with the reduction, we\u2019ve shaved a little bit of that back, but as I mentioned, we\u2019ve really high graded the inventory in Egypt and we\u2019re seeing some strong results coming out of there. So that\u2019s going to help us with that number. And then secondly, we\u2019ve got the luxury of some, some really nice tie-ins and the timing of those that came on with our garden too well and so forth. And we\u2019ve curtailed that well a little bit, given price volatility and things there. So, slightly under, but in kind of an improving picture in terms of what it takes to maintain those two areas. Neal Dingmann : Okay. And then just quickly move over to the permian, you all mentioned the release that you thought you\u2019d have about 70 ducts. I\u2019m just wondering, is there a sort of level that you\u2019re comfortable taking this down to or just to before you\u2019d bring rigs back or just wondering how you think about that count? John Christmann : No. that number is just the result of where we were in the program and when we kind of picked up the range, I mean we \u2013 it was easier to shut down the completion crews. So that\u2019s the first thing we did was shut the crews down. it took a little bit of notice time on the rigs as we mentioned. I think we\u2019re on our last well on the Permian as we speak. And so that was purely just a result of kind of where we were. It\u2019s more than we typically would carry, because of the shutting the completion crews down first, which is going to give us a little bit of ducts to bring on when we decided to put the comeback term. We\u2019ll have about 15 in Alpine High in the restaurant, our Midland basin unconventional and for those are three mile laterals. So, it\u2019ll give us some uplift when it\u2019s time to put some capital back to work. Neal Dingmann : Great details. Thanks, John. John Christmann : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Reynolds from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Scott Reynolds : Thanks. Hey, I appreciate all the color and I know you\u2019ve been given a lot of bookends in terms of how to think about Apache here going forward, but just so I\u2019m understanding it, I mean, the goal is you kind of go through 2020 and to 2021 at this point, based on your current activity level, it seems like you\u2019re not spending at maintenance levels, when you talk about that $30 per barrel price sort of resiliency too. And I\u2019m just curious, like, if you brought yourself to more of a maintenance production mode in each of the areas, what does that price indicator look like? John Christmann : Well, I mean you\u2019ve got the brackets there, Scott, because we were going to grow slightly with, where our budget originally was, which was geared around a $50 WTI. As we\u2019ve said now, we can make kind of cash flow at 30, but we are going to decline, we\u2019re below maintenance levels in the Permian. And so that will come down and international is going to be kind of flat or relatively flat. So, it\u2019s somewhere in between there in terms of if you were going to call it, generate free cash flow and actually keep our volumes flat. Scott Reynolds : Okay. It\u2019s fair enough. And obviously, in Suriname, you\u2019ve got your \u2013 things you\u2019re submitting to the government at this point in time. What can we expect from Apache over the course of this next year in terms of like how we\u2019re going to hear new information and what the plan is leading into potential appraisals that once you get the government response back, you\u2019ll have a press release or can you give us a sense of how you\u2019re going to report the new information to us over the balance of this year? John Christmann : Well, I mean, that\u2019s something we\u2019ll work through with our JV partner. I mean, typically, we \u2013 you submit the appraisal program; it\u2019s kind of a work plan. And then we\u2019ll go execute that. So, we\u2019re not in a position right now with our partner, where we\u2019re announcing what that entails. We\u2019ve got a couple of years to do the appraisal program and before we have to make a decision on FID. And so we want to go about that as quickly as possible, but we\u2019ve kind of balanced, you got to have to balance that as you get into the back half of this year, early next year with when you start. Scott Reynolds : Does the current oil price environment impact the FID decision at all much? John Christmann : I mean, right now the good news is, is that you look at Suriname, you look at the timing of it you\u2019re four to five years realistically from discovery to when you\u2019d have production online. I think that all of us would look through to seeing a better price environment. I don\u2019t know what the recovery shapes going to look like more near term, but I think as we would get out the timeframe, where Suriname comes into play and we\u2019ve seen no wavering from our partner and we\u2019re fully committed as well. So, I think it\u2019s something that stays on track and it\u2019s actually something that we can fund and our JV is beneficial to our capital profile spending. Scott Reynolds : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And in the interest of time, we\u2019re going to take our final question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brian Singer : Thank you and good morning. John Christmann : Good morning, Brian. Brian Singer : Good morning. There\u2019s been a bit of an improvement in expectations for natural gas prices into 2021 and I just wondered what it would take natural gas price wise, if anything to either shift or increase capital and the gas in your parts of the Permian, Alpine high or other areas within the portfolio? John Christmann : Well, what I\u2019ll say, Brian is it really boils back down to economics and the portfolio, right. So, it just goes to show you a year ago, we were talking about curtailing gas and here we are now curtailing oil in the basin. So, it just shows you how quickly things can change. We like having a portfolio, we like having a commodity mix. It gives us leverage, where we can put capital and have options, whereas if you\u2019re saddled to it being a pure play in one commodity stream, that\u2019s what you\u2019re tied to. So, I\u2019ll just say it\u2019ll \u2013 the projects will have to compete as we start to put capital back to work and a lot of hinge on how the products are trading relative and what the view of them longer term is at that time. So right now, your gas, your wells and things have higher are more economic right now than the straight oil wells, which is a total flip from where we are. Brian Singer : Great. Thanks. And then my follow-up is with regards to a hedging strategy. Apache was unhedged in 2019 and into 2020, and I think there\u2019s maybe a mischaracterizing, but that has been more of a preference to depend on the movement in capital spending versus the pluses or minuses of hedging. There have been some hedges that have been added recently and I just wondered if you can talk more philosophically about how \u2013 if there\u2019s been any changes to how we should think about your hedging strategy going forward. John Christmann : I mean, I think philosophically, no. We came into this on edge. We saw a lot of short-term volatility. And so we really put the hedges in place, swaps Q2, the callers and three and four of the few swaps in Q3, what we put those in is protection. to the downside scenario as you work through, what was a shutdown, but not a philosophical change, unless Steve, if there\u2019s anything you want to add on the hedging. Steve Riney : Yes, sure, John. I\u2019ll always take the opportunity to talk about our philosophy on hedging. So now, it hasn\u2019t changed, Brian. We believe that the best hedge is the ability to have flexibility in your activity. I think that current price environment proves that. So, we think the best hedge is the ability to ramp down activity, which is what the industry needs to do right now and associated with that to get cost levels down as low as possible. There are times when we do believe, we need to engage in hedging activity. We had one of those in the past when we had commitments that couldn\u2019t be avoided, where we had to build out the midstream at Alpine high. We\u2019ve got one now, where you\u2019ve got a period, where oil prices are getting into a range where cost just can\u2019t be cut low enough to maintain free cash flow. And so that\u2019s why we entered into the hedges as we saw what was happening. We knew second quarter was going to be very, very painful. You could see that coming and that\u2019s why we hedged the vast majority of our volumes for second quarter, mostly with swaps, all with swaps. And then we hedged a little bit less for 3Q and even less still for 4Q. And there has been a combination of swaps and some collars. So we just \u2013 we generally just believe that we have a preference to refrain from financial hedging. We, as I spoke about earlier with the Egypt and coming in the future of the Suriname, we do have some natural hedges already in the portfolio and it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019ll just point out that nobody ever asks us why we didn\u2019t hedge after prices run up. I only ask when prices have run down. just I\u2019m sure just one of those oddities of the environment that we\u2019re in right now. Brian Singer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude the question-and-answer session for today\u2019s conference. And I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to John Christmann for any closing remarks. John Christmann : Yes. Thank you, operator. In closing, I would like to wish all of you good health as we work through this COVID-19 pandemic. We are looking forward to getting the economy back on its feet and sharing our progress in future calls. Now, back to the operator to close. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants\u2019 are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin. Gary Clark : Good morning and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation\u2019s Second Quarter Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. We will begin the call with an overview by; CEO and President, John Christmann; Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO will then summarize our first quarter financial performance; Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President of Development will also be available on the call to answer questions. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 15 minutes in lengths with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday\u2019s press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our second quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today\u2019s call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. Finally, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John. John Christmann : Good morning and thank you for joining us. For the last several months, the world and the global E&P industry have been facing one of the most challenging environments in recent history. Apache is responding with decisive actions designed to protect our people, our assets, our investors and the communities, in which we operate. And I want to take this opportunity to thank the many Apache employees and contractors for their hard work and dedication in these tough times. In my prepared remarks this morning, I will discuss the progress we made during the second quarter and review our key objectives and capital priorities going forward. I'd like to begin with a brief update on our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Apache moved quickly to implement a wide range of fit for purpose protocols to ensure a safe and productive work environment in both our onshore and offshore operations. Thankfully we have experienced a relatively small number of COVID-19 cases and have incurred no material operational disruptions beyond our intentional production curtailments. We are prepared to maintain our current work model for as long as necessary. Since the onset of the pandemic we have been listening and responding to the specific needs of the communities, in which we work and live. Apache has donated PPE and critical medical equipment to hospitals and first responders, as well as supporting food banks. long distance learning initiatives, and shelters for women and children. From an operational and financial perspective, during the second quarter, we executed our planned activity reductions on schedule and delivered upstream CapEx well below guidance of $230 million. For the full year, we are now tracking toward the lower end of our capital guidance range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. The majority of our organizational redesign has been implemented, achieving combined run rate, LOE and overhead savings of more than $300 million as planned. Net of severance and restructuring costs, actual cash savings realized in 2020 are estimated to be approximately $225 million. Through these and other actions we have reduced our free cash flow breakeven oil price to be around $30 per barrel on a forward-looking basis. This allows us to protect our current financial position and enables positive free cash flow in the current price environment. And in Block 58 Offshore Suriname during the second quarter, we submitted a plan of appraisal for our first discovery mockup announced our second discovery at Sapakara and spudded our third exploration well Kwaskwasi, the results of which we announced yesterday in conjunction with our earnings release. We are thrilled with the results from the Kwaskwasi-1 exploration well. This is the best well we've drilled in the basin to date with the highest net pay and the best quality reservoirs. While we have a lot more work to do, a discovery of this quality and magnitude merits a pace of evaluation that enables the option of accelerated first production. Following Kwaskwasi the Noble Sam Croft drillship will move to the fourth well in our 2020 exploration program, Keskesi. After, which Apache will transition operatorship of the block to our partner Total. Turning now to the curtailment program. We have returned our North Sea and Alpine High volumes to production along with a portion of curtailed oil volumes in the Permian. We anticipate that several thousand barrels of higher cost Permian oil production may remain offline for the rest of 2020. Apache is currently running one exploratory rig in Suriname, five rigs in Egypt, and one floating rig and one platform rig in the North Sea. We intend to maintain this activity set for the remainder of the year if commodity prices do not deteriorate significantly. At this time in the Permian Basin, we have no drilling or completions activity and no plans to complete our DUCs for the remainder of the year. As we look at the second half of 2020 into the long-term, our key objectives remain unchanged despite the extreme price volatility. We will budget conservatively and direct free cash flow on a priority basis to debt reduction maintain a balanced and diversified portfolio and prioritize investment for long-term returns over production growth. We have spoken frequently about our priority ranking for capital deployment within the portfolio, and our thoughts on this are worth reiterating. At the top of the list is Suriname, which will continue to receive priority funding for both exploration and appraisal activity. Under the terms of our joint venture, the incremental cost to Apache associated with appraisal and ultimately development should be very manageable. Our second priority is Egypt, where the PSC structure offers more stable returns in relatively low and more volatile oil price environments. Following that, we should look to complete our DUCs in the Permian Basin and resume drilling with a second platform rig in the North Sea. And finally, while our Permian operations have been delivering highly competitive economics within the basin, other areas within our portfolio offer more attractive investment options in a capital-constrained environment. Therefore, we don't envision returning rigs to the Permian Basin unless oil prices recover well into the $50s. We have always stated that our best hedge against price volatility is prudent and responsive management of the capital program. To the extent, oil prices are sustained at/or below $50 per barrel WTI, we do not anticipate a material change in our annual capital budget from the current rate of around $1 billion. For oil prices significantly below $50 capital spending is more likely to be reduced from the $1 billion mark. If oil prices rise above $50, we will be very measured with our capital increases and the first column that incremental free cash flow will be returned to investors initially with debt reduction. I'd like to close by summarizing Apache's approach to managing the unprecedented challenges thus far in 2020. We implemented successful COVID-19 operating protocols and work-from-home procedures and helped ease the burden of the pandemic on our host communities in numerous ways. We responded to the sudden price drop by quickly limiting cash outflows to protect our balance sheet. This included a significant reduction in capital, dividends and overhead and operating costs. These along with other actions have enabled us to lower our free cash flow breakeven such that we now have good visibility to debt reduction. Operationally, we have preserved optionality to reactivate our curtailed production, development programs and other investment opportunities when appropriate. And we have successfully advanced our exploration program in Suriname. Through these and other actions, particularly the successful implementation of our corporate redesign, we entered the second half of 2020 a very focused and streamlined organization. The benefits of our diversified portfolio are more evident now than ever as we flex capital towards our international operations. Together, with our world-class position in Suriname, Apache offers a truly differentiated investment opportunity within an industry that has come under tremendous pressure. I would like to again thank all the Apache employees for their commitment, resilience, hard work and flexibility as we successfully navigate these challenging times. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney. Steve Riney : Thank you, John. On today's call, I will review second quarter 2020 results, discuss progress on our cost-saving initiatives, and provide commentary on our free cash flow outlook and debt management efforts. As noted in our news release issued yesterday, under generally accepted accounting principles, Apache reported a second quarter 2020 consolidated net loss of $386 million or $1.02 per diluted common share. These results include items that are outside of core earnings, the most significant of which are, an unrealized loss on derivatives, a tax valuation allowance, and asset impairments, partially offset by a gain on the repurchase of outstanding debt. Excluding these and other smaller items, the adjusted loss was $281 million or $0.74 per share. Adjusted production decreased 7% from the prior quarter, primarily driven by shut-ins and production curtailments of approximately 190,00 BOEs per day at Alpine High, and production curtailments of 10,000 BOEs per day in the North Sea and 6,000 BOEs per day for other operations in the Permian. Partially offsetting this was increased Egypt cost recovery volumes due to the lower oil prices in the quarter. Apache's second quarter average realized price on a BOE basis fell 39% from the prior quarter, with oil and NGL prices down materially. International oil price realizations were notably weak, as actual price realizations dislocated from the published benchmark price. This discount was driven by unprecedented excess supply on the market, resulting in unusual competitive pricing dynamics. Consequently, second quarter international oil realizations averaged around $5.50 per barrel below the benchmark, which we do not customarily experience. So far in the third quarter, Brent pricing has reconnected with the benchmark and we do not currently anticipate this changing. Turning now to our cost savings initiatives. We entered 2020 with a goal of reducing annualized overhead and LOE costs by at least $150 million. With the price downturn in March, we took quick action to double that goal to at least $300 million. We have since fully achieved this target and then some. Roughly 2/3 of the targeted savings are coming from overhead reductions, and 1/3 from direct LOE reductions. These are sustainable cost reductions, and they are showing up in multiple places on our financial statements. So let me provide some detail. Of the roughly $200 million of annualized overhead cash cost reductions, approximately $100 million will show up as reduced capital investment. $20 million will come in the form of reductions in LOE and exploration expense, and approximately $80 million will show up in lower G&A expense. So our underlying G&A expense, which in the recent past typically ran about $100 million per quarter, should now run around $80 million per quarter. During the first quarter of 2020, you will recall we had a nearly $30 million reduction in G&A expense caused by the mark-to-market effect on share-based compensation plans associated with the significant negative movement in our stock price. During the second quarter, this impact partially reversed, generating a $19 million increase in G&A expense. As a result, second quarter G&A expense was $94 million. Turning now to LOE, we have eliminated approximately $100 million of direct LOE costs on an annualized basis. In addition to these sustainable LOE reductions, we are also seeing cost reductions associated with production curtailments and deferred workovers as well as the deferral of certain other nonessential activities. While these actions reduce costs in the near term, they are not sustainable, and we expect at least a portion of them to return at some point in the future. As we have previously noted, one of our key long-term objectives is debt reduction. Let me share two views on this objective as we look at the second quarter. With respect to long-term debt, we took the opportunity to repurchase bonds at significant discounts when the debt markets came under pressure. In aggregate, during the second quarter, we repurchased $410 million of face value debt for $263 million, reducing aggregate long-term debt by $147 million. The repurchase debt had an average remaining term of approximately 20 years and at the purchase price, had an average yield of 9%, making this a very attractive investment. Another view of debt is through the borrowings on our revolver. Between the negative cash flow impacts of the extremely low price environment and the $263 million of bond repurchases, we ended the quarter with $565 million outstanding on the revolver. With an improving second half price outlook, combined with lower capital investment and reduced operating and overhead costs, we anticipate generating positive free cash flow in the second half and using it to reduce borrowings on the revolver. Before wrapping up, I'd like to note that we did issue third quarter guidance yesterday in our financial and operational supplement on our website, which covers our outlook for capital investment and production as well as a number of expense items. In summary, although it was a very challenging quarter from a price and cash flows perspective, we took significant actions to reduce our cost structure, protect the balance sheet and retain asset value for the future. To the extent WTI oil prices remain above $30 per barrel, we look forward to generating free cash flow in the second half of 2020 and using that to reduce leverage. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Sorry, guys. I was on mute. I couldn\u2019t get my mute button to go off. I apologize. Good morning, everyone. John, this is also a great day for your stock, and congratulations on the latest discovery in Suriname. I'm obviously going to focus my two questions on that, if I may. So my first one is your comment in the press release about this deserves perhaps the option of an accelerated first production. My question is, what influence does Apache have over that? How aligned is Total? And what are the parameters within the contract that could get you to that? And I guess what I'm really aiming for is, would you consider an early production system here? And I've got a follow-up. John Christmann : Well, Doug, thank you, first of all. I think in the end, it's just going to boil down to the quality of the well and the rock and the play, when you step back and look, Block 58, 1.4 million acres. To put it in perspective, it's over 250 Gulf of Mexico blocks. We've now drilled 3 wells in 3 different fairways. And I use that context to help you understand why you can have 3 very large fairways. We're going to be moving to another one with Keskesi once we conclude operations. The comments in the press release kind of speak for themselves. With where we sit, I think that our partner is also excited. We've done some things in the Campanian, with this well, we gained -- collected some extra data. We're doing some things with an exploration well that you typically would not do, which helps us gain some insight into what we've got. And so we'll -- in the end, it's going to boil down to us being aligned with our partner. And of course, aligned with the Staatsolie and the government of Suriname in terms of the pace and moving it forward. But I think in the end, it's going to be the quality of the rock and the resource potential that's going to drive that. Doug Leggate : Pardon my follow-up on this -- that question, John, but Total just don't seem to be communicating the same level of urgency, I guess, as your comment in the press release. So I just wonder if you could help us bridge the gap between the two, given the... John Christmann : Well, I think, what all my comment says is that, it's of a quality that would look at an accelerated pace. I think in their press release today they stated that, there will be an appraisal and exploration program early next year to appraise our discovery. So I'll just leave it at that. Doug Leggate : Okay. My follow-up is also on Kwaskwasi. And it's related to the deeper Santonian. Obviously you did not disclose anything other than hydrocarbon reservoir. The last thing we heard of that expression it was gas condensate at Haimara and Guyana. So I'm just wondering if you can address some concerns out there, as to what the hydrocarbon type is. Why you didn't release APIs? What do you know about scale? And just any other ways you can characterize that deeper horizon? And I'll leave it there. Thank you. John Christmann : Yeah. The thing I'll say is, if you look at the first two wells, the Santonian has been more oily than the Campanian. So I will tell you everything looks good here. We are in a position, because we had done some additional work in the upper zones. And set pipe in the Campanian that we had a lot of that -- all that information. There is still more that we are collecting here but we felt like we were at a position with the materiality that we should talk about it. I'll let Dave to give a little more color on the Santonian there. Dave Pursell : Yeah. Thanks John. So Doug, John talked about some additional testing in the Campanian. So it's important from a timing perspective we did some additional deeper investigation-type testing. And it does two things for us. It gives us a composite flow capacity and allows us to see a little deeper in the reservoir than conventional fluid testing allows. So we've -- we're through the Santonian. We have the conventional wireline logs collected. Based on our experience with the mud logging and the open-hole wireline logging, on Maka, Sapakara and the Campanian in this well, we feel confident that we have oil, in significant portion of the Santonian. So we felt like, we were fine with releasing. We still have work to do. We still have to collect fluids and pressures. We have core data to collect. And we anticipate doing some of the additional deeper investigation testing, on this interval. So I wouldn't read too much into the fact that we don't have -- we didn't release API gravities because we don't have those collected yet. Doug Leggate : Thanks. Congrats again. And I look forward to next quarter. Thanks. Dave Pursell : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Scialla with Stifel. Mike Scialla : Yeah. Good morning and brilliant and congratulations as well. I was curious on Kwaskwasi the results there how those compared to expectations? Was there any indication from your seismic data that this well would have more than double the net pay of the other two? John Christmann : Yeah, Mike, first of all, thank you. I mean when you look at the seismic we knew Kwaskwasi was going to be a prolific fairway, as the other two were. It boils down a little bit about the depositional environment. I mean once again, we're in such a large area and these wells are so far apart, that you have to drill them to learn that. So I mean clearly, it exceeded what would have been pre-drill. But we knew there was that kind of potential. And there is -- the exciting thing about it is we've got a lot more of this block to explore, but clearly, very excited about it. Mike Scialla : Good. And then, Stephen, you mentioned about prioritizing that you want to improve the balance sheet obviously. I was wondering how you would prioritize options there? Is it really just using free cash flow to pay down debt or any other options you've considered at this point? Steve Riney : Yeah, Mike. I think, in a more typical environment you'd see companies selling assets to strengthen the balance sheet to pay down debt. And I think it's clear that, in the price environment we're in right now that just doesn't work. And so for the most part, it is going to be the old-fashioned way of retaining free cash flow spending a little bit less on capital which we all ought to be doing. And that just means it will take some time to get the balance sheet in order unless there's a price spike or some -- there will be the occasional one-off opportunities where you have a chance to do something to reduce debt similar to what we did in the second quarter with repurchasing some debt at a discount. And we'll take advantage of those from time-to-time. But I do believe this is just a simple case of prioritizing retaining free cash flow and using it to pay down debt instead of spending it on capital to maybe achieve a different type of growth profile. Clearly for us, strengthening the balance sheet is going to be much more important than growing production volume. And I think we're now approaching a period, where we're going to be able to do that. We've -- as John mentioned in his prepared remarks, we're now capable of running free cash flow neutral at $30 WTI on a point forward basis for the rest of this year, with the CapEx budget where it is, with the dividend cut, the overhead cuts, the LOE cuts, some of the other things that we've done. We have no intention of raising the capital budget for this year. And that's what we'll do. And to the extent that oil price exceeds $30 WTI, we'll use any excess free cash flow that that generates to reduce debt. Mike Scialla : Very good, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Bob Brackett : Hi. Good morning. I'm intrigued a bit by the comments around, doing some things with an exploration, well that you wouldn't typically do in the deeper investigation type testing. Are you performing a mini drill stem test out there? And are there any rates to report? Dave Pursell : Yes. Bob this is Dave Pursell. Good try. We \u2013 it's something that would be between \u2013 if you want to call them mini drill stem tests that would be a reasonable characterization. It's something between a full drill stem test and what you typically would get from a fluid sampling operation. So again what we're getting from this is composite flow capacity of a \u2013 instead of a point permeability measurement from a core sample, we're getting a composite flow capacity and then another benefit is some deeper investigation for pressures into the reservoir. So we're still evaluating that data. But that's what we're doing. And again, we anticipate performing those tests in the Santonian as well. Bob Brackett : Okay. Yes. That's clear. Another question. Given the thickness of this recent discovery, what drove the sequencing of the overall exploration campaign? And what might that tell us about the fourth well? John Christmann : I mean I think when you step back and look, as we said we had multiple fairways. I think there \u2013 and you look at the size and think about this it's equivalent of 250 Gulf of Mexico blocks. So moving across there. A lot of it has to do just with how the \u2013 how things were deposited. But we've got a full another fairway that it will be testing. So we're anxious to move over and see. But everything looks really good on the seismic. So we're anxious to move on to Keskesi after Kwaskwasi. Bob Brackett : Appreciate it. John Christmann : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles Meade : Good morning, John, you and your whole team there. John Christmann : Good morning, Charles. Charles Meade : I'm asking another question on the relief the headline that everyone is focused on the thickness of the pad that you guys found with this well. I'm curious, is there anything going on with either the dip of these sort of formations or perhaps structurally that's some kind of mitigating factor for that thickness you announced? Or is this more the case where you guys just really found a thick stack of pancakes here? John Christmann : I would just say it's really more depositionally. There's nothing tricky with it. Geology is pretty level out here. So it's very exciting. I think it just goes to the quality in the Cretaceous here both with the Campanian and the Santonian. So as we've said, there are other play types that we are still looking forward to testing. The Turonian is a target we had at Maka. There's more to do. We've really \u2013 with the Campanian and Santonian, we're really only fully starting to evaluate two of the play types, we think there's seven or eight \u2013 so there's multiple targets. So a lot of exploration to do. And obviously, we got a lot of appraisal work to do on these first three discoveries. Charles Meade : Well, John, you anticipated my follow-up question on the Turonian because I remember back, you guys certainly have plenty to say grace over here but going back to that first well, the Maka well that you guys had some encouragement with the Turonian. So does \u2013 is that something that we should anticipate you guys are going to \u2013 are you going to maybe test with your next well? Or is that something that's where you found enough in the Campanian and Santonian that that's kind of receded into 2021 or beyond? John Christmann : Well just the timing of how \u2013 if you look Charles, we're really still moving across one direction across this block with these first four wells. We haven't even started to move the other direction which would be north and south. So we're going to \u2013 Keskesi, obviously move to the other side of Sapakara. So we'll talk about that with the future exploration wells. Charles Meade : Got it. Thanks for the color, John. John Christmann : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : Hi, good morning, everyone. John Christmann : Good morning. Jeanine Wai : I've got two questions on Suriname starting. But I guess my first question is just on the reservoir quality. And the second is just on the accelerated first production commentary. So based on what you've seen so far from the Kwaskwasi well, can you provide a little more color on what makes the reservoir at one of the best quality reservoirs that you've ever seen in the basins? And is it primarily just the net feet to pay? Or are there other characteristics that you can elaborate on? John Christmann : I'd just say in general, it's better. It's better if you look at the one net fee to pay both in the Santonian and in the Campanian are greater than we had in the first two wells combined. So that's one element. But I'll also tell you the quality looks fantastic. So at this point that's all we're going to say about it. Jeanine Wai : Okay. I can appreciate that. And then my follow-up question. In terms of the potential for accelerated first production relative to the current plan which to our understanding I think was something around four development wells and four exploration wells a year. Is the thought that maybe you could shift some exploration CapEx, development Capex? Or do you envision doing more than the four plus four wells? I know it's still early but I'm also not sure if there's anything in the PSC that allows for some timing flexibility. John Christmann : Yes. I mean, what I would say is I don't know where the four appraisal or four development wells came from. We're drilling four exploration wells this year. Under the terms of our joint venture us and our partner can each propose four exploration wells so there could be eight going forward. What we've stated is there will be both an appraisal program and an exploration program in 2021 and we plan to try to get started as early as we can. So clearly the comment is with what we've got and some of the things we're doing here, this is of a quality and magnitude that it would warrant trying to look at could it be accelerated is all we're saying. Jeanine Wai : Okay. Great. Thank you, very much. John Christmann : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John Freeman with Raymond James. John Freeman : Hi guys. John Christmann : Good morning, John. John Freeman : So, I wanted to focus on the capital allocation. You have been pretty clear about the balance sheet being the first priority and then kind of Suriname, Egypt, North Sea, Permian sort of that order. And the slide that you have got in your presentation sort of lays it out at different kind of price tags how that capital gets allocated. And John, you were very clear in your prepared remarks that it's going to take an oil price well over $50 to put a rig back to work in the Permian. But I guess, I'm curious with sort of where the current strip is which is just barely above $40, it's kind of right on the line there between, if you do anything in the North Sea, if you would potentially draw down DUCs in the Permian. And I guess, what I'm going towards is with this continued success in Suriname and everything you want to do there and what's -- and the continued run in Egypt, if maybe the gap has sort of widened between those two assets versus the other two where maybe at a low price is just barely above $40, it maybe doesn't make sense maybe to put the capital of those last two relative to the others? Like is there part of the pie now getting bigger I guess? John Christmann : Yes. John, a really good question. I think the first thing I would say is in my prepared remarks, I laid out too that with where the strip is today CapEx probably comes down for the whole in '21. And that's just because of how we prioritize things. As it relates to the pie, Suriname, the way we structured our joint venture, it really doesn't change, how much capital we have to put into Suriname. So, clearly it's just going to boil down to how much capital do we want to spend. And with where the strip sits today, I really think that the CapEx budget is going to come down because, we're going to want to generate some free cash flow that can go towards reducing our debt. John Freeman : Great. And then just the last question for me. With this latest result in Suriname and everything you're doing there, just internally relative to how you were thinking about the mix of kind of appraisal and exploration in Suriname next year, does this change that mix? I'm not telling you to give me the actual breakdown because you haven't probably determined that yet, but just does it change your thought process of how that mix would have been prior to this result? John Christmann : It really doesn't because I mean we've been -- I think, we understand the potential there. Clearly, there's things we're going to want to try to move forward on an accelerated pace if we can, but we also have a very large block that we have to continue to explore. And so, we're going to want to continue exploring. I think the exploration pace will be pretty similar to what it is today. And then, it will just be a function of what we need to do on the appraisal side with our partner. John Freeman : Thanks, John. I appreciate it and congrats. John Christmann : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Gail Nicholson with Stephens. Gail Nicholson : Good morning. Congratulations on another great Suriname well. John Christmann : Thanks Gail and good morning to you. Gail Nicholson : When you guys look at Egypt activity in the second half of the year, could you just talk about any exploration targets that you guys are looking for to tackling? John Christmann : I mean, Gail, we're -- we continue to work Egypt hard. And we've shot a big -- a very large 3D there. We continue to high-grade our inventory. We do have some interesting things that are on the schedule that we're anxious to drill some stratigraphic targets. And at some point, if they work like we think they could work then there will be some things to talk about. Gail Nicholson : Great. And then Steve, in the first quarter call, you talked about a cash flow sensitivity that for every dollar move in oil was in the -- roughly in the $50 million to $60 million range. Is that still a good proxy to use? Or has that improved? Steve Riney : No, that's still a pretty good proxy to use for every dollar around -- probably close to the $60. Gail Nicholson : Great. Thank you. John Christmann : Thank you, Gail. Operator : Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Chase. Arun Jayaram : Good morning. John, I was wondering if you could maybe as a follow-up to John's question, just give us some thoughts on your plans to delineate the three discoveries you've announced thus far and thoughts on potentially bringing in additional drilling rig to the theater call it next year or beyond? John Christmann : Yes. Arun, I'll just say, we have a kind of a procedure through the concessions that we follow. And we have submitted the appraisal plan for Maka. We are working on the appraisal plan for Sapakara. There will be one that follows Kwaskwasi and clearly there's going to be an appraisal program that starts in early '21. And at this point, that's all I'm at liberty to really say, but we look forward to getting after it. Arun Jayaram : Great. Great. And just a follow-up regarding Egypt, you guys have talked about the new licensing areas. I was wondering if you guys have processed seismic on your legacy position as well and perhaps a little bit more detail on when you plan to test the stratigraphic trap play concept that I think you've identified in the Ptah and Berenice discoveries back in 2014? John Christmann : Yes. I mean, it's -- really it's -- Ptah and Berenice it really kicked off this whole effort. Prior to drilling those wells, we'd shot new 3D in 2013. They were on our legacy acreage position called offset. It really opened our eyes to the fact that we needed to start looking stratigraphically not just structurally in Egypt. We had found some things that were stratigraphic in nature through some of the wells that we had drilled in the past. But it really had us design the 3D, which we've been shooting and obviously we picked up new acreage and are shooting that over a lot of our old legacy as well, so a lot of prospectivity. We've got some wells that we're pretty excited to drill. And the nice thing about those is their vertical. They're onshore and there are the other wells we're drilling. So we can do them pretty quickly. It's just a matter of working through all the details and prioritizing. The rig count there we've also reduced. We're currently at five. We'd like to spend more there, if we could, so. Arun Jayaram : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Scott Hanold : Yes. Thanks. On Suriname, a great discovery and congratulations, by the way. Does that discovery really say anything about the positioning or your read of the seismic that you have over some of the other fairways like the Maka, for example, i.e. is there the chance that you guys now see the opportunity for like thicker structures other places? Is there anything unique that you found with that well? John Christmann : Yes. I mean, Scott, good question. I mean, I think, what you're learning too and is what we're learning, we've still got work to do. We'll continue to reprocess seismic. There are some carbonates and some things that make it harder. We're fairly deep here, as you saw with the TD that we announced in this well. So we're going to continue to work that. I mean it's -- I think what it really points out is just the vast size as you move from these first three wells between them and the size of the block. So we're going to get smarter with the reprocessing to better understand everything and put it all together. But the good news is, we've got a massive hydrocarbon system. Its working, its oil and we've got good reservoir in the Santonian and in the Campanian. So we'll learn more as we go and as we really start to drill wells. We've just drilled three. So with -- we'll learn more as we go. Scott Hanold : And effectively, as far as Keskesi goes in terms of where that was positioned, is there any chance that shifts a little bit as you continue to get closer to that? Or is that location pretty well set at this point? John Christmann : No. I mean, as we stated, we had I think nine wells permitted. We knew we would drill three for sure; likely, the fourth was the option we exercised. So there were -- we've got five other locations out there that were picked. Could be appraisal could be others so -- other exploration targets. But we've stick in with where the original wells were on most of these. I mean, it's Sapakara, we moved over one. So as you go and you learn more, you set yourself up to try to get smarter. But it's going to take some more work with the seismic to really change some of the interpretation that we did on the front end. Scott Hanold : Understood. Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer : Thank you and good morning. John Christmann : Good morning, Brian. Brian Singer : Sticking with Suriname, how many combined appraisal wells at the three discoveries do you think are needed between moving forward with the codified development plan? And when you think about the appraisal plus the time to get to FID and any government approvals, what's the realistic timing for when we could see early production start-up and a realistic timing, if we see more normal production start up? John Christmann : Well, I mean, I'd say, that number one, we'll determine the number of appraisal wells that we need through the program. So -- and we're working on that. So I really don't have anything to say other than there's going to be a program and obviously, we've got three discoveries to appraise and there will be contingency wells as we work through those appraisal programs that you'll have with those. Time line, we said normal process you're probably in the four to five range, in terms of years. Obviously, there\u2019re ways that that could be accelerated, but I'm not ready to comment on anything at this point in terms of putting anything out there. I mean we're -- it's all fresh. We've got the log. We're working through this with our partner. We're working on right now, the Sapakara appraisal plan. And then, we're going to get after the Kwaskwasi appraisal plan following that pretty quickly so\u2026 Brian Singer : Great. And then my follow-up is with regard to gas condensate. As you get more data on the gas condensate potential, how are you and your partner considering the potential if at all, for gas condensate development and economics? And is there any scale benefits from discoveries that you've made as well as in the Stabroek block of Guyana for a larger industry partnership? Dave Pursell : Yes, Brian, this is Dave Pursell. I think it's premature to go down any details on that. But the way I think you could think about it is, the oil is going to drive the initial development here. And then gas or gas condensate development is beyond that kind of a phase two, if you will. And, obviously, there'd be some scale benefit in the basin, if that were an option. But we're -- there's a long fairway between here and that determination. Brian Singer : Makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities. Richard Tullis : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. And, John, congratulations on the big discovery. Two quick questions. With no plans to resume domestic activity until oil prices are considerably higher, what are your current views on potentially monetizing any of the U.S. assets at this point? John Christmann : I mean, I'd just say with the portfolio, we're always working the portfolio. We're always looking at how we improve. When we look at our acreage positions out in the Permian specifically, the good news is, we don't have a lot of wells. We have to drill the whole acreage. In fact, mostly everything is HBD [ph]. So we've been looking at working swaps and things to improve our lateral fit in terms of drillable -- lateral feet. And then, I mean, it's -- we're always watching and looking and evaluating the portfolio. I'll just say what we typically do is, just come back and talk to the market after we've done things, rather than setting out expectations or anything on the front end. Richard Tullis : All right. Thank you. And then just lastly, I know, we've been provided a good bit of information on the thickness of the three discoveries. Any initial thoughts on the aerial extent of any of the three discoveries at this point? John Christmann : Thoughts are that -- I mean, it's --we're -- they're very sizable, but we haven't given any color. And we haven't started to put any acreage size on any of these at this point. And I think it's premature. It's something we'd come back with after we've done the appraisal programs. Richard Tullis : Okay. That\u2019s all from me. Thank you. John Christmann : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Neal Dingmann : Hello. John or Steve my question is just wondering with the pace of next year's appraisal plan at Suriname would that have any impact on your decisions on domestic or international play spending? John Christmann : In the way we structured our joint venture, we've kind of got everything worked in and planned around. I mean that was the main reason we held on to 100% of this block and really farm down 50% because we are really setting ourselves up for success because we believe there was a tremendous amount of potential and thought very likely we would find ourselves in this position. And so that's how we structured it. So it's really not going to create an incremental capital call that we can't fund it really at any price. Now you get into second quarter where we got -- all bets are off, but really in an even sub-$30 world we will be focused on paying down debt and funding Suriname. Neal Dingmann : Got it. And then just last question just on Egypt. I'm just wondering you mentioned that you'd probably stay the course if pricing stayed around here. Is there -- just kind of wondering if you could talk about any price sensitivity that would cause you to change that? John Christmann : No, Egypt works really well. I mean -- and quite frankly, that the driver there is how much free cash flow do we think we can spend and invest there. I would like to spend more because we've got a lot of prospectivity there and it works quite well. So we'll be looking to try to spend more money in Egypt if we possibly can. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc. Leo Mariani : Hey. Thanks, guys. Just wanted to kind of get a little bit more color around some of the comments you made with respect to CapEx. I think you guys specifically said that it's $50 you'd spend at or below the $1 billion as we work our way into next year. And I just wanted to get a sense, I mean, it seems to me that that level of capital you're going to see steady production declines in all three of your areas, sort of, Egypt, North Sea and Permian. Just wanted to kind of confirm that with you guys. And then if that is the case then are you guys just feeling comfortable with that just because of the great initial success in Suriname? Or you just think that the long-term economics in Suriname are going to be so good you're fine letting things blow down for a handful of years until this kind of kicks in? John Christmann : No, Leo I mean, I think, the point is we're managing the company for free cash flow and long-term returns. And it's not about production growth. I mean, obviously, we're not spending at a level today that would be maintaining production. We do know from past history that as you go forward with us with our decline rates some of these conventional assets really start to arrest that decline. So it would take more in the future, but it's a matter of priorities of how we're managing the company. And I think some of these other assets some of the things you talked about they're going to hold up pretty well with under investment. Leo Mariani : Okay. And I guess just with respect to your third quarter production guidance here you guys have the kind of adjusted international production of 135,000 BOE per day and kind of the upstream CapEx of $190 million. I want to see if you guys could provide those numbers on a kind of fully consolidated basis. So what would those be if we didn't make those kind of downward adjustments for the Egypt non-controlling interest in midstream and other things. Steve Riney : Yes. Leo, we -- I don't have those numbers to hand. So I'd suggest maybe you call Gary to take a look at the reported volumes. We typically talk about adjusted because those are the ones that have a true economic effect for Apache shareholders, but I understand the desire to know what the reported numbers might be. So if you want to talk to Gary about that that would be probably the best source. Leo Mariani : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from David Deckelbaum with Cowen. David Deckelbaum : Good morning, guys and congrats. John Christmann : Thank you. David Deckelbaum : Just curious you've spoken quite a bit about obviously, Suriname. You talked about your capital allocation priorities as commodities improve and the emphasis on free cash. There were reports, I guess, earlier in the month or perhaps last month about Apache's potential interest in some other North Sea assets. If we think about Apache just as a portfolio company now, should we be expecting you look at opportunistic acquisitions that would increase your free cash per share scale? Or just given the immense resource that might be in front of you would that be something that would be off the table right now? John Christmann : No. I would just say that number one we typically as a rule don't comment on rumors and with the -- as we think about portfolio and changes, we typically talk about them after we've done things right? So if you look at us today, we've always believed in a portfolio. We've believed in diversity. We think we've got strong international assets. We maintained those at a time when there was push to try to move to more of a pure-play model. And so we've always maintained the balance. We believe in having an exposure to all the commodities and multiple strong legs to the stool that keeps it strong so. David Deckelbaum : Appreciate that. And then just the last one for me is you talked about priorities in accelerating appraisal and potentially development particularly in Block 58. How do you feel now? Or how are you thinking now about exploring in some of the other blocks namely 53? And if there were some leases that opened up towards the end of the year in more of that southern extension in the basin? Would we expect Apache to be present in those? John Christmann : Yes. I mean when you look at 58, it's a lot to say grace over for us. We're obviously -- it was important to us to structure our joint venture where we could maintain 50% of the profit oil. We're thrilled to have Block 53. I think directionally the way things are moving it bodes well for 53. So at this point we've got quite a bit to say grace over in that part of the world but. David Deckelbaum : Thank you, guys. Congrats. John Christmann : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy. David Heikkinen : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. And congratulations on the success in Suriname, kind of triggered some memories of many DSTs that look for perm really poor pressure and then boundaries. With that thickness can you talk about how many DSTs you're running? What are you thinking about as far as detecting boundaries? And are there any analogies that in other basins or the Gulf of Mexico that you could point us to the -- to think about what those results will be as they come in? Dave Pursell : Yes Dave. This is Dave Pursell. Good -- thanks for the question. Yes when I think about a mini DST the -- probably the most important piece of information because there's a mini DST is the composite flow capacity. So we're getting that aggregate kind of near wellbore perm across a thicker interval. The deeper reservoir investigation is an added benefit but we still -- you're still not getting out as far as you would in a true conventional drill stem test. So what this is going to -- and the number of tests we're going to perform is dependent on a lot of factors on thickness and a number of things. But what the results are really going to allow us to do is, be able to be more thoughtful in the appraisal program as we come in and design more traditional drill stem test. And so it's a really good piece of information that's going to again make us smarter during an appraisal. David Heikkinen :   Yes. So really near wellbore probably won't get enough distance to see any boundaries. And that's really setting up for your future DSTs not anything more than that... Dave Pursell : Yes for -- yes that's probably the -- that's the way to characterize it. David Heikkinen : That\u2019s helpful. Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotia Bank. Paul Cheng : Hi, thank you, good morning. Two quick questions. One in certain the discovery seems to be closing up you should be able to extend the horizontal well and tie it back into one production pop? Is that what you intend to do or that the reserve is it seems like big enough that you may any way that you use maybe two FPSO to develop it? John Christmann : Yes. Paul it's just early. I mean clearly the benefit of having these fairways and things is you're going to have all sorts of options. The key is having resource, oil and as you work through that and that's some of the stuff that will go into the planning of how we appraise and ultimately make those decisions. But there's a lot of optionality to how you do it. Paul Cheng : And -- okay. And last question that you sort of answered it before, but let me try another way to ask. In Permian if we're looking at -- given the success in Suriname you will be extremely busy in the second half of this decade and probably have very good growth. And so when we're looking at something like in your Permian asset do you consider it still a long-term core portfolio? Or that is not really considered as a long-term core portfolio from what you can see today? John Christmann :   No. I mean we like our assets in the Permian. I think we've always believed it was a key pillar. I think what -- in this price environment today, we've just got places that are going to get capital before that's going to get it. And I'll just -- I'll leave it at that. Paul Cheng : Thanks. Operator :   Our next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. Jeffrey Campbell : Good morning and congratulations. I'll jump in on the Suriname success so congratulations. Real quick question there, I just wanted to confirm who will operate the upcoming fourth exploration well? John Christmann :   Apache will operate the Keskesi well. After that well is when we've already started transitioning with our partner Total. And I will say, we chose the right partner for a lot of reasons and we're excited to continue working with them and let them take the reins as operator. Jeffrey Campbell : Right. Well being a little superstitious. I wouldn't mind seeing you guys drill one more well. So I'm glad to hear that. The other quick question was just how many Permian DUCs do you actually have right now in the queue? John Christmann : Permian DUCs you got that. Dave Pursell : Yes it's about 50 outside of Alpine High. Jeffrey Campbell : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to John for any closing remarks. John Christmann : Thank you, operator. And thank you to everyone that has dialed in today. To close the call I'd like to leave you with three key takeaways : first, Apache has responded quickly and aggressively to the volatile price environment thus far in 2020 we are exceeding our cost and capital reduction goals and we'll continue to relentlessly work these initiatives. Second, we are laser-focused on free cash flow generation debt reduction and investing for long-term returns not production growth; and lastly, we have a differentiated portfolio that offers attractive investment options in this volatile oil price environment. The long-term future of that portfolio is underpinned by Suriname where our success rate thus far indicates a very large high-quality oil resource. We look forward to sharing our progress as we continue to appraise our discoveries and explore for additional oil. And with that we will conclude the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you and please go ahead, sir. Gary Clark : Good morning and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation\u2019s third quarter financial and operational results conference call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John Christmann; Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO will then summarize our third quarter financial performance; Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President Development will also be available on the call to answer questions. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 10 minutes in length with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday\u2019s press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our third quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today\u2019s call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. Finally, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John. John Christmann : Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today's call I will review our third quarter performance, provide some preliminary color on our 2021 plan and update our progress in Suriname.  While commodity prices improved and were less volatile during the third quarter, macro headwinds continue to persist. Apache's strategic approach to creating shareholder value, however, remains unchanged. We are prioritizing long-term returns over growth, generating free cash flow, strengthening our balance sheet through debt reduction and advancing a large-scale opportunity in Suriname. We are allocating capital to the best return opportunities across our diversified portfolio, aggressively managing our cost structure and continue progressing important safety and emissions reduction initiatives. Apache believes that energy underpins global progress, and we want to be a part of that conversation and solution as society works to meet growing global demand for reliable, affordable and cleaner energy. As we work to help meet global energy needs, we are focused on developing innovative and more sustainable ways to operate. Our environmental, social and governance framework continues to evolve. And early next year, we will communicate more on the enhancements we are making in these areas. We want to be a partner to the communities where we live and work and deliver shared value for all of our stakeholders. Turning now to the third quarter. Our upstream capital investment, lease operating expenditures and G&A for the quarter were all below guidance. The organizational redesign we initiated a year ago is delivering combined cost savings in excess of our previous estimate of $300 million on an annualized basis. In terms of production, we exceeded our guidance in the U.S. and delivered in-line volumes internationally. U.S. oil volumes declined 11,000 barrels per day or 12% from the second quarter. This was the result of several factors. The most notable of which was our conscious decision to suspend Permian Basin drilling and completion activity back in April. Additionally, we implemented a series of intermittent shut-ins in the Southern Midland Basin to assess optimal well spacing. And lastly, we chose to leave approximately 4,000 barrels per day of oil shut-in during the quarter, primarily from the Central Basin platform, most of which we do not anticipate returning to production until prices warrant. By early July, most of our shut-in volumes at Alpine High had returned to production, which drove the increase in gas and NGL volumes compared to the second quarter. We are now seeing very compelling service costs in the Permian Basin. And as a result, have retained 2 frac crews to begin completing our backlog of drilled but uncompleted wells. We are mindful of price volatility and will take a flexible approach to the flow-back timing of these wells. Regardless, there will be no impact from this program on our fourth quarter Permian production and minimal impact on our full year 2020 capital guidance, which we have reduced to $1 billion. Looking ahead to 2021, we anticipate an upstream capital budget of $1 billion or less, which is based on a WTI oil price of approximately $40 per barrel and a Henry Hub natural gas price of $2.75. In this price environment, our capital allocation priorities will remain unchanged. We envision a stepped-up program in Surinam that will include both exploration and appraisal drilling, a 5 to 6 rig program in Egypt, 1 floating rig and 1 platform crew in the North Sea and 2 frac crews in the Permian Basin. We do not envision a sustained drilling program in the Permian, but will monitor oil prices and service costs for the appropriate time that they serve. Let me be really clear. If NYMEX futures are materially below $40, we are prepared to reduce capital accordingly as we have demonstrated in the past. As previously noted, we plan to direct nearly all free cash flow in 2021 toward debt reduction. In terms of production trajectory next year, our DUC completion program should stabilize Permian oil volumes at a level consistent with fourth quarter 2020 levels while Egypt and the North Sea will likely see modest declines. Turning now to Suriname. During the third quarter, we completed operations on our third successful exploration test in Block 58, Kwaskwasi which is our best well in the basin thus far. We are currently working with our partner, Total, on an appraisal plan, which will be submitted to Staatsolie before year-end. Following Kwaskwasi, we commenced drilling our fourth exploration well, Keskesi in mid-September. We have also selected our fifth exploration well, Bonboni, which will be situated in the North Central portion of Block 58. Apache is in the process of transitioning operatorship of Block 58 to Total, who will conduct all exploration and appraisal activities subsequent to Keskesi. I want to close by thanking our employees worldwide for maintaining safe operations, delivering on our key business goals and helping to minimize the spread of the coronavirus in our workplace and communities. Our field personnel have done an exceptional job instituting operational protocols that enable business continuity and our office staff successfully adapted to the remote work environment. That said, we look forward to returning Apache employees to the office in the future. And I will now turn the call over to Steve Riney. Steve Riney : Thank you, John. On today's call, I will review third quarter 2020 results, discuss progress on our balance sheet initiatives and provide a few thoughts on our fourth quarter guidance. As noted in our news release issued yesterday, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Apache reported a third quarter 2020 consolidated net loss of $4 million or $0.02 per diluted common share. These results include items that are outside of core earnings, the most significant of which are an unrealized gain on derivatives and an impairment for unproved leasehold. Excluding these and other smaller items, the adjusted loss was $59 million or $0.16 per share. U.S. production increased slightly from the second quarter as the return of curtailed production volumes, most notably at Alpine High, more than offset the declines resulting from no drilling activity and only 1 well completion in the quarter. Internationally, adjusted production was down approximately 6% from the prior quarter, primarily driven by the impacts in Egypt of higher oil prices on cost recovery volumes and natural field declines. This was partially offset by the return of previously curtailed production in the North Sea. Apache's third quarter average realized price on a BOE basis recovered significantly from the prior quarter, up 45% as WTI oil prices averaged around $40 per barrel and Henry Hub natural gas prices trended up to nearly $3 per Mcf by the end of the quarter. G&A expense in the quarter was $52 million, well below our guidance of $80 million. Most of the variance reflects a mark-to-market change in the value of future cash settled stock awards and a reduction in the estimated value of our 2018 and 2019 performance share programs. Excluding these types of impacts, our underlying G&A expense runs around $75 million per quarter. As always, efforts will continue to lower our G&A costs as we identify more ways to run the company more efficiently. Lease operating expenses were also below guidance for the quarter. On a per unit basis, LOE declined nearly 25% from a year ago, mostly as a result of our corporate redesign and cost reduction efforts. I'll turn now to our balance sheet initiatives. In August, favorable market conditions provided an opportunity to refinance a portion of our debt at attractive rates. We issued $1.25 billion of new bonds. And including the debt repurchased in the second quarter, we will use all of proceeds to reduce other long-term debt. Specifically in 3Q we used proceeds to tender for $644 million of existing debt at a slight discount to par. Additionally, this week, we called at par the remaining $183 million of notes scheduled to mature in 2021. Between now and the end of 2023, we have only $337 million of debt maturing, which we plan to retire with free cash flow. Apache's liquidity position remains in very good shape. At September 30, we had just over $3 billion of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility. The vast majority of the consumed portion of the facility is for the letters of credit associated with future North Sea asset retirement obligations. Before wrapping up, I'd like to point out that we issued fourth quarter 2020 guidance yesterday and our financial and operational supplement which can be found on our website. As John noted, we expect our full year 2020 upstream capital investment to be around $1 billion. This implies an uptick in fourth quarter capital to around $200 million, which reflects some incremental capital associated with the DUC completion program that is beginning this month. While we continue to make good progress on our lifting costs, reported LOE is expected to rise a bit in the fourth quarter to around $270 million. This increase simply reflects the quarterly variations caused by timing impacts. In summary, Apache continues to make steady progress on the goals we set for the year. While the operating environment remains challenging from a commodity price and cash flow perspective, we continue to take every possible action to reduce our cost structure, protect the balance sheet and retain asset value for the future. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Mr. John Freeman of Raymond James. John Freeman : Yes. The first question, just on Suriname, when you all mentioned that you're nearing the award of the 2 rigs for 2021, I just want to make sure that I'm thinking about this the right way. That doesn't necessarily imply that you're just going to have the 1 exploration, 1 appraisal rig for next year. That's just -- that's what you're currently in the process of, but there could be additional activity as you progress through '21 in Suriname? John Christmann : Yes, John, what we've got is we've said there'll be 2 programs, both an exploration and an appraisal program. We're currently on our last well, Keskesi, with the rig that we're operating, the Noble Sam Croft. That will be released once that well is concluded, but we're in the middle of the tender with Total, and they're going to be picking up 2 rigs early next year. And there will be a combination of exploration and appraisal with those 2 rigs. John Freeman : And then as you go through the rest of '21, I guess, when you decide whether or not you and Total, if you're going to add additional rigs to the plan, is that driven in some ways just by the timing of receiving approval on these appraisal plans on the first three wells? John Christmann : No, that will just be a decision we make based on which wells you want to pull forward and how you want to play it. So the 2 rigs are going to be a minimum for next year. John Freeman : Okay. And then just the 1 follow-up on Suriname, maybe just some additional color on what went into choosing the other location on the Bonboni well. Obviously, up to this point, you'll kind of been moving in kind of a West-East direction across the block. Does this now assume we're set up to kind of go from a North to South kind of direction? John Christmann : John, if you step back, I mean that's kind of been the plan from the get-go and it was always the plan. The first 4 wells, we had lined up to kind of go across just 1 direction. They're on trend with the wells that have been drilled in the blocks, both to our East and West, there's now a rig running in on the other side of this. We just got to step back and realize just the perspective and just how big Block 58 is and even Block 53. It's the equivalent of over 250 Gulf of Mexico blocks. So just we\u2019re working our way, one direction is pretty -- a big move. Obviously, we've said there's a lot of depth. These are all independent separate features that run outward. And so we're anxious to kind of get out, as we've announced Bonboni, it will be the fifth well. It will be drilled early next year. Total will drill that well. And we're anxious to move out more towards the -- kind of the North Central part and start to show just that dimension of this in terms of the block. So it's exciting. We've said there will be a continuation next year on the exploration pace. And obviously, we're anxious to start appraising. So it's going to be fun. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gail Nicholson of Stephens. Gail Nicholson : I just had a question in regards to Suriname. When you guys look at what you have done upward Block 53, can you just talk about what you learned there in those original 2 wells drilled and how that has helped you influence some of your decision process on the exploration activity? John Christmann : Well, Gail, if you go back to early 2015, we were drilling our first well Popokai and it was actually drilled ahead of the Liza well in the Stabroek Block. So you go back in time, the main thing that Popokai did for us was it helped us inform us that, one, we wanted to go ahead and pick up Block 58. So that's the first thing. I would say secondly, we actually were able to drill the thing all the way down through the source interval and gain a lot of information with it. The second well, Kolibrie, was further outbound, really drilled some really, really high-quality sands and told us a lot about that. So I think Block 53 is highly prospective. I think the well that's being drilled next door to us will be very informative. I think our Keskesi well will be very informative and also Bonboni.  So we've got 1 well commitment left at in Block 53, but I think it holds a lot of promise for the future. So it's sitting nice. I think with the work we've done since, there's a lot of potential in Block 53. Gail Nicholson : Great. And then just looking at those incremental cost savings that you guys have achieved with the portfolio optimization, where are you guys thinking that breakeven is today on the assets? John Christmann : Yes, I mean if you go back to last quarter, we talked about where our volumes were. We have moved kind of from a 50 to low 30s kind of going forward this year. Next year, it will tick a little higher because our volumes are going to be down. But I think, generally, we're in a pretty good place, and we continue to surprise ourselves by what we're able to drive out of the cost structure. I mean we've driven another $100 million out. Steve, I'll let you hop in and provide a little bit more color. Steve Riney : Yes, Gail, I'll just add to that, we have -- we continue to make efforts on the cost cutting and cost focus. And the most surprising thing to us this year is the pace at which we're actually able to capture them in the current year. So we're around $400 million now of annualized savings, and we'll get at least $300 million of that and probably more in the current year. And so as John says, as you know, we've got declining production volume as we round the corner into 2021, and that works against the cash flow breakeven, flattening in the U.S. oil, as we talked about. But the -- that can -- will tend to be offset by the annualized benefit of the cost savings going into next year. But the breakeven of $30 per barrel on a cash flow basis is going to go up a bit as we round the corner into '21. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Doug Leggate : John, just maybe a follow up to Gail\u2019s question if I may on Popokai. Give me a minute to ask this. So Popokai as I understand that was a tight hole. But our discussions just solely suggest that the failure mechanism was reservoir quality, and it's kicked off some controversy given that we haven't got any data in the first 3 wells that you drilled. So I wonder if you could put that to rest and talk to us about reservoir quality of the 3 wells? And I'd like to remind you, obviously, that the Maka well, you did say you saw it capable of prolific oil. So any data you can give us to put that to rest on the 3 discoveries? I've got a follow-up, please. John Christmann : Well, number 1, we have not released a lot of data, the data on Popokai, and it was tight. And I'll tell you the key to that was record the source interval. So there was not an issue with reservoir quality in any of the zones. It had some other factors. But it was -- the key for there was it gave us a lot of the key data and we were able to core the source interval, which helped us with the maturity, which played back into Block 58. So that was the key there. I think that, Doug, from our perspective, the information that we've released with Total has been agreed between the 2 parties on everything we've released, the net pays for what have been the -- both Campanian and Santonian numbers. They're not our estimate, not their estimate, they're agreed. So we feel really good about those numbers. I think in general, the quality is good. But for us to really get into a lot of detail, we've got to get into the appraisal work, and that's -- we're going to be very deliberate with the steps and the information that we put out, but I can assure you that some of the rumblings we heard of [indiscernible] that's not a mistake you'd make or it's not something you'd find with the logging suite and the detailed core analysis and all the work we're doing. So we feel good about the reservoirs, but we really need to follow the appraisal work to be able to start putting out more information. This isn't -- it's a conventional play, and there's a reason you go to those next phases. But there's a lot of zones. I mean we're in a super basin. It's large. We've got a lot of really, really good rock, and we're very pleased with where we are. I mean, it's -- but we're still on our fourth well across 1 dimension, and it's just really early to start talking about things you'd typically do after you've gone into your full appraisal when you can come back with concrete information. Doug Leggate : No evidence from the logs. I guess, just a clarification point real quick. When you announced Kwaskwasi, you've obviously talked about the cementing problems. Could you lose circulation into the reservoir on that well? John Christmann : What we said was we got into higher pressure below our target in the lower Santonian. It's not a matter of losing circulation. The trick was, what do we need to do to put the cement plugs in. And so we had to put a lot of fluid in, in the well to -- from the other direction. And so that's why we compromised the ability to actually get the fluids out of the Santonian because we had an open hole that we had to balloon over time. So it was more a function of the drilling operations. It wasn't cementing problems, Doug. It was that we had to set two cement plugs, let me just be real clear on that. There were no cementing problems. We just had to set 2 cement plugs below the Santonian because of the pressure that we had, and we had the open hole above us, which compromised other -- we'd already run logs on it, but it compromised the ability later to get fluids. Doug Leggate : To be clear, the reason I'm asking the question, it was around about way you're trying to get that reservoir question answered because seems to me if you overpressured the reservoir and lost mud into the reservoir, is a very porous permeable reservoir, that's why I was asking the question. My follow-up real quick is Bonboni, I guess, that\u2019s how you pronounce it. Any source or migration differences in the depositional setup there geologically compared to what your first 3 targets look like or first four targets look like? I'll leave it there. John Christmann : Doug, Bonboni is exciting. We'll have both the Campanian and the Santonian targets. There's also an opportunity to go a little bit deeper and test some other things. So same setting. These are -- it's a good distance out. And I think it just -- it's going to give us another ability to explore the other dimension of this block, which we're quite excited about. But the primary targets are going to be similar. And you're going to see those targets as we continue in these next several wells. A lot of it is going to be about the campaign and the Santonian. But I do want to remind you, we've got some other targets that at some point we'll get to. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research. Bob Brackett : Kind of repeating on a similar theme. If we think about Block 53, I note that you've included it back again into some of the materials, you've got a single well remaining to meet your commitment. Are your partners aligned with potentially drilling a well in '21 or 2022? John Christmann : Yes. Bob, I'll say our partners would love for us to get back in there. And it's not that we ever excluded it, it's just we've been focused on 58. 53 is something we made a well commitment on that we've got to actually drill before the spud before the end of the second quarter of 2022, and it's something we're very excited about. We've got 45% of it. I can promise you 2 of our partners, 1 of them is in the well that's being drilled South of there right now. So yes, they're anxious and we will get to it in due course, and we're anxious, too. But there's a lot of activity that's going to be very informative on the potential in Block 53. Bob Brackett : Great. A quick follow-up. The water depth for Bonboni, I can probably look off the symmetry, but if you have that handy? John Christmann : I don't have that off the top of my fingertips here. It's not real crazy. It's going to be deeper. But it's not something crazy. I'm looking down here at Clay. Operationally, he\u2019d know yet. But it's not -- I don't think it's crazy. We can -- Gary can follow up with that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Scott Gruber : In the Permian, how many DUCs do you have? How long can you keep 2 frac crews working without adding any rigs down there? Dave Pursell : Yes, Scott, this is Dave Pursell. We have about 45 DUCs in the Permian. We'll pick 2 frac crews up here later in the quarter. And those will stay busy through the middle of next year. Scott Gruber : Got it. And then you also mentioned a flexible approach to flowback timing on those completions. Obviously, post-completion, the well cost is basically [sold]. How do you think about flowback strategy on those? I assume there's more price threshold, you're thinking about, but some color there would be great. Dave Pursell : Yes. We'll look at a number of factors as we bring the wells back online, some of these -- we have 5, 3 milers that we're bringing back, and we'll keep those facility constrained for a while. But really, we're going to look at the forward curve on price and how the wells are flowing back and just see how we want to -- how aggressive we want to be with the chokes through the end of '21. So we just want to keep some optionality out there given the volatility in the oil price. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : John, for the Bonboni, do you have -- what is the depth that you have to drill below the seabed to reach the TD? John Christmann : Yes. It's actually -- the thing is shallow, as we move that direction, Paul. So the targets are actually going to be a little shallower below the seafloor than what we're sitting at Maka, Kwaskwasi and even Keskesi. So it's shallowing which is actually a pretty good thing from a maturity standpoint. Paul Cheng : Okay. And that for next year, the CapEx of $1 billion for maintaining the U.S. production spread and modest decline in loss in Egypt. But of course, that benefits on the top. So without the top benefit, what's that number may look like? John Christmann : Well, there's 2 things, Paul. Number one, you have to look at we're spending quite a bit of money on exploration in our CapEx. And so we're making a conscious decision to put the money into Suriname, which we could be putting into that base business. I can assure you the money going into Suriname is more than what it would cost to run those 2 frac crews. So you step back and think about the decision we're making on the exploration investment, that's capital we're putting in the -- which could be putting into the base, but we're making a long-term decision because we think there's going to be much, much greater benefit when you get 3, 4 years out. Paul Cheng : No, fully understand the decision, but I'm just curious what that number if we're saying that in 2021 on the sustaining CapEx without the benefit of top. And also one on Suriname, I thought, Total carry you for 87.5%. So your CapEx to that shouldn't be that much, is it? John Christmann : Well, but the Total carry actually kicks in on the appraisal work. And so we're going to have 2 rigs running. So there will be exploration activity at a pace. It's pretty similar to what we've been spending this year, right? And then the appraisal capital kicks in. And on that, we will be paying 12.5% on the appraisal work. Paul Cheng : Okay. Two final questions. First, if the oil price end up next year swing much better than the $40 WTI base budget, how that may impact if it does on your 2021 CapEx and the activity level? And then last one... John Christmann : Yes. I mean, clearly, our priority there is going to be debt repayment. I mean there's more with the $1 billion or less number we've kind of laid out for 2021, that's predicated on $40. If prices are higher, you're going to see us continue to prioritize debt repayment. But there are some things we'd like to get to more capital in Egypt is something that would be a priority for us. But that's going to be the big thing. And then I think you'd have to get quite a bit higher before we start thinking about rig lines in the Permian. Paul Cheng : Okay. And final one, that partly, actually, even though the price looks very depressed, but they trade at a higher multiple compared to most of your E&P peers. Does it make sense from that standpoint to use this relative premium currency to acquire company with a maybe better near-term cash flow and balance sheet? I mean I don't think you need to acquire company for growth. But that may allow you to have additional room of cost reduction and also improve your balance sheet also more maybe at serving rigs. John Christmann : No. It's been a busy time, and we've seen a lot of transactions happen out there on the M&A front. I think as you alluded to with how we're trading, we're in a pretty unique position where we've got a potential company-changing exploration block that we feel like actually, there's a lot more potential there than is reflected on our share price. As we think about things, clearly, we're focused on paying down debt. You see we're really aggressively managing our cost structure, working on the breakevens. But I think from our perspective, we've got to make sure something would really makes sense for our shareholders and protect the shareholders because we see a lot of upside potential on a relative basis with our share price just because of the potential in Suriname. So you can't stick your head in the sand, you have to keep your eyes open, but we're going to be very cognizant of shareholder value. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Charles Meade : I have 1 quick question and then maybe a bigger follow-up. John, I didn't hear you address it in your prepared comments. I apologize if I missed, but did you give a timeline when we expect a decision or announcement on your Keskesi well you're on right now? John Christmann : Well, we did not, Charles. We're drilling ahead. We did run into some hole stability problems in the upper portion. We've since sidetracked. We've set pipe and we're getting ready to move ahead. We have not got down into any of deeper zones yet but the wells are in really good shape, and we're anxious to move forward. So -- but we're not going to lay out a timeline, but it's -- things are going well. Charles Meade : Good. I appreciate that color. That's helpful, John. And then the follow-up, back to this Bonboni. And as you can imagine, we all have a lot more questions and you probably want to answer about it right now, but you've already painted a little bit of the picture here, in that it's the same Campanian, Santonian intervals you're targeting there, but they're in a shallower -- they're shallower because it's -- you've got some, I guess, basin thing going away. Can you talk about -- you also mentioned that they're kind of the same setting. So can you talk about whether these are -- I would expect these are more eerily large basin floor features as you move in that Northeast direction, but is that a fair inference to make? Or is there anything else you can talk about the different kind of play versus what you've established already with your string of 4 wells? John Christmann : No. I mean -- and I can answer 1 of the questions on the water depth. I think we're in about 2,000 meters of water with Bonboni. So what you've got happening is as we said, they're very significant independent features. You've got turbidite fan systems. But -- so what you're giving up is a little bit of -- you're kind of trading some of the water depth for depth of the formation. So they do shallow a little bit, which we think is going to be a positive for maturity. But they're big, Charles, and that's what we want to say at this point. We need to go out and explore, right? But we're excited about them. They look fantastic on seismic. They're sizable and there's just a lot of ground to cover between Maka, Kwaskwasi, Sapakara and Keskesi and as you start to move out just that direction to Bonboni. So -- but Campanian, Santonian, a little shallower, very large features, and then there are some things down below that we might be able to get to as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Scialla of Stifel. Michael Scialla : Hess mentioned on it's call that there are 5 penetrations in the Santonian, in the basin, your 3 and then 2 on the Stabroek block. And it sounds like currently drilling Exxon exploration well and Guyana is expected to test both the Santonian and the Turonian. Just curious if you're sharing any data with your neighbors there? And if so, anything you can say about what you've learned there about those deeper zones? John Christmann : Mike, we have not at this point just because after -- other than what Haimara might have done for us, it hasn't been beneficial to us. The -- I think it just shows you the depth and the number of targets we've got. I mean, it's -- the Guyana Basin is turning out to be a super basin. You've got a maturity and source -- multiple source rock that's working. You've got multiple targets. They're high quality, and we've penetrated both the companion and the Santonian with all of ours. And I think a lot of that work will come back with through appraisal when we start to really get into more details about what would be our plans as you move post the appraisal plan. But it just shows you the thickness. It shows you the sand. We had over 900 feet in a Kwaskwasi between the 2 zones. So it just shows you the depth and just what -- how a target-rich this environment is for both. Michael Scialla : Very good. And can you talk about your decision to complete the DUCs in the Permian rather than to generate more free cash flow? And will all of those be in the Midland Basin? Or are you planning on completing any Alpine High if gas prices continue to improve? John Christmann : Well, actually, I think the first 3 are going to be Alpine High. So there'll be 3 there and then mainly in the Midland Basin. But I think the big reason to start this now is really we see an opportunity on the service cost. I mean, costs are down significantly from where they were in the first quarter. And I think it's just -- we see it as an opportunity to go ahead and get out there and get them completed, and then it gives us a little bit of flexibility in terms of how you -- how and when you bring them back. So this is driven off of the cost side and their wells that you ultimately are going to complete, and we just see it as a good window to commit, put 2 frac crews to work and go knock these out. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer : To follow up further on Suriname, you made a couple of references here deeper zone or zones below the Santonian. And I wondered if you could talk any more about that and whether what you would potentially down the road or as part of this well at Bonboni test. How applicable those ones are? How prospective those zones could be across Block 58? And then separately, as you think about 2021, can you just remind us on where you see the ratio of exploration wells versus appraisal wells? John Christmann : Well, it's the likely going to be more appraisal than exploration, but you're going to see a similar pace with 2 rigs. And so there's going to be multiple exploration wells the best way to say it. But we're going to have the flexibility with both those rigs to do both. So you'll start to see the programs kind of blended as we kind of go out and prioritize things. One other thing I would say is when we started out and did all of our early work, we've seen 8 different play types on Block 58. And to-date, we've tested 2. Two of those, the first 2 were the Campanian and the Santonian. We've seen all -- both of those and all the first 3 wells. We attempted to get down to the Turonian, but we ran into too much pressure in the Santonian at Maka. And so there's clearly -- the Turonian would be 1 of the next targets that we'd like to get to. And it's just a matter of figuring out when and which well we want to do that with. We think there's great potential there. And then there's really 5 other types. You start to get pre and post unconformity and some other things that are even a little bit deeper. But that's for a later conversation later down the road. But there's just a lot here in this block. Brian Singer : Great. And then my follow-up is with regards to the cash costs. You talked about some of the volatility from quarter-to-quarter and how strong cash costs and LOE was this quarter, but that that's not necessarily sustainable. Can you just remind us again kind of where you see that path and what you kind of see as a sustainable LOE relative to this last quarter and your guidance for the fourth quarter? John Christmann : Yes. Brian, I think that's a question that's probably, in terms of specific numbers, best left for when we talk about 2021 in more detail, typically in February. But what I would say is that we got after the G&A costs pretty quickly because we knew what we were going to do on an organizational restructure, and we implemented the vast majority of that in the first quarter. And so you saw a significant drop in G&A pretty quickly. LOE takes a bit longer to get organized around that to start attacking the cost and start to see the benefits of that showing up. But clearly, we're seeing a significant reduction in LOE as we're going through -- as we went through the third quarter and into the future, you're going to see more of that. There are some more run rate type of costs that we need to get after. And I think you'll see continued benefit of that as we round the corner into 2021 and even beyond, especially if we stay in this type of price environment. The thing about LOE, as you know, it's just a bit lumpy. And so you get the impacts of things like maintenance spend and turnarounds and pace of workover activity and things like that, that just affect operating costs a lot more than G&A, which tend to be more steady. And on the G&A side, we just get the weird little accruals that we have like this quarter. But I just -- I think instead of giving an accurate number of where we're going on OpEx, LOE on a quarterly basis. Let's see where we're at in February, and we'll give some good context and guidance on 2021 at that point. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Leo Mariani of KeyBanc. Leo Mariani : I just wanted to follow up a little bit on Suriname here. You certainly talked about starting to get after an appraisal program in 2021. You also talked a couple of times about some of these deeper zones. Do you think that the deeper zones, in particular, the Turonian are going to be part of the appraisal plan already here as you look at a few of the wells, Maka, Sapakara, Kwaskwasi. Is that contemplated already for '21? John Christmann : At this point, Leo, we don't have -- we haven't explored or gotten down to the Turonian. So It would be early to call it appraisal until we can get down and actually successfully explore. So we'll find a place. Maybe you might take an appraisal well that we decide to deepen and put an exploration tail on it. But we'll just see how we work through that. But right now, we're -- all the appraisal work is going to be in appraised discoveries, which we've already quantified. Leo Mariani : Okay. That's helpful. And I guess you guys obviously laid out a plan to hold your 4Q '20 premium oil volumes flat next year. You talked about kind of modest declines in North Sea and Egypt. Just trying to get a sense, you are running quite a few rigs in Egypt there. If you can kind of help us out with any kind of order of magnitude of those declines? Are we talking kind of 10%, kind of single-digits? What are you guys thinking here for North Sea and Egypt next year? John Christmann : Yes. I mean I think you look at our base overall decline, both areas is kind of like where North America. It's all around 25%. North America is a combination of our unconventional which is higher and our conventional, which is lower. North Sea is 40s, it is going to be lower. barrels a little higher, but it's in the 25% range. But we will be active there. So it's modest, as we said. And then Egypt is also -- it\u2019s really good conventional rock. On average, our decline rate is probably close to 25% in Egypt. We came into the year running about 10 rigs there and 10 years is -- 10 rigs, you're closer to kind of keeping it, maybe growing it. When we went through the capital cuts, we dropped down to 5. So 5 to 6 is not a lot for when you consider the size of our position, how much production we're making there in terms of the volumes and so forth, it really is -- it's not a lot of activity just for the size, scale, scope of that business. But when we say modest, that means it's less than what our natural base declines would be. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Neal Dingmann of Truist Securities. Neal Dingmann : Got to stay away from Suriname like COVID. So my question is on Egypt. You're running pretty -- been running a 5 rig plan now for some time. Is that -- did economics sort of favor that continuous plan? Could you see maybe even adding more activity there? Can you talk maybe a little bit about just the activity in that play? John Christmann : Yes. Actually, Neal, we came in the year with 10. So we dropped to 5 when we had to cut capital because we cut everywhere, right? It's -- clearly, we've got more activity than we've got cash flow right now to put into Egypt. So the appetite would be for more. But as we're going to -- as we said, we're prioritizing free cash flow, we're prioritizing debt repayment, we're doing that at the corporate level. So Egypt is contributing some free cash flow. It's an area where we could easily double that rig count. But it's going to have to fit into the big mix of how much can we free up to put into Egypt. Neal Dingmann : No. Okay. Makes sense. And then same thing with just allocation. I mean, I guess, the way price -- gas prices are running any thoughts or just any comments you can make around potentially even minimally revisiting Alpine High? John Christmann : Yes. I mean like I said, we've got -- on the DUCs, we're going to go knock out, I think, 3 DUCs at Alpine High first because things look pretty good right now from that perspective. But I think in the U.S., it's the place we would get to in a higher price environment. We have optionality there, but it's going to boil down to, once again, prioritizing debt repayment and free cash flow before we start to put incremental capital back to work over what we'll lay out early next year. But clearly, there's a portion of Alpine High that is -- hinges on Henry Hub or Waha pricing, which has definitely improved, and you've seen that in the numbers this quarter. There's a big chunk of it that's really hinges on NGL prices as well. So it's nice to have that optionality in the portfolio. And we'll just have to kind of look at if we were to put more activity work to work in the Permian, based on price decks where it would go into the oil plays in our Midland Delaware or into the gas or NGLs. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mr. David Deckelbaum of Cowen. David Deckelbaum : Most have been answered today. I just wanted to follow up a little bit just on the DUCs at Alpine High. Are those all in the lean gas window that you'll be completing in the first quarter here? John Christmann : Yes. David Deckelbaum : Okay. And then just Altus has proposed a significantly higher dividend, pretty substantial payment back to Apache. Does any of that value creation change the way that you think about developing Alpine High as an operator over the next couple of years? John Christmann : I think you just got to step back and factor everything in. Clearly, things are -- have improved out there, and we'll just have to kind of factor all that into our math of where we would put capital back to work. But right now, we don't have anything laid out. As we laid out the early look for 2021 at $40 and $2.75, you're not likely going to see any sustained rig programs in the U.S. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. John Christmann for the concluding remarks. John Christmann : Thank you, operator. I'd like to leave you with the following key thoughts : Oil and gas, when produced and delivered in a safe and environmentally conscious manner, dramatically improves the quality of life around the world and lifts hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. As energy production systems continue to evolve, a robust competitive, innovative and cleaner U.S. energy industry will be necessary for decades to come. Apache plans to remain focused on its core business, and we will work continuously to deliver positive impacts on the air, water and communities in which we live and operate. While our industry continues to face many short-term macro headwinds, Apache's strategy has not changed. We are maintaining a flexible capital allocation approach across our diversified portfolio, generating free cash flow, reducing debt and continuously working to lower our cost structure. And lastly, we are choosing to fund a differential large-scale opportunity in Suriname rather than invest in short-cycle projects that maintain or grow production in the short-term. As current commodity prices do not offer attractive enough returns to justify doing so. Thank you for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our progress in the future. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference to your speaker today, Gary, Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Gary Clark : Good morning and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President John Christmann. Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results in 2021 outlook. Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations and Dave Pursell Executive Vice President of Development, will also be available on the call to answer questions. Our prepared remarks will be just over 15 minutes in length with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release. I hope you've had the opportunity to review our fourth quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. And finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations; however, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John. John Christmann : Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today. I will recap Apaches 2020 accomplishments, discuss our fourth quarter results, and provide commentary on our outlook for 2021. First, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the severe weather and devastating power outages experienced here in Texas last week. Nearly all of our Texas-based employees were directly affected. Our field staff worked tirelessly to maintain safe operations, and like millions of Texans, our employees across the state experienced notable challenges, including a lack of power heat, water and many of the modern conveniences we all rely on. While it appears that numerous factors played into the situation, one thing is certain, this event has underscored the need for resilient and reliable energy infrastructure and supply. 2020, brought many unexpected challenges, which required immediate and aggressive actions. Shortly after we issued our initial guidance for the year, a confluence of events signaled clear trouble for near-term oil prices. The Russians and Saudi's in a battle for market share were flooding the market with supply. At the same time, the spread of COVID-19 was emerging as a significant threat to global demand. In response, on March 12, we announced several important steps designed to protect cash flow in the event of a prolonged adverse oil price environment. We reduced our capital budget by 37% from the budget we had laid out just 2 weeks earlier. We cut our dividend by 90%. We initiated a shutdown of all drilling and completions activity in the US and a reduction of rig activity in both Egypt and the North Sea, and with the significant reduction and planned capital activity, we decided to double our target for combined G&A and LOE cost savings from $150 million to over $300 million. While these actions seemed extreme to me, it turned out to be necessary and timely. Throughout 2020, relative to our original plan, we lost over $1.3 billion of oil and gas price-related revenue and more than $300 million of cash flow to working capital. Despite this, Apache finished the year with no increase in net debt when excluding Altus Midstream. We were even in a position to take advantage of volatility in the debt markets to buy back some bonds at a significant discount in lender issue, $1.25 billion, of new bonds to restructure the debt portfolio and protect near-term liquidity. In addition to these actions, our response to the pandemic was equally swift and effective. We protected employees and minimized operational disruptions by quickly implementing a work-from-home program for office staff and changes in the field operating protocols. To date, there have been no known cases of a COVID-19 transmission from one Apache employee or contractor to another. I'm also especially proud of the assistance we provided to the pandemic response in each of the communities where we operate. Finally, as we look back on 2020, one of the key highlights was our exploration program in Suriname, where we commenced activity under our joint venture with Total. We have now made four significant oil discoveries in our first four exploration tests and recently began the appraisal drilling program. Turning to the fourth quarter results, we ended 2020 on a strong note, beating our fourth quarter guidance for adjusted production, upstream capital expenditures and LOE. Oil production in the quarter was slightly ahead of expectations while gas and NGL production was notably strong as we returned all previously curtailed Alpine High volumes to production around the end of October. In the Permian Basin, we resumed completions activity in response to significantly lower service costs and improving oil prices. In Egypt, we continue to leverage our large acreage position and modern seismic program to further enhance our long-term exploration and development inventory. A recent example of this is the Tiam North discovery, which encountered 88 feet of high-quality oil pay. We are waiting on pipeline connections to further assess the reservoir extent and potential for additional development locations. In the North Sea, we made an important oil discovery in the tertiary play with our Loscan well, an offset to Aker BP's discovery on the Norwegian side of the border. In combination with two previously undeveloped Apache discoveries in the tertiary, Loscan is part of a longer-term development opportunity that could contribute meaningful incremental volumes while leveraging existing infrastructure. Looking ahead in 2021, last night, we announced an upstream capital program of $1.1 billion consisting of approximately $900 million for development activities and $200 million for exploration, predominantly in Suriname. This program is expected to deliver substantial free cash flow under our assumed price deck of $45 WTI oil and $3 Henry Hub natural gas. In 2020, we directed a higher percentage of our development capital to international projects to generate better returns in a lower price environment. With the improvement in oil prices, we are returning to a very modest level of activity in the US during 2021. In the Permian, we are currently running one rig and plan to add a second rig at mid-year. This measured approach will advance our objective of mitigating Permian oil production declines. We will likely need to add a third rig at some point to fully arrest the decline. At Alpine High, we have completed two lean gas ducts. They are performing very well, and we are planning five similar completions this spring. While there are no specific Alpine High drilling plans in 2021, we will continue to monitor commodity prices and remain flexible with this asset. Following several years without operating activity in East Texas, we recently added a rig in the Austin Chalk play. This rig will drill a few wells that are necessary to hold our core acreage position and preserve optionality. We believe that Austin Chalk, which is well situated near existing infrastructure, will likely merit future capital consideration. In Egypt, we plan to continue running five rigs this year. Our goal is to stabilize production and ultimately return Egypt to growth, both of which will require the addition of more rigs. We can quickly flex spending in Egypt as conditions warrant and we will monitor oil prices and cash flow for the appropriate time to do so. In the North Sea, the capital program remains relatively unchanged this year with one floating rig and one platform crew. While production from the North Sea is lumpy on a quarterly basis, we believe we can generally sustain output in the 55,000 to 60,000 BOE a day range for the next several years at this level of activity. Lastly, in Suriname, we began the transfer of Block 58 operatorship to Total at the beginning of the year. They are an excellent operator and we look forward to this year's exploration and appraisal programs. On the exploration side, our fourth well, Keskesi, is continuing to explore deeper objectives in the Neocomian. As previously announced, we have selected the location for our fifth exploration well, Bonboni, which will be in the northern portion of the block. Total spud the first appraisal well in Block 58 earlier this month, which will be appraising aspects of both the Kwaskwasi and Sapakara discoveries. I would like to close by discussing Apache's oil production trajectory and provide some perspective on maintenance capital levels. As previously noted, we chose to significantly reduce capital spending in 2020 and plan to maintain a conservative investment approach in 2021. One of the outcomes of this choice is our global adjusted oil volumes decreased by 17% from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the fourth quarter of 2020. This year, we are projecting a much more moderate decline of around 1% to fourth quarter 2021. This implies the $900 million of capital investment we have earmarked for production and development activities is just a bit shy of the spend required to sustain global oil production in fourth quarter 2020 levels. As we look to 2022 and beyond, our goal is to establish a development capital investment budget that will add a minimum sustained production volumes for the long term. While we have experienced a very welcome Oil and Gas rebound over the last three months, our strategic approach remains centered around capital discipline and flexibility. As such, we are continuing to prioritize the retention of free cash flow to reduce debt. A focus on long-term returns over short term growth, aggressive cost structure management, the advancement of our exploration and appraisal activities in Suriname, and continuous improvement in our ESG practices and metrics. In 2020, we increased the weighting of ESG goals in our short-term compensation calculation to 20% and refined our focus areas to air, water, communities, and people. During the year, we emphasized robust employee safety programs related to COVID-19, assisting our communities impacted by the pandemic and advancing programs that foster a more inclusive workplace. We also made good progress on the environmental front with enhanced greenhouse gas data collection and expanded disclosures, particularly with regard to TCFD. We plan to continue to build on these efforts in 2021 with ESG goals that tie directly to compensation and includes specific emissions and water usage targets and enhance our employees' experience. These include delivering less than 1% flaring intensity in the US, achieving fresh water consumption less than 20% of total water consumed, and further progressing our diversity and inclusion programs. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney, who will provide additional details on our Q results in 2021 outlook. Steve Riney : Thank you, John. I'd like to provide a bit more color around Apache's fourth-quarter results, debt management efforts in 2020, and our outlook for 2021. As noted in our news release issued yesterday under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Apache reported a fourth-quarter 2020 consolidated net income of $10 million. On a fully diluted basis, we incurred a loss of $16 million or $0.04 per diluted common share. These results include items that are outside of core earnings. Excluding these items, the adjusted loss was $20 million or $0.05 per share. Company-wide adjusted production for the quarter was 365,000 BOEs per day, a 7% decrease from the third quarter. This was driven by declines in the Permian Basin and Egypt, where we felt the impacts of reduced activity levels after the first-quarter cut in capital spending. These declines were partially offset by increased North Sea production primarily associated with the timing of work-over activity. These operating expenses of $269 million for the quarter were below guidance but did rise a bit from the third quarter. G&A expense of $76 million was at the low end of our guidance range. This was also an increase from the third quarter but mostly due to mark-to-market accounting treatment of certain stock compensation programs. Entering 2020, one of our key financial goals for the year was to retain free cash flow to reduce debt. While the collapse in oil prices made this significantly more challenging, the decisive actions we took to reduce our capital program cut operating and overhead costs, decreased our dividend, and numerous smaller actions enabled Apache to avoid further leveraging its balance sheet. We also took some important steps to rearrange the bond maturity profile and to create a cleaner runway for the next few years. Through a combination of discounted open market repurchases, tender offers, and call options, we reduced shorter-term bond maturities by $600 million with only minor changes to our average maturity profile and coupon rate. We now have only $336 million of bonds maturing before November 2025. We still intend to reduce debt levels through free cash flow retention, and if oil and gas prices sustain anywhere near current levels, we will make substantial progress in 2021. Further to the 2021 outlook, as John stated, we are planning an upstream capital budget of approximately $1.1 billion with the primary goals of advancing our exploration and appraisal activities in Suriname and stabilizing global oil production around fourth quarter 2020 levels. At this point, it looks like our planned capital program will fall just a bit short of stabilizing oil production. But we continue to look for ways to get more out of those investments. More specifically, to our production profile for 2021, we expect US Oil output to decline in the first quarter. This is primarily attributable to 9 days of extensive Permian Basin shut-ins during the recent freeze event as well as the timing of Permian DUC completions during the quarter. Consequently, we expect a significant rebound in US Oil volumes during the second and third quarters before backing off a bit in the fourth quarter to a rate similar to fourth quarter of 2020. Internationally, we anticipate continued declines for the year compared to fourth quarter 2020 levels as upstream capital investment remains below maintenance levels and we will incur more downtime in the North Sea for scheduled maintenance turnarounds. In 2021, we are projecting LOE to rise approximately 7% year-over-year, which primarily reflects the impact of some cost deferrals from 2020. This includes items such as increased work-over spending and platform maintenance in the North Sea. We also expect to see some higher foreign currency exchange impacts associated with the weakening US dollar. G&A will also rise a bit this year to a run rate of around $75 million per quarter. In closing, we are cautiously optimistic for a year of improved oil and gas prices. Even if we fall a bit from the current strip with a very conservative approach to capital budgeting, we should generate significant free cash flow for debt reduction. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Doug Leggate : Thank you, guys. Appreciate all the color this morning. I got one set of questions on Suriname and one on work-overs, if I may. So on Suriname. John, there's been a little bit of incremental information, partly coming from your partner, including as you pointed out in your release, the likelihood of an FID this year, [indiscernible] by 2025 and then you yourselves spoke about am appraisal program that appears to be topping both KwasKwasi and Sapakara. So, I wonder if you could just walk us through what's going on in the appraisal and what the scale might be of our first development in your mind. John Christmann : Doug, thanks for the question. The first thing I'll say is, I really don't want to add a lot of color to our partners' commentary, a long timeline. I mean we're aligned with them. What I would say is given that when we made the press release after the Sapakara discovery, we said that it merited consideration for fast track and had those key ingredients. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that the very first appraisal well is doing exactly that. We've always talked about the first four wells and I'll go back and talk about Maka, Sapakara, KwasKwasi, and now Keskesi. It is really four different deep-water turbidite channels systems. They are placed where potentially you could do some overlap and so forth as you start to think about development. So the nice thing about where that first well is placed, Sapakara West. Number 2, is it will be appraising both aspects of Sapakara and we get to see some KwasKwasi? So, it shouldn't come as a surprise and we're obviously anxious to get the results. When we think about the appraisal program, it's just the next step following exploration. In terms of scale, those are the things we wanted to term through the appraisal program. So I don't want to get into discussions on that at this point, but we're going to be looking to determine things like flow rates, connectivity, those types of things, boundaries, things we might see as you work through this. So we're anxious to get on with it and quite frankly excited with how quickly Total has grabbed the hold and is running with it. Doug Leggate : So, I can't press you on scale, John? John Christmann : You know, we will take it one phase at a time, but we're in appraisal mode. Doug Leggate : Okay. I'll let someone else talk about Keskesi but I think when I ask about the maintenance capital, just the trend that you find, it seems kind of remarkable to us that you're managing to hold the decline as shallow that you are, presumably some of that capital is translating into work-over costs in places like the North Sea. So, I just wonder if you could kind of walk us through how you think about the dynamics of work-overs versus capital. I'm really what I'm trying to drive to is what do you think that sustaining breakeven oil prices for that decline that you seem to be able to hold in 2021. John Christmann : Yes, I mean the thing I would say is, I'm really proud of what our asset teams and our operation staff have been able to accomplish. I mean in a really tough environment with COVID-19 and a lot more protocols added, I cannot say enough good things about our organization and all the hard work that has taken place and you see that, you saw in our cost structure reductions, you see it in these numbers. Not only did we reduce all the drilling rigs in the US, we dramatically cut the work-over rigs in the US and then the other areas as well. And it just goes to show you what the focus and the effort we're putting on it. This year, we did pick up a rig in the Permian. It's the one that made a lot of sense to pick up. We plan to add another rig mid-year and we're going to be just short as I said in the commentary. We probably need to add another one but we don't plan to do that right now to be able to kind of hold our oil production. We're just short of the activity levels in Egypt to kind of hold it, and North Sea is going to be lumpy and we're kind of in that range now, where we think we can manage it between 55 and 60; it's just going to be a lumpy profile with the turnarounds and the types of projects we're bringing on through subsea tie-backs in the Beryl area. But, really, kind of hats off to the operational staff on the asset teams because we're really managing things on cash flow and managing the cost structure really hard, and it's amazing what that's done as a result to the oil curves Doug Leggate : I'll take the details offline John, but I appreciate the answers. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open. Bob Brackett : Good morning. Unsurprisingly, I'll follow up a bit on Suriname. If I think about the $200 million exploration budget that seems to have three buckets, a small amount going to Austin Chalk, some going to Suriname exploration, and then the remainder going to appraisal in Suriname where you're paying 12.5 cents on the dollar effectively because of the JV. Can you break those out any more for us, or should we just kind of think of it as one big lump? John Christmann : Well, Bob, what I would say is, number one, the Chalk money was not appraisal, right. It's development capital. It's an area where we've got leases that are expiring. We had some wells, we had to make a decision there to either drill those wells or let the acreage go. It's not exploration capital. So, we feel good about we've been participating an offset well, so the first thing I would say there. Then, when we look at Suriname, you're right, there are two buckets, but it really will hinge on the types of wells that we're drilling. The exploration wells will be 50/50. And at this phase of our joint venture, the appraisal wells will be 12.5% and so we really didn't break that bucket out. Clearly, the first appraisal well, we're paying 12.5%, and clearly, we're paying 50% of Keskesi. But that dollar amount doesn't change much for where it has been last year when we were running a rig at 50/50 the whole time, Bob Brackett : Okay, interesting. A quick follow-up would be, what's the timeline for Staatsolie deciding whether to back in for 20% and any thought on where their heads are? John Christmann : I mean, they actually have that election at the time you FID a project. So we've got some time there. I think they would like to participate. That is what we've always planned on from the get go. But we would obviously be in a position to take additional interest if you get there. But they would come in on a point-forward basis at FID. Bob Brackett : Okay, that's clear. I'll pause here and maybe hop in the queue later. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeanine Wai at Barclays. Your line is now open. Jeanine Wai : Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. John Christmann : Good morning, Jeanine. Jeanine Wai : Good morning. Our first question is on the 2021 CapEx budget and your anchored at the very conservative 45 and 3. And so, what's your appetite for incremental activity if the strip ends up playing out. We know you said you would be very conservative and you're going to watch things and be very measured. But you said that you ultimately need a third rig in the Permian to arrest decline, you have some really good opportunities in Egypt and you maybe need a little more activity there to mitigate decline as well. So I guess what is your appetite on all of that and where are you most likely to add that incremental activity if it could be done this year? John Christmann : Yes, Jeanine. Right now, our appetite is generating free cash flow that we can set aside for debt repayment. And we're just pointing out that to really stabilize Permian, we do need to add another rig. There may be an opportunity in Egypt, but right now, like I said, we're going to be very disciplined on the capital and we would just be very measured, and right now the appetite is to generate free cash flow for debt repayment. Jeanine Wai : Okay. We like free cash flow and debt repayment; that's good. And then my second question, maybe just following up on Bob's question just now. I might have missed part of it. In that $200 million in exploration CapEx that's primarily Suriname. Is there anything in there for offshore Dominican Republic? I think you are finalizing something on that a few months ago. John Christmann : Yes, there is a small bit there, Jeanine. I mean where we're starting to go through the work and scoping out our 3D seismic shoot. So there is a little bit of money in there, but it is not a lot that it would be captured. Jeanine Wai : Great, thank you. John Christmann : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open. Bob Brackett : Well, I had hopped out of the queue and I guess you put me back in. I was going to let other people get a chance. John Christmann : Bob, I don't know what happened because there is a list here. So I would say the operator puts you back in. But if you want to ask one since we've done it. I would say, I ask it. But we weren't trying to step over anybody else. But there is a list here. Bob Brackett : So, I guess I'll stay on that Suriname theme, which is talking about getting to FID. Is there a drill stem test planned for the year and I'm just kind of surprised by the speed at which you can go from no appraisal to FID in less than 12 months? Is there something you can do to give us comfort on that timeline? John Christmann : Yes, I would just say, our partner is pretty confident in the rock, I mean I'll just leave it at that. I mean we've got four exploration wells now, we've been taking our time with those, collecting a lot of data, we've gone sidewall cores, we've done a lot of PBT analysis. They're not well more than we intend to use. But we've been gathering a lot of data as we've gone along, and we've been doing a lot of lab work subsequent. So, I'll just leave it at that. I mean clearly, we will be doing flow tests with the appraisal program as the other piece, Bob. But I'll leave it there. I don't want to by no means want to do anything but state we're going to the next phase. And I don't want to try to add any commentary to the timeline that our partners talked about. But we are moving on the appraisal wells that we think could be fast-tracked. Bob Brackett : Great, thanks for that. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Harry Halbach with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Harry Halbach : Good morning. I was looking at Total's release and they said around nine wells are expected this year. Can you sort of rough estimates on the timing of those and when we can expect results and kind of just be - for exploration and appraisal wells going forward? John Christmann : I mean, all we really say here is, there's two rigs. I would say that nine wells is their whole portfolio. But we've got two rig programs here that I would say. We drilled three plus wells with one rig line last year on the exploration front. Some of the appraisal wells could go quicker because you've now got penetrations in the basin. But some of these might take longer because of flow test and things. So I would just say we haven't given that color. We've just said, kind of, think of it as an exploration rig line program and an appraisal program, and we're going to move on them concurrently. Harry Halbach : Great, thanks. Appreciate that. And then looking at the US, what does that maintenance mode, sort of, program looks like including Alpine High, and how is the returns to Alpine High stacking up to the Austin Chalk or the other Permian steps just with the moving propane and butane prices lately. Dave Pursell : Yes, Harry, this is Dave Pursell. So, when we think about maintenance in the Permian, we're thinking about it on the oil side. And so when we talk about three rigs, we're thinking about what it takes to keep oil production flat. And we're going to run that map at Alpine. I think when you look at the forward curve on gas and NGLs, even though we have preliminarily positive results from the two DUCs that are flowing back now, given where the oil prices are, it's unlikely in a limited capital budget that those compete within the Apache budget, but if there're economic, we're open to think about partnering with someone to help us move Alpine forward. Harry Halbach : Thanks. Appreciate you all taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Scialla with Stifel. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking my call. John Christmann : Good morning, Mike, Unidentified Analyst : This is actually Guillermo stepping in for Mike. I was wondering if you could provide additional color on the US. You mentioned you adding a second rig. But just to confirm, to hit your guidance number. Will you need that third rig or your comments on adding that third rig are showing some upside potential to your guidance? John Christmann : No, I mean we do not have it planned. It's not in the plan, and obviously if it is not in the plan, it wouldn't be in our guidance. So we were just making the reference point that we're just shy on the oil side and we would likely need one more rig in the Permian, which right now we do not plan to add, I want to be really clear there. It is not in our guidance. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thank you for the clarification. And going forward, you mentioned maintenance mode, is it fair to assume a slight growth in the US to upset international volumes or should it be maintenance all across the board? Dave Pursell : Yes, I think when we talk about this, we're talking about maintenance across the board. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thank you. And the last one for me. I suppose Austin Chuck, a competitor of yours, suggested a well performance that could compete with the Permian. You have similar expectations for those wells? Dave Pursell : Yes, this is Dave again, Guillermo. We've been patient as we've watched this play develop. We have a big acreage positions legacy, we participate in some non-op wells, and we have high expectations, which is why we're drilling these. But again, John said it, it allows us to preserve the optionality of this, again to bring in some additional capital if we choose to. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you very much. That's it for me and have a great day. John Christmann : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gail Nicholson with Stephens. Your line is now open. Gail Nicholson : Good morning. Steve, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that there is some cost deferrals on the LOE side in '20 that are hitting in '21. Could you quantify that amount and then what is the more normalized LOE rate look like post '21? Steve Riney : Sorry Gail, I don't have a quantification of the amount that was deferred from 2020, nor how much of that is actually showing up in 2021; maybe just suggest that you can follow up with Gary after the call, maybe we can get an estimate of that. But I don't think it is a material amount. But it's certainly contributing to the 7% rise in LOE from one year to the next. Sorry, what was the second part of the question? Gail Nicholson : I just wanted to know if we [indiscernible] amount, what would the normal LOE run rate look like? Steve Riney : Yes. Well, I think actually the 2021 amount is probably the more normal amount, because what we've done is, we've just deferred some stuff out of 2020 into 2021. We're not necessarily doubling up a lot of stuff. There could be a little bit in there. So you're probably in the low single digits in terms of the band of error there in terms of doubling up some expense into 2021. I don't think it's got a material effect. Gail Nicholson : Okay, great. And then, in the supplement, you guys talked about the Egyptian decline rate is expected to moderate in 2021. Can you talk about where it is today and where you think it will be by year-end and what is driving that moderation? Dave Pursell : This is Dave again. I think when you look at, particularly in the Permian, you look at the way unconventionals behave. I'm sorry I misunderstood the question. Yes, in Egypt, it's a combination of activity and where we're focused. We have a pretty significant work-over program there that is also really bringing in behind pipe resource. So as production declines, you tend to have an easier time holding it stable. So that's the way the math works there in Egypt. Gail Nicholson : All right. Thank you. John Christmann : Thank you, Gail. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Scott Hanold : Thanks. If I could move back to maybe discussing Alpine High, I mean do you all think there some latent value that's associated with the infrastructure or even maybe the gas, the well in the gas production opportunity here is, and if that's the case, is there opportunities for you guys to do something to get some of that value recognized and specifically too on the infrastructure side with what you all have there as well as your joint venture agreements? John Christmann : No, Scott. There is no doubt. I mean you've got resource there, we've gone in and done a couple of DUCs, which we said there are the first two we've done. They're performing very nicely. I think we've got five more DUCs. It will finish the DUC program with later this spring. So there is opportunity there to potentially bring in some capital. I mean what we've got right now with where our capital budget is, it's pretty tight. So we don't plan to add any, but there is opportunities to potentially look at some things out there. Scott Hanold : Okay. Is that an initiative free all or is that just something that could happen? John Christmann : I mean, I'd just say that there is a lot of things we always work on that you don't spell out. But I'll just leave it at that. It's something that we might be working on or would be thinking about, but there's nothing we've got set up or planned in the activity set. Scott Hanold : No problems. Thanks for that. And then, my next question is, if you all could you remind me in Egypt with the PSC and higher oil prices, at what point do you start getting to sort of cap on the value [indiscernible] ways away from there. Obviously, I think the strip has moved up pretty nicely, and there is obviously some conversation out there whether we get into the next oil super cycle, I just kind of want to remind me the sensitivity to higher oil prices with that PSC. John Christmann : No, I mean the returns there are good. It's just that things shift as you move higher, right. And you get to a point in there where inventory in the US and the Permian actually spends over and be more attractive. So we're not in that range. I mean we're at a point today, if you go back and look last year, we put out some priority sheets that kind of showed investment levels with some price decks and kind of at 50 was where we considered Permian. I mean there's nothing that's changed off that to those priorities that we put out there. Scott Hanold : Understood. Thank you. John Christmann : Thank you. Dave Pursell : Sorry, before we go to the next, if I could just add a bit to that, I'd say that in the $50 to $60 Brent range we've still got plenty of running room where price continues to add meaningful amount of value to the Egypt opportunities. So we're not near any type of ceiling on value opportunities in Egypt, nowhere near that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Brian Singer : Thank you and good morning. John Christmann : Morning, Brian. Brian Singer : Want to follow-up on a couple of the topics, first maybe starting with Suriname and the exploration appraisal budget that's largely the large component of $200 million, in a continued success scenario and reflective of the less demanding capital contracts as part of the joint venture, how do you see Suriname CapEx evolving in years to come and how do the optionality of the call on Suriname capital impact your willingness to flex other assets like Egypt, Alpine High, and Permian? John Christmann : Yes, Brian, I mean the nice thing is as you start shifting more dollars into appraisal and development with the carriers really kicking in. So those numbers don't go up, so it doesn't hinder. I mean that's part of why we structured that deal in the first place. It's really the exploration rigs that drive because of the 50-50. Obviously as you shift into development and assume a new FID something, then your dollars will go up but I mean it's not going to be something we can manage. It's not something that's going to take away capital from other areas. Brian Singer : Got it, thanks. And then, my follow up is trying to piece together some of the comments from your opening remarks as well as other questions as it relates to the CapEx flexibility, you were very nimble in flexing CapEx to the downside in 2020. There seems to be a consideration to be nimble on the upside, and I was wondering if you could quantify if you were to stabilize production in the Permian with a third rig, stabilize production in Egypt and pricing in NGLs and natural gas warranted some greater activity in Alpine High, what the combined incremental capital would represent to make that happen? John Christmann : Yes. I mean, I'd say today, Brian, we're not thinking about trying to be nimble there and I add, right, I mean we pulled our plan. Actually, the rig we picked up in Permian, we've been paying standby rates on. So it made a lot of sense for us to pick that rig up. And when we reduced last year, we drastically reduced. In fact, like I said, we were paying some standby rate. So we're not really motivated right now to try to be nimble and pick up incremental capital, we're just pointing out kind of where those things would be. But, I mean, right now, I think Steve especially wants to see some dollars come in that we can earmark for debt repayment. Brian Singer : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Leo Mariani : I just wanted to follow up here a bit on Suriname. Just wanted to dive a little bit into the Neocomian zone here. What can you kind of tell us about that particular zone? Is that pricing and the other 3 discoveries, and then in general, is it present or maybe just other areas of the basin and has anyone else had any penetrations potentially elsewhere in the basin in this particular zone? John Christmann : Yes, great question. I mean, you know, when we talk about Block 58 in the first place, we laid out more than a handful of different play types and quite frankly our first three play types are all upper Cretaceous. Campanian. Santonian are the first two and then the third one is actually [indiscernible] which is also upper Cretaceous. We attempted to get down to the Maka [ph], but we were unable to do to pressure. With the Neocomian, it is actually a lower Cretaceous target. You know, when I talk about the upper Cretaceous, Campanian and Santonian, they're really deep-water channel and turbidite [ph]. But the Neocomian is lower Cretaceous and it's more shallow-water carbonate reef buildups and so in others. I will tell you that we're not through the first two targets. We've got to Neocomian targets to test in Keskesi. What we have to do is swap out the BOPs. And so we're in the process of doing that. We'll be back to drilling, but these are carbonate reefs. They're pretty visible on the seismic, but this will be the first test for us, and this was an optimal place to go on down through the source rock to the Neocomian, and we're anxious to see. But it is exploration, they're visible. If it were to work and bear the right fluids, then it sets up a whole string of these that are down there. So it's a play concept test. And this just was the logical best place to do the first test for the Neocomian. Leo Mariani : So just to confirm, you guys certainly believe this is present across your block and potentially in other areas in Suriname. And is this kind of the first test that you're aware of in the basin? John Christmann : No. I mean, I'd say when we've got multiple domains across the block. I mean, what you've got to understand is with the geology here, there are play types that are present in as you start thinking about other play types in those portion of the block that are present in some areas but not everywhere. So it gets back down to what the settings where like when it was laid down and I said this was lower Cretaceous, it's more shallow water carbonate reef buildups. And so there's probably a trend of those. There is a trend that moves across our block. But we're focused mainly on our block. And this is the first one, obviously it is exploration. So obviously the chance of success you put in there is likely not going to work. But if it does work, it does set up some more targets for us. But it is an exploration well for a reason. It is a play concept, but if it happens to work, we've got more of these on the block that would be additive and potentially could become part of whatever you did in terms of an FID somewhere down the road. Leo Mariani : Thanks, very helpful color for sure. So I'm going to shift over to Egypt here. You guys obviously made a discovery at [indiscernible] sounds like you're waiting on pipe there. Just wanted to get a sense of when you guys might think you'd be able to get back out there, just high-level timeframe. Is it something that we could talk about just in a matter of months, we can go out there and get a better look at the appraisal, or is this something that could be a longer term that might get pushed into the next year? John Christmann : No, we're pretty quick. The nice thing about Western Desert is we've got good infrastructure. I think the most important thing with [ph] is it proves concept with the new seismic because it's something that we would not have seen with seismic [ph], and while it's a very nice discovery, we need to do some flow testing and things to figure out if there is offsets and how many. Most importantly, it's proof of concept and we've got some other key wells that are on the rig schedule that are coming pretty soon. So, it's just further validation of the time we've invested over the last few years with selling together more acreage, shooting the seismic, and really refining some of our interpretation skills on what we're doing there. So it's just a lens into the rock, which you would have seen otherwise, and that's what we're excited about. Leo Mariani : Okay. Good color. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Your line is now open. Neal Dingmann : Good morning, John and team and thanks for squeezing me in and maybe before Bob's third one. So a quick question for you, look at slide 12 just on the operating cash margins. John, you obviously continue to have great margins on North Sea among the others. I'm just wondering, given the type of margins you continue to see there, why not push that even further? John Christmann : Well, I mean I think the key there is, we're in pretty good rhythm, if you look at what we did last year, we had two platform crews, they're actually one at Beryl and one at Forties, we started alternating those. We're in a pretty good cadence of projects. With the one rig, we've been doing what we could do in terms of prioritizing. We've got a really nice discovery there with [indiscernible]. Yes, I think we're in a good place with where we are. A really good cadence. And when you look at our other types of opportunities across the portfolio while the margins are really good there, I think we're investing and we're showing good work and now we've got a tertiary project that we're going to work on, not ready to talk about yet. But I think we're in a good cadence in the North Sea. Neal Dingmann : Okay. And then just the last. Can you talk just on Egypt with that being, still is it free cash flow independent I assume, John, and we will continue to be. John Christmann : No, I mean we've got a good solid business there. We've built it over 25 years now. You know, we reduced activity when we had to everywhere. I think there's the opportunity as Steve mentioned, we've got a lot of opportunity in Egypt. I think the new seismic and the new acreage is going to open some things up and there is more to do there. But we're always working on preserving cash flow and those cash margins everywhere. And that's something we've been working on across the entire portfolio. Neal Dingmann : Perfect, thank you. John Christmann : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy. Your line is now open. David Heikkinen : Good morning. And first and foremost - yours fared well through the freeze and thaw; it sounds like you did so, that sounds good. John Christmann : Thank you, Dave. David Heikkinen : Also just a couple of quick hits, kind of good luck with the Neocomian. It sounds like, I could characterize it as a string of pearls-type prospect or trend that you hit this one and then you'll have other high spots that are just going to follow along the same depth position. John Christmann : Yes, I mean I would say it's how you could think about it, right. I mean, definitely it's all carbonate reefs working a shallow water environment. David Heikkinen : That's what you're seeing. So you're seeing that type of string of pearls is what I was getting at. John Christmann : Yes, there are multiple targets that this would set up, but it's deep, and there's risk, right. But we'll see what happens? David Heikkinen : And then just, Dave, you kind of hit on some of the base decline tempering and you had it in the slides, I don't think I heard an answer as far as you got the sustainably low level of CapEx and you have a base [ph] declined tempering in 2021. Can you put any numbers to that tempering as you roll into 2022, your sustaining CapEx, sounds like it might go down and your operating expenses don't sound like they would go up some? So I'm trying to think of how things temper through the year. Dave Pursell : Yes. Let's talk about the Permian for a minute. We've given some numbers on base decline in the past, I don't have those at the tip of my fingers, but you know how unconventionals work. As you anniversary in the big first year production decline, you start to moderate the declines on the unconventional and then we have an obviously big legacy position. So think about third or more of our Permian production is a very shallow decline that was Central Basin Platform-type well. So we have an advantaged position. We never got into that super-size growth mode in the Permian. So the first-year declines that we anniversaried in weren't as big as others. So when we look at the capital required for sustaining production, it's kind of in that 3 rig level and you'll see the similar analysis if we look at Egypt as well. It's a bit more conventional declines but you'll see as overall production declines moderate it becomes easier to hold production at those levels. So don't have numbers in front of me, but that's directionally why the maintenance capital is probably lower today than what we've talked about in the past. David Heikkinen : And then, just an absolute debt-level target. Do you have one for this year post the use of cash? Steve Riney : Not necessarily a specific debt level target. My target is as low as possible. So longer term, we've said this before, we're trying to get back to something below 2, approaching 1.5 times debt to EBITDA. We were getting close in 2019 and then 2020 happened. It looks like this year at $55 WTI, we're going to be approaching 2 again. At the current strip, we'd actually be below 2. And that's what the current level of debt. And we should be able to generate a significant amount of free cash flow. At anything $55 or above, there's going to be a huge amount of free cash flow. We're planning on being free cash flow positive for a few 100 million at $45. So 2020-ish [ph] collapse in oil price, we're going to generate quite a bit of free cash flow this year. So I think we're going to get debt to EBITDA back in the right direction by the end of this year to be quite a bit stronger by the time we enter 2022. David Heikkinen : Thank you, guys. That's very helpful. Operator : Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions at this time, I would now like to turn the call back over to CEO, John Christmann for closing remarks. John Christmann : Yes, thank you. I really want to close the following key points. Despite the recent run in oil prices, our priorities have not changed. We remain focused on funding projects that provide the best returns over the longer term. Maintaining a balanced portfolio, generating free cash flow to pay down debt, and continuing to move our program forward. We are taking a very measured approach with our 2021 capital program and you've seen that through the Q&A today. We ended 2020 with zero rigs in the Permian, and the combination of higher WTI prices and lower service costs, make this an appropriate time to restart a very modest drilling program. Our goal is not to pursue growth but to sustain oil production beyond 2021. Our program in Suriname is progressing well. The transition to total as operator has gone smoothly, and we are aligned with our partner on both the appraisal and exploration programs, and most importantly the objective of achieving first oil as quickly and as safely as possible. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress throughout the year. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President for Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead. Gary Clark : Good morning. And thank you for joining us on APA Corporation's first quarter 2021 financial and operational results conference call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John Christmann. Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results and 2021 outlook. Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President, Development, will also be available on the call to answer questions. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 15 minutes in length with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our first quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apacorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. This quarter, we have also introduced the term free cash flow, which is defined on page 20 in the glossary of our supplement. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that, I'll turn the call over to John. John Christmann : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. In my prepared remarks, I will review APA Corporation's first quarter results and discuss our 2021 priorities. Despite some significant weather-related challenges, we delivered a strong first quarter. Specifically, our free cash flow generation was over $500 million. We performed well relative to our production and cost expectations, and our safety performance was excellent. Our total adjusted production exceeded guidance as Permian oil and gas volumes benefited from a faster-than-expected recovery from the February storm impacts. This more than offset lower international adjusted volumes resulting from the impact of higher oil prices on our Egypt PSC cost recovery barrels and some extended operational downtime in the North Sea. Upstream capital investment and LOE were considerably below guidance for the quarter. Together with strong price realizations, these factors contributed to an exceptional quarter of free cash flow generation, all of which is being designated for debt reduction. Looking ahead, the full year guidance we provided in February is unchanged, and we are clearly off to a good start. Turning now to operations in the United States. We reactivated a rig in the Permian Basin, which was previously on standby and picked up one additional rig to drill a 4-well program in the Austin Chalk play of Texas in Brazos and Washington counties. We placed 22 wells online in the Permian, including two at Alpine High. Roughly 5,000 BOEs per day of lower-margin Permian production remains shut in at the end of the first quarter. We are very pleased with the early results and combined with the recovery from Winter Storm Uri are expecting a significant increase in second and third quarter production. On Tuesday, we announced an agreement in principle with the Ministry of Petroleum and the Egyptian General Petroleum Company to modernize the terms of our current production sharing contracts, which is the result of a process that has been underway for more than one year. The agreement is comprehensive, and when ratified by parliament, will result in increased activity, capital investment and oil-focused production growth over the next several years. Currently, we are running a five-rig program in Egypt and continue to build quality inventory across our expanded acreage footprint. In the first quarter, we had another significant oil discovery at our Hadid prospect, the details of which are in our financial and operational supplement. We are projecting Egypt gross production will bottom in the second quarter and trend up in the second half of the year. Debottlenecking of certain pipelines of facilities and the addition of compression capacity will enable us to connect roughly 35 wells in the second half of the year compared to only 20 wells during the first half. These and other 2021 guidance items do not include any potential changes associated with the pending PSC modernization, which we look forward to updating after the agreement is formally approved. In the North Sea, we have been operating one floating rig and one platform rig crew for just over a year. At this pace, we are capable of delivering annual production in the range of 55,000 to 60,000 BOE per day for the next several years. In 2021, we anticipate North Sea volumes will be a bit lower as we experienced unplanned compressor downtime in the 40s field during the first quarter and will incur extended pipeline downtime and platform maintenance turnarounds during the second and third quarters. Following this, however, we expect a sharp rebound in production during the fourth quarter 2021. In January, we announced a discovery at our fourth exploration well in Suriname. An appraisal plan for this well, Keskesi is forthcoming. Total has now fully assumed operatorship of Block 58 and is running two rigs in the vicinity of the Sapakara discovery. Both rigs are capable of appraisal and exploration drilling, which provides ultimate flexibility as we execute our programs. We look forward to providing updates as appropriate in the future. Next, I would like to review our priorities for 2021, which we outlined previously on our February conference call. First, we are budgeting conservatively and focusing on free cash flow generation and debt reduction. This year, our reinvestment rate is currently tracking below 50%. Second, we are aggressively managing our cost structure, and we'll continue to do so regardless of the oil price environment. Third, we are preserving optionality within our portfolio, which will enable us to either develop or possibly monetize certain assets at the appropriate time. Fourth, we are advancing the exploration and appraisal programs in Suriname and are now beginning to benefit from our joint venture carry agreement, which is a very efficient funding source for our differential long-term opportunity in Block 58. Fifth, we are continuing to focus on value creation through organic exploration. We recently announced the hiring of Tracey Henderson to lead our exploration team, which concludes an extensive search that began prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Tracey's experience and expertise are a great fit for the existing APA portfolio and we look forward to her leadership on future exploration strategy and ventures. And lastly, we are advancing ESG initiatives that are relevant, impactful and core to our business. Broadly defined these fall into three areas of emphasis, air, water, and communities and people. In 2021, we have established goals that address routine flaring, freshwater consumption and diversity and inclusion programs. These goals are linked to the annual incentive compensation of not just management, but all employees. We made excellent progress in each of these areas during the first quarter and I look forward to discussing them further as we progress these efforts through the year. In closing, I would like to thank all of our employees across the globe for their hard work in the first quarter And in particular, our field personnel and contractors on the front lines that did an excellent job of safely navigating global pandemic protocols as well as some very extreme weather events. During the historic freeze in Texas, our teams worked around the clock to maintain and restore the hydrocarbon production systems that are vitally important to ensuring the safety and well-being of people and communities during events such as this. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney, who will provide additional details on the first quarter and our 2021 outlook. Stephen Riney : Thanks, John. As noted in our news release issued yesterday, under generally accepted accounting principles, APA Corporation reported first quarter 2021 consolidated net income of $388 million or $1.02 per diluted common share. These results include items that are outside of core earnings, the most significant of which is a $43 million valuation allowance adjustment for deferred taxes in the quarter. Excluding this and other smaller items, the adjusted net income was $346 million or $0.91 per share. We had a very good first quarter with most financial results being in line or better than our previous guidance. Notable exceptions were North Sea production, which John addressed; and G&A expense, which was $83 million. While underlying spend was in line with our guidance of around $75 million, additional charges were recognized for the mark-to-market impact on certain stock compensation programs. First quarter results were significantly influenced by U.S. natural gas pricing volatility associated with Winter Storm Uri. The impacts of the storm appear in several places on the income statement. So let me take you through most of the significant items. Since it determines the reporting of results, I'll first remind everyone of how we handle Permian Basin gas production. We sell all of our gas production in basin, and then manage our long-haul transport obligations separately. We optimize those obligations through the purchase, transport and sale of gas from various receipt points in the Permian Basin and in the Gulf Coast areas. Our common practice as we contract for the purchase and sale of gas is to maintain a relatively balanced exposure between gas daily and first-of-month pricing. As the end of January approach, we had a portfolio of purchase and sales contracts that were heavily skewed to February first-of-month pricing. As we commonly do when this is the case, we use financial contracts to rebalance that exposure closer to 50-50. So given the unusually high gas price spike that occurred in mid-February, this impacted first quarter reporting of results in three ways : first, our underlying sales contracts for produced gas determine the reporting of revenue and realizations. Since approximately half of our underlying sales contracts for February production were at gas daily pricing, you will see a significant increase in both natural gas revenues on the income statement and in the average realized price for U.S. gas for the quarter. Second, our underlying contracts also determine the reporting of revenues and costs associated with our activities to purchase, transport and sell gas to fulfill our transportation obligations. The results of these activities appear in the lines entitled, Purchased Oil and Gas Sales and Purchased Oil and Gas Costs on our P&L. Combined, we incurred a loss of $54 million on that activity in the first quarter, which includes the cost of the transport and the fuel associated with that transport. In a normal quarter, given current differentials, we would expect this loss to be in the $25 million to $35 million range. For the first quarter, this loss was compounded by a volume imbalance in our underlying purchase and sale contracts, which resulted in more gas purchased at the higher February daily prices and more sales at the lower first-of-month pricing. Finally, since we used the financial swap to rebalance our underlying contract portfolio, a good portion of the price spike benefit appears in the $158 million derivative instrument gain on the income statement. If our underlying contract portfolio had been more balanced in the first place, we would not have used the derivative contract, and we would not have this gain. Instead, we would have reported higher gas revenues and a lower loss on sales of purchased gas. I know I went through that quickly, and it can be confusing. If you have further questions, please call Gary's team and they can take you through it in further detail. Free cash flow was also strong in the first quarter, exceeding $500 million. That cash is being used for debt reduction, initially, through the pay down of our revolver. Excluding the consolidated effects of Altus Midstream, we reduced net debt by $339 million in the quarter, mostly through the retention of cash. If the current price environment holds up, we anticipate at least $1 billion of net debt reduction in 2021. Turning now to some additional comments around our 2021 outlook. Our full year 2021 production, capital, LOE and G&A guidance all remain unchanged. Assuming the recently announced PSC modernization in Egypt proceeds on course, we anticipate adding some capital activity in Egypt for the second half of 2021. We will update our guidance for Egypt as we proceed through that approval process. We have also expanded our guidance to include the anticipated effects of purchasing and selling gas in the U.S. to fulfill our transport obligations, which I discussed previously. Lastly, for the remainder of the year, we expect our U.S. natural gas realizations will closely approximate Waha and El Paso Permian pricing. You will find all of our current guidance items in the financial and operational supplement. In closing, we look forward to a very strong year of free cash flow generation of at least $1 billion. This should take us a good bit of the way toward our previously mentioned leverage target of around 1.5 times debt-to-EBITDA under a mid-cycle pricing scenario. You should understand, however, that our more relevant objective is to return to investment-grade credit status. To that end, we will continue to budget conservatively, focus on costs, free cash flow generation and debt reduction and maintain close contact with the rating agencies to ensure that we are taking the appropriate steps to achieve that goal in a timely manner. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Freeman from Raymond James. Sir, your line is open. John Freeman : Good morning, guys. John Christmann : Good morning, John. John Freeman : The first question I had was just on what Steve said there at the end about potentially looking when the new PSC has done in Egypt about adding some additional capital and activity in the second half of '21 in Egypt. And obviously, that's consistent with what you've said in the past, John, about eventually wanting to get the U.S. and Egypt, and 2022 and beyond is sort of more of a maintenance level activity at the least. And so I know in the past, the sort of the commentary around Egypt had been from the five rigs you're currently running, probably wanting to get to at least a couple of rigs more to at least get to that maintenance level. So until told otherwise by you all, is that a fair assumption to assume that, that's kind of where you want to get to in Egypt for the - by year-end? John Christmann : Yeah. I'll make a few comments on - just in general on Egypt, and then I'll have Dave step in a little bit in terms of just rig count and things. But I think what you've seen is, finally, we can get out in the public about a real important step in the process that we've been working through and modernizing our PSCs in Egypt. This is something that we started really prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. But I will tell you, we've been negotiating in good faith and in earnest with Egypt since -- for more than a year. And we're at a point today where after working with the Minister of Petroleum as well as EGPC, we were able to announce this on Tuesday. It's really a framework that sets the future for Egypt. We've been clear not to touch guidance this year. We've now had to go through the approval process, and there are some steps to go through the parliamentary process and ultimately get things ratified, and then we'll be able to talk more about it. But as we go through the year, we will be picking up some activity. There's just a lot of projects in Egypt that had been - become non-competitive because of the terms of the PSC, and this is really going to open up some projects that we're ready to fund. I think this is going to be a win-win for both the country of Egypt and Apache, and it's going to really put us on a much stronger than just maintenance curve for Egypt. So Dave, I'll let you jump in and add a little bit more to that. David Pursell : Yeah. Thanks. Let's step back. And I think, John, you had - you framed your question on what we've said before around wanting to maintain the business. So let's think about maintenance capital. So right now, we're going to spend this year roughly around -- these are going to be round numbers - $900 million of development capital. And that's -- and in that mode, production's in a modest decline. So we think about two places we'd want to flex capital to arrest that decline, that would be in the U.S. in the Permian Basin, primarily, and in Egypt. If you think about a rig line, we've talked about needing potentially a full rig line or a partial rig line in addition to the two we'll have in the second half of this year in the Permian to sustain production and then more rigs in Egypt. And we've talked about seven to eight rigs needed to sustain or maintain production there. And so if you think about a rig line in the Permian and a handful of rigs in Egypt, that puts you roughly $200 million incremental dollars. So our maintenance capital is about $1.1 billion. And the key here is we're not talking about material growth, but we're talking about maintaining production. And that gives us some optionality in the portfolio to where we want to add that capital to maintain our global production. And so that frames the maintenance capital, and I'll throw it over to Steve to add some more color on that. Stephen Riney : Yeah. So we entered, I think, good context for this is that we entered the year as people will recall, it seems like years ago, but ended this year with a plan that was based on $45 WTI, and it had a - as Dave called it, the development capital, the $900 million of development capital, if we just set aside Suriname, was about a 60% reinvestment rate. And at current strip, that same amount of capital is less than a 40% reinvestment rate. So clearly, this is not a reinvestment rate that's going to sustain, and it's not a maintenance level of capital spending. And so we've got a continued slight decline in production volumes. And we've talked about this in the past, that the #1 priority coming into the year when it still looked like a pretty difficult year was that we needed to get debt paid down. We needed to get the balance sheet strengthened an we needed to star the process and that was the most important financial priority. But it is prudent [ph] to spend at of maintenance capital level and maintain the production volume going forward and we probably need somewhere in the neighbourhood of $100 million to $200 million more development capital in order to get into that neighbourhood. And with price where they are, and if they hold up, I think we\u2019re likely to start increasing capital in the second half in order to get that point and most of that is Dave outlined is going to be in the Permian and Egypt, especially Egypt with the modernization efforts as that proceeds and gets the final approval. And I just want to echo on that. The issue there was the old structure of the PSCs and how they work. These were very old vintage PSC structures. And it has nothing to do with the fact that Egypt actually has some very highly economic opportunities in quite a bit of them and just needed the PSC structure that enabled the capital investment in that. And I'll just echo once again John's point that none of this is in our guidance. It's not in the capital for guidance nor is it in the production volume or anything else for guidance. And just to reinforce what Dave said, I'd ask that we please don't throw us into the bucket of growthers [ph] because this is not an aggressive growth spending plan. This is just about a prudent step towards getting to at least a maintenance level of capital spending. John Freeman : I appreciate that. That makes a lot of sense. Just the follow-up related sort of tied to that is I see what sort of the activity has been in Suriname onto the first half of the year were Total made the decision to focus more on appraisal here in the first half of the year as opposed to immediately taking that second rig up to Bonboni for the exploration program. And I guess we'll just wait to see when we ultimately get up to Bonboni. But at the very least, it seems like just given that you are on the hook for 12.5% on appraisal versus 50% on exploration, it seems like that created a little bit of slack in the budget, unless I'm reading too much into it. There's at least a little slack because just by definition, it seems like your Suriname on budget from where you started the year is probably a touch lower just given the -- a little bit more of a skew toward appraisal versus exploration at least through the first half of the year. John Christmann : Yes. And I guess, John, we look at the Suriname budget, we really haven't touched that, right? I mean it's just a timing thing. Bonboni will be the next exploration well. We're obviously anxious to go drill it. And it is 45 kilometers to the north, so it's -- to give you an idea just the scale and scope. So we aren't shifting dollars there, consuming any of that. We've left the Suriname budget kind of where it is. That's just a kind of timing. And quite frankly, we had a pretty good idea what their cadence was going to be as we entered this year anyways. John Freeman : Great. Well, I appreciate it, guys. John Christmann : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Sir, your line is open. Doug Leggate : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I'm afraid I'm going to pound John a little bit on Egypt, just to round out the last John's questions. Steve, I wonder - I know you're going to give us details later on, but I just wonder if I could touch on a couple of aspects of why this could be a big deal for you guys. I think it's 10 years since we published our primer on this, believe it or not. The cost pool, the potential for extension and the implications of that seismic shoot you've been doing, particularly over the oil play in the Western Desert, can you offer any - can you quantify perhaps what no ring fencing can do to the cost recovery or the cost that you have outstanding there and whether you would get an extension on those concessions as part of this agreement? John Christmann : No, I mean, Doug, great question. And you'll have to just wait until we get things finally approved for us to really dive in and give any - a lot of details on it. But I'll just say, we - stepping back, it's a holistic approach. This is something that will be good for Egypt. We've looked at things very carefully. This has been a process that has been very lengthy and very thorough and very comprehensive. And it really is in line with the minister's objective of modernizing the oilfield in Egypt. And I think it's going to have some benefits that's going to enable us to direct more dollars into the drilling programs and into the volumes, which are going to generate more revenue. And so we've got a deep inventory. We're seeing good early results off of the seismic with the Hadid announcement that we had this - within the supplement this go-around. So we're excited about Egypt. And quite frankly, this really puts us in a position where we can fund some projects that are ready to go. Doug Leggate : Forgive me for getting technical on this, John, but I just want to make sure you understand my question. Do you have isolated cost recovery pools that you couldn't recover because they were ring-fenced? And I'm just trying to understand if you could - your share of production could go up sort of overnight as a consequence of being able to tap into those cost recovery pools without any incremental capital John Christmann : I fully understood your question. I'll just say again, I can't get into a lot of details until we close. But this is going to be a win-win for both us and Egypt, and it's going to let us put more dollars in the ground and raise out investments. Steve, do you want to? Stephen Riney : Yes. I'd just say, Doug, we applaud and respect the effort. We just can't get into details because it's still got quite a bit of process to go. But we've made a major milestone here with the agreement in principle, and so we're on our way. And I'd just like to reiterate, Egypt is a fantastic country to do business in and it's got some of the best underlying opportunity in our entire portfolio and long legs on that inventory as we're proving with the seismic and some of the activity going on, on the exploration side. And all we're accomplishing with this is the -- is getting rid of an old, outdated PSC structure that created artificial barriers, to being able to access some of that really attractive opportunity. We'll give a lot more details as we get closer to this. Doug Leggate : Okay. I don't want to hold the call guys. That was actually my first question. My second one, I won't go to Suriname this time, but I'd like to ask you, Steve, about free cash flow. Look, obviously, $500 million adjusting for working capital, $1 billion for the year that current. There is some something not adding up there. I just wonder if you could just frame for us what you think the scale of the more than $1 billion could look like. And more importantly, in a relatively complex portfolio in some people's view, what's the longevity, ex Suriname, of sustaining that free cash flow from the current portfolio? And I'll leave it at that. Thanks. Stephen Riney : Yes. Great, Doug. And I think that I was probably a bit too understated in my prepared remarks. And the point of that was really just to highlight where we've gotten to in one quarter from the plan that we laid out to all of you in February. Our original plan, as I said, we report at $45 WTI. It had somewhere around $350 million of free cash flow. And the point of the - of my prepared remarks was to just indicate that it's over $1 billion now. And maybe I could do a little bit better than that and say that at the current strip, it will be well over $1 billion. We - the only thing I would say about that, though, is we don't give guidance on free cash flow. We haven't done that in the past. And I don't want to start that process on an iterative basis at this point, mainly because there are so many different measures out there of what people call free cash flow. And we've defined what ours is, so we're very clear about that. But we're going to continue not to give guidance on it. And the second thing I would say is, if I go back to my comments earlier around maintenance capital, on the -- if you just set Suriname aside, we're somewhere -- and yet, we continue to invest $200 million in Suriname, you only need about 100 -- somewhere between $100 million and $200 million more to get to a maintenance level of capital on the development side. So we're not far from that. And then -- and so that's what your difference is, it requires $100 million to $200 million more in order to sustainably access this, what I would call well over $1 billion of free cash flow, in this price environment for an extended period of time. And I think what we've shared in the past is that we certainly are confident we can do that for five to 10 years, and we're always looking for opportunities to be able to do that for an extended period of time beyond that. Doug Leggate : Steve, that's really helpful. I mean Suriname's in the stock [ph] for free, and I appreciate the answer. Stephen Riney : Thanks for the question. Gave me the opportunity to be a little less conservative on the free cash flow. Doug Leggate : That\u2019s appreciated, guys. Thanks so much. John Christmann : Thank you, Doug. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Scialla from Stifel. Sir, your line is open. Michael Scialla : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. John, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about potential non-core sales. I just wanted to see if you could talk about that anymore, maybe what assets might be included there and how far along in the process are you. Is there a formal data room planned for that? Or where are you in that process? John Christmann : Mike, thanks for the question. Yes, we typically wait to talk about portfolio transactions and things after we've announced them and so forth. So -- but I don't think it's a big secret. We've had a pretty small package in the Permian that's in the market. It's non-core, some higher cost waterflood-type stuff that we may be in a position to transact on, we'll see. We're kind of working through that now. I think the point is we've got the rig running in the chalk. We're open to looking at what we will and will not be investing in. And as we make progress on things like modernization in Egypt, it's a continual process for us. So a lot of key things going on, but we're open and always looking at various things with the portfolio. Michael Scialla : Okay. Thanks. And I wanted to ask on Suriname, just kind of a follow-up on the deeper test at Keskesi. You ran into the pressuring issues before you could test the Neocomian. I think you said in your release, it nevertheless helped validate your geologic model. I just want to see if you could add any color on that and what you saw in that process. John Christmann : Well, with Keskesi, there were a couple of things that happened there that I think were key. Number one, we got down below the unconformity. I think, number -- and proved that we had charge in hydrocarbons. I mean, that's obviously why we had to stop. And then the other key fact that was important was at that depth, we proved that we could have quality reservoir in those carbonates. And so -- and it also was very, very rich hydrocarbon, not just a dry gas. So we're encouraged by that. It's a prospect and a play that's going to need to be tested. But it's also going to take a different well design than what we had. We were very close to getting down to the first target. There were two targets that we're going after. But we had to call it early and we did. But that's something we'll be working with our partner, Total, on to come back with an exploration well that will test those Neocomian targets at a later date, because both of us were encouraged by what we had seen leading up to getting very close to the first target. Michael Scialla : Great. Thanks, John, Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai from Barclays. Ma\u2019am you line is open. Jeanine Wai : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. John Christmann : Good morning, Jeanine. Jeanine Wai : Good morning. Thanks for the time. Maybe just two quick ones on the balance sheet. Can you talk about the medium-term plan for adjusting the balance sheet? You've got a ton of free cash flow on the horizon, so there's a lot of options there. Do you intend to retire debt as it comes due? Or are there opportunities to retire or further refinance at lower rates earlier? Stephen Riney : Yeah. Jeanine, so this is Steve. Yes, we've talked about the fact that we are -- we've talked externally about -- we're targeting at least getting down to 1.5 times debt to EBITDA. We may need to move lower than that. Certainly, the direction things have been moving in general over time. We believe something at or below that number is going to be what's required to get back to investment grade. And as I said in my prepared remarks, that's ultimately the real underlying goal, is to get back to investment grade, and we're going to do whatever it takes to do that. We're clearly making some tremendous progress this year by our estimation at the current strip. We'll have net debt-to-EBITDA down to approaching 2, about 2.1 times debt-to-EBITDA at the end of this year. Even if you adjusted that to -- well, what would happen if we were in a $55 price environment for 2022, we'd still only be slightly higher than the 2.1, maybe 2.2 or 2.3. So it doesn't move up considerably. So we're - we've made tremendous progress or will make tremendous progress this year if prices hold up. As far as how we're going to do that, we haven't gotten into the details of exactly how we're going to do that. But it obviously has to result in paying off some of the bonds historically. What we've generally said is we're going to do it the same way we've done it in the past. We've done combinations of open market repurchases. We've done 10b5-1s. We've done tender offers, refinances, and we will do all of the above. I don't believe -- at this point in time, I don't believe you'll see a material amount of refinances going forward until we get to -- back to investment grade. We've got about a little over $335 million of debt maturing in the next couple of years, and that will just be paid down as it matures. Jeanine Wai : And so maybe following up on, so the ultimate goal is to get back to investment-grade. How do you view that versus more meaningfully increasing the dividend? Or are those two things kind of mutually exclusive? Or do you think you can do both of them the same time? Stephen Riney : Yes. I - obviously, both of those are important. I think we have to get the balance sheet in order and get debt down and get at least at a minimum, get back closer to a point where we think achieve investment grade before we start looking at the dividend again. And as we've discussed before and I think we've talked with you specifically about it, we look at debt paydown as a return to shareholders because every dollar of debt that we can get off the balance sheet today will add more than $1 to the market cap of the company, we believe, because we think that the debt level is actually weighing on the share price. And so while it's not the same as a dividend and we recognize that, it does benefit shareholders directly with debt paydown. And we haven't made any specific plans as to what we're going to do. We've got quite a bit still to accomplish on the debt paydown effort. We - as I said, we'll accomplish quite a bit of that, hopefully, this year. We'll need to do more of it in 2022. And at an appropriate time, we'll reconsider whether we need to bring the dividend back or whether we want to start bringing the dividend back and we'll certainly hold out the option that we could start looking at the dividend prior to actually getting investment grade. That is clearly an option for us. Jeanine Wai : Thank you for all the detail. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you, Our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Sir, your line is open. Charles Meade : Good morning, John to you and the rest of your team there. John Christmann : Good morning, Charles. Charles Meade : I wondered if I could go back to Egypt and just ask a question -- I think I know the answer. But in principle -- I recognize you can't talk about the details yet. But in principle, are we talking about that there's some opportunities that are obvious to you and obvious to Egypt, but it's also obvious to Egypt that you're not pursuing them because of the -- maybe some oil price thresholds that are quite low in those PSCs, and so that's the win for them? Do I have the right framework? John Christmann : Yes. I'll just say that there were some projects that the PSC was making them less competitive, right? And by modernizing the PSCs, there's projects that move up the queue that we can fund, and we'll be looking forward to fund. So there's no doubt it's a critical step. And this is not -- it's not uncommon. You got to understand these PSCs, we've been in Egypt for over 2.5 decades now. A lot of these fields have been operated since the mid-90s. And so stepping back and going through this, this is just the evolution that's required in an oilfield, right? So. Charles Meade : Yes. That's right. I imagine if you'd ask the people who had written them, if they were going to stand for all time, they would have said absolutely no. But If I can ask the second question about -- you mentioned in your prepared remarks and you guys put out a press release about bringing Tracey Henderson on to head up our your exploration. So she has some experience drilling offshore Suriname. And I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about more -- a little more about where you see her getting rubber to the road or really helping your process both in near term and the long term. I know that you're still the operator of Block 53, if I'm not mistaken. So that's one obvious place in the near term. But can you talk a little bit about how you expect her to fit in and contribute? John Christmann : Well, I mean, I think it's all about building the executive leadership team that we want for long term. And Tracey brings a wealth of experience and a wonderful skill set. She's worked in small publicly traded companies, so she understands where they had to explore for a living. I think she'll bring a lot of expertise, a lot of experience. She's built exploration teams. I think we've got a lot of key pieces here that she'll be able to come in and hit the ground running and work with, and a portfolio that fits a lot of her expertise. So she was absolutely our #1 candidate, and we're thrilled to ever join us. Charles Meade : Thank you for that color John. John Christmann : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gail Nicholson from Stephens. Ma\u2019am your line is open. Gail Nicholson : Good morning. We came in slightly below guide for 1Q. Can you talk about the drivers here and the ability to replicate any of those 1Q savings going forward? Clay Bretches : Yeah, Gail, this is Clay Bretches. And with regard to the LOE, it was just a masterful performance by our operations folks in the field. They did a great job. They understood the task that was at hand. Last year, we went through some significant cost-cutting exercises. We identified the areas where we could cut cost. We knew that those needed to be sustainable, especially when we were looking at commodity prices in 2020. So we had an all-hands-on-deck approach to this. There was a lot of bottoms-up initiatives that led to this LOE reduction. It wasn't short term. It wasn't just deferral of expenditures, maintenance, et cetera. There was some of that, but it wasn't significant. The big issues here in LOE reduction had to do with those initiatives that took place. If you take a look at where we had the most significant reductions, it was in the Permian. A lot of that had to do with the wells that we shut-in. We have a lot of wells that are what we call frequent flyers, wells that go down a lot. We took those out of service, and those are still shut-in because they cost us a lot of money and they're not economic to run. Furthermore, a lot of our waterflood properties that just weren't providing the economics, we went through and looked at these on a well-by-well, field-by-field basis, there's a lot of water that's not being injected right now because it's really expensive to inject that water. We still have approximately 300,000 barrels a day of water that we don't inject, which saves us a lot on electricity, a lot on maintenance, a lot on personnel overall. So in general, it's just the approach that we took. We want to maintain that. That's something that we talk about as an operations group on a regular basis. How do we maintain this low LOE profile as we go forward? In light of the fact that commodity prices are increasing, we do have concern about inflation and service costs. So we focus on making sure that we keep that LOE down, continue to strive to find initiatives that are going to keep the LOE down and flat in light of the fact that we know that there's going to be some inflationary pressures going forward. So really, again, just kudos to our operations team for getting us to where we are and maintaining those levels. Gail Nicholson : Okay. I appreciate the clarity. And then just moving kind of on the ESG front. In regards to carbon capture, some of your North Sea peers are looking at carbon capture projects. Are you in the process of potentially doing anything in that vein? And/or do you see any potential for carbon capture of projects on your North Sea portfolio? John Christmann : Yes. Gail, on the ESG front, we've emphasized there's really three areas. I mean we're focused on air, water, communities and people, right? And I think the key for us, too, is we're focused on near-term projects that we can do that can make an impact. And I think the area we're focused on right now mainly is flaring And in the -- basically in the U.S., where we're committed to eliminating our routine flaring by year-end this year as well as delivering less than 1% flaring intensity. So key goals there. We're looking at things in the North Sea. But as far as right now, the near-term things, we're looking at some of the low-hanging fruit that we can get after. I don't know if, Clay, you want to add anything on the carbon side in the North Sea. Clay Bretches : No. Just what you said, obviously, there's a price on carbon in the North Sea, which creates opportunities. Anytime you have a price on carbon, that creates some economic incentives to study carbon capture. So we will take a look at that anywhere that we see a price on carbon. It is something that we were paying attention to in the North Sea. But like John said, what we're focused on right now from an ESG standpoint are those areas that we have control and which are going to be impactful for Apache. So the really big initiative for us from an ESG standpoint is to end our routine flaring in the U.S. onshore by the end of 2021. And we think this is really significant. You hear a lot of ESG claims out there that talk about some type of initiative that's aimed at 2030, 2040, 2050. What we're doing is saying we're going to end routine flaring by the end of this year. And we think that's really significant. And it represents a significant commitment by Apache to do the right thing and to produce responsibly. And we've shown that over and over. If you take a look at the investment that we have made in midstream solutions to make sure that we were performing responsibly, not only with Altus Midstream with those gathering and processing assets that we have in the Delaware Basin, but also our significant investment in the Gulf Coast Express pipeline, Permian Highway pipeline. Both of those are moving over four billion cubic feet of natural gas out of the Permian Basin that not only serves Apache, but it serves a basin in general. Getting that gas out of there and creating opportunities for others to get gas that otherwise would be flared out of the basin. So we've put a lot of investment in those pipes. We've put a lot of commitment in terms of firm transportation to anchor those pipes. So we feel like we're really doing a lot that impacts the gas flaring and ESG initiatives in real time.\u2019 Gail Nicholson : Great. Thank you. Great quarter, looking for the back half of the year. John Christmann : Thanks, Gail. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Scotiabank. Sir, your line is open. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Good morning, guys. John Christmann : Good morning, Paul. Paul Cheng : Can I just get some maybe your intention for Egypt and Permian over the next several years. I mean we know that you -- most likely than not, that probably going to raise the activity level to into the sustaining level for those two areas. But over the next several years that are we going to trying to maintain them flat or that you were trying to grow a bit. And is that in any shape or form tied to your debt reduction target for that? How that decision-making or that type process is going to be? That's the first question. The second question is certainly, Total have indicated they will sanction the first development this year coming on stream in 2025. Any kind of color you can provide that which discovery is going to be target and whether that you will be doing similar to what Exxon did in these are one using a smaller ship sort of as an early production system, trying to learn the rest of -- learn the whole operation before you go to the [indiscernible] operation. Thank you John Christmann : Well, thanks. Two good questions. I'd say, first of all, when we look at the portfolio, we've said for 2021, not to touch guidance or anything right now. So modernization in Egypt is going to have a big impact for us. It is going to enable us to put Egypt back on a track where we can grow those volumes, and I think it's going to be very beneficial. I think in Permian, we've got one rig running today. We're planning to pick up a second rig midyear. As David has said, we need to grab another rig there to kind of maintain our Permian volumes, and that would be an objective of ours But I think as we look going forward beyond that, we don't see trying to ramp up to a big activity pace and try to grow aggressively, that we think we want a modified moderate investment pace where we're investing very wisely and very -- making very capital -- efficient use of that capital. Your question on Suriname, clearly, we're underway with -- as Total as operator. They've got two rigs running in the vicinity of the Sapakara discovery. We have not put out any time lines, and I don't see a anything magical about when you need the FID a project. I think the key for us is doing the appraisal work collecting the data, so we can ultimately FID a project. There's lots of optionality. You are very likely looking at potential FPSOs like what's been done next door, but it's just really premature to get into anything there. I don't see anything magical about a year-end time line to make a first oil 2025. I think that could easily slide into next year and still make that type of time frame. So we're not pressing for any hurdle there. You want to do the work, you want to do it right, and then you want to be in a position to FID the projects when you're ready to FID the projects. Paul Cheng : John, can I just go back into the first question that you said you're not going to increase the activity and trying to have a major growth. Is that a function to your debt reduction target that -- because you haven't reached that yet? Or that is just because you think the world doesn't need more oil even though the commodity price is strong. Stephen Riney : No, I think -- Paul, I think in the short term, it's a function of needed debt reduction. But I think longer term, it's just in the -- it's part of the function of more cash flow for shareholders. And we've been in a position for quite some time that growth was not an objective that was worth chasing in and of itself. And that this business needs to be something that's returning cash to investors. We need to get the balance sheet fixed first in order to do that. As I mentioned earlier, we think reducing debt is a return to shareholders, just a different type. But longer term, when we get debt where it needs to be, we're not going to be looking for double-digit growth, but we're going to be returning cash to investors. Paul Cheng : And Steve, I just want to -- reaffirm that. I think earlier, you guys said that you're going to add a rig in Egypt. That's not included in the current budget. And same as that for Permian, if you're trying to maintain as a flat production. So if we're going to do those, then that means that your overall capex for this year is going to be higher than $1.1 billion, right? Stephen Riney : Yes. Let us be clear one more time maybe. We are not changing our guidance at this point in time. We just said that if prices hold up and we continue to make progress on the Egypt modernization, we may be looking at some further capital spending or capital activity in the second half of the year. If we were committed to doing that, we would be looking at contracting rigs and we would be telling you we're changing guidance, but we're not doing that right now. Paul Cheng : Okay, perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani from KeyBanc. Sir, your line is open. Leo Mariani : Yeah. Hey, guys. I just wanted to follow up a little bit on Egypt here. In terms of the Hadid discovery, can you maybe just give us a little bit more color around that? Is this something that rose out of the new concessions and new seismic that you folks shot? When do you see first production from that potential discovery here? And then additionally, do you think that this discovery unlocked a bunch of other drilling opportunities for you late this year and into 2022? John Christmann : Yes, Leo, great question. It is a result of the new seismic. It was 2013 when we shot our last vintage, and then we started shooting this new seismic in really the '18, '19 still shooting process out there. It's given us more clarity where we can see things that are more subtle, and we're starting to move really from just drilling big bumps to things that have a stratigraphic element to them. This is a trend where it sets up multiple wells within the discovery area, but it also sets up very similar-looking prospects that look much like it. So it really gives you some insight into the lens we have now and the opportunity that we know sits out there that we now can start to crystallize as we continue to drill more wells off of the new seismic and refine that process. So on timing, I don't have that for you today. I can let - I think Clay can jump in on that on - actually on the Hadid well. Clay Bretches : Yes. So Leo, this is Clay Bretches. And on the timing for the Hadid we're laying pipeline right now, and we're making sure that we have a pipeline that is sized for -- appropriately for the Hadid, but also for growth opportunities, just like what John said, based on follow-on wells in and around Hadid. And that pipeline is being laid right now and should be in service in the fourth quarter of this year. Leo Mariani : Okay. That's helpful. I just want to jump over to the North Sea here. You guys certainly had some unplanned downtime in the first quarter, but you're also saying there's going to be -- it sounds like some more of that in the second quarter and then maybe some normal planned turnarounds in the third quarter. Could you give us a little bit color on how you see North Sea volumes progressing? Would you expect second quarter to go down further or would be more flat with first quarter? And then just kind of what's the cadence into third quarter? Is it down further? And I think you guys were saying that fourth quarter production should be up a lot. Just wanted to understand the cadence in the next few quarters. John Christmann : Yes. I mean, it's all planned activity. Second and third quarter were, from the get-go, planned. It's pretty heavy maintenance periods. We were unable to do some of it last year, so they're going to be a little heavier this year. And then you're going to have a really strong rebound in Q4 as we bring everything back online. So I think the -- our guidance for the year is -- we reiterated that. And I don't know, Dave, is there anything else on shape or anything for Qs two and three for North Sea. David Pursell : Yes. Just to reiterate what John said. The TARs [ph] in the second and third quarter, probably a little larger than normal because they were abbreviated last year because of COVID issues. So we'll see second and third quarter impacts, rough order of magnitude, those are kind of in the 6,500 barrel BOE per day range expected through the quarter for second and third quarter just on those impacts, and we'll see a rebound in the fourth quarter. So again, as John said, no change to guidance. Leo Mariani : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann from Truist Securities. Sir, your line is open. Neal Dingmann : Thanks for squeezing me in guys. Just my last question, I don't know if there's anything about this, but I'm just wondering. We've seen a nice run continue not only in oil, but in gas. Any thoughts on potential incremental activity in Alpine this year or early next? David Pursell : Yes. Neal, this is Dave Pursell. From an activity standpoint, we have five DUCs that we're completing as we speak. We completed two earlier in the year. We're going to evaluate the performance of those. But given where oil prices are, and we've got -- as we've talked about on this call, we have a constrained capital budget with oil in the 60s, it's hard for Alpine to compete with oilier capital in the Permian and in Egypt. So our view is let's evaluate the performance of the DUCs and then we'll decide or evaluate potential third-party capital. Neal Dingmann : Sure. Makes a lot of sense. And then just lastly, quickly, are you seeing any just OFS, whether cost inflation, not only domestically, but I'm just curious, internationally, do you see much over on the two plays? David Pursell : Yes. On well capital, so far, the answer is no. We would - we're looking for it. We'd anticipate it. We're looking at steel to see if we see inflation on the OCTG side of it. I think where we're feeling the inflation, and Clay talked about it on the LOE stuff, your basic operating chemicals and diesel costs. So we're seeing a little more real-time inflation on the -- at the LOE level and less at the capex level right now. Neal Dingmann : Very helpful. Thanks again for squeezing me in. David Pursell : You bet. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions in queue. I will now turn the call back to John Christmann. Sir, please go ahead. John Christmann : Thank you. I'd like to leave you with the following parting thoughts. Delivery was very good in the first quarter, and we have reiterated our full year guidance. Commodity prices continue to be constructive, and we have clear visibility into at least $1 billion in free cash flow this year. We are seeing the benefits of our diversified portfolio as increasing volumes in the Permian over the next two quarters will more than offset the seasonal planned maintenance downtime in the North Sea. Activity will also be picking up in Egypt as we move into the back half of the year. We have successfully transitioned operatorship on Block 58 to our partner, Total, with two rigs conducting very active appraisal and exploration programs for 2021. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress throughout the year. That concludes our call today. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the APA Corporation's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President for Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gary Clark : Good morning and thank you for joining us on APA Corporation's second quarter 2021 financial and operational results conference call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John Christmann. Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results and 2021 outlook. Tracey Henderson, Senior Vice President of Exploration; Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President, Development, will also be available on the call to answer questions. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 12 minutes in length and the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our first quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apacorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that, I'll turn the call over to John. John Christmann : Good morning and thank you for joining us today. In my prepared remarks, I will review APA Corporation's second quarter results and comment on our outlook for the remainder of 2021. The company is making good progress on several key initiatives. We generated nearly $400 million of free cash flow during the second quarter and, at June 30, held approximately $1.2 billion of cash, which will be used primarily for debt reduction. In May, we reached an agreement in principle with the Egyptian Ministry of Petroleum and Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation to modernize the terms of our production sharing contracts. The final draft of which has now been completed and will move to Egyptian Parliament for ratification in the fall and then to the President for his approval. We are pleased with the progress thus far and believe that this modernization will return Egypt to the most attractive area for capital investment within our portfolio, and will put Egyptian oil production back on a growth trajectory. In Suriname, as announced in our press release last week, we drilled a successful appraisal well in the Sapakara area moving us closer to our goal of sanctioning the first commercial oil development. We are generating strong results from our DUC completion program in the Permian. And during the second quarter, we closed two smaller scale Central Basin platform asset sales, as we continued to optimize our portfolio. On the ESG front, APA continues to deliver on our key initiatives and safety metrics. Most notably at the beginning of the year, we established an ambitious goal of eliminating routine flaring in the US in 2021, and I am pleased to announce that we will achieve this goal in the third quarter. This is the result of adding compression where appropriate, setting clear expectations and rules in the field and improving hydrocarbon processing at location. These efforts have also helped to drive down our flaring intensity, which is tracking well below our goal of less than 1% for the year. We are also making great progress on our water initiatives. In the US, we are currently at 3% freshwater usage, which is also well below our goal of less than 20% for the year. Turning now to operations. Total adjusted production exceeded our guidance in the second quarter, with the US benefiting from better than expected performance throughout our Permian Basin DUC completion program. This more than offset lower international volumes, where higher oil prices impacted Egypt cost recovery volumes and we experienced extended operational downtime in the North Sea. Upstream capital investment was below our guidance for the quarter, primarily due to timing while LOE was slightly above expectations. Our full year outlook for these items remains unchanged. In the US, we placed a total of 27 wells online in the Permian, including five at Alpine High. In aggregate, these wells are significantly exceeding internal expectations, driven by a combination of optimization initiatives. This effectively completes our backlog of Permian DUCs, so you will see fewer well connections during the second half of the year. You will also see Permian production come down a bit in the second half of the year, as our current pace of drilling and completions is not sufficient to offset the initial declines from the DUC completion program. As previously planned, we added a second Permian Basin rig in late June, which will enable a steadier pace of completions. In the East Texas, Austin Chalk, we drilled three operated wells, and are pleased with the results thus far. We are evaluating the addition of a third drilling rig in the US, as previously noted, which would put us on a path to sustained oil production. Given strong oil prices and the recent improvement in natural gas and NGL prices, all of our US asset areas are attractive candidates for this rig addition. In Egypt, we have increased our rig count to eight and continued to build high quality inventory across our expanded acreage footprint. Facilities expansion constrained our ability to connect wells in the first half of the year and contributed to a decline in gross production during the second quarter. As we wrap up, our facilities work, well connections will increase significantly in the second half of the year, and gross production will begin trending up. In the North Sea, we continue to operate one floating rig and one platform rig crew. During the second quarter production was impacted by compressor downtime, extended platform turnaround work and third-party pipeline outages. Some of this carried over into July and when combined with planned maintenance turnarounds at Beryl will lead to only a modest production increase in the third quarter. Once we conclude this heavy maintenance period, production volumes in the North Sea should return to more normalized levels in the fourth quarter. In Suriname's Block 58, we are running two rigs. Upon completion of drilling operations at Sapakara, the Maersk Valiant will mobilize to the Bonboni exploration prospect approximately 45 kilometers to the north. Following Bonboni, the Valiant will return the flow test the Sapakara South-1 well. Drilling activities continue at the Keskesi South-1 appraisal well with the Maersk developer. On Block 53, where APA is the operator and 45% working interest owner, we recently signed a contract with Noble Corporation to secure a drillship that will commence exploration operations in the first quarter of 2022. Before turning the call over to Steve, I would like to comment on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Oil prices, year-to-date, have averaged well above our original budgeted level of $45 WTI. And more recently, gas and NGL prices have also begun to significantly exceed budgeted levels. This has created a very welcome amount of incremental free cash flow, and will enable substantial progress on debt reduction this year. More importantly, our 2021 capital program will remain unchanged at $1.1 billion, even if we decide to add a third rig in the US later this year. In June, we opened our Houston and Midland offices and began welcoming back the majority of our office staff, as permitted by regional guidelines. It has been great to see more in-person collaboration in settings that we took for granted prior to COVID-19. And we will remain diligent with our protocols to keep employees safe. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney, who will provide additional details on the second quarter and our 2021 outlook. Stephen Riney : Thank you, John. As noted in our news release issued yesterday, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, APA Corporation reported second quarter 2021 consolidated net income of $316 million or $0.82 per diluted common share. These results include items that are outside of core earnings. Excluding the second quarter impacts of divestiture gains, movements in our tax valuation allowance, mark-to-market derivative losses, and other smaller items, adjusted net income was $266 million or $0.70 per share. Most of our financial results were in line or better than guidance this quarter with just a few minor exceptions. As we've discussed in the past, we continuously review our portfolio for the right time to monetize assets that no longer compete for funding. In the second quarter, we closed the sales of two such packages in the Central Basin platform. These were mostly lower margin conventional waterflood assets, which were producing roughly 2500 barrels of oil per day. Proceeds from the sales were $178 million. As we look forward to the rest of 2021, we are updating some of our full year guidance items. We are effectively increasing us production guidance by 4500 BOEs per day and decreasing international adjusted production guidance by 14,500 BOEs per day, compared to the midpoint of the previous respective ranges. This net decrease of 10,000 views per day for the full year reflects the strong underlying performance of our US assets but it also captures the impact of a few offsets; the unplanned operational downtime in the North Sea, the impact of higher oil prices on Egypt cost recovery barrels, and the recent Permian Basin asset sales. We are reducing full year DD&A guidance by $125 million, which reflects a combination of price-related reserves additions, and the impact of our changing production mix with lower North Sea volumes and higher US volumes. Finally, other than an increase to our expected UK tax expense, due to strong commodity prices, there are no material changes to the remainder of our guidance for the year. On a longer-term perspective, one of our most important strategic goals is to return to investment grade status, which will require a significant reduction in debt. In the near term, progress towards this goal takes priority over the capital program, which today is still below a sustaining level of development capital. In other words, we are willing to under-invest slightly in the short term to build balance sheet strength and financial resilience for the longer term. We entered 2021, anticipating a multi-year process of debt reduction. With this price environment, we're making significant progress, more quickly than we thought possible. In the first half of the year, at an average WTI price of $62, we delivered upstream only free cash flow, which excludes dividends received from Altus Midstream of $860 million. Assuming current strip prices for the second half of 2021, upstream only free cash flow for the full year is expected to be around $1.7 billion. The vast majority of this cash will be available for debt reduction. The rating agencies will ultimately decide when we return to investment grade, but we will clearly make significant progress in 2021. With meaningful progress on debt insight, we would remind everyone that we have a strong portfolio of investable inventory and it would be prudent to at least increase development capital to a production sustaining level. We estimate this would require around $1.2 billion of annual investment versus the $900 million we are investing in development capital this year. At this investment pace, and assuming prices remain flat over 2021, as we look out to the next several years, APA is capable of generating upstream-only free cash flow of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion annually. This is all based on our current portfolio of assets and to highlight what the current portfolio can deliver, this analysis assumes no further investment or future benefit from Suriname and no free cash flow uplift associated with Egypt modernization, which is still pending. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Thank you. Good morning. Good morning, everybody. John Christmann : Good morning, Doug. Doug Leggate : One for Steve and one for you, John, if that is okay. Steve, thank you first of all for clarifying the more than $1 billion of free cash flow, that is much appreciate. The question I have is sustainability of that. The key thing for us is the value of the base business is how long you can sustain that cash? Well, you said for a significant amount of time, can you put some parameters around that, so we can kind of back into what the market isn't paying for, and I've got a follow up please. Stephen Riney : Yeah, Doug and let me actually put some parameters around the whole 1.6 billion to 1.7 billion of free cash flow that I talked about in my prepared remarks. And John said, it gets confusing because of the same numbers but John talked about 2021 being 1.7 billion of free cash flow, and that's based on first half actual prices plus the second half strip. And that is our internal, most current outlook for the business for the full year. In 2022, we say 1.6 billion to 1.7 billion of free cash flow and that is sustainable for a run of years and we can talk about that a bit. I put two caveats on that. Number one, we're not attempting, in any way, to give guidance for '22 and beyond at this point in time. That's a hypothetical case but I want people to understand that that's a very realistic case. We know our inventory today better than we've ever known it. And we've put together a realistic case, based on what we would actually invest in, in the current price environment. As I said, in my remarks, it is focused on the current portfolio. So, we've kind of chosen to eliminate the noise associated with Suriname, doesn't have any future Suriname CapEx, no future Suriname production or free cash flow. And just to be clear, we don't want that to come across as any reflection on our feelings about Suriname because that doesn't reflect that at all. The prices that we used in that case are exactly the same as the 2021 prices because I didn't want those to affect the comparability of the results. The CapEx, as we know, 2021 is 1.1 billion; in our hypothetical case for '22 and beyond, it's 1.2 billion. There's a difference though, the 1.1 billion includes $200 million of exploration spend, which is mostly focused on Suriname exploration and appraisal, so there's only 900 million of development capital in there. The 1.2 billion for '22 is all development capital. And we've talked about a number of slightly lower than that, 1.1 billion is sustaining capital development or capital spending; that was when we were talking about sustaining oil production volume. The case that we put together now sustains the 1.2 billion sustained BOEs on a per day basis. So, it actually is full production sustaining for a run of years; that's adding capital to mostly to Egypt and to the US. Under this case, there's a slight decline in volume from '21 to '22, on an annualized basis, but then it's sustained from 2022 forward. So, some people might be wondering, okay, you're spending 100 million more of CapEx and you have a lower volume, but free cash flow is roughly the same, from '21 to '22. How do you do that? First, there's debt paid down assumed in that, so there is less interest expense because we are going to pay down somewhere in the neighborhood of 1.5 billion of debt, a little more than that, including what was on the revolver at the beginning of the year. And then the other thing that people may not fully appreciate is that the forward look, our production mix is changing. The spending will create a decline in gas volume and growth in oil volume. So, again, prior case we talked about was a lower capital because it was just sustaining oil volume; this one is sustaining total volume, but growing oil relative to gas. And again, a reminder, that doesn't include anything in there for Egypt DUC [ph] modernization, which is going to be meaningful. The specific question that you had about the - how long this is sustainable, if we want to get into the inventory, I'd let David Pursell take that. I'll give him a chance to make a comment here quickly. But this is - when I say for a run of years, I'll say stick with a comment I made last time, you asked me this question Doug and that is, this is at least for 5 to 10 years that we can see out into the future. David, you have anything to add? David Pursell : I would just confirm that it's well beyond - it's in that kind of 10-year window, well beyond five years. And once you get beyond 10, it's hard to think about anybody paying for that inventory, but it has sustained - it has absolute sustainability to it. Doug Leggate : Well, guys, thanks for the detailed answer. I really appreciate that because that's kind of what I was really trying to get to. I'm going to - I love the tip of the hat Egypt to be significant. I'm guessing you're not going to answer that question, so I'm going to go as soon on, John, if you don't mind. You saw what we said about this, it seems to me that if you're 2.5 miles away, with pretty much the same thickness on the formation and your oil target in Sapakara. You're going to start to get some idea of tank [ph] size. I likely know that we had a chance to speak with the head of [indiscernible] talked about this as being \u201cmassive\u201d. So I wonder if you could just offer any thoughts on resource scale, at this point? And maybe a little bit of an explanation as to why not full past that [ph] time? Why do you have to come back to [indiscernible]? Thanks. John Christmann : Now, Doug, I appreciate the question. So, I mean, we are in the middle of the appraisal. And as we said, we have not flow tested, Sapakara South. Unfortunately, just to clarify, the testing equipment on the valiant is damaged and that's why, otherwise we'd be flow testing that thing now. But it's going to take some time to repair that equipment and that's why the ship is going to sail on up to Bonboni and get onto the expiration well that we're excited about. But we need we need flow tests there and we're in the middle of appraisal, so we have not put out volumes yet. I mean, clearly, we're fine tuning things and working with things, and we've talked about this being an important step towards potentially an FID, but it's just a little bit premature to get into areas and those things until we gather a lot more data. And we'll do that as we continue to appraise and analyze what we've collected, but we're clearly excited about it. Having 30 meters of one Rocky sand that's full base, high quality is the type of thing that you can build around because you've got your age there. But there's a lot more to do here and a lot more appraise. Doug Leggate : [indiscernible] current model, half a billion dollars. John Christmann : Repeat that, Doug. You cut out on me, Doug, I did not hear. Doug Leggate : Sorry. Are we out for launch [ph] on our tank model to suggest order magnitude with [indiscernible] contact you could do setting on half a billion barrels on that prospect? John Christmann : I'm just not going to comment at this point. We've got more appraisal. I appreciate the question and I'm going to stick to where we are. It's early. We're appraising and - but we're clearly excited about it but I'm not going to comment, on your question there. Doug Leggate : Can't blame me for trying. Thanks. Well, I appreciate. John Christmann : Yep, not at all. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James. John Freeman : Good morning, guys. John Christmann : Good morning, John. John Freeman : The first question, I just wanted to clarify one thing on Egypt. So if you had the five rigs last quarter, you're now running eight rigs. When we sort of think about the PSC being approved, and obviously, I've been vocal and again on this call about that would - once it's approved, that's going to see an increase in activity. I'm just trying to make sure that I'm using the right baseline so that the incremental five rigs to eight rigs, I always - I know, there was always some incremental activity planned in the second half, but is the eight rigs, the baseline that we're supposed to use ahead of PSC or was there any, maybe, additional rig or two that was added, sort of, in anticipation of the PSC being approved? Just want to make sure, when I'm thinking about 2020 modeling, that I'm using right starting point. John Christmann : Well, I mean, clearly we're taking some steps that we've agreed with them. But in terms of your baselines for capital, and those items, I think we're in the fairway to stay where we are. Dave, anything you want to add? David Pursell : John, I think it's a good question. We've said - I think hinted in the past that we think we need eight to nine rigs to keep oil production flat in Egypt and I think you'll see the eight rigs get us pretty close to that, and then, we'll see where we go after modernization. But I think I think John and Steve, both, talked about those modernization could put us on a path to grow in Egypt. So, if eight rigs sustain, that, I think, is a pretty good baseline on your model. John Freeman : Okay, great. And then just my follow-up in conjunction, Steve, with the detailed response, you gave to Doug's question when sort of hypothetically thinking about 2022. So if I take what you just said, on Egypt and the eight rigs will already have sort of maintained levels, and we'll just assume something north of that, so like Egypt, post PSC would be growing. The North Sea, you previously talked about one rig, one platform can kind of maintain volumes at that 55,000 to 60,000 range. Obviously, first half of this year, due to the extended maintenance, you're a good bit below that. So just by default, the North Sea is going to be up a decent bit in '22 versus '21. And then the Permian, it sounds likely - the base case sounds like it would be to add the third rig in the Permian here in '21, which gets that back to sort of a flattish, sort of a sustained sort of profile, so, ex-Suriname, just hypothetically, thinking about those regions, right. Stephen Riney : Yeah, I think directionally, John, that's about right. Most of the increased capital will be going to Egypt and a bit to the North Sea is, I mean, to the US as well. Probably not a whole lot of additional capital in the North Sea, if any, but it'll be better production in the North Sea simply because of the downtime that we've had this year, which is both planned and unplanned. It has been pretty material for second and third quarter. But again, I just remind you, John, that this is a hypothetical case, we're not trying to give any type of guidance or rolling out specific capital plans for 2022. That's still ahead of us for later this year. We'll talk about that some probably with third quarter earnings. John Freeman : No, understood. It is the knuckleheaded almost like a little be doing the speculating but I appreciate all the answers, guys. John Christmann : Thank you, John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Bob Brackett : Good morning, all. Thanks for taking my question. I might be over interpreting this, but the fact that the Maersk developer is going to come back and appraise Keskesi South, does that mean that if you get a successful result on the well test, that's all the information you'll need on Sapakara to move it forward to FID or would you expect more appraisal wells there? John Christmann : At this point, Bob, it clearly needs to come back. We need a flow test. But I'll just say we still are appraising and we may need more appraisal, and so I wouldn't read into it anything more than that. Bob Brackett : Okay. Just, so there's multiple opportunities to move forward in the appraisal pipeline. John Christmann : Correct. Bob Brackett : Okay. Thanks for that. John Christmann : You bet. Operator : You next question comes from the line of Michael Scialla with Stifel. Guillermo Garcia : Good morning, everyone and thank you for taking my question. This is actually Guillermo stepping in for Mike. I was wondering if you could provide some additional color on the CBP asset sale. You foresee to monetize more non-core assets like this one and are there any other assets in the US that you would want to increase your presence on? John Christmann : I mean, I think we've always looked at the portfolio as something that's kind of in flux. We're always looking for things that make sense to monetize, characterize what we sold is pretty high water cut, higher lifting cost, some properties we've had in the portfolio for quite some time, and quite frankly, it's time to move those along the food chain to somebody else that will put more focus attention on them, and quite frankly a little cheaper cost structure. But at this point, nothing major is planned, is always is the case. We like to report on these after we've done things but we're constantly looking at a number of things, so - but nothing major plan at this point. Guillermo Garcia : That's helpful. Thank you and my follow up, maybe on inflation. Are you seeing them inflation in the drilling rates? You're planning to add that third rig, so I was just wondering if you would foresee a more expensive rate on that additional rig? John Christmann : I think, in general, on the inflation side, we had a lot of our key items secured for this year. I think you get into 2022 and we are seeing some uptick and things that are around the commodities, people, things like that but I don't know. Anything, particular, Dave, on rig contracts you want to comment on. David Pursell : Yeah, I think if you're looking for places for inflation, the completion side and pressure pumping and frac is where you'll see more inflation, we have that dealt into our forward plat. Anything that has to do with commodities whether it's steel or on LOE with chemicals and diesel usage, you'll obviously price inflation there but when we look at our forward plan, we think we have it adequately captured. Guillermo Garcia : That's helpful. Thank you. That's it for me and congrats on the quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with Truist. Neal Dingmann : Oh, sorry about that, I was on mute. Hi, guys. Two quick ones I could. First, just on sort of capital allocation, how you're thinking about things, my question is, I guess, once you obviously start ramping up in Egypt, is that going to simultaneously then - would that take capital away from the US and others? Or I'm just wondering, could you talk about the thoughts about when that happens, kind of, how you view that activity versus what you're thinking domestically? John Christmann : Well, I mean, I think we've got a pretty good base run that we're running right now. And that's where we've been. We've been pretty consistent. We did pick up the first two rigs, early this year. We added the second rig in the Permian. We had a rig that drilled four wells in the Chalk in East Texas, in the US. But in North Sea, it has been pretty constant. Egypt, we've kind of moved from five or six rigs up to eight, but in general pretty, pretty level loaded, pretty constant. And I think it'll be pretty consistent, it is building blocks going forward. You will post modernization see some changes to Egypt, but it will not impact cash flow or the capital in the other areas in a negative way, so. Neal Dingmann : Okay, got it. I assumed that but it is good to hear that, John, and then just a follow-up for you, Steve. To me, given what appears to be the strong transparency you continue to have with free cash flow, when do you all think about, I don't know, either call it notably or materially boosting dividends or free cash flow in addition to that - your solid debt repayment program that you continue with? John Christmann : I mean, I think the first priority is exactly that. We came in to this year with too much debt, and we plan to pay that down, as Steve has made very clear. I think, once we make progress there, then you can start to think about the dividend, but the first priority has been the debt. And clearly, we're on a much faster pace there than we would have envisioned at the start of the year. But anything you want to add, Steve? Stephen Riney : No. Neal, I'd just say that when do we think about it? We think about that all the time. We do realize it's important and we need to do that. And so, I'm sure with the amount of debt paid down that we're going to accomplish this year, we'll be talking about that in due course. But it is certainly moving forward, not backwards. Neal Dingmann : That clearly is seen. Thank you. Thank you, all. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Hi, good morning, guys. John Christmann : Good morning, Paul. Paul Cheng : John, two quick questions. John Christmann : Okay. Paul Cheng : First, the second quarter effective tax rate on the adjusted operating earnings seems small. Was there any one-off item in there or what contributed to that - seems like less than 30% effective tax rate? Secondly, I just curious, I mean, I think a lot of people will argue you [ph] still have too many operators in the US shale. We don't need all the operators. So, wondering that, for Apache, does it make sense that for you to trying to find a company with the nearby land possession and form a vast scale joint venture and put everything together? Everyone still have the equity ownership, so no one paying any equity premium to anyone, but that - by doing in this way, you can drive much better efficiency and cost improvement than individually, perhaps that the company could be able to do so. Is that something that you guys would entertain or you think that doesn't make sense for our Apache? John Christmann : Yeah, I will Steve address the effective tax rate question first, and then I'll come back to your - the second part. Stephen Riney : Yeah. Paul, if - I think I understand the question around the effective tax rate, as your recall, we have put a 100% valuation allowance on the tax benefit of our net operating loss carry forward in the US on the balance sheet. You normally carry a deferred tax asset on the balance sheet, and we've put a complete valuation allowance on that reducing that asset on the balance sheet to zero, even though we do have a pretty significant tax, net operating loss, carry forward. And what we do in periods of time like this in the second quarter, when we have book income in the US, and we would normally recognize a tax expense, we release enough of that valuation allowance just to offset the tax expense for that quarter. And you'll see that, you'll see the $60 million in our non-GAAP reconciliation from net income to adjusted earnings in that in the appendix in our supplement. So that'll have the effect of lowering the effective tax rate quite a bit. Paul Cheng : I see. So as long as that we have discount commodity prices and US is earning a fair amount, we should assume that the effective tax rate will be substantially lower than what, say, under more normal tax waiver suggests? Stephen Riney : Correct. Paul Cheng : Okay. That will do. Thank you. John Christmann : Paul, your second question, it really just boils down to value. I mean, I think the nice thing about our assets, we've got high working interest. We now have two rigs operating in the Permian. I think it boils down to scale, efficiency and value added. And in some areas that could make a lot of sense, some areas it may not make sense. But we're open to looking at things, as is always the case but today, I think we like where we are, we like to pace, we like what we're doing. I think our wells are very competitive and performance is very strong. And I think we're putting attention on the right assets within our portfolio today for us. Paul Cheng : Alright. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Gail Nicholson with Stephens. Gail Nicholson : Good morning. When you guys - when discussed about Alpine, with the scenarios you laid out and keeping now equivalent volumes flat, is it fair to assume that Alpine potentially gets more capital in the '22 forward timeframe? And how - can you just talk about the five DUCs that you're completing and how those compare to previous wells? John Christmann : Yeah, I'll let Dave touch on the DUC performance on those. And as Steve outlined, Gail, it's holding BOEs flat, but we actually going to be growing oil and offsetting some of the gas, so in those cases. So I'll let Steve handle that and then Dave, you can talk about the Alpine DUCs. Stephen Riney : Yeah, Gail. So just to be clear, again, we're not trying to say what exactly our capital program is going to be in 2022 and beyond. The hypothetical case that we used did not contain funding of additional drilling in Alpine High, so it's more oil focused than gas focused. Thus, gas volumes going down into the future, oil volumes going up. But we look at that all of the time, certainly with gas and NGL prices improving in the recent months, and could continue to improve. That'll be something that we will evaluate. And as we finish up this year and roll into next year, we'll get into the actual capital program for 2022, which very well could include some capital for Alpine High. David Pursell : Hi. Yeah, and Gail on the performance, so we've completed seven DUCs, just to level set, two early in the program and five, kind of, more in the mid of the program. The wells - I think all the wells are meaningfully outperforming our expectations and prior well results for offset wells that we would have completed in the 2019 timeframe. So, very excited about the results. The last - the most recent five, still early, they're producing - they've cleaned up and they're producing well, but we want to continue to watch the performance curve before we probably spiked the ball. Gail Nicholson : Great. And then just on the exploration front, there's a tremendous amount of potential on Suriname, but you've also had success in other areas like the tertiary in the North Sea [indiscernible] that you'd disclosed earlier this year. I'm just wondering how you guys are thinking about exploration outside of Suriname over the next couple of years? John Christmann : Tracey, I'll let you. Tracey Henderson : Hi, Gail. I think, we are very excited about Suriname, as you mentioned, and I think we will be looking for other opportunities. I think we are in a very opportunity rich environment for exploration. So, it's early days. I've been with Apache now just right at two months. So, you'll hear more about that, as we go forward. But definitely, we'll be looking at other opportunities. Gail Nicholson : Great, thanks, guys and excellent quarter. John Christmann : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with KeyBanc. Leo Mariani : Hi, guys. Just wanted to follow up a little bit on Suriname here, you guys mentioned that you're in the process of picking up a rig to drill a well, Apache operated on Block 53. Just wanted to kind of get a little bit more information about that? Is this kind of a mandatory well to hold the block? Is this kind of a one-off exploration well, as you folks see it? And I guess, is it just kind of a short-term rig deal as result and what will be the rough capital net to Apache to go and execute that? John Christmann : Yeah, Leo, we've actually got one rig or one well required to continue to hold the block. And so, we've got to spread well by June of next year and we're excited about that. I think there's a lot of prospectivity in Block 53. In terms of where you looking - where the costs are going today, well costs are probably going to be close to 100 million would be my guess, for gross, and we've got about 45% working interest in there. But I'll let Tracy talk a little bit about what we see exploration wise, as we've got both slope and more of a deepwater setting Block 53, like we did at Block 58. Tracey Henderson : Yeah, leveraging on what John just said we - it's certainly not a one-off exploration or seen as a mandatory well. I think what we've learned is an incredible amount with the exploration wells that we've drilled across 58. And the petroleum systems within the basin continues right into Block 53. So, we're actually very excited and we see some prospectivity that's very analogous to what we've been drilling in Block 58 and what we've just seen with some of the recent appraisal wells. I think we've learned a lot and those learnings will be leveraged into what we see in Block 53, because we do see very analogous systems. Leo Mariani : Okay. That's helpful color. And I guess, just given kind of the substantial plans that are existing in Block 58, which I assume is going to involve at least a couple rigs every year for the next several years. And I know you have to get a well done by June, but can you give us a sense of, if you are successful here in Block 53, is this kind of just another leg of the stool where this can kind of be a block that has concurrent activity over the next couple years in parallel with Block 58. How do you think about the success case here? John Christmann : Well, I mean, the nice thing is we've got two partners here, we've got 45%. So I think it gives us a lot of optionality, as we start to think about it. We are the operator at Block 53. We did do the joint venture and handed over operations in Block 58 to Total. But I think it just builds up more optionality and more flexibility for us to look for different ways to continue to advance some longer term very meaningful programs. Leo Mariani : Okay, that's helpful. I guess, just lastly, on this potential for the third rig that you talked about here, obviously you decided to add some activity in Egypt. And I think you guys have strongly alluded to the fact that a third rig can kind of show up in the Permian. Just trying to get a sense of what's kind of the decision point there? Is it really just about sustained higher commodity prices in the year end, and if that occurs, is that third rig pretty much kind of coming for next year to try to hold BOEs flat with oil up and gas down a little? John Christmann : No, we have not made a decision on the third rig. I want to make it really clear. It's not in the budget this year. I think it's important because we've been under investing below sustaining levels to kind of articulate what it would take and as Steve said in his prepared remarks, we're prioritizing debt pay down in the balance sheet first, which is why we've been under investing, but the third rig would be required to get to a sustaining level in the US. And so we've got pretty attractive options for that, so that's why that's framed that way. But it is not whether - it's not a foregone conclusion that we're bringing it, we have not made that call and cap remains at the $1.1 billion for 2021. Leo Mariani : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeoffrey Lambujon with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one is just to follow up on US upstream. Obviously, throughout the first half year, US volumes have been more than offsetting the planned and unplanned international downtown, which we've seen more about in the full year guide as well, even net of the CBP sales. So, just hoping you could talk more about what you've been seeing in non-Alpine High Permian, in other words, through the first half of the year, and how that might influence capital allocation within non- Alpine High Permian specifically? David Pursell : Yeah. Jeff, this is Dave. Good, thanks for the question. We're seeing meaningful uplift in our performance on the on the Permian DUCs outside of Alpine as well. And it's - we're optimizing on a number of different variables. We're excited about that program. And so when we - I think Steve talked about it in his prepared remarks, when we look at our US portfolio, we have multiple places where they could compete for the capital for that third rig and that would be the Chalk, it could be in third rig in the oily Permian and possibly the third rig in Alpine. So, we're evaluating those, but we're very excited about the performance that we've seen and the improvements that we continue [Technical Difficulty]. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Got it. Thank you. And then second, just to try on the Egypt PSC modernization, and understand you can't speak to specific terms. Is there anything you can share at this time, maybe just on what mechanics are in flux that will help to increase capital allocation to that region? John Christmann : No, I mean, I think you just got to look at it in terms of modernizing. We've got a lot of concessions. We will be collapsing those. Merger and joint ventures, I mean, there's a lot to do there administratively that's going to make it easier and it will effectively keep us from trapping capital. But we're not in a position to elaborate more than that today. It's going through the approval process and we should be in a position to talk about it later this year, for sure. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen with Pickering Energy. David Heikkinen : Good morning, guys, and thanks for the hypothetical framework, it is helpful, and we won't hold you to it for your budget. One of the things that we're curious about him, on the gas side, have you all thought about joining any of the, like, oil and gas methane partnerships or certifying your natural gas or moving in any that direction to really quantify the improvements you're showing around emissions? John Christmann : Yeah, I think we're a member of One Future. I think, well, our approach has been to take real tangible projects and steps that we can take. We're in the middle right now of working on our sustainability report, which will be coming out later in the year, like we always do, and so we're monitoring all those things. I think the key for us is trying to focus on what are the material things we can do in our business, that are going to lower those emissions, and drive performance, right. And so those are the things we're focused on. David Heikkinen : And as you think about your operations globally, would you move towards quantifying carbon equivalent emissions per barrel for the North Sea, Egypt or US operations? John Christmann : I think we will stay tuned and monitor where things are going. I mean, for us, we recognize we need to continue to lower our footprint. We need to be in a position and continue to monitor and measure those and take those steps. And then we'll just be making the - determining how - what's the best way to show it, and the best way to quantify it and also how to attack it. In the end, it's about lowering emissions. David Heikkinen : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. I'll turn the call back to John Christmann. John Christmann : Thank you. So before ending today's call, I'd like to leave you with three points; the first two of which are important catalysts. First, we're very encouraged with the progress in Suriname and look forward to having further results later this year. Second, the PSC modernization in Egypt will have an immediate positive impact for both the country and APA, and we are very pleased with how things are progressing. Finally, the free cash flow capacity of our base business is robust and sustainable, and this will materialize in returns to investors. Thank you for participating in our call today. Operator, over to you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. The floor is yours. Gary Clark : Good morning. And thank you for joining us on APA Corporation Third Quarter 2021 Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President John Christmann. Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results in 2021 outlook. Also on the call and available to answer questions are Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President of Development. Tracy Henderson, Senior Vice President of Exploration, and Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 18 minutes in length, with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you've had the opportunity to review our 3rd quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor. apacop.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. Finally, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discussed today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John. John Christmann : Good morning and thank you for joining us. Our top priority coming into 2021 was to continue strengthening the balance sheet through debt reduction. With the significant recent strides in that regard and a favorable outlook for continued free cash flow generation, we are in a position today to announce some material changes at our capital investment plans and use of free cash flow. First, we're moving toward a capital budget that will sustain or slightly grow global production volumes. This is being accomplished through a gradual ramp in activity over the next few quarters primarily in Egypt where we are anticipating PSC modernization terms will be approved by year-end, but also in the onshore U.S. Second, we're committing to a significant increase in cash return to shareholders. While a stronger commodity price environment has accelerated progress on the Balance sheet is the quality and cash flow generating capacity of our core operating areas through a range of commodity price environments that are enabling our new capital return framework. We have a substantial inventory of quality drilling opportunities throughout our portfolio. In addition to Egypt, which now has the deepest inventory in more than a decade, we also have significant potential in our onshore U.S. portfolio. Primarily in the Southern Midland Basin, Alpine High, and Austin Chalk. In this price environment, there are many compelling drilling opportunities that should be funded and we anticipate adding a fourth onshore U.S. rig in 2022. With regard to our new capital return framework, we are committed to returning a minimum of 60% of our free cash flow to shareholders. This begins with our base dividend, which in September we announced would increase to an annualized rate of $0.25 per share. Yesterday, we announced a doubling of that rate to $0.50 per share. In early October, we took the more significant step of initiating a share repurchase program. Through October 31st, we have repurchased 14.7 million shares and expect to continue returning capital in this manner through the Fourth Quarter and into 2022. Our commitment is to return at least 60% of free cash flow to shareholders and we will exceed this amount in the current quarter. We believe that, APA currently offers one of the highest free cash flow yields at our peer group. And that this framework could deliver us an attractive and highly competitive return to our shareholders. Turning now to the third quarter results of highlights. Through a combination of strong commodity prices, capital and cost discipline and good well performance, we generated nearly $1.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA, making it our strongest quarter of the year thus far. We anticipate fourth-quarter will be even stronger. U.S. production exceeded guidance in the Third Quarter and we continue to see good performance in the Permian oil plays, Alpine High, and the Austin Chalk. Internationally, production was a bit below guidance as we experienced some extended maintenance turnarounds and compressor outages in the North Sea and lower volumes in Egypt associated with the impact of strengthening oil prices on our production sharing contracts. We expect gross production in both the UK and Egypt will increase in the Fourth Quarter. In the U.S. we placed a total of 10 wells online during the quarter. This included 9 wells in the southern Midland Basin, 3 of which were 3 miles in length. At Alpine High no new wells were placed on production during the quarter. But performance from this year's DUC completions, as well as the underlying base production volumes continue to exceed expectations. In the East Texas Austin Chalk, we drilled three operated wells earlier this year, two of which are on production. We've recently added a third rig in the U.S., which will be used to continue the delineation of our Austin Chalk acreage position. We have now gathered a substantial amount of data in this play that indicates returns will compete with other quality portfolio opportunities. Dave Pursell can provide more details around the Austin Chalk during the Q&A. Turning to international operations. In Egypt, gross production has began to turn higher, putting us on a good trajectory as we enter 2022. In anticipation of modernized PSC terms, we recently increased our rig count to 11. We will likely add more rigs in 2022 as modernized terms would return Egypt to being the most attractive investment opportunity within our portfolio. In the North Sea, we continue to operate 1 floating rig in 1 platform crude. As expected, production was up modestly in the third quarter compared to the second quarter as we continued to work through both planned and unplanned maintenance downtime. On the drilling front, we recently TD the store to development well, which we plan to place online in January. While one of the primary objectives in this well was wet, we encountered more than 300 feet of net pay and other targets, which we're projecting we'll IP around 20 million cubic feet per day of gas and 2500 barrels per day of condensate. Our 59% working interest in this well provides good leverage to what should be robust North Sea natural gas and condensate prices over the coming months. In Block 58 offshore Surinam, our partner Total is currently running 2 rigs, one of which is conducting a flow test at Sahakara Sal and the other is drilling the Bond Bonnie exploration well in the Northern portion of the block. These operations are still ongoing and the data we collect will help inform the next steps in the Block 58 appraisal and exploration programs. On Block 53, we are finalizing plans for our next exploration well location with partners Petronas and Septa. The Noble Jerry D'souza drillship is scheduled to commence drilling this well in the First Quarter. The plan is to drill one well in Block 53 in 2022, but we have an option on the drillship for two additional wells if warranted. Before closing, I want to comment on the charge we took this quarter related to the Gulf of Mexico properties we sold to Fieldwood in 2013. Since Fieldwood emerged from bankruptcy in August, we have independently assess the situation and have elected to book the contingent liability that you saw in our press release. Steve will walk you through some of the details. In closing, I'd like to make a few remarks about the progress we're making on the ESG front. We recently announced that we have eliminated all routine flaring in U.S. operations. This was an ambitious goal that we set at the beginning of the year and achieved 3 months ahead of schedule. Additionally, through the end of the third quarter, flouring intensity in the U.S. was only.38%, significantly below our target of less than 1%. Our global safety performance has also been strong. We have delivered a 35% improvement in our total recordable incident rate compared to this time last year. We have also progressed a number of important initiatives that foster diversity and inclusion within the organization and that enhance the health and well-being of our employees. In October, we published our 2021 sustainability report, which I hope you will review for a more in-depth look at our ESG philosophy, performance, initiatives, and success stories. Finally, we are in the process of establishing some very rigorous short, medium and long-term ESG goals. Which will include further efforts on GHG and methane emissions and we look forward to discussing these in the near future. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney, who will provide additional details on our third quarter results and outlook. Stephen Riney : Thank you, John. In my prepared remarks this morning, I will make some additional comments on our third quarter performance. provide a bit more color on the field with related contingent liability, review aspects of ULTA's midstream's recently announced combination with EagleClaw and provide some more context around our free Cash Flow outlook and capital framework. As noted in our news release yesterday, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, APA Corporation reported a Third Quarter 2021 consolidated loss of $113 million or $0.30 per diluted common share. These results include a number of items that are outside of core earnings, excluding the impacts of the Fieldwood related contingent liability, a loss on extinguishment of debt, a charge for tax-related valuation allowance, and some other smaller items, adjusted net income for the Third Quarter was $372 million or $0.98 per share. Most of our financial results were in line with or better than guidance this quarter. Upstream capital investment was considerably below guidance, primarily due to the timing of infrastructure spending in Egypt and lower exploration costs in Suriname. Our teams have done a good job holding the line on capital and LOE despite service cost inflation. And we expect these will finish the year at or below our original 2021 guidance. G&A was also below guidance this quarter, mostly due to the timing of some costs which we now expect to be incurred in the fourth quarter. I would like to provide a bit more color now on the Fieldwood ARO situation. Through Fieldwood most recent bankruptcy process, we had to rely on third-party estimates of the remaining net abandonment obligations related to our legacy properties. Since Fieldwood emerged from bankruptcy in August, we have conducted our own evaluations. Based on that work, it appears the combination of the various financial security packages and the anticipated future net cash flows from the properties will not be sufficient to fund all of the remaining abandonment obligations. Accounting rules require that the entire undiscounted contingent obligation and the offsetting undiscounted value of the financial security will be brought onto our books. These are recorded independently as a liability and an asset without netting them against one another. Accordingly, in the Third Quarter, we brought onto our books the anticipated net ARO obligation of $1.2 billion. We also recorded the offsetting value of the financial security in the amount of $740 million. As a reminder, the financial security includes a funded abandonment trust, letters of credit, and surety bonds. As abandonment activity occurs, it will be funded first by the free cash flows currently being generated by the legacy properties. To the extent these cash flows are insufficient, Apache Corporation will be required to fund the activity and will be reimbursed through the financial security. Only after the operating cash flows and financial security packages are fully depleted, will Apache Corporation be obligated to fund the activity without a source of reimbursement. The undiscounted net liability is $446 million and we anticipate it will be at least 2026 before Apache incurs costs in excess of the available financial security. A few weeks ago, our majority on midstream Company, Ulta's, announced that it will combine with the parent Company of EagleClaw Midstream, to form the largest integrated midstream Company in the Delaware Basin. We considered a wide range of strategic options for Altice for more than a year. Ultimately, we determined that this transaction would allow all Altice shareholders to reposition equity holdings into a pro forma Company with the best combination of scale, synergies, asset quality, and attractive growth opportunities. The transaction would also preserve the $6 per share annual cash dividend for the public shareholders and provide near-term optionality for APA to monetize a meaningful portion of our current position. Such a secondary sale would benefit the combined Company by improving the public float. It would also provide APA with cash flow. A portion of which would be deployed into Alpine High activity, thereby enhancing dedicated sources of revenue for the Company. Reducing our ownership interest in Altice to a minority position provides a number of benefits for APA as well, including simplification of our financial reporting, increased comparability with our upstream only peers, and improved leverage metrics upon deconsolidation of $ 1.3 billion of debt and preferred equity as of September 30th. As we proceed towards closing, which is anticipated in the First Quarter of 2022, we will provide further detail around the accounting treatment and the financial statement impacts of this transaction. With respect to portfolio management more generally, as we build the capital investment program to a level capable of sustaining or slightly growing production, you will see increasing activity in our core asset areas, primarily in the U.S. onshore and in Egypt. This will demonstrate both the quality and running room in our core assets, as well as the need for a more accelerated pace of non-core asset divestments. As part of that, in 2022, we anticipate a minimum of $500 million of further non-core U.S. onshore asset divestments. I'd like to close by reiterating some of John's comments regarding APA's free Cash Flow generation capacity and it's anticipated uses. As always there can be some confusion around a term like free Cash Flow. So we want to be clear what it means at APA. You will find our definition of free Cash Flow in our financial and operational supplement, which we published with every quarterly earnings report. In the Fourth Quarter of this year at current strip pricing, we expect to generate free cash flow in excess of $600 million, which would result in full-year 2021 free cash flow of around $2 billion. Under our new capital return framework, a minimum of 60% of this free cash flow would go to ordinary dividends and share repurchases. And as John indicated, we expect to exceed this 60% framework in the current quarter. Looking ahead to next year, we currently contemplate a capital budget of around $1.5 billion. This would consist of roughly $1.3 billion for development and $200 million for exploration and appraisal activities, mostly in Suriname. As we've indicated, we believe the plan level of activity would put our global total BOE production on a sustaining to slightly growing long-term trajectory. This excludes any future production contribution from Suriname. The near-term allocation of capital would likely be bias to increasing oil production, which would offset declining gas and NGL production. That said, the commodity price environment is very active. And we have considerable flexibility within our portfolio to redirect capital as appropriate. Based on this investment level, we anticipate free Cash Flow in 2022 would again be in the neighborhood of $2 billion prior to any benefits of Egypt PSC modernization. Finally, I would like to caveat all of this with, as is customary, the final plan for 2022 will be reviewed in the Fourth Quarter call in February. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. You have your first question coming from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Doug Leggate : Well thanks. Good morning everybody. Just checking, John, can you hear me okay, I'm finding it difficult? John Christmann : Yes, Good morning Doug. Doug Leggate : Some companies can give me some problems. John, I'm going to start with Egypt if I may. I'm sure you saw the report we put out a month or so ago. One of your smaller peers has been a little bit more transparent on the potential changes in terms from the PSC modernization. So one of those conceptually, you could walk us through how are you see the moving parts as it relates to increased profit oil and in particular, the potential for legacy stranded capital cost recovery. If you could put some maybe a range of potential impacts on your assuming similar terms applied. John Christmann : Well, Doug, it's a great question. And you know, from our perspective, we are the largest onshore producer in Egypt. You've hit on some of the key points. We've made the decision not to give more color on that until it's finalized. I will tell you that the modernized PSC has recently been approved by the cabinet and it has moved on to Parliament. So we're getting close and we expect it to everything's on track for a year end approval. But in terms of anymore color you've done a good piece of work out there. And I'll let Steve comment on a couple of things. Stephen Riney : Yeah. Doug, the thing I would add to that, based on your work, you've demonstrated, you understand how the PSC's work. The backlog -- while we haven't indicated exactly how much that is, the mechanism to recover that, is that it is the backlog would be -- and we've shared this publicly already. The backlog would be recovered over a 5 year period on a quarterly basis. And that backlog would roll into the other costs for cost recovery. So it is all subject -- to sum of all of that, is subject to the 40% limit on cost recovery barrels. the benefit -- the real benefit as you've noted in your right out is that by aggregating all of these into a single bucket for cost recovery purposes, you don't end up with stranded costs in any of the smaller buckets and that will allow us to get this backlog of cost recovered as well especially in this price environment. Doug Leggate : Steve, I know you don't want to give specifics, but end my -- my note I did suggest the potential of the impact could be several $100 million across would you push back on that or give some affirmation that we're in the ballpark? Stephen Riney : Yeah, Doug. I think I need to be really careful about that. So I think we won't comment on it at this point in time. Doug Leggate : Okay. I understand. Let me move on very quickly to my second question, which is understandably Suriname. You've got a well test, I guess you drilled out the fox about 3.5 weeks ago. John, I guess I'm a little surprised that you're not ready to give us some updates there or on Bonboni, where our guys on the ground are suggesting that you'd already in the formation era. So I'm just wondering if you can offer any color around those 2 pieces of potential news flow that we expect, I guess in the coming months, now we get there. Thank you. John Christmann : Great question. I'll address Sahakara Sal South first. Number 1 you can appreciate that there's multiple phases of a flow test that you go through and sometimes even more important than the flow period is the buildup and the pressure response and all of those things. So it's early. I will just tell you save your question. I'm not in a position to reveal anything on it today, but hold your the question and we'll be able to respond in the near future. So is returned to Bonboni? Yes, there's Total's got two rigs, the developers of Sapakara South. The value in is at Bonboni I will remind everybody it's 45 kilometer step-out to the North, It is a key well. And I think the prospectivity up there will -- will inform the Northern portion of the block, as well as have some implications on Block 53. So once again, I'm not in a position to provide any update but I would just stay tuned, right? So and we'll be in a position to update you when we can. Doug Leggate : Awesome, thanks so much, guys. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann from Truist Securities. You may ask your question. Neal Dingmann : Hello, John. Nice update on the shareholder return. I was just going to add one thing around that. Just your thought -- I don't know. Either you're the Company's for personal thoughts on something about doing more of a variable versus buyback. And obviously your stock appears to me on many levels quite cheap here. So I'm just wondering how you think about the two alternatives. John Christmann : Neal, I guess I'll start out and just on the framework, I'll just give a few comments here. It really should not come as a surprise that anybody that's engaged with us over the last several years, when we've been on the road and in our meeting. Stephen and I have been really clear that a quality EMP needs to have a strong Balance Sheet. You need to have a sustaining the low growth profile. Multiple years of inventory, but not too many years of inventory. And we should be throwing off the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders. We've had a lot of work to do. The volatile pricing environment has at times impacted. But we're in a position where we're finally here. If you look at the framework, we believe you want to do a nice mix. You need a competitive dividend. We're not big fans of the variable dividend in terms of how that works. And I think with where our share price is, especially today is as cheap as it is, that that would be the primary means of how we'd look at it. Steve, any more specifics you want to provide? Stephen Riney : Yeah. Only on the [Indiscernible] that. Thanks for the question because I think it is important to share some of the context around the framework that we've rolled out today. And I think John framed it exactly right in terms of the history of where we've been. I think if you just step back and think about the industry, it wasn't too long ago that the industry was all about growth and really, little or no returns to shareholders. More recently, we've finally gotten to where it's about moderated growth ambitions and really starting to roll out these returns frameworks. And I think the big step right now is to figure out well, what's the right return framework? And I'd say it's early days for the industry in general and we're all figuring that out now that returns frameworks right now are migrating towards a percent of free cash flow and I think that's probably good. Ranges out there pretty broad. I see ranges from 25% all the way up to 75%. We're probably going to find a sweet spot in there. And I think it's starting to migrate towards somewhere around 50% as an industry for APA specifically. I mean, we just took a significant step in improving the capital structure of the Company with the debt tender this fall and that was a 100% focused on debt reduction. We know there's more to do on the Balance Sheet and we'll get to that. But to be clear, we still want to get to investment-grade, that can take some time and that's okay. We do have to just recognize that, shareholders are pretty important too and we need to find a balance in returns to share holders, while at the same time continuing to improve the Balance Sheet. And the industry has chosen 50%, because they're kind of migrating towards that. We chose 60%. We think this is the right balance, or ACA. We have a quality diversified portfolio. It's exposed to a good range of commodity price and geographic mix. It's capable of sustaining free cash flow for many many years. And remember free cash flow, the basis for the return's circulation is after capital spending. We've been improving the Balance Sheet. We can still continue to strengthen the Balance Sheet up to 40%. Still available for other uses including debt reduction, but I'd say in the near-term, we certainly have a bias for dividends and buybacks. And remember also we did talk about, in my prepared remarks, we talked about the fact that we're going to probably pick up the pace on non-core asset sales and that's also a source of funds for continuing to strengthen the balance sheet, but also for potentially for more returns to shareholders as well. So we feel pretty good about that balance and the 60% level. As John indicated, we don't -- we're not particular fans of the variable dividends at this point in time. We will consider -- will keep -- we'll continue to look at that for the future and consider how the market reacts to those. I think the variable dividend needs to be in general, a smaller piece. And just in terms of balancing dividends versus buybacks, for now we're just happy to lean into buybacks. We believe our share price is too low. We've been discounting for several months now greater than 25% free cash flow yield, one of the highest in the peer group. We don't believe our base cash flow generating capacity is actually fully appreciated by the market. And we need to continue to work on that. We know that. But for now the share price is just too low, so we will continue with leaning in on the buybacks. We know we need to have a competitive ordinary dividend yield. And it needs to be competitive against other E&P s as well as the broader market. And I think that's probably higher than what we see is the typical 2% ordinary dividend yield we see today. And we'll figure that out and it's about getting to a balance around what's the right strength of Balance Sheet that certainly is spending to something stronger. But also what price are we going to base all of that on, because I think it's a valid question is to what we all think mid-cycle price is now. We'll get on with raising the dividend as well. We just need to be thoughtful about that. It was only 18 months ago that we cut the dividend by 90% and that was a pretty painful process. We're going to make sure we don't put ourselves in a situation where we have to do something like that again. Probably more than you added for, but I wanted to take the opportunity to lay out a lot of context around the returns framework. Neal Dingmann : No, I appreciate. I think what you said about the -- both said about the Total return makes a lot of -- or about the shared buybacks makes sense. And one just quick follow-up, John, just thoughts on future of, I'd say near-term, medium-term Alpine High activity given not only the strong natural gas prices post the Altice deal and even that Schneer long-term supply contract agreement seems to be get you closer to fruition. So given all that, maybe what you could say about Alpine High. John Christmann : When you look at our U.S. program, we've got 2 rigs in the southern Midland Basin. We picked up another 1 that's in the Chalk now. We've indicated we will be adding another rig, probably middle of next year, which will put us 3 that will go to Permian. And quite frankly then we envision those rigs working those assets in tandem. We're in pad drilling. You will be seeing those move. And what the time it takes on the unconventional side to mobilize a rig, drill pads, and see production. Your short-term windows are benefiting from those right now at Alpine High with the dokcs that we did earlier, right? So I think you're going to see our very well thought out efficient capital program in the U.S., where we're moving those rigs around those place based on the, how we've laid the inventory out in the infrastructure, so we can maximize those returns. But there is a portion of the Altice piece if we sell the -- sell down shares that we do put in there, but it will all fit into our framework. So it's nice to have quality inventory and options, because then we can just really plan it out and be thoughtful, but you'll see activity across our Permian next year in a very thoughtful way. Neal Dingmann : Got it. Thank you all so much for the time. John Christmann : You bet. Thank you, Neal. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ciara from Stifel. You may ask your question. Michael Scialla : Yeah. Good morning, buddy. See what the next steps would be at [Indiscernible] the issue with both appraisals. They're just lack of reservoir quality sands as you stepped out. Did you just step out too far in the edge so you need to move back towards the discoveries with the next appraisals or is it more complicated than that? John Christmann : Mike, it's a good question. I will tell you that at [Indiscernible] it was a big step out. We know it looked a little different in terms of the signature. So we knew there was more risk to it. But there is work to do at Cadcassie, in closer. But I think from the priorities, it will all be put into is your working across all the discoveries and the appraisal program. We're integrating data. We've prioritized for the appraisal there things that you would be what I'll call lower GOR black oil that you could potentially fast-track. And so we're working those in a queue based on the learnings, we've integrated everything in. Some of that will come to one of the reasons why crab to go is the next exploration well. It's in the neighborhood and we like the way it looks. So I think it's all part of an integrated plan. Michael Scialla : Okay. Helpful. And maybe just to follow-up on Neal 's question. Can you talk about that decision to put the third rig in the Chalk versus the Midland or Alpine High. And Steve mentioned a plan to add a fourth rig next year. Any early preview on where that might land. I guess, any possibility of going beyond four rigs, and then U.S. next year. David Pursell : Yes. This is David Pursell, good question. So remember on the Chalk we talked about drawing a handful of wells in our Brazes County acreage position. One, because we're trying to maintain optionality. We -- we've had significant experience a bit to the West and the Washington County area and we had a decent acreage position put together and wanted to hold it together and we liked what we've seen so far. It's consistent with the geology we've seen in Washington County in well results. And so we really just want to leverage that experience. We liked what we saw and felt like it was time to put a rig there and continue to progress that position. The thing to remember it's near infrastructure. There's a lot of pipe infrastructure in the area. It's less than a 100 miles from Houston Ship Channel. So we're getting Henry Hub pricing and LLS pricing for the crude. The GORs are little bit higher than what you typically see in the Permian. So there's a little bit of a gas component too, which we like in these markets. So for us it was a pretty easy decision on the Chalk. The extra rig we talked about, the incremental rig in the middle of 2022. I think it's important to point out, first of all, as you -- as we think about adding another rig, it's harder to stand up a rig quickly, it's a couple of quarters to from the time you make that decision till the time you're turning to the right just because of long lead items in supply chain issues and to make sure that we have everything we need to keep that rig running. I think John highlighted that there is a lot to do in the Permian. We have two rigs in the southern Midland Basin. We have a lot of development inventory that we're not getting to, which includes Alpine High and we have a lot of good opportunities for that rig and we'll post John those in February that you can imagine that Alpine would be on that list of places we'd be looking to drill next year. Stephen Riney : And to be clear, there will be no fifth rig in the onshore U.S. next year. David Pursell : Yes -- Yes. Thank you, Steve. Michael Scialla : Thanks, guys. John Christmann : Thank you, Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett from Bernstein Research. Your line is now open. Bob Brackett : Good morning all. Just a question following up on the Austin Chalk and the Alpine High, how do you think longer-term about the balance of gas-directed drilling versus oil-directed drilling, any thoughts there? David Pursell : Bob, I think the beauty of the diverse portfolio is we have the ability to flex that. And so I'm going to give you a non-answer because it really depends on where commodity markets go. Obviously, we've got a very constructive crude market and our gas markets is becoming more constructive. We'd like to see the back end of the gas curve strengthen a little bit from here. But again with the diverse portfolio, both diverse in the Permian and diverse globally, we have the ability to flex and move, and take advantage of commodity markets across the globe. So I'll leave it at that, but we're getting -- we're watching the forward curve on gas let's just leave it at that. Bob Brackett : Okay perfectly clear. We're traveling the globe, can you talk about inflation and sort of what's you're baking in domestically, where you might be seeing something a bit higher versus maybe some of the international assets. What's baked into that sort of capex guide in terms of inflation? John Christmann : Yes, Bob, you look today and this is the commodities, right? I mean steel is up, where we've got fuel. Your power costs, you are people costs. But it's really steel and people, is how we frame it. And we have factored some of that into that capital number, as we look at our programs. And then we try to get ahead on the purchases. And so, if you get into the middle of '22, it is baked into our capital numbers. Bob Brackett : Any difference domestically versus internationally? And is there a number you'd hazard to throw out? John Christmann : No. I mean, I think you can look at those numbers and easily you get into the -- I mean, 15-20% number easily, and in some places even higher, but not a lot of difference between the two. You just don't have -- I mean, the nice thing about a places like Egypt there's not as much competition for rig ads and things. And so it's probably easier to pick up rigs in Egypt than I would say in the U.S. Just because I take you back to 2014, we were running 28 rigs there. So it's not like we're going up to a level where we've got to bring the equipment in and those sorts of things. Hello Dave, any more specific you want to say? David Pursell : The only thing I'd add is if you think about the type of drilling that we did in Egypt, its vertical wells. It's more commodity drilling compared to what we're doing in the Permian where a lot of the well cost is really on the completion side. So just less I think John hit it, there's less inflation in Egypt and astray just because of the type of wells that we tend to drill day in and day out. John Christmann : The other thing I would add, Bob, is some of the targeted divestments have man on our higher water cuts. From Basin Platform properties where we're burning more energy and moving more fluid and those types of things are helping our numbers too in terms of what we're targeting. So there's -- we're trying to be really smart about the portfolio and factoring all those in. Bob Brackett : Great, that makes sense. Thanks much. Operator : Your next question is from Leo Mariani from KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Leo Mariani : Hi guys. Just wanted to follow up on the stock buyback program here. I guess, high level you guys talked about roughly I guess $2 billion of free cash flow. There's some dividend here, but 60% to the buyback I mean, that certainly could imply North of a billion dollars on the buyback. And just in our math, that's certainly seems to be a very large percentage of your shares outstanding currently approaching 15%, upwards of that maybe in one year or next year. Just wanted to get a sense of do you guys think that a number that size is roughly correct and is it feasible to buyback that much stock? Stephen Riney : Well, if the share price stays roughly where it is, and that'll be the outcome, yes. And if oil prices stay where they are. Leo Mariani : Right. Okay. Stephen Riney : And, yes, I think it is feasible. Yes. Leo Mariani : Okay. And then just wanted to follow-up on the Austin Chalk here. So obviously, it's like this point you've dedicated rig. In your slide deck you talked about one well result looked very strong. Presumably there's probably more than that in terms of results that maybe you guys have seen out there. I was hoping maybe you could give us a little bit more color in terms of inventory of aerial extent of where you guys have drilled. Is there an acreage number you think is a sweet spot out there for you that, would give you just a number of years of inventory and maybe just more color about what that rig is doing. Is it all development work? Is there going to be a mix of some exploration in there? Can you maybe just provide a little bit more color about what the run rig is doing and what you've seen so far? John Christmann : One comment from me is, not only do we have the operated rig, but we're also amount up on some of Magnolia's operations, so there's quite a bit of data. Dave, I'll let you jumped in. David Pursell : Yeah. It's good question. The way -- on the Brazos County side, we haven't really talked yet about the sides of this, but there is some -- I wouldn't call it exploration, but there is some additional delineation work we're doing to see how big this could be. But when we look at it, there's easily over five rig years worth of development to do in this one spot. So again, we're leveraging a lot of our knowledge on the work we've done over in the Washington County area as operator and as John suggested, a fairly significant non-op position. We'll leave it at that. Leo Mariani : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Next is from John Freeman, from Raymond James. Please go ahead. John Freeman : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. John Christmann : You better, John. John Freeman : I wanted to follow up on Alpine High, which I'm sure you would have -- a couple of quarters ago, I don't think we would have realized that we haven't multiple questions on Alpine High, but obviously a lot of things change. And so I guess, when I look at the Alpine High and what gas NGL prices have done. And then following up on the recent Altice - EagleClaw deal where those processing gathering rigs got a heck of a lot more attractive. And then I know that you have done some stuff on wider spacing than you are used to do there as well. I'm just curious as it sounds pretty likely that that fourth rate will go to Alpine High if we might -- there might be some plan to get an update on the economic model for Alpine High cause it has been quite a while since we've seen it. David Pursell : Yes, John, this is Dave. We look for that as we get into 2022 and really kind of hone in on where that additional rigs are going to focus. But you're right. I mean, it's not just gas price and cost structure. We've done some things on performance, on some of the docks with spacing as well as its prac design and some of those wells are in the public domain and the results are very, very good and certainly exceeded our expectations. So there's a number of factors that would drive us to really focus on Alpine as well as some of the other opportunities out there. John Freeman : Okay. And then just the follow-up question on Egypt. So if I heard you right, John, it sounded like the 11 rigs was going to go higher post the modernization, getting completed if I heard that right. And obviously it's been a while since we've been at this sort of an activity set. So Egypt until at least Suriname gets to a point where it's at first oil, Egypt becomes the growth driver for the Company. And I guess I'm just curious when we think historically has been an 8 rig program or so would try and keep production roughly flat if we go 11 rigs plus. Is it a double-digit type growing asset just I guess any additional color how you're thinking about Egypt. John Christmann : Clearly, we've been gradually ramping, right? We went from 5 -- we started the year around 5 rigs, we went to 8, now we are at 11. The plan would be to go up another step. I don't see us going back -- needing to go back to where we once were in the mid-20 range. But it will -- it's going to turn the corner. We've been under -- slightly under-investing in Egypt for quite a number of years. And definitely we'll turn the trajectory the other way, which is what Egypt wants. And quite frankly, part of the overall win-win that 's in this for Egypt and APA. John Freeman : Got it. Thanks. I appreciate it. John Christmann : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Michael Scialla from Stifel. Your line is now open. Michael Scialla : Actually, John just asked my 2 questions, but I'll ask one more. The asset retirement liability being put back to you with those Gulf of Mexico assets, does Fieldwood continue to operate there and do you have any input on what they do there? Stephen Riney : No. Those assets came out of Fieldwood, so the Legacy Fieldwood Company is now a Company called Quarter North. And they don't own the old Fieldwood assets that Apache had sold to them. Those came out and went into an interview that we now call Tom Shelf. There is a person that's contract managing those assets because there are assets that are still producing. But the contract today is in place with Quarter North, the old field with organization to operate those assets for us, and we will continue to evaluate whether that's the best long-term situation. Michael Scialla : Is there any thought on just taken over or could you potentially take over operations there? Or do you want -- if you've got the -- all the liability, would it make sense to operate it yourself? Stephen Riney : We'd have to ask the lawyers that of whether we can operate those assets or not. I believe there's some issues with us being able to operate them. But I doubt that we would take over operatorship of those assets at this point in time. These are -- so there are -- the nature of the assets there, there's the -- a large inventory of properties that came out of Fieldwood. A number of them are in abandonment activity today. And a number of them -- a smaller number of them are operating and still generating free cash flow. And I won't go through the details unless somebody wants me to, but we booked a net, $1.2 billion liability on our balance sheet. That's the gross abandonment obligation, less the free cash flows that we see coming out of those assets for their remaining life. And then we also booked on the asset side of our Balance Sheet $740 million of various forms of financial security that we have in place to fund that abandonment obligations. So a net liability on our part, a net obligation of about 450 million, that obligation won't --we won't -- we won't actually start funding anything on that obligation until 2026 at the soonest, in terms of costs that could be incurred, that we wouldn't have any form of reimbursement for. And then that would carry over for about 5 or 6 years after 2026 in terms of that Stephen Riney : situation. The present value of all of those costs today are about 250 million. Guess we had to book an undiscounted number of the 450 million. The other thing I just might comment on is that the way we went about doing the work, because we only got access to the raw data behind all of this in August and we've been scouring through that since we got that. We've looked hard at abandonment costs and we've looked at -- the 2nd priority was to look at the operating assets and the cash flow from the PDPs on those. And then the 3rd priority was to look at the capital investment opportunities, because any assets like these are going to have uphold recompletion opportunities and things like that. That was the third priority and we really haven't gotten through all of those. There are literally hundreds of capital investment opportunities. We got to the ones that, we think -- we thought were the highest priorities seemed like the best opportunities. And so those are included in the free cash flows. But we think there are more. We think that, there are opportunities to reduce the operating and overhead costs in the PDPs and we believe there are probably more opportunities in investment side that, we just haven't been able to get to yet. So we'll be -- we should be watching for those over the coming quarters. And that has a decent chance of possibly bringing that $450 million liability down over time. And that would also decrease obviously, the present value of that opportunity. Michael Scialla : Thanks for the detail on that, Steve. One more. You'd mentioned Steve, that the divestitures you plan next year. I know you guys don't want to give detail on that, but I'm just curious. Can you speak broadly as to what assets might be put in that divestiture bucket or I'm assuming they are on the domestic side and outside of your 3 core areas or were core interception? John Christmann : Mike actually, we sold some Central Basin Platform properties earlier this year that were higher costs, higher water cut, later life in the country for having a portfolio for a long long time. What I call some of the legacy. You can anticipate more of those types of assets is probably what would make sense. Michael Scialla : Yeah. Okay. Very good. Thank you, guys. John Christmann : Thank you. Operator : You have your last question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Doug Leggate : Hey guys. Sorry for double-dipping today, but I have a couple of things I wanted some clarification on so I queued up again. First one is -- on the buyback I think I missed the comment and I'll ask a question like this. When you take disposals potentially into account, as well as, I guess we've already dealt with the Egyptian thing as it relates to cash flow. Is it an upward limit on how aggressive you would expect to be with the buybacks? In absolute terms? John Christmann : No. Doug Leggate : Okay. Simple enough. My focus is Stephen Riney : So just to get a bit of color on that, Doug, I think again, I think our shares are trading at a pretty meaningful discount today. They have improved over the last month or so and that no doubt as part of the purpose of the buyback. But we believe there's still trading at a meaningful discount relative to the price environment we find ourselves in. And we just think that's, for long-term shareholders, that's one of the better investment opportunities we can make, so we'll continue doing that. As long as the free Cash Flow holds up. So that's why we say it's a minimum of 60%. Doug Leggate : Steve, the 5-1/4 million, does that go to the Balance Sheet or does that go to buybacks as well, because that's not technically Operating cash flow? Stephen Riney : Yes we're just going to remain noncommittal on what the buybacks, and for that matter, the other 40% can go to the -- I mean the disposal proceeds and the other 40% of free Cash flow because we'll deal with that as it occurs. Could go to Balance Sheet strengthening, could go to more buybacks, could raise the dividend quicker. We've got -- we've got a number of things on the horizon with Egypt modernization also occurring. So we've got a lot of things still ahead of us here. Doug Leggate : I don't want to labor the point but credit agencies, do they have a view on the buyback, have you run this past them to get their opinion? Stephen Riney : We haven't spoken to them yet, but we will be speaking with them shortly. Doug Leggate : Okay. And my last one -- Stephen Riney : We will reassure them of the same thing that we've talked about here today. We're still going to have plenty of free cash flow to do further balance sheet improvements and [Indiscernible] from asset disposals, if we need to do that and if we feel like that's the best thing to do at the point in time. Doug Leggate : Thank you. My follow-up is a real quick one for clarification. Cheniere is your contract kicking in pari - passu with their 3rd Corpus Christi development, which is not even FID-ed yet. My understanding was that that contract to become effective middle of next year. Can you just offer some clarification on the timing? And maybe what you would expect that the ultimate tooling costs to be for you guys. Stephen Riney : Yes, I can certainly comment on the first part of that. Our contract is, while it was in the context of FID in another project, it's not contractually tied to any project. And so it's just a contract that, starts in 2023 and runs for 15 years. A 140 million cubic feet a day, and Schneer has an option to bring that forward one year to start it in mid 2022, July of 2022. And we were waiting to see if they will exercise that option. Doug Leggate : Alright, thanks folks. John Christmann : Thank you Doug. Operator : That ends our question-and-answer session. I will turn the call back over to John Christmann for closing remarks. John Christmann : Thank you. And before ending today's call, I'd like to leave you with the three following points. First, we're taking prudent and appropriate steps now to increase our capital investment to a level that will enable us to sustain production on a global basis for many years. Our portfolio offers considerable depth and flexibility to do this efficiently. Second, we're generating substantial free cash flow in this environment, which we currently estimate will be around $2 billion for the full-year 2021 and again in 2022. And lastly, we are committed to returning a minimum of 60% of our free cash flow via dividends and share buybacks. And we're demonstrating our commitment to this process right now in the Fourth Quarter. Thank you for participating in our call today. Operator, I'll turn it over to you. Operator : That concludes the conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised today's conference may be recorded. [Operator Instructions]  I'd now like to hand the conference over to Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gary Clark : Good morning, and thank you for joining us on APA Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John Christmann. Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results and 2022 outlook. Also on the call and available to answer questions are Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President of Development; Tracey Henderson, Senior Vice President of Exploration; and Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 25 minutes in length, with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you've had the opportunity to review our fourth quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apacorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the difference between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude noncontrolling interest in Egypt and Egypt's tax barrels. I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John. John Christmann : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. At the beginning of each year, I'd like to look back and reflect on our progress and 2021 marked an important turning point for APA Corporation. While there is clearly much more to accomplish, I believe we made outstanding progress on 6 specific fronts last year. First, we demonstrated the robust cash flow capacity of our base business. We entered 2021 with a plan to generate around $350 million of free cash flow assuming $45 WTI. By being mostly unhedged and with the benefit of a $68 average WTI price tailwind, free cash flow exceeded our plan by nearly $1.5 billion and came in at $1.8 billion for the year. This represents the highest annual free cash flow in more than a decade and is one of the highest in the company's 67-year history. Keep in mind, these results do not include any free cash flow uplift that will come following the Egypt PSC modernization we completed in late December. The free cash flow capacity of our base business has significantly improved over the past few years. We have accomplished this improvement through multiple initiatives focused on portfolio enhancement, improved capital allocation and capital productivity, per barrel margin expansion and relentless overhead cost rationalization. Although we are getting some traction in the market, we believe our free cash flow capacity is still not fully appreciated. Second, we strengthened the company financially. By maintaining capital discipline and investing at a level slightly below our plan, we let the strengthening oil price flow directly through to the balance sheet reducing upstream net debt in 2021 by $1.2 billion. In 1 year, we accomplished what we thought would take multiple years and made great progress toward our goal of returning to investment-grade status. Third, we initiated a capital return framework for our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, on the back of a strengthening balance sheet we implemented a robust long-term framework for returning capital to shareholders. Reducing debt was and continues to be important. However, we reached a point in 2021 where it became appropriate for equity holders to participate more directly and materially in cash returns. We feel our 60% return framework is a good balance, providing near-term cash returns to shareholders while still recognizing the importance of longer-term balance sheet strengthening. Thus far, we have returned capital under the new framework, primarily through share repurchases as we bought back nearly 8.5% of outstanding shares during the fourth quarter. We felt this was appropriate given the sizable gap in the free cash flow yield at which our stock was trading relative to our peer group. We are committed to returning capital under the 60% framework for the long term and anticipate a progressively larger dividend component as we see improvement in our relative share price performance, further strengthening of our balance sheet and reduced oil and gas price volatility. Fourth, we refreshed the economic foundation for our business in Egypt. At the end of December, we finalized our agreement to modernize the terms of our production sharing contracts in Egypt. We have a long history with Egypt, and this agreement sets the foundation for many years of a mutually beneficial partnership. The improved PSC terms return Egypt to the best long-term investment opportunity in our portfolio. In turn, this incentivizes increased capital spending and a return to long-term production growth. This is a tremendous outcome for both Egypt and for APA. Fifth, we continue to streamline our Permian portfolio. In 2021, we sold $256 million of noncore assets in the Permian Basin, and we plan to close on the sale of an $805 million minerals rights package in the Delaware Basin within the next week. You should anticipate continued noncore Permian asset sales.  And finally, we made good progress toward a potential FID in Suriname. In November, we announced a successful flow test and pressure build-up at our Sapakara South appraisal well. With further information and analysis, we are increasing our estimate of the connected resource in place in a single zone at Sapakara South-1 to more than 400 million barrels. We look forward to additional appraisal that should further increase the estimated resource in place at Sapakara South. We also announced a follow-on discovery at Krabdagu, which lies approximately 18 kilometers to the east of Sapakara South. We will initiate flow testing at Krabdagu in the coming days, and we'll share more details at the appropriate time. 2021 was also a transformational year for Altus. This week, we plan to close the previously announced merger with privately held EagleClaw Midstream, which will significantly scale the business and reduce APA's ownership to a minority interest. The combination creates the largest and best-in-class gathering, processing and transportation company in the Delaware Basin with capacity for product delivery to the Gulf Coast. The outlook for the new company is strong, and their plan is to maintain and ultimately grow the $6 per share dividend. For APA, this transaction enables deconsolidation of the midstream business and its associated debt. It also provides APA an opportunity for near-term liquidity of almost 1/3 of our 12.9 million Altus shares. 2021 was also a year of significant progress on our ESG initiatives and safety performance. We firmly believe that being proactive with respect to ESG is 1 of the most important strategic imperatives facing our industry. Our collective ability to meet much needed energy demand while also reducing emissions will determine our long-term success and viability. APA is committed to being part of the solution and part of the future, and we plan to demonstrate that commitment through a strong bias for near-term actions that will make a real difference. In 2021, we set an ambitious goal of eliminating routine flaring in the Permian Basin by year-end, which we accomplished 3 months ahead of schedule. APA is the first amongst its publicly traded peers in the Permian to end routine flaring, and we applaud the numerous companies that are now taking measures to do the same. APA also seeks continuous improvement in our safety performance and protocols. In 2021, we achieved a significant improvement in the 3 key safety indicators that impact the annual incentive compensation of every employee in the company. I am proud of our teams for delivering these results. The task now is to build on these successes in the future. In summary, 2021 was a year of outstanding progress for APA. The achievements I just highlighted along with several important ongoing initiatives will improve our operational and financial performance and sustainability for years to come. Turning now to the fourth quarter results. APA generated $1.3 billion of adjusted EBITDAX, making it our best quarter of the year. Upstream capital spending was $334 million for the quarter and $1.06 billion for the full year, both of which were below guidance. U.S. production exceeded guidance again in the fourth quarter as we continue to deliver good performance from our Permian oil plays and at Alpine High. Our focus was on increasing efficiencies through longer laterals, optimize well spacing and enhanced completion design. The success of these initiatives was recently recognized by JPMorgan analyst, Arun Jayaram who named APA as a top performer in his analysis of 2021 Midland Basin Well Performance. As we noted in prior calls, U.S. well connections in the second half of 2021 were significantly lower than in the first half due to the timing of our DUC completion program. Accordingly, we placed only 13 wells online in the U.S. during the fourth quarter, 11 of which were in the Southern Midland Basin. The remaining 2 completions were in the East Texas Austin Chalk. In October, a dedicated rig arrived in the Austin Chalk and initiated a drilling program that is expected to run through 2022. Internationally, gross production was up in the fourth quarter. However, adjusted volumes were below guidance due to unplanned downtime in the North Sea during the month of December. On the cost side, LOE increased again in the fourth quarter and was higher than our guidance. We have begun to see the impacts of inflation, particularly in fuel, chemicals, labor and steel costs. These pressures are showing up in all areas of spend. In yesterday's earnings materials, we set forth some high-level guidance on APA's 3-year outlook which I would now like to provide a bit more color around. With the onset of the pandemic at the beginning of 2020 and the resulting oil price collapse, we cut capital investment to protect the balance sheet. As a result, our base production levels have been in decline for the last 2 years. With the stronger oil price environment and an improved financial situation, our overarching goal for the next few years is to return to pre-pandemic production levels and then invest at a pace that will sustain or modestly grow those production volumes. Our capital program for 2022 will be approximately $1.6 billion, a slight increase from our prior view. This includes some small changes to the timing of the rig count increases in Egypt and in the U.S. as well as an updated view of inflation. This amount also includes $200 million for exploration and appraisal activities, mostly in Suriname. In 2023 and 2024, capital increases a little further despite a mostly unchanged activity set as we expect continued inflationary pressures. Over the 3-year period, we're planning on an aggregate capital investment of around $5 billion. Based on this planned level of capital activity, we should exit 2024 at production levels similar to 2019 after adjusting 2019 for divestments. Most of the growth will come from Egypt, with some modest improvement in the U.S. and declining volumes in the North Sea. At current strip pricing, we expect to generate approximately $6.5 billion of free cash flow over the next 3 years. By any measure, this is a strong free cash flow yield relative to market cap or enterprise value and it would be even stronger, if not for the heavily backwardated strip pricing. I would remind everyone that these numbers assume no production volumes from Suriname but do include continued capital investment for exploration and appraisal. If we FID any discoveries on Block 58 during the next 3 years, planned CapEx would increase modestly since 75% of our appraisal and development spend will be funded by our partner. Additionally, this outlook does take into account the pending Delaware Basin minerals package sale, but assumes no further portfolio changes. Finally, our commitment to return capital to shareholders over the next 3 years will remain unchanged. We will return a minimum of 60% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Before turning the call over to Steve, I'd like to wrap up with a few remarks about our ESG goals and initiatives. We have established several rigorous goals for 2022, which are designed to move the ESG needle as quickly as possible. We remain focused on our key pillars of air, water and communities and people.  Our short-term incentive compensation plan for 2022 includes 3 specific ESG-related goals. We will reduce upstream routine flaring in Egypt by 40%. We will initiate new programs to promote and deliver increased supplier diversity, and we will implement a new workplace ecosystem that recognizes the changing dynamics of technology and work schedules for our employees. We have also established rigorous new safety compliance protocols and metrics as we pursue continuous improvement in the health and well-being of our workforce and for the communities in which we operate. As we look to the longer term, we will invest a minimum of $100 million over the next 3 years in ESG initiatives, much of which will be focused on global emissions reductions programs. To underscore our commitment to these efforts, for the first time, we have added an emissions-related goal to our long-term incentive compensation plan. By the end of 2024, our goal is to deliver emissions-focused projects that eliminate at least 1 million tons of CO2 emissions per year. To provide added transparency, we plan to have these projects and their associated CO2 reductions externally verified.  And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney. Stephen Riney : Thank you, John. So let me start with further details related to our fourth quarter results. As noted in our news release yesterday, under generally accepted accounting principles, APA Corporation reported fourth quarter 2021 consolidated net income of $382 million or $1.05 per diluted common share. These results include several items that are outside of APA's core earnings, the largest of which was associated with noncash impairments, primarily on Altus Midstream's interest in the EPIC Crude Pipeline. Net of tax and noncontrolling interest, this reduced APA earnings by $123 million. The partial reversal of prior tax valuation allowances and other tax adjustments had a $42 million benefit to earnings. Please see our detailed table of non-GAAP financial measures in our financial and operations supplement for a full reconciliation of adjusted earnings. Excluding these and other smaller items, adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was $468 million or $1.29 per diluted common share. Lease operating expense in the quarter was above guidance as a result of increasing inflationary pressures and higher-than-expected emissions costs in the North Sea.  In the U.K., the price of emission credits has nearly doubled since credit auctions were initiated in May of 2021. G&A expense was also significantly above guidance, primarily due to the fourth quarter strength in our stock price and the resulting impact on noncash stock-related compensation expense. Costs were also impacted by a higher-than-planned incremental incentive compensation accrual in the quarter. Due to these higher costs as well as lower oil, gas and NGL prices in November and December, free cash flow for the quarter was $485 million below our guidance of $600 million, which we provided in early November. As John noted, the modernized production sharing contract in Egypt was ratified in late December. If you haven't already done so, please refer to the Egypt PSC Modernization Investor Presentation on our website for more details related to the updated terms and their anticipated impacts.  The new agreement became effective on April 1, 2021. From that date to the end of 2021, the true-up of revenue sharing net of some small closing-related costs was $245 million benefit to the APA, Sinopec joint venture. The agreement also included a signature bonus payable to EGPC of $100 million, half of the signature bonus was payable upon signing and was offset against outstanding receivables. The other half of the signature bonus is payable to EGPC over the next 5 years. Given the timing of the PSC signing late in December, our fourth quarter operational results include no impact from the PSC modernization. Turning to Altus Midstream. The business combination with EagleClaw Midstream is expected to close shortly. As a result, fourth quarter 2021 should be the final quarter for APA to consolidate Altus Midstream's balance sheet. This will eliminate the consolidation of approximately $1.4 billion of Altus' debt and redeemable preferred equity. Depending on how you model them, this could have a significant impact on APA debt metrics and multiples related to enterprise value. Now I would like to turn to the outlook for 2022. We are planning for a capital program of around $1.6 billion with $1.4 billion in development capital and $200 million of exploration and appraisal, mostly in Suriname. This level of activity should deliver company-wide annual adjusted production similar to that of 2021.  In Egypt, increased drilling activity in 2021 has already halted the decline in gross production volumes. With more drilling activity being added in 2022, gross production will turn to a growth trajectory through the year and into 2023. On an adjusted basis, you will see an immediate uplift in production in the first quarter given the revised terms of the modernized PSC. From that point, adjusted production should grow in line with gross production, excluding PSC-related impacts from changes in Brent oil price. In the North Sea, we anticipate a similar production level compared to 2021 as we will again have another lengthy turnaround season at Beryl. Additionally, the Ocean Patriot drilling rig is expected to be offline for approximately 3 months to repair damage incurred to its anchor system during a recent weather event. Production volumes in 2022 will be impacted by the reduced amount of rig activity. In the U.S., average production this year will be modestly below 2021 after adjusting for asset sales. However, we will exit 2022 in a position of sustaining to slightly growing U.S. production. There are 3 reasons for the decline compared to 2021. First, about 7,000 BOE per day of production is lost due to the Delaware minerals package sale that John mentioned earlier. Second, the DUC program largely completed in the first half of 2021 provided a significant production boost that will not be replicated in 2022. Finally, the underlying drilling program in the U.S. will only get to a maintenance level of activity around midyear after we have added the fourth drilling rig. On the cost side, inflationary pressures are real in our sector, and we are seeing that across many forms of cost. In particular, LOE is rising with everything from labor and trucking to fuels and chemicals under pressure. Our guidance for 2022 costs include these impacts. That said, we see risks of further pressures on these and other costs as we look to 2022 and beyond, especially if the current price environment prevails. All of the details around our 2022 full year and first quarter guidance can be found in our quarterly supplement on our website. Our 2022 guidance around certain costs may be difficult to reconcile to 2021 actuals due to the impact of the Altus deconsolidation. Please reach out to Gary and his team for further support. From a free cash flow perspective, 2022 looks very robust. At current strip prices, we anticipate free cash flow well in excess of $2 billion. In addition to strong cash flow from operations, we also expect $805 million in cash proceeds from the Delaware Basin mineral rights sale, and we anticipate a sell-down of up to 4 million shares of our ownership in Altus Midstream during the 3-month period following the closing of its combination with EagleClaw. All of that should provide a significant amount of available cash in the next few months. First priority for that cash will be to pay off the revolver. Beyond that, remaining available cash will be used in some combination to buy back shares, further reduce debt and to fund the dividend. I would note that in January we utilized the early call option feature on the $214 million of bonds that mature in April. So that debt effectively sits on the revolver today. Finally, I'd like to make a few remarks about steps taken on our new capital returns framework. In the fourth quarter, we returned well in excess of 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders, mostly through stock buybacks. We had to fund a portion of this on our revolver and had the confidence to do so given the robust price environment coupled with our expectation of significant near-term divestment proceeds.  Obviously, we cannot repurchase shares this aggressively every quarter, but we feel it was a good decision at that time. While relative valuation for APA has improved, we continue to believe our stock is a good value on both a relative and absolute basis. We are committed to our capital returns framework, so the share buybacks will continue in 2022.  And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : John, I wonder if I could ask you first on Suriname. Obviously, Krabdagu was announced before your earnings. When you and I last spoke, I guess, at our conference in November and multiple times since then, it seems to me that Krabdagu was kind of a gating item for -- not to put words in your mouth but what if there will be a Board or what the size of the Board will be. So I'm just wondering if you could give us an update on your thoughts there because it seems to me at least that the press release was somewhat right down the middle. What are you -- is there anything concern you here? Can you talk about was this multiple sands? Is there a flow test gating item you want to get past? What are you thinking? Maybe just frame for us what you think the next steps are? John Christmann : Thanks for the question. I mean, first of all, we made it clear that Krabdagu was the next well we needed to drill. It was technically an exploration well but it was a well we had fairly high confidence in because we're really starting to get an understanding of what is working and what we can image and so forth. So I think coming in and finding 90 meters of light oil pay and good quality rock which is predominantly just -- we did only drill down through the Campanian is a fantastic outcome. I mean we're very excited about it. We're gaining confidence on what's working. I think the key next step here is because it is an exploration well, is moving on to the flow test and the pressure build-ups and the beauty of this is, is we can do that now, and we are anxious to get on with it. So I think we just need time to confirm and get some more information. And then obviously, we'll be back to you with a lot more color once we validated that. Doug Leggate : You still see Sapakara Keskesi Krabdagu as a combination development? John Christmann : I mean the nice thing is at Sapakara South and in my prepared remarks, we stated that the connected volume to the Sapakara South-1 well has increased, and it's a good sign because with time and the build-up, things like -- fields get bigger and so forth. And so that has happened there. There is more appraisal to do at Sapakara South. The nice thing is with where it is connected or the distance, it could be connected. But I won't say that it has to be connected. So there's a lot of optionality there. We need to do the flow test at Krabdagu and then we'll come back to the game plan. And the nice thing is, while we're doing the flow test, there's optionality with where we send the rig next. Do we go ahead and appraise Krabdagu? Do we appraise the second well at Sapakara South1? Or there's also some nice-looking prospects in between here that we have confidence in. So there's a lot of optionality, Doug here, a lot to work with, and we just need time to collect more data and keep working the data. Doug Leggate : Okay. My follow-up, hopefully, a quick one, Steve. On the last call, you talked about a strip pricing before the modernization of Egypt, the PSC, more than $2 billion of free cash flow in 2022. And I guess that was back in the third quarter call. You've put out the same number today, which I think might be 1 of the reasons your stock is lagging. So can you walk us through what -- why is that number not been reset higher. And again, usual question for me. What do you think the duration of the free cash flow capacity of the portfolio is today? Stephen Riney : Yes, Doug. So I think I'd probably refer to the -- I think we put out a chart in our supplement that will give you a good view to the 3 years, and that will I think answer the last question you had there around the duration of cash flows and what should be happening to production volume and what that cash flow looks like under, I wouldn't say, a current strip, the February 7 strip, which we're above today and then an $86 flat WTI price environment, which was the '22 strip on that February 7 date. You can see in my script, I said it will be more than $2 billion of free cash flow. You can see from the chart, it's closer to around $2.2 billion. What would be any difference in that versus maybe some expectations, I'm not sure what the strip price environment was when I said it would be $2 billion. We can go back and maybe reconcile that. But I think, number one, we've divested the minerals package. So that's probably somewhere in the neighborhood of $100 million of cash flow that will come out of 2022 on a free cash flow basis. We're also using the 2 -- the February 7 strip, which is a little bit below where we are actually today. And again, I'm not sure exactly how that compares to the strip I used last time and the costs that we talked about, John and I both talked about what's going on with cost environment. You see it in some of the assumptions that we've made in our guidance which is also in our supplement around LOE going up, G&A going up, and we can talk about some of those things, if you'd like. So costs are going up. and it's also affecting the capital program. So we -- and I noted in my comments that we've built some inflation into the capital program, and that's why it's a little bit higher. Part of the reason why it's a little bit higher now than what we were talking about back in November. So I think it's a number of things that kind of accumulate there. Some of those are probably maybe us being a little bit conservative, especially on the cost side as we have built a reasonable amount of inflation into here. We're not saying that it's inappropriate, especially in this price environment, but costs are kind of moving quickly these days. And we just wanted to make sure that we've built an appropriate view into the plan at this point. And so we'll continue to monitor this as we go through the year. Doug Leggate : Okay. I'll let someone ask about the use of proceeds. Operator : Our next question comes from John Freeman with Raymond James. John Freeman : The first question I had, I guess, piggybacking on Doug's questions related to Suriname. So the $200 million of -- roughly $200 million of capital rose from maybe not Suriname but close enough. $200 million that's allocated towards Suriname. It seems like maybe in the comments, John, you haven't necessarily decided the exact mix of the plan this year in terms of what's going to be appraisal versus exploration. So is the $200 million roughly, I don't know, sort of a conservative kind of placeholder until you have a better idea of the mix of appraisal versus exploration because obviously, what you're on the hook for is quite a bit different if it's exploration versus appraisal. John Christmann : No, John, it's a great question. I think we've got some optionality and flexibility in there. And I think we've tried to just conservatively handle the $200 million out of covered, both between Block 53 and 58, right? So I think it's a good estimate. And there's very important to a well or 2 to swing either way. John Freeman : Okay. Yes. I just look like last year. You ended up coming in a good bit below the initial budget you'll put out on Suriname last year. So that's what I ask.  And then the other question related to the mineral sales. So last quarter, you all said you were targeting in 2022 $500 million of noncore U.S. sales that were mainly going to come out of the Permian. Is this 805 -- the divestiture you did on the minerals should we think of this as just that's -- that was in addition to whatever you were contemplating. I think previously, you all kind of contemplated additional deals in the Central Basin Platform. So just trying to get an idea of how to think about the minerals deal you all did that was a good bit more on proceeds than what you all contemplated doing for all of '22? John Christmann : No. I would just say, John, we said we'd sell a minimum of $500 million. Clearly, we've met that through the sale. But as I said in my prepared remarks, there's still opportunity out there for some potential additional pruning if we choose to do so. But I mean, we view it as we've met that goal and we've exceeded that goal. Operator : Next question comes from Michael Scialla with Stifel. Michael Scialla : I want to follow up on Suriname as well. You said the discovery derisks some additional prospects. So is Krabdagu a different play type than the prior 4 discoveries? And thinking in particular, are you feeling like you're able to identify black oil versus higher GOR prospects at this point? Just looking for more color there. John Christmann : Mike, it's a great question. And even with your background, I think you probably have some insights into what we're getting a handle with. But I think from the geophysical side and the geologic model side, it's derisking and becoming a lot more predictive, which gives us confidence. And it's the same play type. I mean we're in Maastrichtian and Campanian. We did not drill on down to the San Antonio in here. So this was really just the upper 2 targets. But I think it's just confidence in what we're being able to see an image and put into the models. So it's a positive from that perspective. Michael Scialla : Very good. I wanted to see, Steve, you mentioned, I think, previously that you plan to retire another $337 million of long-term debt this year at par. I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks, but I missed it. There may be some plans to go beyond that. Anything you can talk about there? Stephen Riney : Yes. So the $337 million is a combination of the April '22 bonds and the January of '23 bonds. And both of those -- the April '22 bonds were called early in January of this year. And as I said in my prepared remarks, that $214 million of debt sits on the revolver effectively today. And the remaining amount, which is the January maturities, we will call those in the fourth quarter of this year at par. They just have a 3-month early call option. That's all. And we generally exercise that. So we'll pay down at least those amounts of debt. And again, what I said in the -- in my prepared remarks is that we will -- with the cash coming in, in the first quarter, we will pay down the revolver, which at the end of last year, the revolver had $542 million on it. And again, we did add that $215 million -- $214 million from the April maturities to that. So there have been some other ins and outs on the revolver during the quarter, but the revolver will end the quarter at zero. So that will be the first use of cash.  At the end of the quarter or through the quarter, I should say, we -- between the operating free cash flow, the royalty package sale, which we should close before the quarter ends. If you exclude any sale of Altus shares during the quarter, if you use all of that cash from operating cash flow and the royalty package sale to pay off the revolver, you'd still be left over somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 million to $600 million of cash, which we may have already or may use to buy back shares or repurchase other debt further reduced debt. And we'll talk about what we've chosen to do with any excess cash with each quarterly results instead of getting into a process of just ad hoc conversations whenever we're on conference calls or anything like that. Operator : Our next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles Meade : I wanted to go back to the Sapakara South1. So obviously, that's a positive result from the flow test, 400 million barrels in place. But should what should we be thinking about in terms of recoverable there? And can you frame or refresh for us? I know this is maybe overly simplistic. But what do you need to get to in terms of total recoverable resources before you're within striking distance across the finish line on FID. John Christmann : Well, a couple of different questions there, Charles, and I'll give a little bit of insight, and then I'll let Dave Pursell jump in here as well. But I think the things to know on Sapakara South. Number one, 1 continue -- kind of contiguous thick blocky sand; 1.4 Darcy rock. So you're going to have very efficient reservoir and high recovery. And then the second thing is with one of the keys after you do a flow test is you collect the data on the build-up and the characteristics there. And it's from most characteristics of the build-up that really showed us and demonstrated that there's even more resource there than we had mapped in Sapakara South. So it points you to more appraisal, and it's a really good sign. So Dave, I'll let you jump in on the second part of that question. David Pursell : Yes. Thanks, John. Charles, good question. John is right on the build-up test. Remember those -- that we floated for a few days and then shut in for a long-term build-up and the longer -- that longer-dated pressure really allows us to start to hone in on recoverable volumes, and that's where the original range of that initial range of 325 to 375 that's moving higher as we continue to analyze the longer shut-in data. On recovery factor, again, that's going to be a function of what the development scheme looks like if we get there. But in 1.4 Darcy Rock that's world-class reservoir. It's 1.4 Darcy, as John pointed out, it's thick and blocky to any range of recovery factors that you might be using, you want to look at the high end of that range because this is some of the best rock you'll see. So we're very comfortable and excited about what kind of recoveries we could get, it's just too premature to throw a number out there. Charles Meade : And Dave, any comment or just kind of a guidepost on what to think about as far as recoverable to meet the FID threshold? David Pursell : It's a good question. I suspect other folks will try to ask that. We'll work with our partner to try to get to development, and there's a number of factors, including recoverable resource that factor into that. So I'll just leave it there. Charles Meade : Got it. Yes, I know it's a simple way to ask on a complex some. But 1 other question on the Delaware Basin mineral sale. Was that a piece of -- or was that a piece of that original BP acquisition -- BP Permian acquisition that's where those assets came from? John Christmann : Some of it came from that, Charles. It's just a Delaware Basin package, and there's a few different pieces of it that came in there, but some of that was part of the old [indiscernible] BP. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Bob Brackett : A 2 parter. One is, I think in the verbal comments I heard light oil at Krabdagu versus not seeing that in the press release. Could you kind of confirm the quality of the oil? John Christmann : Yes, Bob, it's a great question. It's early. We've got samples and they're on their way to lab. But we can confirm it's light oil in all 90 meters of pay that we released. Bob Brackett : Perfect. And the second 1 might be a bit pick and knits, but you've mentioned in the release and in your words a minute ago, the world-class reservoir quality sitting there at Sapakara South1. And I think the language in the release on the reservoir quality of Krabdagu was middle of the fairway. Anything there? Or is that just you're being vague until you actually get core sample and get some real measurements? David Pursell : Yes, Bob, this is Dave Pursell. We want to see the flow test. I think before we flow tested Sapakara, we were probably using the same language. We want to see the data and whether it's the core data and/or the flow test. We're going to wait to see what the results are from those before we get out of the fairway on that. Bob Brackett : Perfect. I'll stop asking lawyerly questions. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : Maybe our first question is just on cash returns, our favourite subject. In your prepared remarks, John or Steve, I think you mentioned a progressively larger dividend. And I think also your prior commentary on that was that your base dividend needs to be just meaningfully higher on a yield basis versus the S&P. So we're just wondering how you're thinking about where the base dividend can grow, whether it's a yield or some of your peers have, for example, a cap on the post-breakeven dividend or they have like a maximum percentage of CFO that the base dividend will be at some mid-single price? John Christmann : Yes. Jeanine, and I can let Steve jump in here as well. But I think in general, just over the 3-year period, we are laying out with the amount of free cash flow that we're going to generate, you could see us progressively increase that dividend. I think we're a believer in, want as much in the base dividend. And today, by our actions you've seen, we've had a desire to buy back more shares because of where we trade on a free cash flow yield. But I think we're just laying a framework there that over time, we do anticipate we will be able to raise the dividend Steve, anything you want to add? Stephen Riney : Yes. I think. And we've said this in the past here in the recent past, Jeanine. I think the best thing for APA to be doing right now is buybacks, leaning into the buybacks with any excess cash flow because of the discount that we still see ourselves trading at. That said, I think the base dividend needs to be competitive. It needs to be competitive not just with our peers but with the broader market. We recognize that. And I think that means in the long term, in our sector, dividend yields need to go higher than where they are today, which averages somewhere in the neighborhood of 2%.  As a perspective, if you take our 60% capital returns framework, if that was all in dividends, we'd be yielding in excess of 10% on our dividend today. But we're not paying that all-in dividends. It is in buybacks -- a lot of it in buybacks, the vast majority in buybacks. And John spoke a little bit in his prepared remarks about what would cause us to raise the base dividend. And I think the most important thing around the base dividend and improving that and increasing that over time is that we want to be confident that that's resilient. We've commented before on the amount of pain that we endured when we cut the dividend by 90% in early 2020, anticipating what was ahead of us at that point in time. And so we want that dividend to be resilient when we raise it.  But really, the things that are going to raise the dividend is some sustained improvement in relative share trading, some more strengthening of the balance sheet and possibly not required, but possibly a less volatile price environment than we've endured over the last few years. And really, any combination of those types of things are going to give you the confidence to be able to raise the dividend and do so and feel like it's going to be resilient through time. And so that's our approach to the dividend. We definitely need to raise it, and we will do that over time. Jeanine Wai : Okay. Great. Our second question is just maybe heading back to the 3-year outlook, which we appreciate you all given us. Can we maybe dig in a little bit more on some of the assumptions? For example, I think you clarified. Can you just clarify whether the plan is only valid at certain price outlook? We know you showed free cash flow estimates at the strip and higher. You also mentioned that inflation was built into the outlook. So maybe any commentary on what level of inflation you've assumed along with anything on U.S. cash taxes. John Christmann : Jeanine, I think in general, we've set the activity levels and have confidence in those. We've been planning around those. And I think that's why there's a lot of confidence in this year's plan. In terms of inflation, we're seeing more right now probably in the U.S. than we are in the international market. But those would be the 2 factors. But I think we've got a lot of confidence in the plan. It's a relatively stable plan over the next 3 years, and we are going to be growing oil, I think, at about 5%, driven primarily by Egypt. Stephen Riney : Yes. And just a little further color on that. I think the capital program is robust through a pretty wide price range. If prices go up, the capital -- the activity set isn't going to change from what we have planned. The cost of that activity could possibly go up with some further inflation if we found ourselves in a much higher price environment. But it's also a robust activity set even in a lower price environment. And as a matter of fact, I think it's probably a robust program all the way down to $50 WTI because it's the sustaining capital program that we want to have in place. And we can certainly afford that and still be generating free cash flow even below -- well below $50 WTI.  So we'll stay with the capital program, and that is a good one and a robust one and won't move with pretty broad movements in price. The tax question that you had, we do not anticipate paying -- being a U.S. cash taxpayer for quite some time. If we found ourselves in an extremely high price environment for a few years, we could. We have 2 forms of tax loss carry forwards, but we have multiple forms. But the 2 big ones are what you would call grandfathered tax losses that are that can be used 100% to offset taxable income. And then we have some other tax losses that are not grandfathered under the recent tax changes and would be subject to an 80% limit that could be used to offset up to 80% of taxable income. And so when you get into -- you go through the first the grandfathered losses first and when you get into the non-grandfathered loss, you could find yourselves in a situation where you'd be paying taxes on 20% of your taxable income, but that would be quite some time at the current price environment that we're in. Operator : Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Neal Dingmann : My first question is on the, John, really just on the ease of activity. You all have laid out nice plans to increase the rig count. It's about 15% by midyear this year given the high economics of the place. So I'm just wondering when you look on a go forward, what are the limiting factors on how much further you could push the activity of this play? Just wanted obviously given the great economics there. John Christmann : No, Neal, you're spot on to kind of what the plan is. We're currently at 12 rigs today. I think we had the 13th rig next month, and then we'll be at 15 midyear. We think that's a good place. I think one of the keys with Egypt is while we were working the modernization, we've been building inventory and putting together a pretty robust drilling line. So we're excited about the program there. I just was over in Egypt, and I can tell you, Egypt is excited about it as well. And we've got a lot of work to do in terms of merging the concessions and the JVs while executing but we're off to a good start and a lot of momentum and a lot of anticipation. We're excited about it. Neal Dingmann : I'd say really look forward to activity there. And then secondly, just on domestic pressures, I notice you've continued to mention even on this call, the domestic OFS inflation along with some difficulty, maybe procuring pipe and other equipment. I'm just wondering do you see the same challenges on this. I'm just wondering how much long do you think this to go forward? Or do you anticipate this mitigating a bit in the coming quarters? John Christmann : No. I mean I think the key with us is in the luxury we've had is we set our activity sets and we plan those. I mean we've been planning to add the fourth rig in the U.S. since last fall. And so I think we've got good line of sight on our services and activities. Supply chain is working several quarters out, and we find ourselves in a pretty good place. But I also say it takes time, right? I mean that fourth rig will come in midyear, and we couldn't have added it any sooner in the U.S.  So it just takes a lot of rigor and a lot of planning and a lot of stability in the activity sets. And I think that's where we've landed everything in a place where we've got a lot of confidence around those. But let's not kid ourselves, there are pressures in the system. Truck drivers out in West Texas. Chemicals, fuel, there are pressures in the system and steel and everything else that's going up, especially on some of our longer-dated things. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Scott Gruber : Circling back on the balance sheet, I may have missed this, but is there a leverage target at some normalized crude price that you'll target over the medium-to-longer term, gross debt level that you'll target over the medium term post the Altus deconsolidation? How are you guys thinking about targets for the balance sheet from here? Stephen Riney : Yes. We don't have a specific target in mind. We have -- what we have in mind is getting back to investment grade. And while that's important, it's not urgent that we get it done right away. It is important that we get that done now. And so we don't have any specific target for long-term debt. In the end, it's -- the rating agencies will decide what level of long-term debt, what type of debt-to-EBITDA metrics would allow us to get back to investment grade. And so we're targeting whatever it takes to get back to investment grade. I think it's probably going to require a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1 or below, especially in this price environment. We've made pretty good progress on that in 2021. We're going to make more progress on that in 2022. If we do -- if we pay down no more debt this year other than what we have planned and the debt that's sitting on the revolver at the end of '21, if we use all remaining free cash flow for share buybacks we would end the year at the current strip with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.1. So we're getting into the right ballpark and we'll see what the rating agencies will do with that. Scott Gruber : Got it. And then just a quick 1 on Alpine High. The 4 million share early sell-down option associated with Altus EagleClaw combo, I believe it came with the stipulation that you invest the first $75 million in new Alpine High development activities over the subsequent 18 months. Is that spend in the budget for '22? And can you talk about the plan for Alpine High at these commodity prices within the multiyear plan? David Pursell : Yes, Scott, this is Dave Pursell. Yes, that's -- it's in the budget. We have the fourth rig in the U.S. We're adding. Think about that as a Delaware Basin focused rigs. It will do some drilling in Alpine and also do some drilling at our DXL field, which flows into the Altus Midstream assets. And so there's a -- it will move around in the basin over the next couple of years. But it will do a fair amount of drilling at Alpine specific. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Just curious that can you talk about that, the CapEx how that is going to spread throughout the quarters? Are they going to be pretty ratable or that 1 particular quarter is going to be heavier than usual? John Christmann : No. I mean I think you've got a little gradual build in the schedules with the Egypt rigs ramping. By midyear, we'll be at 15, we're at 12 now. We're going to add a rig in the Permian midyear, so it'll be a little bit heavier back half. And then the only shift you've got right now is with the Ocean Patriot needing to go in for some repairs that were addressed in the prepared remarks. But beyond that, nothing -- it's going to be pretty steady given the way we've geared our program. Paul Cheng : Yes. And the second question is that, I think previously, when you guys use complete PSC modernization, talking about this year will be a mid-teen type of growth in the oil production. If we're looking at 2023 and forward, with a 15-rig program, what kind of growth that you would be able to generate over there on the [indiscernible] basis? John Christmann : Egypt is going to drive the primary growth in the portfolio of oil over the next 3 years. And so I think we've outlined approximately 5% for Apache total to get us back to kind of the pre-COVID levels. And Egypt is going to be the driver. So that's probably going to put that more in the 10% range. Paul Cheng : Okay. And that I just curious that is that extend, I presume that more than 2024. So if we look a bit longer term, is that 10% is kind of target for you guys or -- John Christmann : I mean we really just laid out, Paul, a 3-year look on that. But clearly, the plan is to continue investing at the same rate or potentially higher in Egypt as we move on. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Scott Hanold : I'm just kind of curious on maybe following up that question from Paul. Like when I look at the chart on Page 9 of the outlook through 2024, you do have a nice step-up in oil '21, '22 and '23. But '23, '24 looks a little flatter with gas going up a lot more. Can you give us a sense of the dynamic around there because I know the Qasr field in Egypt is on probably a pretty good decline at this point? So like where does the gas pick up in '23 and '24 in your outlook? John Christmann : Yes, Dave, are you -- David Pursell : Yes. I think if you look at the portfolio wide, the growth in Egypt is going to be really driven by oil. There will be obviously gas growth as well, but it will be oil. The gas growth in the portfolio will likely come from the Delaware Basin and Alpine. Scott Hanold : Okay. So it's more of Alpine High, great. Okay. And then as my follow-up, turning to the Permian and ex-Alpine High. Can you give us a sense of where you think your depth of your core Tier 1 inventory is so when you think about your outlook over the 3 years and maybe a little beyond what kind of depth do you see there at a, say, 3 to 4-rig cadence. David Pursell : Yes, we're well beyond the 3-year program. We get out towards the end of the decade easily. Scott Hanold : Okay. And is that sort of Delaware or Midland? Or just kind of a combination of both? David Pursell : It's a combination of both, Scott. It will -- our SMB program has been the driver, and that's where we'd see the core, but we're adding an extra rig into the Delaware because we have confidence that we have longer-term inventory there as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc. Leo Mariani : I wanted to ask a little bit on the North Sea here. I know that you clearly have been plagued with some unplanned downtime. And of course, you have turnarounds in that area. But as I'm just looking at the production, you guys were around 62,000 BOE per day in the fourth quarter of '20. It looks like it's down about 30% to the fourth quarter of '21. It sounds like a lot of that was maintenance downtime related. I just wanted to get a sense. You have a comment in here that you can get back close to 50,000 by the end of 2022. In terms of how you view that asset. Do you see that 50 is kind of being little bit more stable in that outlook? Or do you see the 50 probably continuing to trend down? And is it just kind of always anticipation of that kind of 2-rig program in the North Sea? John Christmann : No, it's a good observation. I mean I think the key with the North Sea when you look at -- we've got 2 different assets there, Forties and Beryl. And Forties, we've got the Ocean Patriot up there. We're working. We're doing subsea tiebacks. We've had that rig working for a long time. And we did have 2 rig breakdowns that we typically haven't seen that have just kind of slid the schedule back. One was some things with the BOP. And then as we mentioned, this had some really rough weather and had 1 of the anchors break on one of the tie down lines, and we've still got to get that rig into the shipyard to have that repaired. So when you're running 1 floater and then you have something like this, which is kind of a very unusual event, it slides back a key well like Garten 4, which was scheduled to come on until the back half of this year. So I mean, I think we have confidence in getting back to the 50. But if you look at Forties and how we're starting to operate it, we've got 1 platform rig. We've been working between Beryl and Forties. We're definitely starting to move into the wind down in terms of how we look at Forties from a capital investment perspective. And we will be kind of modifying how we're going to operate that. We've historically run a drilling campaign, and we won't be doing that in the future. When we bought that asset from BP in 2003, it was scheduled to be abandoned in 2012. Here, we are a decade later, we see that still being another decade from now, but we will be starting to think about the twilight years on Forties as opposed to investing capital in Beryl and continuing to expand and adding subsea tiebacks. Leo Mariani : Okay. Very helpful color for sure. And maybe just jumping over to Suriname here. So I think there was a point in time where all maybe talked about kind of a 2-rig program on Block 58. But it seems like maybe it's just -- it's kind of gone to 1 rig. Has there just been any shift in the thinking of the partnership here in terms of how you view the asset or maybe you just think it's a little better to go a little slower, kind of still early in the appraisal program and if you guys have continued success appraising and you get to FID, do you envision this as maybe going back to a couple of rigs as you look out in the 3-year plan? John Christmann : Yes. I think it's a function of equipment and timing. There were -- Total brought in 2 rigs. The developer was scheduled to leave and it did leave. We still got the Valiant. I think if you read some of their comments that committed to drilling 3 more wells this year in Block 58. And that would imply that there's probably more activity needed to get that accomplished. But we've got options on the rig that's coming, the Gerry de Souza that's coming to Block 53. We've got additional options there. So there's some flexibility in terms of how we approach it. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to John Christmann for closing remarks. John Christmann : Thank you, operator. I'd like to close with the following comments. We've outlined a 3-year overview based on a heavily backwardated strip that delivers much stronger production and free cash flow than currently modeled by the Street. With $6.5 billion of projected free cash flow, we will return $4 billion to shareholders under our current framework that leaves $2.5 billion for debt reduction or additional shareholder returns through buybacks and/or dividend increases. Clearly, we will make material returns to shareholders, and we will continue to strengthen the balance sheet. Lastly, we are very pleased with how Suriname is progressing and look forward to the data that is coming from the flow test at Krabdagu.  Operator, back to you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the APA Corporation First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Gary Clark : Good morning, and thank you for joining us on APA Corporation's First Quarter 2022 Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John Christmann; Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results and outlook. Also on the call and available to answer questions are Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President of Development, Tracey Henderson, Senior Vice President of Exploration; and Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations. Our prepared remarks will be around 20 minutes in length, with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you've had the opportunity to review our first quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apacorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude noncontrolling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that, I'll turn the call over to John. John Christmann : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. The first quarter brought a strengthening in both oil and gas prices to levels unseen since 2014. This quickly shifted the prevailing energy narrative to questions about spare capacity, energy security and whether producers could realistically deliver more reliable and affordable oil and natural gas. These are all very good questions and hopefully represent a more thoughtful outlook for our energy dialogue. At APA, we significantly increased our capital activity coming out of 2021, and we will remain squarely focused on executing on our 3-year plan, generating strong free cash flow, delivering on our shareholder return framework and continuing to deleverage our balance sheet. Since the beginning of 2021, we have made tremendous progress with debt reduction, which enabled the initiation of our capital return framework. In that time frame, we have reduced our outstanding bond debt by $3 billion, repurchased $1.1 billion of APA stock or roughly 10% of shares outstanding and increased annualized dividend to $0.50 per share. At current strip prices, we expect to generate approximately $2.9 billion of free cash flow in 2022. Based on our capital return framework, this would imply a minimum of $1.8 billion of return to shareholders. Thus, if commodity prices sustain at these levels, you should expect an acceleration in the pace of share buybacks through the rest of the year. With regard to our operational strategy and 3-year capital activity plan, we anticipate no material changes at this time. In Egypt, we have been increasing our rig count over the past year, investing in shorter cycle projects designed to deliver 8% to 10% compounded gross oil production growth over the next 3 years. In the U.S., a fourth rig, which was contracted in September, recently arrived and has begun operations. This should help return U.S. oil production to a modest rate of growth as planned. Given the substantial supply chain bottlenecks and scarcity of oil service equipment and field personnel, any attempt to increase activity in the U.S. would be logistically challenging and capital inefficient. In the North Sea, our plan calls for a stable drilling program with 1 floater and 1 platform rig, which should be capable of broadly sustaining production over the next 3 years. And lastly, we continue to explore and appraise our 2 large blocks offshore Suriname, which we believe have the potential to deliver a significant new source of lower carbon intensity oil production. Of equal importance to this investment activity is continuing to reduce emissions throughout our global operations and improving the health and welfare of our employees and the people in the communities where we operate. Turning now to some details of the first quarter. Our results continue to demonstrate the power of our unhedged diversified global upstream oil and gas portfolio. Some of the key highlights for the quarter include : free cash flow generation of $675 million, up 39% compared with $485 million in the preceding quarter. In addition to strong operational cash flows, we realized approximately $1 billion in proceeds from the sale of selected minerals acreage in the Delaware Basin and the monetization of a portion of our shares in Kinetic. We continue to return cash to shareholders through the dividend and ongoing share buybacks. During the first quarter, we repurchased $261 million of APA shares. Since initiating the buyback last October, we have repurchased more than 10% of the company's shares through the end of March at an average price of $29. We believe our stock is a compelling value and remain committed to this program as an important part of our returns framework. We also took another significant step forward in strengthening the balance sheet with $1.3 billion of bond debt reductions during the quarter. In terms of operational highlights, we exceeded our oil production target in the Permian Basin and continue to deliver significant productivity improvements in both the Delaware and Southern Midland Basins. We also announced an exploration discovery at Krabdagu on Block 58 in Suriname. Upstream capital investment in the quarter was approximately $360 million or $30 million below guidance, which was mostly driven by the delay of some activity into the second quarter. Despite the lower first quarter spend, we are increasing full year capital investment guidance by about 8% to $1.725 billion. Approximately half of this increase is associated with Suriname as we now plan to keep the Noble Jerry Desouza drillship in country following conclusion of operations at the Rasperwell in Block 53. Non-operated spending as well as some changes in our U.S. activity mix account for most of the remaining capital increase. Total adjusted production in the first quarter was 322,000 BOE per day, which was down about 3% from the fourth quarter and in line with expectations. Total U.S. volumes decreased 7% from the fourth quarter, driven primarily by well completion timing in the Delaware Basin Minerals divestiture in early March. U.S. oil production was nearly 70,000 barrels per day and continues to exceed expectations with Permian Basin wells demonstrating excellent performance. This offset some softness in natural gas and NGL production caused by weather events and unplanned third-party downtime. We have been consistent in noting that U.S. production will bottom in the second quarter as an increase in the number of wells placed on production in the second half of the year and incremental activity from a fourth rig should drive volumes higher. That fourth rig is now running in the Delaware Basin, where it is drilling out a previously unfinished 6-well pad at DXL in Reeves County. Following this, the rig will mobilize to Alpine High to resume gas and NGL development drilling in the summer. Outside the Permian Basin, 1 rig is currently delineating the Austin Chalk in Brazos County, where we are in the early stages of flowback on the first 3-well pad. Moving to international. First quarter adjusted volumes increased 8% compared to the fourth quarter driven by the positive impacts of our recently modernized PSC terms in Egypt. Adjusted production in Egypt was just over 68,000 BOEs per day consisting of 57% oil. We deferred a number of high rate uphole recompletions from the first quarter into the second quarter as the producing zones in these targeted wells were still delivering at economic rates. As a result, first quarter Egypt oil production was a bit below expectations. However, we are now seeing a significant uptick as this recompletion work is performed. We are in the process of adding our 13th rig in the Western Desert, with the 14th and 15th rigs expected by midyear as planned. Dave Pursell can provide more color on our Egypt operations during Q&A. In the North Sea, production of 43,000 BOE per day was impacted by unplanned downtime at the Forties Echo platform. This resulted in the loss of 2,300 barrels of oil per day for approximately half of the first quarter, and we expect required repair work will keep these volumes offline through the end of the second quarter. Scheduled turnaround repair and maintenance work will also be conducted at both barrel and Forties through the summer. So we expect North Sea production to decrease for the next 2 quarters before rebounding in the fourth quarter. Moving on to Suriname. In Block 53, we spread the Rasp per exploration well in late March and are drilling above the target zones at this time. We will update the status of this prospect at the appropriate time. In Block 58, we are focused on drilling a prioritized list of exploration and appraisal wells in the central portion of the block to assess and appraise resource, scope and scale to underpin and optimize a potential first development. At the previously announced Krabdagu discovery, flow testing is complete and we are now in the buildup stage in both tested zones. After we have obtained and analyze this data, we will provide more details. Following conclusion of operations at Krabdagu, the Maersk Valiant will mobilize to the nearby Dico exploration prospect. Before turning the call over to Steve, I'd like to make a few remarks about our ESG progress. We have multiple initiatives underway within our focus areas of air, water and people, and we are piloting and investing in a number of technologies to support the measurement, understanding and reduction of our emissions footprint. In Egypt, we recently completed 2 projects that are making an immediate and material contribution toward our goal this year of reducing upstream flaring in our Western Desert operations by 40%. I will close by commenting on a frequent question that E&P companies are receiving from industry watchers. That is how will capital investment programs and capital return frameworks change in the context of sustained higher oil and gas prices. As I noted at the beginning of the call, we do not currently anticipate any significant changes to the activity levels set forth in our 3-year program. APA remains committed to safe and steady and efficient operations in all of our regions and returning a minimum of 60% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney. Steve Riney : Thanks, John. For the first quarter of 2022, under generally accepted accounting principles, APA Corporation reported consolidated net income of $1.88 billion or $5.43 per diluted common share. As is commonly the case, our results include several items that are outside of APA's core earnings. The most significant of these was $1.1 billion of after-tax gains on the divestments of Altus Midstream and the Delaware Basin minerals package. Other material items included a $187 million benefit, related to a release of tax valuation allowance to offset deferred U.S. income tax expense or a $53 million charge for early extinguishment of debt associated with our March bond tender. Excluding these and some other smaller items, adjusted net income for the first quarter was $668 million or $1.92 per diluted common share. In our financial and operation supplement, you can find detailed tables for all of our non-GAAP financial measures, including 1 for adjusted earnings. Our first quarter results underscore APA's strong free cash flow generating capacity. The impact of the Egypt PSC modernization on production volumes, combined with the higher commodity price environment, drove a 39% increase in first quarter free cash flow compared to the preceding quarter. Cost inflation has become a popular topic in quarterly earnings calls and for good reason. We embedded a good amount of cost pressure into the budgets we laid out in February. And for the most part, costs are tracking close to that plan. However, 1 cost issue in the first quarter that was not fully captured in guidance is related to equity-linked compensation. So let me go through a few details on that with you. You may recall that we have multiple equity-linked compensation plans that are denominated in APA shares. As these plans vest, some are paid out in actual shares and some are paid out in cash, we accrue the anticipated cost of these plans each calendar quarter through their various vesting periods. For the payers that pay out in cash, the accounting is a little more complicated. In the fourth quarter of 2021 and now, again, in the first quarter of 2022. These plans had a significant impact on our results for 3 key reasons, all related to improved underlying business performance and share price performance over the last several months. First, since we accrue the cost of these plans at the quarter end share price, our quarterly cost accrual has been increasing substantially with the near doubling of our share price since the beginning of October. Second, the cumulative number of shares that are accrued but not yet paid out must be mark-to-market at the end of each quarter. The first quarter results include a large mark-to-market impact again due to the significant share price increase since January 1. Third, as a result of the improved business performance and relative share price, the variable payout plans now appear likely to pay out at a higher level than previously anticipated. So we are increasing the accrual levels accordingly. These stock plans apply to nearly the entire employee base. So some costs will flow to LOE and some to CapEx, but most will flow through G&A. As a result, G&A is notably above our previous guidance and market expectations. We have revised our G&A guidance for the remainder of this year accordingly. That said, stock price movement due to its unpredictable nature will continue to impact quarterly results beyond our revised guidance. We achieved a significant milestone during the first quarter with the closing of the Altus Midstream Eagle Claw business combination and the monetization of a portion of our ownership in the resulting entity Kinetic Holdings. Accounting rules require that we consolidate Altus' profit and loss through the February 22nd merger date. So you will see a partial quarter for these items reflected on our income statement. From a balance sheet perspective, upon closing of the transaction and reduction of our ownership to a minority interest, we will no longer consolidate Altus' balance sheet. As a result, $1.4 billion of debt and redeemable preferred equity from the 2021 year-end balance sheet are no longer consolidated. This could have a significant positive impact on various APA debt metrics, depending on how you calculate it. Subsequent to the completion of the transaction, APA sold 4 million shares of our Kinetic common stock holdings in March for net proceeds of $224 million. At quarter end, the market value of APA's remaining 8.9 million Kinetic shares was approximately $580 million. At this point, we view Kinetic as a noncore holding and following the expiry of our lockup period in February of 2023, we will evaluate the potential for further monetization of our position. In the meantime, we continue to see this as an attractive investment with a leading Delaware Basin footprint, stable cash flows, a strong dividend and attractive near-term growth potential. Turning now to the progress we've made during the quarter on our balance sheet. In addition to the deconsolidation of Kinetic, APA completed 2 important steps on the path to reducing leverage and maintaining strong liquidity. First, we initiated a tender offer in March for $500 million of outstanding bonds. We upsized the tender to $1.1 billion, with a focus on repurchasing shorter maturity bonds. This extended our average maturity to approximately 16 years and reduced our annual bond interest expense by approximately $50 million. To accommodate the upsized tender, we temporarily drew on our revolver, which ended the quarter with a balance of $880 million. By the end of April, however, we reduced the revolver balance to $680 million. By the end of the year, we plan to use a portion of free cash flow to pay off the revolver and to call at par $123 million of bonds maturing in January 2023. We also recently refinanced Apache Corporation's revolving credit facility. The new facilities, which have been moved up to the APA corporation level and had 5-year primary terms, consist of a $1.8 billion revolving credit facility and a GBP 1.5 billion letter of credit facility, which will be used for LC postings related to the abandonment obligations in the North Sea. These efforts, along with our robust cash flow generation and deconsolidation of Kinetic have already been recognized by 1 rating agency. Fitch recently upgraded Apache to investment grade with a BBB- rating and a stable outlook. I would like to close by discussing some changes to our 2022 production guidance, which can be seen in our financial and operational supplement. Our full year U.S. production guidance is unchanged at this time, with oil volumes continuing to perform well. Reported production guidance for Egypt is down roughly 4%, the majority of which is associated with the impact of higher oil prices on our PSC cost recovery volumes. In the North Sea, we have reduced our full year production outlook by 1,000 BOEs per day, primarily to reflect first half unplanned downtime. Outside of these production impacts and the activity changes that John spoke of, the only other material change to our full year guidance is an $85 million increase in G&A expense, which reflects the equity-linked compensation-related accrual impacts previously discussed. Please refer to our financial and operational supplement or follow up with Gary and his team for any questions related to our updated guidance.  And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Doug Leggate : I think you asked me. So John, I'm going to start -- maybe I'll try to for here. On Suriname on the buyback, the 60% of free cash flow you obviously fell quite a bit below that in the first quarter. But my understanding is when you have non-public information on the well test that you can't actually be in the market. So I wonder -- my 2 for it is, I wonder if you could give us a more fulsome update as to whether you feel like you are still making progress towards a development and FID this year. And whether at this point, you are able to be back in the market taking advantage of, for example, today's share price weakness. And I've got a follow-up, please. John Christmann : Okay. No, Doug, great question. First off, I'll say we are committed to the return framework of a minimum of 60% of our free cash flow to shareholders, and we are committed to that, and we are committed to that for the calendar year of 2022. We do have periods where you have material nonpublic and we have to use other vehicles in that plan ahead with [ten V51s] and so forth. So there are periods where we have to rely on those and think ahead. We have completed the flow test at Krabdagu. We are now in the important buildup stage. And as you know, Doug, and I appreciate, sometimes the buildup can be as important as the flow test are more important. So we're excited about where we are. At this point, we're not going to dribble information out on Krabdagu. We'll wait and come back with a report at the appropriate time. But I would say there have been no surprises. As we think about a path to FID in Suriname, we're kind of moving more towards what I'll call a central area hub concept. And it's something that we're excited about and starting to think about with Total. You've got a foundational piece at Sapakara South. We think Krabdagu can also be a foundational piece, but I'm going to hold comments there until we're ready to talk about that. And we prioritized a list of both exploration and appraisal targets that we need to drill. Obviously, the appraisal targets are helping us find connected volumes, which are critical to scope and scale and the exploration targets that are sizable, we also need to drill to make sure you would get the scope and scale right of that potential first FID. So things are on track. We're excited about how things are progressing. We did say the Maersk Valiant will be moving to an exploration target next, which is DCP. So we're excited about that. And quite frankly, things are progressing nicely. In Block 53, while I'm on Suriname, we're drilling Rasper. As we said in the prepared remarks, we're above the target zones. But we are excited about Rasper, and we'll come back on that when we can talk about it. And we also said we will be retaining the Noble Jury to SUSA in country in Suriname, which is 1 of the reasons why the CapEx is going up. Steve Riney : And Doug, this is Steve. If I could weigh in on the second part of your question about the pace of buybacks and uses of cash. So as John said in his prepared remarks, we anticipate a strip, about $2.9 billion of free cash flow this year. That would imply at least $1.8 billion, as we said, in returns to shareholders. In the first quarter, we -- between dividends and share buybacks, we did just a little over $300 million. So we're a little bit above a 15% payout at that implied pace of annual payouts. And I think there was some activity that may have been limited due to MNPI. But I think also, you don't start the year with guns a blazing, you start probably on a conservative pace. We also, as you know, chose to do something on the debt side. But as John said, we absolutely remain committed to the full year payout of 60% of free cash flow and we actively plan around periods of MNPI. So we understand what that does to us, and there are other mechanisms we can use from time to time to be able to be in the market and buying back shares. Doug Leggate : Hopefully, my second -- my follow-up, I'll let someone was taking to the soon. I think there's 2 tests going on, so I'm sure others will get into that. But I want to ask you about the trajectory in Egypt. This is the first quarter since the normal modernization. There's are a few mixed counties in there that I think might have surprised some people. So certainly surprised me a little bit more gas. What is the trajectory to how you see your adjusted volumes after minorities and tax files or tax molecules? Can you give an idea what that looks like? And I'll leave it at that. John Christmann : Yes. And I think if you step back big picture in Egypt, Doug, we've been declining gross operated production for a number of years. And the key to modernization was it facilitates the investment levels. And so you've seen us really ramp the rig count, really in the back half of last year, second half, we went from 5 to 11 rigs. We're at 12 today. We're in the process of picking up a 13th and 14th rig fairly soon, and will likely go 1 or 2 higher than that. I think when you look at modernization, you have to look at the net. So despite a rising oil price, our net production was up 13% in Q1, and that's really the benefits of modernization. And that's with growth staying relatively flat as you're now starting to see that curve turn. April production is moving up quite a bit.  And I'll let Mr. Pursell jump in and provide some more details here. Dave Pursell : Yes. Doug, so we'll get to your mix, we'll answer the mix question, but it's important to give you the preamble before that. And as John said, April production is moving higher, we're up to -- we're up 8% as we've exited April here relative to the first quarter. So we've got the oil production trajectory the way we like it. And really, that's driven by a couple of things : continue to increase drilling rig count. We talked about we'll be up to 15 rigs by the middle of the year. Those drilling rigs really focused on oil have an oil-focused is both exploration and production. We talked in the supplement. We've had a couple of nice exploration successes is at Pita and Hazem Northwest or Pita West and Hazem Northwest. Our development drilling is on track. We did have some delays on recompletions in the first quarter moved into the second quarter, but we're -- we think we're on track to continue to grow oil production in that. So the oil production mix will continue to improve or increase over time relative to gas. I think -- and I'll let Gary kind of offline, walk you through the blood guts and feathers of this. But when you think about the modernized terms, it's also a simplified structure. And so we think going forward that the adjusted and reported mix should mimic and track the gross mix very closely. So there won't be that ambiguity in how you roll up into the adjusted and reported numbers. So we think growth is what you should focus on, and that gross oil mix is going to improve as we continue to focus on oil development here over the next several years. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of John Freeman from Raymond James. John Freeman : The first question I had, when you mentioned that about half the CapEx increase was related to the increased activity in Suriname with the decision to keep the Desousa drillship starting on falling Raper. And I'm just wondering if there's a way to maybe give a little bit more color on how exactly you all go about estimating the incremental CapEx there given, obviously, your CapEx obligations are materially different, whether it's appraisal or exploration-related activity in Block 58 as well as out of that rig, drill simply split time between Block 58 -- Block 53. It's just a lot of different scenarios, and I'm just wondering kind of how you all kind of came up with some risk kind of CapEx number? John Christmann : Well, John, we're going to keep the Desousa. There's -- you could think about an exploration well in Block 58, where we've got 50% or another well in Block 53, where we got 45% pretty similar. Obviously, if it's appraisal wells in Block 58, they're going to be less because of the carry. So -- and there's also the ability to keep the Desousa for maybe more than 1 well. So I'll just leave it at that. It will stay in country, and we're still working through details, but we felt like we ought to at least move it up from the amount we've moved it up, and we think it's a good number. John Freeman : So is it -- not to try and put wording about some, but is it fair to say that if all of the incremental activity with Desousa ended up being appraisal that, that CapEx number might come down some? John Christmann : Potentially could. But I would anticipate -- we've got risked exploration and appraisal wells. So it's going to be both. John Freeman : Okay. Okay. And then just my follow-up, kind of sticking with the CapEx side. So on the U.S., where it was due to the increased non-op activity and then you mentioned the mix change in your activity, some higher working interest, is it possible at all to sort of say, of the incremental CapEx associated in the U.S. kind of the split between it being due to kind of increased activity/higher working interest stuff versus just cost inflation that we've been hearing about these calls the last few days. John Christmann : Yes, John, I think, as you know, we built in quite a bit of inflation into our capital numbers with what we laid out first quarter. So the majority of this is we do have some wells that are going to be higher working interest than what we had originally planned, and that's just a function of shifting some pads and moving some pads forward. So there will be some higher working interest. And then we do have some increased non-op capital, some of that could be increased activity and then some of that could be some inflation on the other operators, too. It's hard to dig in and understand that, but it's really what we're just seeing on the non-op side moving up. And so those 2 factors kind of come to play together there on that. But I think we've done a pretty good job of anticipating the inflation and the increases in our 2022 plan. And I think that's playing out kind of as we budgeted and forecasted. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan Chase. Arun Jayaram : Yes. John, I was wondering if you could give us an update on your marketing agreement with Cheniere on Stage 3, I believe you have the ability to sell 140,000 MMBtu to them. Obviously, a very, very good pricing environment. So I was wondering if you could give us some details the timing of when that could kick in and perhaps the operating leverage there between your leverage to this and the North Sea exposure to global gas? John Christmann : I'll let Steve dive in. I wish it was a bigger contract, but I'll let Steve dive in on the details. Steve Riney : Yes. We wish it was bigger, and we wish it was sooner. So that contract, that's a 15-year contract. You got the basic terms right, Arun. And that one contractually begins on July 1, 2023. At any point in time now, Cheniere does have the option with 30 days notice -- or 90 days notice, sorry, to elect to start that contract early. They haven't given us that notice. So we would like to obviously get that one at any point in time. But if we do, we'll start at 90 days later or any other time frame that we might agree with them within that. So it's a fair option to be able to do that. And we obviously can't disclose the terms of that contract. But suffice it to say, what we do is we select a mix of Asian versus European pricing and we effectively sell our gas, we deliver gas on the Gulf Coast. We sell it at this mix for a full year, a mix of Asian and European pricing. And then we net back through liquefaction fees, transport fees and a marketing fee that we pay. So we're were, in effect, fully exposed to the European and Asian LNG market pricing for that 15-year period. Arun Jayaram : Great. And that starts mid of next year unless Cheniere elects to early stress that. Steve Riney : Exactly. Arun Jayaram : Okay. Great. And just my follow-up is on Egypt. John, you guys have highlighted your the expectation to grow your oil volumes there by 8% to 10% kind of per annum. Just wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about how your early results are trending. It does sound like things are -- when you got the recompletions going that you are starting to see some growth there. But I was wondering if you can maybe dig down and give us a sense of the trajectory of growth, any supply chain headwinds in country? Obviously, you guys are rapidly expanding activity, but give us a sense of what you're seeing on the ground in Egypt. John Christmann : No. It's \u2013 number 1, it's good to get back to work and kind of move our activity levels up to where we can grow that production base. I think we've got a couple of key discoveries to build on. I think the Pita West in between Pita and Barnes is a nice early win. It's going to give us some things that we can get on fairly quickly. We did get some of the recompletions underway. And as Dave mentioned, I think we're up about 8% in April over the first quarter already. So it just takes a little bit of time, but things are progressing. And then there's a couple of other discoveries that have been nice. So we're going to be focused on oil drilling. We're kind of prioritizing that. We've got the Northwest Razak concession that we're -- we shot seismic on and it's kind of a new frontier for us. So -- we've got some nice exploration wells that we're also excited about. But lots of inventory, Arun, and we feel good about the plans that we've laid out, and we're kind of getting our feet under us and getting going. So anything you want to pile on, Dave? Dave Pursell : John answered the supply question really well. The trajectory we're very we're still confident in the path that we laid out. I think on the supply chain questions, remember, in Egypt, we're drilling relatively conventional. These are conventional wells are vertical. We don't have much, if any, hydraulic fracturing activity in country. So these are, I would call it, kind of commodity sort of wells. But that said, our supply chain team is all over it. They're making sure that we're not waiting on parts. So we've -- as we ramp up, one of the nice things about having a visibility on the plan as it gives the supply chain folks lead time to really make sure that we have all the equipment necessary to keep the program moving forward. And so far, that's been the case. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Scialla from Stifel. Michael Scialla : You're getting close to 1x debt leverage now. Stevie, you said one of the agencies upgraded the debt rating to investment grade. Stock's also done well this year, but it sounds like you're still focused on debt reduction and share buybacks. So I guess with that in mind, I want to see how you view the intrinsic value of the company relative to the current stock price and how you weigh that versus potentially increasing the dividend? Steve Riney : Yes, Michael. So yes, a number of questions in there. I think that the key answer to your question would be -- or the key part of your question would be that we still see our share price is undervalued, and we like the buyback program, and we like it quite a bit. But your reference to the amount of debt reduction that we've done, just to step back from it a bit. In the last 9 months, we've done $3 billion of bond elimination, which is just a phenomenal compared to what you think we might have been able to do just 12 to 18 months ago. Certainly, the balance sheet is much, much stronger today, and then Fitch was the first one to recognize that and acknowledge it. We are in conversations with all 3 rating agencies, and we continue to work the debt rating hard with all 3 of them. I think we'll continue along the lines of balance sheet strengthening, but I think it's unlikely that you're going to see the large chunks of debt tender activity, the $1 billion-plus. We're -- as long as we stay in this price environment, we're going to have significant amount of free cash flow over the next 3 years. And there will be continued balance sheet strengthening, but there will be a significant focus on share buybacks as well as long as the share price, in our view, stays undervalued, which is what it is now. And we talk about the dividend all the time. We talk about it often, and we've raised it twice in the back half of last year. And we'll continue to look at that. And as the balance sheet gets stronger, as prices continue to play out the way they are and as share price improves, on an absolute and relative basis, then we'll certainly think more seriously about the dividend. But for right now, we're quite happy with the buyback program. Michael Scialla : Great. That helps. Second question was a marketing question. I guess, with the deconsolidation of Altus, I believe you retained your firm transportation for gas out of the Permian. I want to see if you plan to use all of that or if you have thoughts on monetizing any excess capacity there? Steve Riney : Well, as you know, we did monetize some of that in prior years. And we have -- we have about -- in round numbers, we have a little over $670 million a day of transport capacity on PHP and Gulf Coast Express. We have -- as we look forward to the next -- the remainder of this year and into next year, we have, on average, somewhere in the $200 million to $225 million a day of excess capacity. Would we be open to potentially marketing some of that? Yes, I mean, we would entertain a conversation on that, for sure. But at the same time, the differentials look good for the next 2 years. And as you'll probably see in our results and our postings that we have actually gone and we've now locked in those differentials on about 90% of that excess capacity all the way through the end of '23. And in doing so, there's a mixture. We put in some hedges in earlier time periods that were not quite as attractive as they are these days. But we've put in quite a bit just recently. And we've locked in about a little under $50 million of cash margin on that transport capacity. And then the rest of the capacity will be used. We use all of it. And effectively, it gets Gulf Coast pricing on our equity volumes. But that -- we sell all of our equity volumes in basin and then our marketing group buys 670 million a day and transports it and then resells it on the Gulf Coast. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Charles Meade : John, to you and the rest of your team there. I mentioned this is a question for you or perhaps for Tracey. Can you give us kind of the background and the providence of this [indiscernible] I don't know exactly the way to pronounce it, the new tick up prospect and perhaps wrap into it, whether it kind of rise into the top of the power here is connected to your central area hub development concept? John Christmann : Yes, Charles, I will tell you, it is something that would fall in that area. It's an exploration well, and I'm happy to have Tracey say a few things about it, so. Tracey Henderson : Sure Charles. As John mentioned in the original comments, we're going to be testing sort of a range of different prospects with different attributes in a list in support of looking at appraisal and exploration prospects. So I would say, the Diku wells at the front of the schedule. It's a well that Total really likes with some potential meaningful reserves. So we see it, I think, is a bit higher risk, higher reward because it does have some different seismic attributes than we've tested, but it has the potential to unlock, I would say, some additional follow-on prospectivity, that could incrementally and substantially but more reserves. So I think it's one we're anxious to see, but it is a bit of a different beast than what we've seen before, but has potential to be meaningful for the appraisal. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets. Scott Hanold : A quick question on the Desousa rig that's in Block 53. If it stays in country. It sounds like it's going to move to Block 58. Would you all continue to be the operator of that rig? Or would you hand that over to Total? John Christmann : Scott, it could stay in Block 53 or we could move it to 58, and let Total take it. So there's optionality there, and I'll just -- I'll leave it at that for now. Scott Hanold : Okay. But just to clarify, if it did go to 58, they would take over operatorship. Is that right? John Christmann : They are the operator in 58 and we're the operator in 53. So there's a lot of things you can work out. But we're not going -- wouldn't be changing -- they've got the value at working, so. Scott Hanold : Okay. Understood. And then Alpine High, obviously, with where gas prices are, looks a lot more interesting. You guys are moving a rig there and going to resuscitate those volumes. Can you think about big picture? Obviously, Steve talked about the potential excess capacity you all have with your FT. And I know in past \u2013 in the beginning of the Alpine High history, I guess, you all talked about Mexico being an option there to descend gas. But like as you think about gas prices, optionality between LNG, maybe Mexico still yet? How do you think about that longer term? Are you guys going to keep a rig there? Do you \u2013 could you move more on there? Do the economics really warrant ramping up much? Just give a little bit color on that, that would be great. A \u2013 John Christmann : No. We\u2019ve \u2013 we started last September picking up a rig in the U.S. It\u2019s going to be a Delaware Basin focused rig. It\u2019s now working in our DXL area. We had a pad there that was partially drilled. And so we wanted to drill that out first, and then it will be moving to Alpine High. We\u2019re excited about what those economics look like, right? If you look back at the Willow well, and we had some details in our supplement there. It was one of the best wells we brought on last year of all of our DUCs. I think it has cumed over 9 Bcf, and it\u2019s been on since really January of \u201821. So we are excited about those economics. I think they compete well, and we\u2019re anxious to get a rig back to work as there\u2019s plenty of infrastructure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett from Bernstein Research. Bob Brackett : I'll try fishing off Suriname a bit. In terms of the Jerry DeSousa, when did the decision to keep that rig occur? Did it occur after you'd spudded RASPER? And a related question, is there an obvious sidetrack to RASPER? John Christmann : We're above target zones at RASPER, Bob. So I'll just leave it at that. Clay Bretches : How about a follow-up. If we talk about the Krabdagoe flow test, the fact that you went on to the next step of buildup suggests that you flowed oil through a sufficiently permeable reservoir that it makes sense to do a longer-term test. Am I getting the engineering right on that? John Christmann : We're doing a buildup. So we're in the buildup phase, and I said there were no surprises. So I'll leave it at that. Bob Brackett : And a final question would just be the restricted flow test at Sapakara South flowed 4,800 barrels of oil, I think. So that -- is that in the realm of no surprises? John Christmann : I'll just say there were no surprises, and we may not have expected there to be a restricted flow test, but I'll leave it at that. Your questions are always fun, bob, and creative. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Two quick questions, John. Two quick questions. Can you tell us that how many wells do you expect to grow in Alpine High this year? And secondly, that I know it's really early, but given the inflationary environment and the activity level, what is your preliminary give and take, different component in the 2023 budget may look like? Any direction that you can point to? John Christmann : In terms of number of wells, Dave? Dave Pursell : Yes, Paul, this is Dave Pursell. Number of wells at Alpine later this year, it will just be a handful because we're -- as John said, we're finishing up an undrilled uncompleted pad at DXL, then we'll move to Alpine. And these are all going to be longer laterals with relatively large stimulation treatment. So it will be a handful of wells that are ready to come online at the end of the year, so. John Christmann : Your second part of your question, Paul, it was hard to hear. Paul Cheng : I was saying that. I know it's early, but for 2023, any kind of direction you can point to on the preliminary budget and activity levels? John Christmann : Yes. I mean I would say today, as we look at 2023, our 3-year plan we laid out this year looks pretty darn good to us, right? We've added the fourth rig in the U.S. we'll be at 15 rigs in Egypt. So right now, we're not envisioning any increases to the 3-year plan that we laid out at the start of this year. Paul Cheng : Okay. And how about in the budget given the inflation, I mean, how much additional costs that we should be taking into consideration? John Christmann : Yes. I mean we'll wait until next February to come out with a hard number for '23, we did have an increased dial in for additional inflation in '23, but I'm not in a position to really give you that number right now. A little early. Operator : Your next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : John and team. The first question is around the North Sea. And just want to get your perspective on the production cadence there. As you've already indicated, it's going to be a heavy turnaround schedule through the summer. And -- but how are you feeling about the exit rate of 50,000 BOE a day and just any update around activity plans there? John Christmann : Yes, Neil, we're still with the North Sea. We've got a heavy turnaround period coming up that we're anxious to get on and get through. I think it's executing and that's going to be key. I think we've got good news that the Ocean Patriot is back in the field or arriving today. So -- that's been one of the other items that we basically lost an entire quarter with the drilling of the Ocean Patriot, which when you're only running 1 floater and you lose it for a quarter, it had to go in. It had a large anchor chain that had broke and had to be repaired. So I think we feel good about the prospects that are on that rig line and the work that's ahead of us and the repair works. We feel good about the exit rate, which should be around 50,000, so -- Neil Mehta : All right. And then the follow-up is, you operate a global portfolio here. Talk about the inflationary forces that you're seeing in the U.S. relative to international, fair to say, thus far, a lot of your peers have reported more inflation in their U.S. business relative to international. But how do you see that playing out over the next 12 months? John Christmann : Well, I mean, I think we do operate a global portfolio. I think it's a function of staying ahead. We had a lot of our 2022 program under contract. And so we had cranked a lot of that in the last quarter when we announced budget. So we feel good about what we dialed in and where that sits. I think a lot of it just depends on where you are and what the demand for that equipment is. And you typically do see higher increases in the U.S. and then more volatility and more stable prices internationally. But I think the thing that's a little bit different this time is we're not all just fighting over rig count rigs. And -- which drives that hyperinflation. So -- but there's no doubt, commodities are going up, fuel is going up, steel, sand So as you look out, costs are going up. And then the other thing, if you look back over the last few years, there's not been a lot of equipment that was built. And so a lot of the parts that were needed to keep rigs running and frac crews running have been cannibalized off of older equipment. So there's no doubt, as you look out over the next couple of years, if the price deck holds, you're going to see some higher prices. Dave, anything you want to add to that? Dave Pursell : Yes. I think when you look at inflation, it's people, steel, chemicals and diesel. You can't -- I mean, that's ubiquitous around the world. When you look at the Permian relative to the rest of the global portfolio, you're running higher spec and kind of higher-end equipment in the Permian, which will have -- and there's more competition for that equipment. Both those things create more pressure and you've got the pressure pumping and big frac component of the wells in the Permian that is -- can be fairly or significantly inflationary, which we don't see in either Egypt or the North Sea. So I think that's the real kind of categorical breakdown. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani from KeyBanc. Leo Mariani : I just wanted to follow up on some of the prepared comments here. You all kind of describe Safacura South as a potential kind of foundational part of a project and said kind of stay tuned on Krabdagoe. I mean I think there's a plan for Total as kind of talked about maybe hitting FID at the end of the year. But am I reading some pretty good confidence out of you guys in terms of what you've seen so far that you think there's certainly a sizable, viable economic project here? John Christmann : At this point, Leo, we have not announced a project or an FID. I think we've said from the get-go that Sapakara South is a foundational piece. We've shown it's gotten bigger with the extended buildup time as we raised that original estimate from the connected volume just to the 1 well, and I want to emphasize again, that's just via the 1 initial well was 325 million to 375 million barrels. We raised that to greater than 400 million. And that area continues to get bigger and there's more appraisal to do at Sapakara South. So I think we have confidence in what we have found, and we like the program, but there's still more work to do. Leo Mariani : Okay. And then just on the North Sea, you all certainly said you've got confidence on this 50,000 BOE per day exit rate. I guess are there some particular wells that you all need to kind of tie in. I know there's a bunch of downtime of turnarounds here this summer. But are there a project or 2 that are kind of chunky that you guys are going to be bringing on, on the well side that gives you confidence in that number? John Christmann : Yes, there's a Garden well that the Ocean Patriot was scheduled to drill, and we've had to slide that back. But those Garden wells have been high rate, and it's a very, very good location. Operator : And there are no further questions over the phone line. I'd like now to hand the call over to John Christmann, CEO. Please go ahead, sir. John Christmann : Yes. Thank you for participating on our call today. I'd like to leave you with the following closing thoughts. Financially, we have become a much stronger company. We will remain disciplined, both financially and operationally. Lastly, we are committed to our shareholder returns framework, returning a minimum of 60% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Operator, I will now turn the call over to you. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, sir. Thank you, presenters. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

It is now my pleasure to introduce Vice President of Investor Relations, Gary Clark. Gary Clark : Good morning, and thank you for joining us on APA Corporation's Second Quarter 2022 Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John Christmann; Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results and outlook. Also on the call and available to answer questions are Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President of Development; Tracey Henderson, Senior Vice President of Exploration; and Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations.  Our prepared remarks will be around 20 minutes in length with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our second quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apacorp.com.  Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude noncontrolling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to John. John Christmann : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call today, I will review our second quarter highlights and discuss key trends and performance in each of our core operational areas. Following that, I will provide some color on the 2022 guidance, which we updated last night in our earnings release and supplement.  Over the past few months, fears of economic recession, a new wave of coronavirus outbreaks and concern about potential demand destruction have created substantial volatility in commodity prices and the value of energy equities. However, the pullback in oil prices from the second quarter peak is healthy for both consumers and producers. We continue to have a positive outlook on the long-term fundamentals for natural gas and oil and view APA stock as a compelling value today. As I look at our second quarter results, I see several key highlights. APA generated record free cash flow of $814 million. We repurchased 7 million shares of APA common stock, followed by an additional $6.9 million of share repurchases in July. Gross oil production in Egypt increased by more than 7,000 barrels per day versus the prior quarter, which was our first material quarterly increase in Egypt oil production since 2018. Our 40s field maintenance turnaround in the North Sea was executed safely and on budget. We advanced our program in Suriname with the successful flow test at Krabdagu, and we made excellent progress on upstream flaring reductions in Egypt and are on track to achieve our 40% reduction target by year-end. The second quarter was very good in many ways as our diversified unhedged portfolio benefited from rising oil and gas prices and high margins. However, we have encountered a few challenges. In Egypt, although we delivered strong oil production growth in the quarter, we are experiencing some delays and inefficiencies as we scale our active rig count from 5 to 15. These include supply chain, equipment and infrastructure-related delays, longer-than-expected time to staff and reactivate cold-stacked rigs extended drill times, which are primarily a function of new rig and new crew inefficiencies and increased regional competition for experienced national employees. Well performance in Egypt has been in line with expectations. So these are mostly short-term above-ground challenges. We have identified and are swiftly taking appropriate actions that will bring us back up to pace. In the Austin Chalk, our delineation program has generated mixed results thus far, so we have chosen to pause most of our planned drilling and completion activities. I will talk more about the impact of these items on our second half guidance in a few minutes.  Turning now to some of the details of our second quarter results. Our largest spend categories Capital investment, operating costs and G&A were in line or less than expected for the quarter despite a challenging overall supply chain and cost environment. Total adjusted production of 305,000 BOE per day was down compared to the first quarter, primarily driven by our early March Permian Basin minerals divestiture and the impact of high oil prices on our Egypt PSC volumes, the timing of well connections across the portfolio and seasonal maintenance in the North Sea. We continue to expect our global adjusted production volumes will return to a growth path this year as our activity has now reached a level that we have not seen since 2019 prior to the COVID pandemic. In the U.S., we continue to run a steady 2-rig program in the Southern Midland Basin and recently initiated drilling at Alpine High with a third rig. In Egypt, we averaged 12 rigs brought online a number of quality wells and achieved a high drilling success rate. Our strong oil production growth in the quarter was partially offset by a decline in lower margin natural gas production. In the North Sea, we are in the midst of summer turnaround season. We completed the maintenance turnaround at 40s on schedule and on budget and have brought that field back into production. At Beryl, we are wrapping up a platform turnaround and will return to production in the near future.  On Block 58 in Suriname, our partner, Total, is drilling the Dikkop exploration prospect which sits roughly 8 kilometers northwest of our Sapakara South discovery. On the adjacent Block 53, we are drilling the Baja exploration prospect with our partners, PETRONAS and CEPSA. On July 29, we closed on an acquisition of properties around our active development areas in the Texas Delaware Basin. This is an attractively valued tuck-in acquisition that comes with PDPs a number of wells in the drilling and completion process and a nice inventory of undrilled locations. It also brings a high-quality drilling rig and experienced crew to continue development in this very tight service environment. There are currently 2 rigs running on the new acreage. One will be released in the fourth quarter and we will retain the other as our fourth U.S. development rig. These assets compete well within our portfolio and integrate nicely into our Permian operations. Turning now to our outlook for the second half of the year, which we included in our financial and operations supplement last night. Our CapEx program of $1.725 billion remains unchanged for the year. Steve will have some comments on a few minor changes in other P&L guidance items. In terms of adjusted production, our new full year guidance range for Egypt is 63,000 to 65,000 BOEs per day, which is down about 7% from prior expectations. More than half of this decrease is a result of fewer wells being drilled and completed due to the operational challenges I spoke of earlier, the remainder is attributable to the PSC impact of higher oil prices. In the U.S., we have a number of moving parts affecting our outlook for the remainder of the year. First, we have removed roughly 8,000 BOEs a day of Austin Chalk production from the second half of the year following the decision to defer most of our near-term drilling and completions. Second, we expect the Texas Delaware Basin acquisition properties will average 12,000 to 14,000 BOEs per day of production for the remaining 5 months of the year. We've also encountered some completion delays on Permian operated and nonoperated wells and recently divested a small package of Permian properties. The net effect of these items is a slight downward revision to our full year 2022 U.S. production guidance.  In the U.K. our near-term activity plan and full year 2022 production guidance remains unchanged. Later this month, the Garden 3 development well will commence production, which should generate a significant volume uplift in the fourth quarter. I will note that the new energy profits levy recently became effective in the U.K. This reduces our free cash flow outlook going forward. And while it won't affect our 2022 drilling program, we are evaluating the longer-term impacts of the tax on our planned investment in the U.K. But in general, new taxes are not effective incentives for increased investment. Steve will share more details about the tax impact in his remarks.  Turning now to an update on our ESG initiatives. APA's top priorities are reducing GHG emissions throughout our global operations and supporting our employees and the people in the communities where we operate. We have completed several projects across the portfolio, most notably in Egypt that enable us to compress and direct previously flared gas to sales, thereby increasing revenue and improving our emissions profile. This puts us well on our way to achieving our goal of reducing upstream routine flaring in Egypt by 40% by year-end. I'm very pleased with our progress on this and many other fronts, and there is much more to come. Also, in late July, we issued our 2022 sustainability report. I hope you will take a moment to review the report and learn more about our strategy and initiatives to provide affordable, reliable energy to the world while also delivering on rigorous near- and medium-term ESG goals.  In closing, APA remains committed to returning 60% of free cash flow through buybacks and dividends as well as strengthening our balance sheet, including paying down debt as it matures. At current strip prices, we expect to generate approximately $3 billion of free cash flow in 2022, of which at least $1.8 billion would be returned to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Through July, we have returned just under 50% of this amount.  And finally, I would like to extend a personal thank you to John Lowe, APA's Chairman, who recently announced his retirement after serving 9 years on the board. John has been a great friend and colleague. We have benefited greatly from his experience and insights, and we wish him all the best. Lamar McKay has been elected to serve as APA's new Board Chairman, and will formally take over for John in September. Lamar has a wealth of experience that I know will be a tremendous asset to the board room and my leadership team. We are all looking forward to working with him and welcome him into his new role. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney. Stephen Riney : Thanks, John. For the second quarter of 2022, APA Corporation reported consolidated net income of $926 million or $2.71 per diluted common share. As is common, this quarter, our results include items that are outside of APA's core earnings. The most significant of these was $129 million related to the release of tax valuation allowance for the use of tax loss carryforwards to offset U.S. income tax expense. Excluding this and other such items, adjusted net income for the second quarter was $811 million or $2.37 per diluted common share. Our second quarter results underscore APA's robust free cash flow capacity. The $814 million we generated during the second quarter represents a 21% increase from the preceding quarter and more than double the same period in the prior year.  Cost inflation has become a popular topic in quarterly earnings calls and for good reason. Oil and gas firms are subject to the same inflationary pressures on labor, materials, fuel and services as every other industry. We embedded a substantial amount of cost pressure into the budget we laid out in February. And for the most part, costs have tracked close to that plan for the first 2 quarters. For the second half, we anticipate a bit more inflationary pressure in LOE than originally planned, especially in fuel costs. As a result, our full year guidance has moved up a bit higher. Second quarter G&A of $89 million was considerably lower than first quarter and was also below our guidance. As we have discussed before, we use cash settled stock-based incentive compensation plans that require a quarterly mark-to-market based on movements in our share price. This introduces some volatility in our quarterly reported G&A expense, which we generally do not attempt to include in our guidance. For example, APA's share price increase into the end of the first quarter resulted in higher reported G&A expense and the declining share price into the end of the second quarter resulted in the opposite. As a baseline, our underlying quarterly G&A expense runs around $100 million, and our full year guidance reflects this for the remaining 2 quarters of the year. With the higher commodity prices, you will note that both sales and costs related to purchased oil and gas have increased substantially. As a reminder, where possible, we saw all of our production in basin and our marketing organization fulfills obligations on various commercial agreements such as long-haul transport contracts using purchased product. The net impact of these 2 lines will mostly track the basis differential, less transport costs on the GCX and PHP pipelines. Finally, exploration expense was higher during the quarter as we recorded $32 million in dry hole costs related to the Rasper exploration well in Block 53 offshore Suriname.  Turning now to the progress we've made during the quarter on the balance sheet. In the second quarter, we paid down $605 million on our revolving credit facility, which brought our balance down to $275 million on June 30. The -- last week, we drew on the revolver to fund the closing of our Delaware Basin acquisition. So that balance will rise again in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we will pay off the January 2023 bond maturity of $123 million at par. While we have made great progress strengthening the balance sheet over the last year, we have more to do. That said, it is nice to see the rating agencies recognizing the improvement.  Our long-term desire is to return to investment grade through a continued steady pace of debt reduction. Paying off bonds at their maturity combined with the occasional debt tender or open market repurchases. A couple of other things before we turn to Q&A. With respect to our full year 2022 guidance, there are a few minor changes. We increased our guidance for LOE and decreased guidance for G&A to reflect some of the impacts I spoke of previously. We have also updated our guidance for our latest view on the net impact from purchased oil and gas I mentioned earlier.  Our guidance for U.K. tax expense has increased to reflect $130 million incremental cost for the energy profits levy. We will pay this additional 2022 tax in 2 parts, approximately half during the fourth quarter of this year and the remainder in the first quarter of next year. As John noted previously, we are committed to our capital returns framework, which means material share buybacks will continue in the second half of 2022. Ideally, all of this would be delivered in the day-by-day open market repurchase program. However, there has been and will continue to be periods of time where the possession of material nonpublic information will preclude open market repurchase of our shares. During such times, we expect to utilize 10b5-1 programs to maintain a minimum underlying pace of buybacks. This was the case for much of the second quarter and we have established similar plans for the rest of the year. As always, please refer to our financial and operational supplement or follow up with Gary and his team with any questions or if you need any help related to our updated guidance. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : John, I wonder if I could hit the 800-pound gorilla in the room, which is in March, you laid out a 3-year plan. And a couple of quarters into it, were $555 million higher in spending and your production guidance is lower. How should we think about Apache management's ability to risk that outlook? And what would you say about the outlook for 2023 at this point? John Christmann : Doug, thanks for joining us this morning. First of all, we feel good about our 3-year plan. there's been, as we laid out a couple of challenges, and we take responsibility for those and hit them head on. I think the programs are running well. We've got some work to do in Egypt and we're on it. But if you look at -- we did need to take this year's guidance down a little bit. A lot of that is shifting of Egypt to the right, but the well performance has been good. I think it's premature to look at our '23 and '24, and it would be premature to adjust those forecasts right now. But in general, I think we feel good about the overall delivery over the 3-year period. And I will say we baked in a lot of inflation on the cost side, and we have not had -- we've been able to manage that side really well. So I think in general, it would be early to do anything with the '23 and '24 years. Doug Leggate : So the '23 guidance today, including the contribution from the acquisition, is that still intact? You haven't -- obviously, you haven't spoken to 2023, but is it intact? Is it higher? Is it lower? Because Street doesn't seem to believe it based on where consensus expectations are? John Christmann : No, I would just say today, we go through a process every year in the fall, we're looking at the next 3 years. We will review that. We'll come out with a new 3-year look in February. But in general, we still feel pretty good about the 3-year plan we laid out. And we did pick up some properties in the U.S. The program has been running strong and I think as you look out with the 4 rigs in the Permian, we're going to be just fine in the U.S. and Egypt, we're confident in the well results. We've just got to work through some efficiencies there. So in general, we feel good, Doug, about the 3-year plan and -- but it would be premature right now to do anything. We've got some work to do in the short term, but we're on it, so. Doug Leggate : All right. On a different number, my follow-up is on gas. Should we now think of the Alpine High having a dedicated rig in which case, what does that mean for the production trajectory there? And as a related follow-up, perhaps, my understanding is you guys have been kind of rethinking the potential implications of your Cheniere contract as it relates to the free cash flow outlook. So I'm just wondering if you could touch on those 2 things, and I'll leave it there. John Christmann : Yes. No, great question. We did not -- and I'll let Steve comment on the Cheniere contract after I make a few comments on the U.S. rigs. We'll have 4 rigs. We've had 4 rigs running in the U.S., we'll maintain those 4 rigs. You're going to have all 4 of those in the Permian now. 2 in the Southern Midland Basin. We'll have 2 in the Delaware. We've got a rig that we recently moved to Alpine High. Following up the results of our Willow well. We're excited to drill some pads there. So I think it will be positive. So you'll see 2 rigs in that area. The nice thing is having those 4 rigs in the Permian now, we can move them around it based on pads and timing and things. But we do envision 1 of those pretty much stand at Alpine High with the near-term. Steve, anything you want to comment on the Cheniere contract, which is not in those 3-year free cash flow and cash flow numbers? Stephen Riney : Yes. Thanks, Doug. So a reminder, the Cheniere contract is a 15-year term contract, 140 million cubic feet a day. Cheniere does have the option to start that early with 90 days' notice. They can do that at any time at this point. But at a minimum, that contract will begin on July 1, 2023. And obviously, the pricing of LNG, JKM and TTF pricing has been amazingly volatile in the last year or so and for that matter here recently, so as Houston Ship Channel. But basically, the contract is structured as a -- where we capture the margin of a mixture of JKM and TTF LNG pricing over Houston Ship Channel. So effectively, people can think of it as we're going to buy at Houston Ship Channel. We're going to sell at a mix of JKM and TTF and we're going to pay some costs associated with tolling through Cheniere's plant, and then we'll pay the cost of transport and fuel loss and things like that. So there's some costs in between that. But that would tell you what the margin structure is on that contract. Again, it will begin July 1, 2023. We believe that is the date that it will begin for the reason I'm about to tell you. And that is that to purchase a Houston Ship Channel on a -- if you look at the forward strip, not even today's prices, which are even higher. But if you look at the forward strip for second half of '23, this contract, the uplift of JKM and TTF over Houston Ship Channel less the cost would generate about $750 million of free cash flow in the 6 months the second half of '23. Doug Leggate : And that is not in the free cash flow numbers in the 3-year plan, Steve. Stephen Riney : And that is not in any of the free cash flow numbers that we put forward in February. We just assumed all of that, that there was 0 margin over Houston Ship Channel for that contract. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James. John Freeman : First question I had a follow-up to Doug's first question. I realize you said it's kind of premature to look at '23, but we've had as we've gone through this earnings season, we've got more and more operators have talked about how they're having to secure next year as being 2023 kind of services and materials a lot sooner than they would have had to do in years past, just given the supply chain issues, cost inflation, et cetera. And I realize it's easier for some of the peers of yours that you have a single basin type portfolio versus a global diversified portfolio. But can you just sort of talk about like what you're able to do to try and secure something ahead of time, given you obviously have a lot more kind of unknown than many of your peers with the unknowns of what Suriname would look like next year. You got the windfall profit tax in the North Sea. Just I guess, sort of how you all manage in this environment, trying to secure things and kind of lock things in as far as advantage you can give kind of global portfolio you all have? John Christmann : Well, John, great question. The thing I would say is we typically try to stay about a year ahead of our programs. And so we've been working on 20 -- started working on '23 as soon as the calendar turned. And we continue to do that, and they're starting to get pretty good visibility. The thing I would say about our guidance when we put it out our 3-year guidance, we bumped our capital quite a bit this year, as you'll recall, and took a pretty material increase. Most of that covered where we are today, and that's why you didn't see us have to bump our capital again this quarter. So I think we've got a pretty good handle on things. And I'll just say we built in quite a bit of inflation in '23 and '24 for next -- those next 2 years when we put out that outlook in February. So it's early to come back with hard numbers. for '23 and '24, but I think we've built in a lot of where we sit today on the inflation side. John Freeman : And then a follow-up question for me on Suriname you've got the drill shift it will move back to -- or move to Block 58 after drilling the Baja prospect and then you end up having the 2 rigs in Block 58. Do you know following the Baja exploration prospect and Dikkop, where those wells would be located and I guess, more importantly, just from a financial modeling perspective, if those wells are likely to be -- continue to be exploration or appraisal some combination? John Christmann : Yes. No, John, good question. What we typically do, and you can understand the those rig lines are dynamic. You've got some things that are dependent, some things that are independent in terms of wells and orders. And so because of that, we've typically waited until we're ready to move the rigs to tell you where they are going. Total has the value there drilling the Dikkop prospects right now. That is an exploration well. Clearly, we've got the Gerry De Souza in Block 53, where we're drilling an exploration well. That well will be moving back to Block 58 to Total. And I'll just say you're going to see a mix. There's appraisal to do at Sapakara South. There's also appraisal to do at Krabdagu, and there are also some other exploration wells. So when you see the rigs move, you're going to see probably a combination of exploration and appraisal with the 2 rigs. But I'm not in a position today to tell you which rig is going where with both of them right now. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : Our first question, maybe it's for Steve here on the balance sheet and cash returns. You ended the quarter with $275 million on the revolver and that kind of stands out relative to peers. So we were just wondering, can you talk about how you're thinking about balancing maybe upside to the 60% minimum payout this year versus paying down debt versus being opportunistic either with hitting the buyback pretty hard on stock dislocations or bolt-ons like what you kind of announced now? Stephen Riney : Yes. Janine, there's -- obviously, there's a lot of embedded questions in that. We're focused on both of those things. We've still got, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, we've still got work to do on the balance sheet. And if you'll recall, we did the $1.1 billion debt tender earlier this year and put quite a bit of that on the revolver. So we use the revolver for things like that, and we use it quite a bit more than we have in the past. That's why you have the revolver, frankly. And we used it again this quarter for the Delaware Basin acquisition. And so -- again, that's the point of having a revolver. You use it from time to time to take some of those material type of steps. In this case, it was just a tuck-in acquisition. But we've got to be focused on continuing to pay down debt. We'd like to get the revolver balance as low as possible by the end of the year. There'll probably still be a bit left on it. But at the same time, we want to balance that with doing the share repurchases in a thoughtful manner. And again, as I said in my prepared remarks, we were in possession of material nonpublic information for quite a bit of the second quarter. So we couldn't be in the market using open market repurchases for shares. So we had to use the 10b5-1 programs. that we had set in place earlier in the year, and we let those run just to make sure that we had a continuing pace. Then when we announced the results of the Krabdagu flow test, we were able to reengage in open market repurchases and you saw what we did in the month of July. And so -- we're going to -- we're somewhat constrained a bit from time to time with material nonpublic information on what we can do on the share buybacks. But I think you're going to see us continue to focus on that and try to be as thoughtful as possible on that for the rest of this year while continuing to balance it with continue to strengthen the balance sheet. I don't know if all of that answered your question or not, hopefully. Jeanine Wai : It did. It did. Maybe moving to Suriname for our second question. John, your partner recently indicated that you all hope to have an answer on maybe how to incorporate or monetize the associated gas by year-end. And I think 1 of the prior options that was discussed was maybe targeting initial development that was maybe more black oil focused and that could help fast-track the project, get things online. Are there any updated thoughts on this from your end? And I know there's nothing special about reaching FID at year-end during the first half of the year or anything like that. But any update here? John Christmann : No, Jeanine, I think we're on track today, I would say, we envision a hub that would really set up between Sapakara South, Krabdagu, in that area kind of a centralized hub. We're still targeting predominantly a black oil, lower GOR development today. I do believe we have found a significant amount of gas in the block as well. And I think longer-term, we will want to look at gas alternatives and gas options because there's quite a bit of resource there. But today, our focus has been predominantly on a hub that would be a lower GOR FPSO. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Robert Brackett : A question on the Delaware Basin tuck-in. Could you give us some color? I'm thinking in terms of a larger acquisition where you might talk about the undrilled location, what does that inventory look like? What did you pay in terms of a free cash flow yield, those sorts of metrics that drove the deal and how they might inform future similar deals? John Christmann : Doug, Bob, thanks. It's a nice tuck-in inside our Texas Delaware Basin. It has good inventory with long laterals and fits nicely. If you look strategically, we've been selling in the Permian I think we've sold over $1 billion. And so this is a nice ability to take and pick up some properties in an area that we know well where we've been running programs. It's got some production that comes with it. It's got a lot of wells that will be coming online and it's got some good inventory. Dave, anything you want to add? David Pursell : Yes, I think it's just some follow-on. John talked about it. We've got some wells that have just come online. We have a handful that are coming online later this month. which will drive production through the end of this year. We also have 2 rigs finishing out a pad. It will add a substantial number of DUCs that we'll likely complete in the first quarter of '23. So there's a lot there. I think in the current -- I think when you think about the opportunity set here, -- we've got a number of intervals that this zone has that are low risk. We know the rock around existing infrastructure. So we think about high-quality, low-risk opportunities. Again, you get probably have several years of drilling just on those. And there's some upside potential. There's a number of zones that we're testing in our existing footprint, and we'll continue to test those and we'll likely test those zones here on our new acreage. And again, that's all upside that hopefully we'll be able to talk about as we go through 2023. John Christmann : And the other thing I would add, Bob, is it brings a hot rig. I mean that's something that if you look a year ago, we were looking to add a rig in the Permian, and we started in the third quarter and really have showed up in April. And the nice thing about this is we've got a really high-quality rig. It's been performing well and a good crew. David Pursell : Yes. And again, we're not going to talk about the development pace here, but if you can think about conceptually putting 1 rig on this for the next couple of years, this is free cash flow positive from day 1, and continues to generate free cash flow. Robert Brackett : And I think that's intriguing the idea that an efficient rig ready to go in the Permian is actually an asset. My follow-up would be -- if I think about the Austin Chalk, and I might have misheard you, but was a 6-well program for 2022, and the revised production guidance was based on the mixed results was 4,500 barrels a day. Can you talk about sort of what the predrill expectations were and some of the learnings on why you didn't hit that number? David Pursell : Yes. And I'm not -- we probably had more wells than that baked into the plan. But just to frame the Chalk to make sure everybody's familiar. We have a non-op and operated position in Washington County, which is West of College Station. What we've put the pause on was a 20,000-acre piece east of College Station on the Eastern edge of Brazos County. In that 20,000-acre piece, the first well we drilled was an outstanding result. We went into delineation mode as we were trying to delineate this 20,000-acre piece, and we ended up with a lot more variability in the results than we had anticipated. So the thought was, let's put pause on this. We've reduced the number of wells that we're going to put online this year. We're actually going to defer some completions as well while we study the results. And the point is this capital is better spent in the Permian. So we're going to pause it and we'll let you know what we come up with probably sometime in 2023. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with Truist. Neal Dingmann : My first question on EGF, I'm just wondering, John, if you -- maybe a bit more detail, just maybe talk about broad comments on what you're seeing on returns there. including maybe just an idea of how natural gas prices are trending the area as well. John Christmann : Yes. Great question. First of all, our natural gas price is fixed, $2.65 per million per BTU. So gas price are fixed. As you know, we make our money through the profit oil in the split is the way the PSC is designed. So the other thing I would say is if you look at the overall market, here, we are increasing our rig count threefold at a time when the rig count in MENA has been growing at about a 20% clip. And so we found ourselves in a pretty unusual situation where there's been high demand for a lot of our trained Egyptian talent, national talent. And we're in the process at 1 point, I think we had 75 folks that we've had to replace effectively and backfill for. And so it's an interesting time, and it just gives you a little bit of a clue into the competition for national talent in the area today. And the good news is, as we're on it and addressing it. But what it's done is it's the safety statistics have been good, but it's manifested in just some delays in terms of getting wells drilled getting the rigs up and running and then getting wells connected. And so a lot of it, it's mainly just in the reactivation of the cold stacked rigs. And it's something we've done before. but it's just taking a little bit longer. And we'll get it ironed out, and we're working collectively with the folks on the ground there and this is something we'll sort out. You see it in our supplement. If you look at what we had planned to bring on in the second quarter, I think, 24 wells, we actually only got 11 on, but you see the pace with third quarter and fourth quarter picking back up. So it's kind of a short-term above-ground set back, but it's something we will recover from. In terms of the well performance has been good and kind of in line with performance. So no issues on the well performance side. Neal Dingmann : Okay. Great details. And then just moving to Alpine High. I think you moved to rig or moving a rig there. Will that rig stay? And maybe if you could just comment on what you think the overall pace of activity might be later this year and into next year? John Christmann : Yes. For now, we see it there. We've got some pads lined out to drill with 1 rig. It takes some time to drill those pads. So I think it will be late, late this year, early next year before you might see some production from that. But the plan is to leave that rig in there for now and for the most part, stay there. It might, after a pad or 2 jump over and pick up a well or 2 in the Delaware. But for the most part, it's going to stay at Alpine High. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with MKM Partners. Leo Mariani : Just wanted to ask a little bit about the U.S. growth trajectory. I think previously, I think you guys had expected the oil volumes to kind of start to grow by the fourth quarter on an organic basis. I realized you made an acquisition, but you clearly took some volumes out of the Chalk. Just any updated thoughts when you resume organic oil growth again in the U.S. Is that still this year? Or is that maybe sliding into next year? John Christmann : No. I think we'll get back on track pretty quick. We did pull out the Chalk, but that is greater than 50% gas there. So when you look at that 8,000 BOEs a day, you could think of that probably as being about 3 million or 3,000 barrels a day and about 30 million cubic feet of gas a day, right? So -- but with the addition of moving the rig back to the Permian, they're going to be a little more oily than what the chalk was. And I think we'll get back on track at -- here pretty quickly. Leo Mariani : Okay. That's helpful. And then just wanted to ask on Egypt real quick. So you mentioned in your prepared comments, but your gross gas volumes were down quite a bit in the second quarter versus the prior quarter. I think you all had previously talked about several months back about trying to hold gas volumes kind of flattish in 2022. Was there anything anomalistic there, where maybe a plant went down for maintenance or something that caused the drop? Just trying to get a sense of some of those volumes are going to come back or maybe you just have some wells that maybe decline a lot or something? John Christmann : No. I mean you've got 2 big things there. We've been focused on more oil-focused drilling with the current rig program. And then you've got [Kassar], which was a big gas field that we found along many, many years back, and it's been on a gradual decline. So there's time periods where you'll see the Kassar impact in those numbers. Operator : I'll now hand the call back over to Chief Executive Officer, John Christmann, for any closing remarks. Gary Clark : Andrew, it looks like we have 1 more analyst who has a question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. . Neil Mehta : Yes. Thanks, team. I appreciate it. So 2 quick questions for me. First is in Suriname. There has been some talk of some -- I don't know, say, geopolitical tensions, but definitely political uncertainty down there. And so how does that affect the way that you and your partners are thinking about investing in the region? And the other is in the North Sea. Can you guys give us an update of how you're thinking about that basin and the profitability there? And particularly, in light of firm natural gas prices, but also around the risk of windfall taxes. John Christmann : No. Two really good questions. I'll address Suriname first. Big picture, we feel really good about it. Neil, the offshore, which is a big plus in terms of where the operations are taking place. And I think it just underscores how important development of resource would be for the country of Suriname. And so Statoil's been there a long time. They've got a great track record, and we look forward to working with them and helping try to bring some energy and some GDP growth into the country. So I think it's a positive from that perspective. And it just shows you that in today's world, there are some challenges out there with inflation and other things going on and a lot of countries are addressing that, including Suriname. In the North Sea, I think we've got a very, very strong business there. We've always characterized our assets as kind of 2 different plays in 2 different -- 2 totally different assets. 40s, we're obviously managing it into the later phases of its life and looking to manage that margin. And as you see it wind down, we still see that happening early next decade. And you see the profits levy there starts to impact timing of some of those things. And so in the prepared remarks, my comments were this isn't helpful sometimes for future investment, and it may actually shorten the life of some things, but we're not facing that today with where it is. And then the other asset up there that we have still some great programs in and see some future development is in the tertiary at Beryl. And we've had some good strong programs and look forward to that. But I think you do have to just step back and look at your future capital, how it fits within the portfolio. But today, we see the North Sea playing a key role. Operator : I am now showing no further questions. So with that, I'll hand the call back over to CEO, John Christmann, for any closing remarks. John Christmann : Thank you for joining us today. I'd like to leave you with the following closing thoughts. We remain very focused on generating free cash flow. In 2022, this will be approximately $3 billion. We will return at least 60% or $1.8 billion to shareholders. Our new properties in the Delaware Basin are additive to this framework. It's an attractively priced tuck-in acquisition and cash flow accretive from day 1. In Egypt, well performance has been good, and we're actively addressing the above-ground inefficiencies to get well tie-ins back on schedule. Operator, I will now turn the call over to you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to APA Corporation's Third Quarter 202 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to introduce Vice President of Investor Relations, Gary Clark. Gary Clark : Good morning, and thank you for joining us on APA Corporation's Third Quarter 2022 Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John Christmann. Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results and outlook. Also on the call and available to answer questions are Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President of Development, Tracey Henderson, Senior Vice President of Exploration; and Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations.  Our prepared remarks will be less than 15 minutes in length with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our third quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apacorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website.  Consistent with the previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude noncontrolling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels.  I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John. John Christmann : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call today, I will review highlights from the third quarter, provide commentary on our fourth quarter outlook and conclude with an early look at our 2023 plan.  APA continues to enjoy a robust free cash flow profile provided by our unhedged exposure to a globally diversified product price mix. With activity in Egypt and the Permian Basin now at levels capable of driving sustainable corporate production growth, our free cash flow is also expected to grow, assuming flat year-over-year oil and gas prices.  Turning to the third quarter results. We have had several key highlights. Global production was in line with our guidance range as outperformance in the U.S. offset unplanned facility downtime in the North Sea. Permian Basin assets were strong contributors across the board from the core Midland Basin development program to the newly acquired properties in the Texas Delaware. In Egypt, drilling and recompletion programs are progressing closer to our original plans for the year. New well connections exceeded our revised third quarter guidance and production momentum is picking up into the fourth quarter.  The challenges associated with the activity ramp are not totally behind us, but we are making good progress. The North Sea after returning to production from seasonal turnarounds incurred an unusually high amount of unplanned downtime in August and September. Most of these issues have been mitigated and volumes have returned to a more normalized level as reflected in our forward guidance.  During the third quarter, we generated more than $600 million of free cash flow, purchased nearly 10 million shares of APA common stock at an average price of $33.85 per share and announced a doubling of our annual dividend rate.  In Suriname, we advanced our exploration and appraisal program with the first oil discovery on Block 53 at Baja and a successful flow test of the CrabDagu discovery well in Block 58.  And on the ESG front, I am very pleased to announce that we have successfully delivered on our 2022 goal to reduce flaring in Egypt. Today, new projects are reducing routine upstream flaring by 40%, enabling us to compress the gas into sales lines and deliver to Egyptian consumers for cleaner burning affordable fuel. More information on our third quarter results can be found in the operational supplement posted on our website.  Turning now to our fourth quarter outlook. Capital investment is projected to be around $450 million, and our full year guidance of $1.725 billion remains unchanged. We expect adjusted production will increase by around 5% from the third quarter, driven primarily by an increase in new well connections and recompletion activity in Egypt and a rebound from planned and unplanned platform maintenance downtime in the North Sea.  Given the age of the North Sea facilities, we expect facility run times will generally be lower and more variable than in the past. As a result, we are now providing a production guidance range to accommodate a broader spectrum of potential future outcomes. In Suriname on Block 58, we are currently participating in the drilling of 2 wells, a second appraisal well at Sapakara South and an exploration well at Aware.  Results will be provided as they become available. Despite a few challenges during 2022 we will exit the year in a strong position financially and operationally. We are on track to generate around $2.7 billion in free cash flow for the year. Consistent with our 60% capital returns program, we anticipate returning at least $1.6 billion of this in share buybacks and dividends.  While there is more to do, we have significantly strengthened our balance sheet, reducing net debt by more than $1.4 billion through the end of the third quarter and production volumes are now trending sustainably higher in the U.S. and Egypt.  As we plan for 2023, our objectives remain the same. We will maintain capital discipline, target moderate production growth, work tirelessly to mitigate rising costs and continue to deliver meaningful emissions intensity reductions. Our capital budget next year will be around $2.0 billion to $2.1 billion. This assumes 5 rigs in the Permian Basin and up to 17 rigs in Egypt, while activity in the North Sea and Suriname is projected to remain consistent with 2022 levels.  Similar to our approach in 2022, this early view incorporates what we believe is an appropriate view of inflationary impacts on the capital program. The majority of the expected inflation is associated with U.S. rig and frac costs as contracts are renewed at the higher current rates. Inflationary pressures in our international portfolio should be more muted. Despite the planned increase in capital investment in a like-for-like price environment, we estimate APA's free cash flow will grow in 2023. Note, this excludes any uplift from our Cheniere gas supply contract commencing in the second half of the year.  Steve will provide more details on this contract, which gives us access to premium natural gas price points in Europe and Asia. Following 3 years of production decline since the beginning of the COVID pandemic, we look forward to returning to growth in 2023. At the corporate level, we are targeting mid-single-digit year-over-year growth, driven primarily by higher oil production across all assets. In the third quarter, our Permian Basin results were particularly strong due to a variety of factors, including good underlying base production and new well performance.  The timing and number of new completions and relatively minimal maintenance, midstream and weather-related downtime. As we look into the fourth quarter of 2022, in the first quarter of 2023, we expect Permian production will be flat to down as we experienced a lull in new well connections and reflect the potential for winter weather-related downtime in our outlook. Planning for next year continues and we will have much more detail to provide with our fourth quarter results in February. In closing, we have a constructive outlook on the long-term demand for natural gas and oil. This hasn't changed despite the potential near-term demand impacts of a recession and the ongoing debate over the pace of global decarbonization trends.  We continue to plan our business using relatively conservative commodity price scenarios, allocate capital to our highest return projects and target long-term single-digit sustainable production growth. APA will continue to return 60% of free cash flow to shareholders through buybacks and dividends while also continuing to strengthen the balance sheet.  Lastly, we remain committed to reducing emissions within our operational footprint, and we will be introducing specific CO2 equivalent emissions intensity goals around this objective in the near future. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney. Stephen Riney : Thank you, John. For the third quarter of 2022, APA Corporation reported consolidated net income of $422 million or $1.28 per diluted common share. Our quarterly results include items that are outside of APA's core earnings. The most significant of these was a $275 million charge for the impact of the U.K. energy profits levy. This was partially offset by a $93 million release of tax valuation allowance due to the use of tax loss carryforwards during the quarter.  Excluding these and other smaller items, adjusted net income for the third quarter was $651 million or $1.97 per diluted common share. Most of our financial results in the third quarter were in line or better than guidance. For the quarter, we reported a net gain of $12 million on the sale of oil and gas purchased for resale. This was better than the guidance we provided in August of a $10 million loss. As a reminder, we sell our gas in basin at Waha Hub or El Paso Permian based pricing. Our marketing organization fulfills obligations on various commercial agreements, including our long-haul transport contracts using purchased product.  The reported gain or loss on the sale of oil and gas purchased for resale is a result of this latter activity. In the fourth quarter, based on recent strip pricing, we expect this activity to result in a net gain of approximately $70 million. GPT expense, which is costs incurred for gathering, processing and transmission was above guidance for the third quarter. This has been a trend for much of 2022 and is primarily a result of the higher natural gas prices in the U.S. GPT expense increases with gas price because some of our gas processing contracts are based on the percentage of proceeds and accounting for such contracts results in costs going up and down with movements in gas price.  G&A of $69 million was considerably below our guidance. As with prior quarters, this was primarily the result of the required quarterly mark-to-market of our cash settled stock-based compensation plans. Underlying G&A for the quarter was around $90 million, a little lower than average. Turning to the balance sheet. You will notice that our total debt increased $244 million to $5.5 billion in the third quarter, as we utilize the revolver to partially fund the closing of the Texas Delaware Basin acquisition at the end of July.  As we've discussed on prior calls, the revolving credit facility is an asset that can be utilized when attractive opportunities arise. We've demonstrated this over the past 2 years using the revolver to fund timely debt tenders, share repurchases and asset acquisitions. Over time, we will look to pay down the revolver with available free cash flow that is not committed under the capital return framework. A few other things before we turn to Q&A. Please refer to our financial and operational supplement, which includes additional information related to our third quarter results as well as our updated guidance for the fourth quarter of 2022. This can be found on our website.  2022 will be a very strong year for free cash flow at APA. As John mentioned previously, at comparable prices, we expect to see increasing free cash flow in 2023. This excludes any financial benefit from our Cheniere gas supply contract.  At recent strip pricing, the anticipated benefit to 2023 would be around $570 million, assuming the latest possible start date of August 1, which is a slightly later date than we have spoken of previously.  One final note on U.S. income taxes. At this time, barring any contrary guidance that may be issued by tax authorities we do not expect to be subject to the new 15% corporate alternative minimum tax until 2024. Thus, we currently anticipate no U.S. cash income taxes for 2023, as accumulated NOLs should more than offset projected taxable income.  As always, please follow up with Gary and his team with any questions or if you need any other help related to our updated guidance. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : I got one on Suriname to kick us off, and then I'll go to 1 of the financial questions, if that's okay. John, I realize that you've got a couple of wells drilling right now. And -- but I'm also aware that Hess and Shell, I guess, Shell, as you operator had a discovery that looks on trend, if I'm not mistaken, with your prospect. So I'm wondering if you can characterize a your expectations or what the current status is? And whether I'm reading that right, that there might be some read-through from confirmation of a working hydrocarbon system. And I guess, Hess has not really -- you haven't any details as to whether that was a success or not, but it looks like they are reviewing it as we speak. John Christmann : No. Doug, the well we're drilling in the kind of the northwest portion of our block is a You will remember Bonboni, it's 25 kilometers west of Bonboni, where we found an active or working hydrocarbon system. It appears that they have a working hydrocarbon system north of us as well. So I think that's all good news. The big thing here will be trap. And -- but Tracy Henderson is here, and I'll let Tracy provide a little bit more color. Tracey Henderson : Doug, I think your comments are really spot on. We are sort of updip in trend from the well we know as much as you do in terms of what's been in the public domain, but it sounds like a positive result at least with respect to the petroleum system. So what this does do, as John mentioned, we had seen Bonboni in the upper -- or oil in the upper part of Bonboni previously. So what this does is basically push the mature proven kitchen further north into Block 42, so well north of our Block 58 Northern boundary, which is good news for the petroleum system.  And I would say it also increases the fetch area in the Block 58 or the Block 58 Northern prospects. I would counter that though with saying with these deepwater fans all along sort of that entire margin, the biggest critical risk factor is trap. So we will still need to be very focused on what our trapping geometries are, but from a petroleum system standpoint, if you have a working trap, this is good and it increases your confidence that you can charge them. Doug Leggate : I hate to do a kind of Part 1b, but just while we're on the topic of Suriname, do you have any color on Sapakara South at this point as it relates to whether that can help inform an FID in 2023? John Christmann : Well, a couple of things I have to say, Doug, on Sapakara South. Number one, it's strongly supported from a seismic perspective, and it's an updip test of Sapakara South.  Our operations are ongoing. And I'll say it could be a very material add to that area. So we're very excited about it in terms of FID and so forth. We've got the appraisal at Sapakara South, which is ongoing. We also got appraisal at Krabdagu, which will follow sometime early next year. So we're excited about that, and we'll just have to get with you when we're ready. Doug Leggate : My follow-up is for Steve. And I guess, Steve, I'm going to try and layer in a couple of things to this, I guess. But obviously, Cheniere doesn't want to start this contract as soon as -- as early as you would like it to start. I think it was pretty clear given LNG prices.  But I guess what I'm really trying to get to is your comments about free cash flow. You said, if I'm not mistaken, that the free cash flow -- the cash flow would be higher next year on a similar price deck, excluding Cheniere, if I heard that correct.  But you've also flipped this Waha trading contract or gathering contract to a kind of almost a $300 million run rate on revenues. So when you wrap all that together, it looks to us that the free cash flow could be up even at a substantially lower commodity deck. So can you help me understand if I'm reading that correctly? Stephen Riney : Yes, Doug, I think we're just going to have to be -- probably be patient to finish the planning process for '23 and to -- we'll get to that in February, and we'll give all the details on that. But as John indicated, if we -- if we have -- if we end up with a capital program that's kind of similar to where we've been running for the last 2 years -- or 2 years, 2 quarters, which would be the $2 billion to $2.1 billion.  If we allocate that similarly to the way we've been allocating and delivering activity for those last 2 quarters, if we end up in a price environment similar to 2022, then we will be up on free cash flow for next year. There have been some things that have changed a bit since the last time we talked about '23, which was in February, we've got a little bit more activity that's leading to that increase in capital spending because we do have an extra rig in the Permian. We've got a couple of extra rigs going into '23 in Egypt. There is -- there are some new taxes, in particular, the energy profits levy in the U.K., and there's talk now about possibly increasing the rate on that, that we did say we don't believe we're going to be subject to the U.S. alternative minimum tax in 2023, and that would certainly be good if we can defer that until 2024.  So there are -- and we've talked about the North Sea, perhaps being a little less predictable in terms of production volume. So having a wider range of possibilities in -- and we know that Egypt has gotten off to a little slower start in '22 than we had hoped for, and therefore, that will carry over a bit into 2023. So we've tried to be really transparent about where we are going into 2023 relative to the last time we talked about it in February. But we think we've got very good momentum. We're fixing some of the issues that we had in the second quarter certainly looks better in third quarter results and going into fourth quarter better.  And I think we'll go into 2023 better. So a long-winded way of saying, let's wait until February for the details on the capital program and the capital allocation and what that means for production volume. But we feel very good. We feel like the plan that we laid out last February is still very much intact with the transparency of the few things that have changed since then. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James. John Freeman : Just a follow-up on the last line of question. I definitely appreciate the early look on 2023, understanding that there's still some moving parts. But if I just wanted to kind of tap on to what you're saying, Steve, where if you're running kind of in aggregate in the U.S. in Egypt, it looks like on a year-over-year basis, maybe an incremental 4.5 rigs versus what you did this year. Is there a way to sort of parse out of the $2 billion to $2.1 billion CapEx number? How much of that kind of year-over-year increase is kind of activity driven versus cost inflation? Stephen Riney : Yes, I'd say that -- and John might have some comments on this as well. But I'd say look at the last 2 quarters, where we've -- especially fourth quarter, we're going to be running basically at what we're planning for, for 2023 preliminarily. Most of that was the same in the third quarter. We did have a bit of time where we didn't have the Ocean Patriot in the North Sea in the third quarter. But on the last 2 quarters, we've been running just a little under or this last quarter and next quarter, we're running a little under $500 million a quarter, and that would give you a $2 billion on an annualized spend rate.  And that's -- so that's a preliminary view with maybe a little bit of inflation built into that go into possibly $2.1 billion. And that's just -- that's the preliminary view. We are still early days on the planning process, and I'd just caveat that with that could change. So let's wait and see in February. But I'd characterize it broadly as the bulk of the change in capital spending is because of the change in activity. John Freeman : Okay. Great. And then my follow-up question on Egypt. You all did a really good job of playing catch up, getting the completion cadence in the second half of the year back up pretty meaningfully after the growing pains in the second quarter.  But John, you mentioned that it's not totally behind us in terms of some of the -- what you are going through in Egypt. Can you just sort of maybe give a little bit more color to what you're speaking to because at least on a completion cadence, it looks really good, where you all going to exit the year at in Egypt? John Christmann : Yes. We're in pretty darn good shape, but we've worked hard to get here in a pretty short time period. And a lot of it is just addressing manpower issues and training -- and so we're in pretty good shape, John. And I think we're close to where we wanted to be, but you're still working through some things there, but we're in pretty good shape. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with Truist. Neal Dingmann : First question, a little bit on what Freeman was just asking. John, my first question is on production growth. Specifically, you all, I think, characterized '23 as potentially seen, I think, what you deem this kind of moderate growth. But to me, looking at your '23 domestic and Egyptian activity plans, it seems like production could be even maybe a bit better than moderate? I know you don't have '23 guide yet, but I guess what I'm wondering is how you view sort of next year's contributions incrementally when you think about Egypt versus domestically given to me all the domestic opportunities, including the new play there? John Christmann : Yes, I would just say, and Steve went into pretty good detail on an update of the early look on a 3-year plan, and it's very dynamic, and we're working that and we'll come back in February.  But in general, you're still looking at mid-single digits on a BOE basis at the corporate level is what we're looking at. And that's going to be driven by oil in Egypt. We should have cleaner run next year in the North Sea, although we're going to have a range -- and then obviously, we've had really good performance in the U.S., specifically in the Permian. Neal Dingmann : Okay. Great detail. John. And then secondly, just on shareholder return, I'm just wondering, would you all say you're still leaning in the stock buybacks, I guess what I'm trying to get a sense of that 1.6 buyback plan, what remains year-to-date. John Christmann : I would just say, I'll underscore, we're committed to the returns framework, and we will deliver a minimum of the 60%. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein. Robert Brackett : I had a question on the Cheniere gas supply contract. You mentioned the scale of a $570 million opportunity. Could you break that down for us in terms of volume implied and maybe the price differential between Henry Hub and whether you think about TTF or JKM? Stephen Riney : Yes, Bob, that -- so the contract is $140 million a day and the $570 million, I won't recall exactly what day, but it's based on strip pricing for -- and we assumed an 80% TTF, 20% JKM mix, which we have the right to elect and that was versus the same period strip for Houston Ship Channel. And then it has all of the deducts that we get from that contract for liquefaction for shipping, for shrinkage and for regas and things like that. Robert Brackett : Very clear. And that's sort of starting up in September through the -- that $140 million a day is 4 months or 5? Stephen Riney : It would be five months. The -- by contract, the latest that contract can start is August 1. It could start earlier. I'm not holding my breath. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : Maybe we just go to the North Sea here. You mentioned in your prepared remarks, lower and more variable run times, just kind of given the age of the asset. Now we potentially have some higher EPL kind of overhanging here. The current 2023 outlook as it stands today, as you said, the North Sea activity should be consistent with 2022. But we're just wondering what the potential range of outcomes could be there, whether it's related to changes in the regulatory environment or by your choice. And we know it doesn't quite work like sale, but what kind of base decline is the North Sea on. David Pursell : Yes, Jeanine, this is Dave Pursell. I don't have the numbers in of me. But think about the 2 different assets. We have 40s, which is a mature waterflood, that's going to be on a the base decline there is going to be on a high single-digit annual decline. These are high water cut low decline wells -- barrels a bit different.  There's water -- there's pressure maintenance through water injection in many of those assets, but the -- you'll see more conventional type declines in barrel. So they'll be higher than 40s. And so we can circle back and get to the blended number. But it's going to be somewhere in the mid- to high teens just based on memory, but we can -- we'll tighten that up. Jeanine Wai : Okay. Great. And then maybe turning to the revolver. I think, Steve, you said you consider it to be an asset to utilize and there's attractive opportunities, you'll look to pay it down over time. I guess our question is how much is too much on the revolver? And how does this really factor into your appetite for future bolt-ons? Stephen Riney : Yes. And I know our controller won't like me calling that an asset, but we view it as such in the nonaccounting sense and it's for that very reason. We can -- we used it for the bolt-on acquisition in July in the Delaware Basin. We use it for debt tenders. We've used it for share buybacks.  In particular, we use it during periods where we have a period where we have no material nonpublic information and we can use it for open market repurchases of shares in periods where we can be a little more selective at the pace at which we buy back shares during those periods of time. So the revolver comes in very handy at those times. We -- especially with the price environment that we're in, we're pretty comfortable with the revolver where we've got it now and where it's been for most of the year.  But we do need to get that paid down and preserve it longer term for that optionality around potential bolt-on acquisitions if we find the good opportunities. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles Meade : John, I'm hoping to get you to elaborate a little bit more your thinking on supercar south to and what kind of piece of the puzzle this might be? I mean my understanding is you could drill appraisal wells in many locations, but the location you do because you're hoping it will answer some questions for you and move you towards sanctioning projects. So can you talk about what the goals were with this location. I think you mentioned it's up dip and how that could play into the moving the project forward in '23? John Christmann : Yes. The thing I would say, if you look at Sapakara South, it was a very, very high-quality discovery. You had 30 meters of pay -- actually 32 meters full to base. Low GOR, around 1,100 and you had really, really high perm 1.3 to 1.5 Darcy rock. At the time of that, we announced a connected volume, which we later updated to more than 400 million barrels. So Sapakara South is really world-class rock. We also said at the time that we believe there was additional resource there that needed to be appraised. And that's exactly what this well is doing. It's moved up dip, and we are appraising and we've got really, really good seismic support. We think the seismic is working. And it could add materially to that Sapakara South discovery. Charles Meade : Okay. Got it. Well, it would be interesting to catch up whenever you guys have the information to share there. And second question, I think this is perhaps for Steve, but maybe for you, John, I think Neal was going at this a little bit earlier.  Putting the pieces in your press release, you guys say that you're going to return at least $1.6 billion of cash in the form of dividends and buybacks. And then you guys had a helpful slide in your presentation where you say you're at kind of 1.1 right now, and you've got another 130. Actually, you're at 1 right now, and you've got maybe another 130 of dividends that are going to come in 4Q. So that -- if I'm doing the math right, that's about $450 million for the last -- or actually maybe you did $80 million in But it's on the order of $400 million for November and December. And that's a big chunk. Are you guys going to be able to -- are you guys going to have to enter into some kind of a tender to get those shares in? Or is this something you think you can do just participating in the regular daily bid? Stephen Riney : Yes. Charles, let me -- I'll just run quickly through the similar math that you were going through. We do expect now at recent strip prices that free cash flow this year will be $2.7 billion, as John said. So that would imply a minimum committed returns of $1.6 billion. Year-to-date, we've done $127 million of dividends. We've bought back 26 million shares at $34. So that's $884 million of buyback. And as you said, that's just over $1 billion so far this year. Since inception by the way, that's 15% of the company that we bought back at a little over $31 a share. So at $2.7 billion of free cash flow that would imply for the fourth quarter total returns of $600 million. The dividends will be about $80 million. And so that implies buybacks of $520 million and we've done right around $80 million of that in October.  So your math was pretty darn close that with all of that, if you landed right on 60% would be about $440 million of additional share buybacks. Historically, we've delivered those buybacks through 10b5-1 programs and through OMRs. As I said, we use OMRs when we don't have material nonpublic information, we are drilling 2 wells in Suriname.  So we do understand that situation and the risk associated with that as John said, we're committed to that program. So you should assume that we have plans in place to make sure that, that will be delivered and -- because it will be delivered by the end of December. Charles Meade : Got it. So I appreciate you corrected my math, Steve, and it's kind of a wait and see, but you guys have planned to get there, if I'm understanding it correctly. . Stephen Riney : That's correct. We will get to you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Two questions, please. The first 1 is a little bit of the John, when you're talking about mid-single -- mid-single-digit oil production growth for next year. Is it based on the fourth quarter or based on full year 2022 level? Because if it is based on full year 2022 level, that suggests that your next year oil production may be lower than the fourth quarter level.  And with the increased activities -- and is there any reason why that the average production will be lower on the oil growth for next year than the fourth quarter level? That's the first question.  And second 1 is very simple. On the Permian, you're saying you're going to run 5 rigs, but do you include anything in the Alpine High. And then what's your view given the current commodity prices between the gas well and oil only weight as well. John Christmann : So number one, it's -- '23 is a work in progress. So we're working on that. We said we'd come back in February. But in general, we said BOEs will be up mid-single digit. It's going to be driven by oil.  And it is year-over-year is -- but we'll come back with that in detail. That's really pretty much the shape of the 3-year plan that we put out last February. When we look at the Permian, 5 rigs, yes, today, we've got 2 in the Midland Basin, 3 in the Delaware. There will be activity at Alpine High. And we do like the mix, and we think those wells compete very well today with where the gas price deck is and the oil price deck. Paul Cheng : John, should we assume you're going to have at least 1 rig at Apline High or is that just not necessarily it may be... John Christmann : I would say today, today, just assume there's likely 3 in the Delaware and Alpine High will be part of that program. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with MKM Partners. Leo Mariani : I was hoping to jump back to the North Sea here real quick. Just kind of looking at the production over the last couple of years, certainly, you guys have been hit with a lot of downtime there.  You're forecasting higher production here in the fourth quarter. Just wanted to get a sense if there's like some things you're doing different operationally where you're kind of feeling more comfortable that you're going to be able to kind of deliver maybe some higher rates here going forward in the North Sea. John Christmann : I'd just say a lot of it's -- we're coming out of our maintenance turnaround season. And we've had to play catch up in '22 for '20 and '21. The Covid years hit pretty hard there and we were limited on what we could do on the tars.  And you've just got aging infrastructure. And when things go down, it takes a little longer to get things back up. But I think we've got a lot of that behind us. And we will be guiding with wider ranges in the future. But right now, we've got good momentum and things are running fairly smooth. Leo Mariani : Okay. And just jumping over to Egypt here. Just looking at your kind of gross oil volumes, look like those were down a little bit here in 3Q versus 2Q. Can you just give us some indications as we get into kind of 4Q and early next year? Do you think 3Q is the low point on those gross oil volumes, and we start to have some nice growth into kind of the end of the year. And then do you see kind of what type of growth do you see in Egypt next year? Do you see that driving a lot of the overall production growth of the company? John Christmann : Yes. I think some of that is just timing of the well connections we had this quarter, and we've got good momentum really across the whole portfolio going into the fourth quarter, we're off to a good start and we had some wells that have come on and things. So we do think Egypt is going to be 1 of the big drivers in '23 and beyond. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum with Cowen. David Deckelbaum : Just wanted to ask if I could. Following up quickly just on North Sea. John, I think your comments were just on the aging infrastructure. Is there sort of a more of an outsized maintenance CapEx spend that goes into North Sea and '23?  Is there an imminent need to upgrade facilities? And how does that sort of square with where production would be in the fourth quarter. Are we back to a more sustained level ex downtime heading into next year? John Christmann : I don't think it's any outsized. I think we really played catch-up in '22 and '23. There are always decisions that you make as you get into later years like at 40s on equipment, and those are decisions we make routinely going forward. But those are all things you're constantly weighing the pros and cons of as you're looking at operating facilities as they get later in their life, but don't anticipate anything significantly outsized from normal and we should be in a period today with most of that behind us where things are going to run a little smoother. David Deckelbaum : Appreciate that. And maybe if I could just ask for a little bit more color on the Cheniere contract. I think you all had marked today based on strip pricing. Can you give us a sense on just how those netbacks work?  Are the costs that are coming out of those LNG contracts on a fixed or variable basis. And what's a good ballpark to apply on sort of an MMBtu basis for costs relative to where the headline TTF price might be? Stephen Riney : Yes. Unfortunately, we -- it's difficult to give a kind of a generic approach to figuring it out because some of the costs like shrinkage and fuel and things like that will come out effectively at it's a loss of volume. So it comes out at the TTF and JKM price, and some of them are contractual dollar amount costs that do have some provision for inflation over time. So a good example of that would be the liquefaction fee. So it's not that easy to give a kind of a generic rule of how it will work through different prices of LNG or Houston Ship Channel for that matter. So we -- that's why we just give it as a as a margin over Houston Ship Channel. Because I mentioned earlier in my prepared remarks that we actually sell all of our product that we produce in basin in the Permian. And we enter into pipeline contracts and things like that, primarily as a participant in the industry to keep less liquid markers like Waha Hub more attached to the bigger, more liquid markets. And then we have a marketing organization that manages those contractual obligations. And -- we -- for that reason, we look at the Cheniere contract as a margin over purchased product because we will purchase product on the Gulf Coast and deliver that to Cheniere.  The pricing that we get is that netback calculation and they buy the product, they take title to it at their plant in let. So we don't have any title to product as it goes through their plant or the liquefied product as it comes out. We don't manage shipping or anything like that. We don't do the selling. They do all of that for us. Operator : Our next question is a follow-up from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : I'm sorry guys for lining up again. But John, I guess, I'm listening to all the questions about the North Sea. I'm listening to the higher windfall tax risk, the less predictability, the life expectancy the field, et cetera, et cetera.  And I guess the obvious question to me seems to be -- is this a core asset for Apache? Is there a point at which -- whether it be you get another core area and Suriname perhaps at some point does the North Sea become surplus to requirements, basically, is it for sale? John Christmann : Yes. I mean, the thing I would say, Doug, is that today, North Sea is a core asset for us. Obviously, you've had some factors out there today that impact the ability to invest future and you have to continually weigh in that. We benefit from the Brent pricing and the high netbacks and the free cash flow. But we also have a portfolio that is dynamic. And so you're always looking to expand your ability to invest in other assets. And as things change, sometimes out of your control, it shrinks some of that. So -- but today, it is core but it's something we're always taking into account as we're laying our future plans. Operator : I'm showing no further questions. So with that, I'll hand the call back over to President and CEO, John Christmann, for any closing remarks. John Christmann : Thank you for joining us on our call today. We started the fourth quarter with strong momentum across our global operations, which will carry into 2023.  In Suriname, we're drilling an appraisal well at Sapakara South and an exploration well at Aware. We will share results when they are available. We remain on track to deliver on our capital returns framework. We will deliver at least 60% of 2022 free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks.  Our teams continue to work on our plans for the 2023 program and longer, and we look forward to providing more details to you in February. Operator, I will now turn the call back to you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gary Clark : Good morning, and thank you for joining us on APA Corporation's fourth quarter and full-year 2022 financial and operational results conference call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John Christmann. Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results and outlook. Also on the call and available to answer questions are Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President of Development, Tracey Henderson, Executive Vice President of Exploration; and Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 15 minutes in length with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our fourth quarter and full-year 2022 financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apacorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with the previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John. John Christmann : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call today, I will review our key accomplishments in 2022, comment on fourth quarter performance, and provide an overview of our 2023 plans and objectives. Ahead of the pandemic, in 2019, we established a pragmatic long-term plan for our business that emphasized returns-focused investment, strengthening the balance sheet, right-sizing the organization and activity levels to deliver moderate sustainable production growth, conservative budgeting, and the selective pursuit of differentiated opportunities for value creation, most notably, exploration. The world oil demand and commodity price dislocations that followed in 2020 and 2021 required some difficult and necessary actions to preserve our business. After a few years of hard work, we have returned to and are delivering on this long-term plan. In 2022, we generated a second highest annual free cash flow in the company's 68-year history, which we allocated primarily to debt reduction and cash returns to our shareholders. We also increased our rig activity to a pace that is now capable of generating sustained production growth in both Egypt and the U.S. Some of the more notable achievements of the past year include free cash flow generation of $2.5 billion, 66% of which was returned to shareholders. The repurchase of $1.4 billion of common stock at an average price of less than $40 per share and the doubling of our annual dividend, a $1.4 billion or 23% reduction in outstanding bond debt, an increase in adjusted oil production from the fourth quarter 2021 to the fourth quarter 2022, which represents our first exit rate to exit rate oil production increase since 2018. The successful integration of our Texas Delaware Basin tuck-in acquisition, which compliments our legacy Delaware position and continues to exceed expectations. And importantly, on Block 58 in Suriname, the flow test of two appraisal wells at Sapakara South, which indicated a combined resource in place of more than 600 million barrels of low GOR oil. At Krabdagu, the discovery well was also successfully flow tested. An appraisal is now underway with two rigs. Additionally, in Block 53, the first oil discovery was made at Baja, which is on trend with Krabdagu. And lastly, on the ESG front, routine upstream flaring in Egypt was reduced by more than 40%. This is a significant step toward our goal of eliminating 1 million tons of annualized CO2 equivalent emissions by the end of 2024. Moving on to fourth quarter results. Following some operational delays in Egypt and unexpected facilities downtime in the North Sea in the first three quarters of the year, we ended 2022 on a strong note. Fourth quarter production and costs were in line with guidance, while CapEx for the period was slightly above expectations due to some small shifts in activity timing. U.S. production exceeded guidance on continued strong performance from our Midland and Delaware Basin oil properties. Oil volumes in Egypt strengthened as we continue to improve drilling efficiencies and project execution and North Sea production benefited from a substantial improvement in facilities runtime. Looking forward to 2023, we will continue to focus on managing costs and driving efficiencies while also taking advantage of the optionality within our portfolio to respond to commodity price movements. Specifically, with regard to the recent and substantial drop in natural gas prices, we are managing the portfolio for cash flow and not production volume. Accordingly, our growth in 2023 will be entirely driven by oil. We are reiterating our capital budget of $2 billion to $2.1 billion, which is consistent with what we indicated back in early November. We believe this appropriately reflects potential inflationary impacts for the coming year and remain confident in our ability to deliver within this range. At this investment level and assuming current strip prices, we anticipate year-over-year adjusted oil growth of more than 10% and BOE growth of 4% to 5%. This is consistent with the preliminary BOE guidance we discussed on our November call. Oil volumes in Egypt and the U.S. will be the primary contributors to growth more than offsetting a decrease in natural gas production in both regions. As we also noted on our November call, we are expecting a sequential decrease in U.S. production from fourth quarter to first quarter. This is primarily driven by our Permian Basin oil well completion cadence. However, natural gas curtailments at Alpine High and liquids volume reductions associated with ethane rejection during the month of January are also significant contributors. Importantly, our Permian oil well completion cadence will accelerate in the second half of February, which should lead to significantly higher U.S. oil production in the second quarter through the fourth quarter. Turning to the North Sea. We anticipate a moderate production rebound this year with three new wells coming online in the first half and shorter scheduled maintenance turnaround times. We plan to release the Ocean Patriot semi-submersible drilling rig around mid-year, following completion of a scheduled drilling campaign in the North Sea. The permanent reallocation of this capital to other areas is being evaluated as a recent tax changes in the UK have made returns less attractive than other investment opportunities within our portfolio. In Suriname, first half 2023 activity is focused on the two appraisal wells drilling at Krabdagu and subsequent flow testing. Following that, another exploration test on Block 58 is also planned. While average oil and gas prices are trending down relative to 2022, APA\u2019s free cash flow this year should be bolstered by our gas sales contract with Cheniere. Steve will provide more detail around the expected impact of this contract in his remarks. We remain fully committed to returning at least 60% of our free cash flow to shareholders through a mix of dividends and share buybacks. Strengthening our balance sheet also remains a priority, and we anticipate that most or all of the free cash flow not returned to shareholders will be used to reduce debt. In closing, while the industry is experiencing considerable short-term oil and gas price volatility, we have a constructive outlook on the long-term supply and demand for hydrocarbons. Over the next several years, our plan is to maintain a relatively constant activity level yet remain flexible to shift capital within the portfolio to the highest value opportunities. Through the cycle, we also plan to continue allocating an appropriate percentage of our capital budget to high-quality differential exploration opportunities. APA\u2019s investment case and portfolio are unique. Within the Permian Basin, we can allocate capital investment to oil or natural gas and generate growth from either or both commodities. Additionally, we hold considerable long-term gas transportation capacity, which our marketing team utilizes to purchase and resale third-party gas for a profit. We have gas sales to Cheniere commencing this summer that will provide long-term access to international index pricing. Our Egypt operations offer exposure to premium Brent oil prices, modernized PSC terms, and an opportunity to generate consistent growth in an area with tremendous potential. And in Suriname, our joint-venture partnership enables the appraisal and potential development of large scale projects on Block 58 with limited capital investment. We believe APA is well positioned to help profitably deliver hydrocarbons that the world needs for the next decade and beyond. We are committed to doing this while reducing carbon intensity and being good environmental stewards. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney. Stephen Riney : Thanks, John. APA delivered very good financial performance in the fourth quarter and for the full-year as we benefited from a strong albeit volatile price environment. For the last three months of 2022, consolidated net income was $443 million or $1.38 per diluted common share. As usual, these results include items that are outside of core earnings. The most significant of these items was a pre-tax charge of $157 million to increase the net contingent liability for decommissioning the former Fieldwood properties in the Gulf of Mexico. The increase reflects a combination of changes in cash flow during the life of the producing asset and estimated future decommissioning costs. This was partially offset by a $52 million pre-tax unrealized gain on derivatives and a $47 million release of evaluation allowance on deferred tax assets. Excluding these and other smaller items, adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was $476 million or $1.48 per diluted common share. During the fourth quarter, APA generated $360 million of free cash flow and repurchased more than 12 million shares of common stock, resulting in approximately 312 million shares outstanding at year-end. Underlying G&A costs for the quarter remained around $95 million. However, total G&A was $169 million, which was above our fourth quarter guidance. This was caused by an increase in anticipated incentive compensation plan payouts, as well as the recurring mark-to-market for previously accrued stock-based compensation that will be paid out in the future. These accruals also resulted in higher than expected LOE and exploration expense, though to a much lesser extent than G&A. Exploration expense was also elevated as we recorded $66 million of combined dry hole costs for the Awari prospect in Suriname and a non-commercial exploration well in the North Sea. Looking ahead to 2023, as John outlined, we expect continued production growth and strong free cash flow generation. At 2022 prices, free cash flow in 2023 would be about the same as 2022. Growing production volumes and cash flow from the Cheniere gas sales contract at current strip prices would offset the impact of higher taxes in the UK and the increased capital program. We will once again return a minimum of 60% of free cash flow to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends with the remaining 40% primarily used for reducing net debt. The gas sales contract with Cheniere will commence in the second half of 2023. We entered into the agreement in 2019 with the purpose of aligning aggregate financial outcomes with a more diversified portfolio of gas prices similar to the diversified oil prices we enjoy naturally through the portfolio. We are frequently asked about the contracts expected free cash flow and its sensitivity to movements in U.S. Gas and Global LNG prices. At current strip price levels, we project roughly $200 million of free cash flow contribution in the second half of 2023. If you want to put a range on annualized forward-looking free cash flows, let me give you two potential outcomes as realistic inputs. Assuming average prices of $20 LNG and $4 Houston Ship Channel, the expected annualized free cash flow would be approximately $500 million. Assuming higher average prices of $40 LNG and $6 Houston Ship Channel, the annualized free cash flow would increase to approximately $1.25 billion. It is important to note that these cash flow numbers include the costs incurred to purchase the gas to supply to Cheniere. Clearly, we believe there is substantial upside price exposure. Despite this, we will continue to plan and budget conservatively given the volatile gas price environment and the scale of associated changes in the cash flow profile. Turning now to income taxes. The UK recently increased its energy profits levy from 25% to 35% and extended the effective period through March of 2028. As a result, the combined statutory tax rate in the UK for 2023 is now 75%, and we expect this will be fairly close to our effective tax rate as well. With that, at current strip prices, we expect UK current tax expense of $550 million to $575 million this year. In the U.S., we do not expect to be subject to the 15% corporate alternative minimum tax in 2023 and therefore, anticipate no current federal income taxes for the year as accumulated tax losses more than offset projected taxable income. Please consult our financial and operational supplement for a full suite of guidance items for both first quarter and full-year 2023. To wrap up, 2022 was a year of great progress as we exceeded our minimum shareholder return commitment and significantly improved the balance sheet. We reduced outstanding bond debt by $1.4 billion while also returning 66% of free cash flow to shareholders and restoring the base annual dividend to $1 per share. Through the buyback program, we repurchased 10% of the company's outstanding shares at an attractive average price of roughly $39 per share. In 2023, we anticipate another strong financial performance with more share repurchases, more balance sheet deleveraging and more progress toward our objective of achieving an investment-grade rating with all of the rating agencies. We look forward to updating you as the year progresses. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Gary Clark. Gary Clark : Thanks, operator. One quick administrative note, Steve Riney will not be available for Q&A as he unfortunately needs to attend to a family matter. So Ben Rodgers, our Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Midstream and Marketing has joined us and he will be able to address your questions related to financial topics and gas marketing and transportation. So we'll give it back to you operator for the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James. Your line is now open. John Freeman : Good morning, guys. John Christmann : Good morning, John. John Freeman : First topic, just looking at Egypt, obviously, a really, really solid quarter in 4Q. Nice to see the rig efficiency gains. I was looking at the success rate that you had in Egypt in 2022 versus the prior couple of years, and the success rate was meaningfully better about 85% average in 2022. And I guess I'm trying to get a sense of how much of that is maybe related to some of the seismic you had done a year ago? Or anything else you are doing in Egypt that would maybe indicate that, that higher success rate is sustainable going forward? John Christmann : Yes, John, I'd say the program has been pretty constant. We drilled really a multitude of different well types, both on the development side and the exploration side. I think what you're seeing there is the impact from the modernization, there were some things that were not being pursued because of the modernized terms, and we're able to pull some of those forward and prioritize them. So you're running a little higher on the success rate as we get some of that low hanging fruit initially. John Freeman : Great. And then a follow-up on looking at Suriname. Has the exploration well been identified where that will be after the two appraisal wells? And is the entirety of the 2023 plan, the two appraisals and the one exploration, which was kind of laid out in the presentation, we just want to think of it as you do the appraisals. I mean it's sort of a \u2013 let's see what comes of that and then determine the second half of the year sort of plan? Just a little bit more detail on Suriname, please. John Christmann : Yes. I would just say today, we've got the two appraisal wells that we're drilling at Krabdagu, and that's going to take a good portion of the first part of the year, and that's where the priority is now. And then we do have one exploration slot that is still being worked and we're still debating with partner on which well that will be, but there are multiple wells identified. It's just a matter of which one. So for now, that is the plan. And obviously, we'll readdress that throughout the year. John Freeman : Great. Thanks, John. John Christmann : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Your line is now open. Jeanine Wai : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. John Christmann : You bet, Jeanine. Jeanine Wai : Good morning, John. First question maybe just keeping along with John's on Suriname. The estimate for resource at Sapakara is now over 600 million barrels of oil in place. So I guess our question is, what's the confidence level of that estimate? And how much overall resource is required to get a project to FID, and we know you're doing a ton of appraisal at Krabdagu this year as well? John Christmann : Yes. I mean in terms of the estimate at Sapakara, there's good confidence. We flow tested those volumes \u2013 is really high-quality rock. It's low GOR oil and really got one main sand package. So it's going to have a high recovery and it will be a big key component potentially of a future project. So we have great confidence there. And then we've got the two appraisal wells that are being drilled at Krabdagu right now. In terms of development size and so forth. As we've said, we're working towards a first project. And really, right now, it's premature to talk about anything pending the results of appraisal at Krabdagu, which we're very excited about and it's moving right along. Jeanine Wai : Okay. We'll stay tuned for those appraisal results. Maybe moving to the U.S. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that you're managing the portfolio for cash flow and not production and so 23% is driven by oil this year. And so you also curtailed some Alpine High production in January. Can you provide any further color on what the price sensitivity is of natural gas curtailments at Alpine High? Thank you. David Pursell : Yes. This is Dave Pursell. It's a good question. Our curtailments earlier in the year were relatively small, but when Waha \u2013 Waha has had a lot of volatility. So as we get down to low Waha basis, and sometimes it's going negative, so we're making those decisions daily and weekly. So it depends on dry gas versus wet gas. There's a lot that goes into it, but as we look at it now, we've been flowing Alpine, full out through most of January and February. So not going to give you a specific price marker, but we're looking at it, pretty extensively every day and every week with the marketing team. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Your line is now open. Charles Meade : Good morning, John to you and the whole Apache team there. I wanted to ask a question about the Krabdagu appraisals. And I recognize that we still have to get the important data that those appraisals are designed to get with not just what you see in the logs, but with the flow test. But from my seat, and I think for most of the people outside looking in, you guys have \u2013 you have two \u2013 I guess you're about to have two appraisals ongoing. It really looks like you guys are trying to drive to get the data to get to a decision point in the near-term? And is that a fair inference to make? John Christmann : I mean, Charles, we've prioritized the appraisal at Krabdagu right. And you saw us move from Sapakara with two appraisal wells there, and we're very pleased with those results. And Sapakara 2 kind of came in as we had projected and modeled and obviously anxious for the results at Krabdagu. And so it is fair to say. And its fact, we've prioritized the appraisal program right now. Charles Meade : Right. Thank you for that, John. That's what we're trying to get to. And the second one, just a quick follow-up for me. How would you set our expectations on when we're going to hear about the Krabdagu flow test, both at the same time? Or what should we be thinking about? John Christmann : Charles, I would just say that clearly, one of the wells is ahead of the second and the second one has been on location spudding any time now. So there will be a lag. And we'll just have to see what we decide to do and work with Total in terms of what we come back with and timing. But we're moving on both of those as quickly as possible, and it's very important information. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is now open. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Good morning, guys. John Christmann : Good morning, Paul. Paul Cheng : Two more questions. John, can you remind us that what is Alpine High role in your longer-term portfolio? I think at one point several years ago, you sort of write down edited then gas pipe become a little bit better, and I think you guys go back and sort of having \u2013 it seems like it's having a role in the long term. But how should we look at the Alpine High? And also, the second question is that I think you guys have not done any bolt-on acquisitions in the last 12, 18 months. Some of your peers has done so. How should we look at bolt-on acquisition for you guys over the next two or three years? Is that a \u2013 could pay a reasonable role or that you will be focusing more effort in exploration in Suriname and also that the activity level in Egypt. Thank you. John Christmann : So two really good questions, Paul. I mean the first thing I would say is as Alpine High is a nice piece of our Permian portfolio, and we look at part of the Delaware Basin. And it's one of the levers we have, the optionality to allocate capital to. We've got really three wells that we're going to be bringing on during the first quarter. And then you'll see kind of a break and then we've got five wells that will be coming on year-end. But it is something we can toggle and we'll tend to leverage that. And what you've seen us this year is given the weakness in Waha and U.S. gas, there's no reason to be bringing on incremental volumes, but it's really about prepping for the opportunity and having that optionality when you look at 2024 and beyond some of the basin bottlenecks open up. So it will be a toggle for us, and it's a place we have the optionality to invest and we plan to use this such and that's been the game plan. I think when you step back in your second question related to bolt-on acquisitions, we did do our first acquisition last year in the Delaware, a very nice tuck-in acquisition. It was one that \u2013 we're constantly in the market looking at things as is we have assets in the market. We typically wait to talk about things until there's a transaction or something to do. The tuck-in we did last year is something that's been exceeding our acquisition forecast, something we're very happy with, and it's now integrated into our Delaware package in our Delaware assets. So I think it's something you just got to monitor. I mean if you've got a handle on your current inventory. You've got a handle on costs and if there are things that we think we can add at attractive cost where we can drive incremental returns, then we're not opposed to doing that. But it's been a high bar, and that's why we've really only done one transaction over the last couple of years. And we're going to continue to drive a balanced portfolio. We are emphasizing exploration with the program we've got in Suriname, but we also do a lot of just blocking and tackling things elsewhere around the globe. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Douglas Leggate : Hi. John, good morning. Hey. Good morning, everybody. John Christmann : Good morning, Doug. Douglas Leggate : John, I've tried this couple of times in the past, but I'm going to try it again. Suriname recovery factors, given your post permeability is world-class rock, obviously, can you give us some idea of what you think that looks like? And if I may reference the more than $800 million as opposed to the $600 million, it looks like we're heading to a joint potential Sapakara, Krabdagu development, what should we think in terms of timing and scale of an FID? John Christmann : Great question, Doug. And there's a lot of work we've done, and we have a lot of confidence in what we put out, but there's also a lot of work left to do. So I will talk about give you a little bit of color on Sapakara and then I'm going to bring Dave in if he wants to add anything, you've really got two areas \u2013 you are correct. We are working towards with our partner, potentially a development hub where you would be bringing in both Krabdagu and Sapakara. They are a little different in terms of the makeup and so forth. Sapakara is predominantly one package, really, really high-quality rock when you're talking low GOR oil, 1,100 GOR oil and you're talking 1.3 to 1.5 Darcy rock, one nice blocky sand, you're going to have high recoveries. And that's really all I'll say at this point. You'd want to get into feed study and do more work before we come out with more specifics there. So some of the questions you're asking are things that will come later. And then Krabdagu is \u2013 there's three targets there. It is the incremental $200 million that you've referenced there, and we're in the process of appraising that. You've got a range of GORs there depending on the zones. And so the work we're doing to understand those and quantify those is really important to determining potential scale and scope. So all things underway. We prioritize it, which is why you've got two rigs there. And we're anxiously awaiting those as well because it's going to have an impact on scope and scale. Douglas Leggate : Thank you for that, John. I guess we're not going to get the FID timing question, but I told you I would try again. I'm torn as to whether I ask my second on Suriname as well. I think I'm going to, so let me try this. Did you find an oil water contact on the second appraisal well at Sapakara. And I guess what I'm really trying to think of is the focus, obviously, is on these two, but they're still, if I recollect, multiple years left in exploration program. How do you think about the broader risk of the basin at this point? Oil window, obviously, prospects specific risk and so on, to generally characterize it for us, is this going to be one and done? Or do you see capacity for a longer-term exploration development program in the basin? John Christmann : Well, a bunch of questions in there. So I'll try to answer all of them to the extent I can. One, Sapakara South 2 was an up dip appraisal. So I think that was important in terms of confirming what we confirm there. If you go over to Krabdagu, I'll remind you, Waha in Block 53 was a discovery of a down-dip lobe and the Krabdagu fairway. So there are multiple levels and that's part of what you're driving at. There's also a pretty good chance we're appraising updip at Krabdagu as well, which is always a good thing when you're appraising. We see a lot of potential. I mean if you look at where we are today and the area we're working, we've had great success. There is more beyond just Sapakara and Krabdagu that could also go into a potential hub. And then if you look on the outboard side of the block, you get further out, we've had a working petroleum system, and we found hydrocarbons. The trick has been trap and seal as you get out there. So I do believe we will have an ongoing program in Suriname as there is a lot of prospectivity. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with Truist. Your line is open. Neal Dingmann : Good morning, John. Thanks for the time. John, my first question, really just a broader one on shareholder return or specific to maybe capital allocation. The last couple of quarters, you all were pretty adamant about talking about maybe a minimum amount of buyback given still what I certainly agree with a cheap stock price. I'm just wondering, do you all still feel like that? I mean, you have kind of a minimum level that you think about going forward for this year or this quarter? I mean, I'm just wondering from a shareholder or buyback perspective, if you're able to frame anything up? John Christmann : No, I think we have \u2013 good question. We have great confidence in the framework we put forward. And I'll underscore, when we say on the buybacks, we'll do a minimum of 60%. As you saw last year, we were able to execute on that. We feel strongly about it today as well, and that's what you'll see us do. By nature, things are back-end loaded last year just because of the volatility in the commodity price. We were active, I think, in 10 out of 12 months on the buyback. And you'll see us taking similar approach this year. But it is definitely a minimum of 60%. That gives us ample on the additional 40 to address balance sheet. So yes, we \u2013 I'll underscore that. Neal Dingmann : No, great point. Okay. And then clearly, just a second question on domestic activity. It's been asked a little bit, but I'm just wondering, you all mentioned having the two Southern Midland Basin, the three Delaware rigs. How fluid is this? Could this change depend on prices, and I'm just \u2013 or even more activity in that newer Titus area? Just wanted for plans for remainder that maybe more second half of the year? John Christmann : Yes. I would just say we're in a really good cadence in the Southern Midland Basin, and you're seeing it in our results because we're planning pads way down the road, and it gives us time to really execute and think about how to maximize the NPV and the returns. And so that two-rig program has been a good cadence for us at Southern Midland Basin. We've got three in the Delaware, and that's where's flexibility. And you've seen from the forecast, we're shifting those more to the oil-weighted projects in the Delaware and that's the luxury we have of our portfolio today. And then we've integrated Titus in \u2013 so it's really just part of our Delaware program and it's ours. So. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Roger Read : Yes. Good morning. John Christmann : Good morning, Roger. Roger Read : Good morning. Happy to finally show up here. One quick question for you on your comments about the outlook for the agreement with Cheniere, the range of 500 to 1.25. When we look at it between the ship channel price and the European price which one do you see more sensitivity to? In other words, we see a big move in prices here or could you slump per and big moves, we expect continued volatility over in Europe, which is the waiting towards? John Christmann : It's going to be more on the global and TTF or JKM, but I'll let Ben provide any additional details. Ben Rodgers : That's right. I mean there's a lot of variables that go into it. We've seen weakness in the ship channel this year, mainly from Freeport LNG being offline and just generally milder weather. So a lot of domestic variables that are impacting the Houston Ship Channel. But to John's point, with the war in Ukraine and a milder winter over in Europe, I think it was one of the \u2013 only the second or third warmest winter that they've had over there in close to 50 years. It's just going to insert a lot of volatility there. The good thing though, as we look at it, you just kind of step back, we think it does provide very significant potential uplift to our free cash flow numbers. And we have that inherently on the oil side by selling our North Sea and Egyptian oil barrels at Brent-based pricing. And it's one of the reasons we entered into this contract in 2019 was to get access to the global gas market as well. Roger Read : Yes, it makes sense. The follow-up question I have is I understand the reason for reducing investment in gas in the near term. But as you look at your let's call it, guidance goals, expectations to deliver oil volume growth this year. What should we be paying attention to as the risk factors on that things that which I guess could cause you to come in underneath or any of the other issues, as you mentioned, kind of like well cadence, stuff like that? John Christmann : I mean it's exactly those things, Roger. But I mean we've got good confidence in the program, and it's underpinned the two onshore areas with Egypt and Permian. But it will be that very thing. It's the turn-in lines and the timing. And you're seeing that a little bit with the first quarter because we only had four wells in the U.S. Fourth quarter of last year, and they are late, one Permian, three Chalk. So a lot of that's going to be driven by the function of just what's the timing on the execution. And when you're running five rigs in the U.S., it's going to be lumpy. And then Egypt, it took us a little bit of time to kind of get our legs under us with the 17-rig program. But I mean that's going to \u2013 those are the key things to watch. But we have good confidence in our projections. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Neil Mehta : Yes. Thanks, so much. Maybe, John, the first question is around capital efficiency. The spend budget came in a little bit lower than where consensus was. So maybe you could talk about what you're seeing real time, both international and in the U.S. in terms of inflation. Have you seen any green shoots that this period of immense inflation is starting to move back into your direction? John Christmann : Yes, Neil, a good question. I would say we spend a lot of time trying to stay about a year ahead of our programs and so with our contracts and things because that gives us the visibility in terms of the spend. And so today, a lot of what you're seeing is contracts based on the back half of last year pricing. So I think it's a little premature from our perspective to be seeing any softness tied to the commodity price. I think if the price stays where it is today, that is one of the upsides of the plan as you're going to see cost structures follow. They just tend to lag but they will follow the deck. It just takes a little bit of time to play catch-up. So nothing there to really comment on in terms of green shoots or anything at this point. Neil Mehta : That's fair, John. The follow-up is the North Sea, maybe you can talk about the impact of the 75% tax rate. How it's affected your willingness to invest in the region. There was obviously the Ocean Patriot release as well. And any comments you have around tax rate broadly would be helpful? John Christmann : Yes. I would just say that it's made the North Sea less competitive relative within our portfolio. And so as we look at that still an asset that we're going to manage for cash flow and we'll get good performance there, and we're going to continue to invest in asset integrity and maintenance and all the things we need to do environmentally, safety like we always will. But longer-term incremental dollars that we have alternatives to put in other places, you're seeing us make that decision just because there's more attractive places to put that. And so it's made the North Sea less competitive on a relative basis within our portfolio. And that's why you're seeing us drop the Ocean Patriot rig later this year. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum with Cowen. Your line is now open. David Deckelbaum : Hey, John. Thanks for the time today. John Christmann : You bet. David Deckelbaum : Just wanted to ask on sort of the future expectations for Egypt growth. I know since the modernization of the PSC and the ramp up to 17 rigs now, the view was that this could be sort of a multiyear growth opportunity. I understand the beginning of this year, production obviously declines and then ramped throughout the year. It seems like a combination of till cadence, but also was curious if there's infrastructure challenges driving some of that production curve. And then what we should expect once we're 10% higher in the fourth quarter of 2023 going into 2024 and beyond there? John Christmann : No. I think you'll see a pretty robust program in Egypt. The thing you have to recognize here, we've got two factors going on. You have a big discovery that was predominantly gas and [indiscernible] that's starting to decline. And that's why you're seeing the oil growth, which is where the drilling program with the 17 rigs are focused in Egypt. So you'll see that oil mix is what's growing in Egypt as well, and that's what's underpinning that program. But it's an onshore multi-rig program. And it's a little bit different from the unconventional that you folks have gotten used to in the U.S. We're at shale and you can do pad math. But the nice thing is, this is conventional rock that flows at you pretty hard and fast and sets up smaller developments but very impactful material developments. So good confidence in the long-term curve there. We've been in Egypt since 1994, and a lot of good confidence in that. David Deckelbaum : I appreciate that, John. And just my second one, just on Suriname. It sounds like we're obviously waiting for the appraisal results from Krabdagu and the intention to potentially build out a hub there. I guess does that necessarily preclude Sapakara being developed independently? Or would you view this as you kind of need to combine both Sapakara and Krabdagu into one hub system to maximize economics and that Sapakara wouldn't necessarily support a development on its own? John Christmann : I'll just say your \u2013 both us and our partner are motivated to get the scope and scale correct from the get-go. And the larger the project, the larger the boat, the better the economics are going to be. And so there's no reason to try to get into \u2013 could you \u2013 because what we're really looking at is to how you get the scope and scale right. And that's why we're looking at trying to combine these. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with ROTH. Your line is now open. Leo Mariani : Hi, guys. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the North Sea. Obviously, you're making the decision to drop the rig here later this year. It certainly sounds like that tax rate is going to be separately high for quite a few years. Should we expect the result of that rig being dropped is it going to kind of accelerate some of the production decline? Should we expect to see kind of steady declines on asset maybe starting in 2024 and beyond? Just trying to get a sense of what the ramifications are of the less activity? John Christmann : Yes. I would just say, in general, it doesn't really change the abandonment time frames as we model that out today. And really, you look at this year, not much impact from the Ocean Patriot. It was drilling some things that are bigger impact subsea wells that take time to come into play. So it does have an impact, start to see a little bit in 2024 or 2025 and beyond, but it doesn't really drive \u2013 I mean we're still looking at early 2030s for both 40s and Barrel. And when we bought the 40s asset, I'll go back and remind you. When we bought that in 2003 from BP, it was scheduled to come out of ground in 2012. And so here we are more than a decade longer 12 \u2013 10 years, 11 years longer. And still looking at close to another decade. So there's still good productivity in life there. We're just going to manage it for cash flow and be very prudent about the future investments. Leo Mariani : That's helpful. And then just jumping over to the U.S. Just wanted to get a sense \u2013 is there anything at all planned in the Austin Chalk in 2023? I know you guys had some wells that kind of came on late last year. So if there's any update you have on that asset. And then also just to follow up on Alpine High a little bit. Do you guys really \u2013 it sounds like you're kind of viewing that as somewhat of optionality on the gas market in the next several years and then hopefully that gas market will improve. But do you guys have long-term designs on using Alpine High as a feedstock for some of these Gulf Coast LNG facilities? John Christmann : I mean the thing I would say is recognize the contract with Cheniere is a separate deal. It's a corporate level deal. We buy gas and ship channel. So it's separate and aside from what our equity gas that we produce. So we sell that in basin at Waha and prices at Waha are going to dictate what we do in basin. So that's the point to make there. In the Chalk, we brought on those three wells. Today, we don't have anything planned in terms of drilling from a working interest perspective. In the Chalk, there may be some non-op wells we participate in, where we've got some non-op interest there that others are drilling. But nothing planned in our budget this year for Chalk drilling. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Chase. Your line is now open. Arun Jayaram : Hey, good morning. John, the more recent activities in Suriname have been focused on appraisal activity with, I guess, two rigs now on location at Krabdagu. What are you and the partners' plans in terms of incremental exploration post the evaluation results of Krabdagu with the two rigs. John Christmann : There will be another exploration well drilled, Arun, and we're still working on that location between us. There are several prospects. Both teams are spending time, high grading. I mean, if you go back and look at both Awari and Bonboni and Block 58, we have working petroleum system, hydrocarbon systems out there. The main targets in both cases failed because of breach of seal. And so I'd say teams are spending time, but there is a lot more prospectivity to the outboard side, all the way back into the \u2013 where we've had great success. So working through that with our partners. And as we get in a position to drill more wells, we'll talk about those as they come onto the rig lines. Arun Jayaram : Got it. And just maybe one follow-up in the Permian. John, as I think about your 2022 program in the broader Permian including in 4Q \u2013 the company didn't place as many wells on the sales as we have thought in terms of our modeling, looking at 4Q, I think you placed one or so wells to sales \u2013 what drove that in 2022? Were you building some DUCs and just thoughts on \u2013 will that shift a little bit as we think about 2023 because you have a pretty robust production growth outlook from the\u2026 John Christmann : No, Arun, it's a great question. I mean it's really more just the lumpiness of a program. We're drilling longer laterals \u2013 and you've got two rigs in the Midland Basin. And so a lot of it is just the timing of the pads, completing the pads and then working through the completion timing. So with only two rigs, you're going to see lumpiness from us, whereas if we were running a lot more rigs and that lumpiness kind of starts to work itself out and normalize. So it's really just a function of timing on those with longer laterals. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Next question comes from the line of Jeoffrey Lambujon with Tudor Pickering. Your line is open. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Hey, good morning everyone. Appreciate you all taking my questions. John Christmann : You bet, Jeff. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a couple of here follow-ups on Egypt. Obviously, some solid execution there, especially relative to earlier in 2022, as you highlighted, that's showing up and production results as we all saw. So as you think about the 2023 guide. I was hoping you could speak to how you're thinking about the level of conservatism or risking that might be baked in there as you think about the oil growth exit to exit. And what kind of running room you might see from here on operations and efficiencies as you move through the year? And we're focusing on in terms of tracking execution from beyond the 2023 program? John Christmann : Well, I mean, Jeff, a question. We obviously try to guide to what we believe are numbers with high confidence that we can hit, and we spend a lot of time on that. I do believe there are things at times that \u2013 the nice thing about Egypt is there is ability to \u2013 with success to bring other things on and get other wells drilled and high grade that schedule as you're moving through the year. But I think we've given a very realistic and good guides for 2023. And I think there's good confidence from the team. I know I sure asked that question and the response I get the response that I'm comfortable to relay. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Okay. Great. And then I guess just on operations and efficiencies, again, obviously improved quite a bit as you move to 2022. Just want to get a sense for what you're focusing on from that perspective and what kind of running room you might see for improvements from here? John Christmann : Yes. It's all about operational excellence and continuing to try to improve and learn from things as you go. In Egypt, we're drilling in some new areas with the seismic and some of the exploration that we're doing there. And so within those areas, we should see improvement as we drill more wells and things \u2013 areas you've drilled before. So you're seeing some of that. And the big thing is across the entire organization, across the asset teams across the functions, everybody is really trying to take all that they integrate it and get better. I mean it's about continuous improvement and execution excellence. And you saw great progress on the safety front. We're going to continue that and continue to focus on the operations. Paying attention to details. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to hand the conference back over to Mr. John Christmann for closing remarks. John Christmann : Yes. Thank you. And before closing today's call, I want to leave you with the following thoughts. First, I want to recognize our entire team for their hard work and dedication to safety, operational excellence and environmental stewardship. APA remains committed to financial and operational discipline. We are focused on leveraging the portfolio to invest in the highest return projects. While activity cadence will impact our first quarter, we are confident in our growth outlook for 2023. Lastly, in Suriname, the JV has accelerated appraisal at Krabdagu, and we look forward to keeping you informed of our progress. I will turn the call back to the operator. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Gary Clark : Good morning, and thank you for joining us on APA Corporation's First Quarter 2023 Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John Christmann. Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results and outlook. Also on the call and available to answer questions are Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President of Development; Tracey Henderson, Executive Vice President of Exploration; and Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations.  Our prepared remarks will be approximately 12 minutes in length with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our first quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apacorp.com.  Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude noncontrolling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels.  I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John. John Christmann : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, we will review our first quarter highlights, update our operational progress and comment on our outlook for the remainder of the year. For the last several years, we have been navigating a volatile price environment, and this has been amplified recently with the ups and downs of global oil prices, extreme moves in global LNG pricing and the rapid decline in U.S. natural gas prices. Despite this volatility, we are constructive on long-term prices for oil, natural gas and LNG.  Based on this fundamental belief, we plan to invest over the long term for sustainable low single-digit production growth at attractive returns. That said, we cannot ignore price volatility and will, therefore, seek to moderate our investment plans during periods of significant price weakness. We must also be responsive to changing governmental tax and regulatory regimes within our countries of operations. Fortunately, our diversified portfolio provides us optionality, and we maintain the flexibility to adjust our investment plans relatively quickly.  In 2023, we have demonstrated this by reducing natural gas directed activity and even curtailing production in response to extreme Waha price dislocations. We also made the decision to reduce spending in the North Sea as the recently enacted energy profits levy has resulted in less competitive return opportunities than in the U.S. and Egypt. So while you should generally expect us to invest at a steady pace for long-term returns and moderate growth, you will also see periods where we respond to external influences by adjusting or redirecting capital activity.  Turning now to our first quarter results, which are characterized by strong operational performance and good cost control. APA met or exceeded production guidance in each of our 3 regions. Total adjusted production was 4,000 BOEs per day, above the top end of our guidance range. Adjusted oil production also exceeded expectations, led by performance in the Permian and the North Sea. Capital investment during the period was slightly below guidance, and our average operating drilling rig count remained steady in the quarter with 17 in Egypt, 5 in the Permian Basin and 1 semisubmersible in the North Sea.  In the U.S., we connected 17 new wells, and as planned, most of these went online in the back half of the quarter. While timing of well connections can drive production variances, on a quarter-to-quarter basis, we are continuing to see significant benefits from the steady pace of our drilling program.  As expected, first quarter oil production declined sequentially from the fourth quarter. However, we remain on track to deliver a significant uptick in the second and third quarters. Permian activity this year will be concentrated primarily on oil development in the Southern Midland Basin and oil-weighted development in the Delaware Basin. At Alpine High, we are currently testing a new 3-well pad at a constrained rate.  Beyond this, we are ramping down our planed 2023 lean gas drilling activity in the Permian due to the prevailing weakness in Waha natural gas prices. This will result in an upstream capital reduction of approximately $100 million but should have no material impact on our full year U.S. production guidance. We are pleased with the results at Alpine High and will return when Waha prices improve.  In Egypt, gross oil production increased by approximately 1,200 barrels per day compared to the fourth quarter. New well connections, recompletion activity and exploration success were all consistent with our expectations, and we are beginning to see positive contribution from our higher activity pace. For the second quarter, however, we are forecasting that Egypt gross volumes will be roughly unchanged as we have recently experienced some production disruptions, most of which are temporary. Despite this, our full year Egypt production guidance has not changed. Turning now to the North Sea. Our production exceeded expectations in the first quarter, driven by strong facility operating efficiency. We are projecting second quarter average daily production will be in line to slightly below the first quarter as scheduled platform maintenance and expected return to more normalized facility operating efficiency will be mostly offset by contribution from a new well, which was placed online in late March.  In Suriname, we continue to progress toward an oil hub development project with activity in the first half of 2023 focused on appraising Krabdagu. We have completed the flow test on the first appraisal well and are currently in the pressure buildup phase. Results of this well thus far are in line with expectations. The second Krabdagu appraisal well is currently drilling and we'll provide more information on next steps in the future.  On the ESG front, we delivered another excellent quarter of safety performance and are making good progress toward our longer-term emissions goal of implementing projects to eliminate 1 million tons of CO2 equivalent emissions by year-end 2024. We reduced routine upstream flaring in Egypt by 40% last year, which gave us an excellent start on this goal. In 2023, we plan to further reduce flaring in Egypt and focus on converting diesel combustion for power generation to field gas, which will reduce both cost and net emissions. In closing, APA has the portfolio and the operational flexibility to respond quickly to near-term commodity price volatility, and we are managing our capital activity accordingly. We remain committed to returning a minimum of 60% of our free cash flow to shareholders this year via dividends and share repurchases.  Longer term, despite many cross currents, we believe the investment case for APA and the E&P industry is strong, and the outlook for hydrocarbon prices and fundamentals is very constructive.  And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney. Stephen Riney : Thanks, John. For the first quarter, under generally accepted accounting principles, APA reported consolidated net income of $242 million or $0.78 per diluted common share. As usual, these results include items that are outside of core earnings. The most significant of these items was a $174 million charge related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax liability in the U.K. caused by the most recent increase in the energy profits levy. This was partially offset by the release of a valuation allowance on U.S. deferred tax assets.  Excluding these and other smaller items, adjusted net income for the first quarter was $372 million or $1.19 per diluted common share. Free cash flow, as we define it, which excludes changes in working capital, was $272 million in the quarter, 81% of which we returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  As John noted, it was a strong quarter for production, and costs were a good bit under plan. G&A expense was $65 million, significantly below both the prior quarter and the same quarter last year. This is a result of APA's lower stock price at quarter end and the mark-to-market impact on previously accrued share-based compensation. Excluding this mark-to-market impact, underlying quarterly G&A costs remained stable at roughly $100 million. LOE also came in a good bit below expectations primarily due to the previously mentioned mark-to-market impact of stock-based compensation programs as well as foreign currency impacts in Egypt.  Switching to forward-looking guidance items. In the U.S., oil production growth is expected to return in the second quarter and should ramp further in the third quarter in conjunction with completion cadence. Our U.S. natural gas production outlook is more muted as we are responding to weak Waha pricing with lean gas drilling reductions.  In addition, we could see further lean gas production curtailments. But to be clear, further curtailments are not contemplated in our U.S. production guidance. All of this is consistent with our bias towards managing for cash flow and long-term returns, not production growth. The $100 million reduced drilling activity John noted will occur mostly in the second half of this year. With that, our full year capital budget has been reduced to $1.9 billion to $2 billion.  Next, I would like to highlight our 2 material gas trading activities that are truly differential for APA, our gas transport obligations and our Cheniere gas supply contract. Our gas transport contracts provide significant cash flow benefits during periods of dislocated Permian gas prices. We hold just over 670 million cubic feet per day of Permian Basin takeaway capacity.  We purchased third-party gas in-basin for resale on the Gulf Coast, realizing a trading margin whenever the price differentials are greater than the transport cost. In the first quarter, this activity generated a net profit of $23 million. Based on current strip prices, we have increased our full year guidance for net profit from such activity to $100 million.  The Cheniere agreement, which will commence on August 1, is another important commercial trading activity. This arrangement provides upside exposure to world LNG margins over Houston Ship Channel on 140 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. For 2023, projected cash flow from this contract has come down a bit from our prior guidance due to the decline in European and Asian LNG prices. Over the past few months, we have provided potential outcomes of annualized free cash flows at different price levels related to this contract. You can find those in the appendix of our financial and operational supplement.  At current strip prices, the Cheniere contract will generate and expected $175 million of free cash flow for the last 5 months of 2023. All of our guidance for both the second quarter and updated full year 2023 and can be found in our financial and operational supplement.  One final item I'd draw your attention to. Looking at the balance sheet, you will notice that our revolver debt increased by a little over $400 million in the first quarter. This was driven by an approximate $500 million increase in working capital primarily due to the paydown of accrued liabilities from December 31, but it also includes increasing accounts receivable in Egypt. Overall, we had a very good quarter to start the year. We're benefiting from relatively stable activity levels within a portfolio that allows us to generate free cash flow and invest in the long-term sustainability of our business. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from John Freeman of Raymond James. John Freeman : I believe the original plan was after the 3-well pad gap brought on in Alpine High in the first quarter, there was going to be those kind of a break and then there was going to be 5 additional wells that we're going to come out at the end of the year. So is the $100 million reduction in the budget basically just coming from the removal of those 5 Alpine High wells? Or is there more to it? David Pursell : Yes, John. This is Dave Pursell. We may have had more than 5 wells planned for the middle of the year. But if you're trying to -- there's some moving parts in the Permian budget, but the effect is, yes, the net $100 million is essentially all the Alpine drilling, completion and facilities capital rounds up to $100 million. John Freeman : Perfect. And then just my follow-up question. I know at some point, there was some discussions about kind of following the release of the Ocean Patriot next month that there was going to be some use of that kind of freed up comp or it might have been to add an additional rig in the Permian. I'm just -- I guess, first of all, is that -- would that be the case? If you were going to increase activity anywhere in the portfolio, is that likely where it would go? And sort of what commodity environment would you likely need to see to potentially add another rig in the Permian at some point in the future? John Christmann : Well, John, I mean, we did add some more weighted drilling in the Permian with that. That was contemplated. And then you're seeing us drop some of the gas weighted drilling at Alpine. So two effects there. Operator : Our next Question. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate, Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Sorry, guys, can you hear me now? John Christmann : Can be. Doug Leggate : All right. Sorry about that. I'm sitting in an airport. I have my new boss in on. I apologize, John. My first question is for Steve, actually. Steve, I wonder if you could just elaborate a little bit on your comments about the increase in receivables in Egypt. There's obviously, I think, some concern events over there, the devaluation and so on might have an impact on your ability to get cash out of the country. So I'm just going to hit that right upfront and ask if you can walk us through what you're seeing currently and whether that working capital build is in fact reversible. Stephen Riney : Yes, Doug, let me just start with the working capital level, and we'll work into the Egypt receivables impact on working capital. So we -- I said in my prepared remarks that we've got about a $500 million increase in working capital in the first quarter, $300 million of that was a decrease in accrued compensation and benefits. So as you might imagine, through the year, we accrue primarily incentive compensation, both short term and long term. And we accrue that through the year. We do that every year, and then we pay it off in the first quarter of the following year. And so that's exactly what happened.  That was a -- we do that every year. It was a little bit larger going from the end '22 accrued liability to what was paid off in 2023 because of the performance, number one, but also because of the share price because it does include the long-term incentive comp, which is share price-based. And because of -- it's a 3 years of programs and because the share price had improved over those years, that raised the cost of that.  So that's $300 million of the $500 million. There was another $100 million decrease in general accounts payable, stuff for operating expense and capital expenditures, things like that. And so that's $400 million out of the $500 million increase in working capital. And all of those things are very common as we go from fourth quarter of 1 year to the first quarter of the next.  Now there were a number of other small, mostly kind of $50 million and smaller items moving in and out of working capital. And that includes a $50 million increase in accounts receivable. And again, I've provided this in my prepared remarks. Just to be completely transparent with folks because I know there's probably some amount of concern over what's going on in Egypt. So in the spirit of transparency, I indicated that accounts receivable in Egypt had increased $180 million.  If you look at our supplement, you'll see a working capital increase for Egypt of $224 million. That includes a number of other things like inventory and stuff like that. So $180 million in Egypt. And I don't know, John, you want to kind of [indiscernible] on Egypt? John Christmann : On Egypt, just a couple of minutes here, Doug. One, we've been in the country for more than -- almost 30 years and we've partnered with Egypt and EGPC and the highest levels of government the whole time. I'd say over that time period, Egypt has been through a number of challenges and successful reforms. The best thing that we can do to help Egypt and our stakeholders is to deliver oil production growth. And that's what we're doing while reducing our emissions. Egypt, like many other places in the world today, is going through a challenging economic time with inflation. This does have some flow-through to us, but not anything that we haven't had to work through in the past. And in fact, there's been more difficult times in the past. Specifically, they are dealing with the after effects of a currency devaluation in January, and we are currently helping our Egyptian National employees through this as we have also done in the past.  We maintain very deep and long-standing relationships with our Egyptian stakeholders, both at EGPC and within the government at the highest levels, I'll say. And we are confident that they will work through this. And we are also having very constructive conversations on how to address the receivables over time currently. So we feel good and a long track record here. Stephen Riney : Yes. And Doug, if I could just kind of add to John's comments there a bit. So we are -- it did go up $180 million in the first quarter. And I'd say that the receivables we have from Egypt are higher than historical averages, no doubt. Some of that is price and some of it is the delay in payment. But I'd just comment that, as John talked about the 30 years of history, we've been in this position several times. This level of receivables from Egypt is not unprecedented. It's never a good time to have this happen, obviously. But I would say it's not overly concerning at this point. Egypt's credit rating has been pretty stable since it got upgraded in 2015. We watch the situation extremely closely. And as John said, we're in active conversations about this specific issue, and we're doing that at the very highest levels in the country. So we feel confident about this. Doug Leggate : Just to be clear, guys, always that balance you talked about in receivables. Are you able to get cash out of the country? Or was that an accumulation of -- basically because it's the highest free cash flowing asset in your portfolio currently? Is this -- are you able to get cash out of the country currently? Stephen Riney : Yes. We are still able to get cash out of the country. That's not the problem. Doug Leggate : Okay. My follow-up is, John, there are a few teasers in the deck about the status of Suriname moving towards potential hub development, I think it was the expression -- and you said you've got the results of at least the first appraisal well at Krabdagu. I wonder if I could ask a question like this. You said the result is in line with expectations. So what were the expectations? And what would you need to move forward by way of resource upside to the more than 800 that you identified in the deck today? John Christmann : I would just say, Doug, we're still getting results from Krabdagu. We're in the buildup phase. To put things in perspective, I won't -- I'm not going to give you a predrill expectations, but the well was in line. But I will remind you that the Krabdagu 2 is 4.9 kilometers from the discovery well. So -- and Krabdagu 3 is 10.3 kilometers from the discovery well. So when you look at that map, sometimes you forget just how large of an area that is. And obviously, we're very pleased with the early data and the results we have from the appraisal well. But you know our history has been able to come back with connected volumes, and we're not ready to do that yet because we're still collecting pressure data. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Brackett at Bernstein Research. Robert Brackett : I'll stick on the Egypt topic. One is just to refresh my memory that in Egypt, natural gas flows domestically sort of toward the Cairo Basin area, whereas oil tends to flow north and you export it and capture those revenues. Am I remembering that correctly? . John Christmann : Yes. Robert Brackett : Okay. The follow-up would be, you mentioned that to expect Egypt to be flattish 2Q versus 1Q. You mentioned production disruptions, some of which are temporary. Am I being too much of a lawyer to suggest that some of those are not temporary? And could you maybe give some color in terms of the cadence of getting oilier through the year? You've guided 60% oil for Q1 rising towards 64% for a full year average? John Christmann : Yes. Bob, I'd say the first thing is, you know we've got a very large asset base area that stretches really from Cairo, almost to be. And we've got a number of fields, and I'll let Dave walk through some of the temporary things and then another minor issue. David Pursell : Yes. So counselor, when we think about this, -- the capital program is performing as expected. So new wells and recompletes, those are on track. We've had slightly lower base production. So a series of things, and we'll highlight a couple of the big ones. We have an unplanned downtime at a gas plant, which will impact condensate production. We've had some ESP failures on some of our larger oil producers. Those are the temporary issues -- we've done some injection conversions taking producers to waterflood injection and that takes some time to see the oil production benefit from those. And then one of our mature fields, our field experienced an increase in water cut late first quarter. And put that in perspective, it's a 3,000 barrel a day field that's now producing close to 1,000 barrels a day. So it's not a big producer, but on the margin, that loss of 2,000 barrels a day impacted second quarter. It actually had a slight impact on the first quarter as well. So when we look at the second quarter, we just felt like given those events, it was probably appropriate to guide conservatively flat I'll tell you, the team is expecting to beat that. So we'll see, but we want to guide conservatively and we'll see as we go through the quarter some of the temporary issues will get back. I think it's important to highlight given the pace of new well drills, the quality of those wells, the recompletes, we remain confident in our ability to grow production in the back half of the year. So no change to guidance for '23. Operator : Our next question comes from Charles Meade at Johnson Rice. Charles Meade : John, I wondered if we could talk a little bit about the time line for these -- the Krabdagu appraisal wells. And maybe I was -- maybe I was off on the wrong track, but I thought we were going to get the -- some of these appraisal results a little earlier. But I found myself wondering maybe these wells, you've designed them to be eventual producers, and so they took longer to drill. So could you comment on, I guess, both of those things, what the time line is and whether the current time line is -- fits with what you expected and whether these are going to be producers and when you think you'll be in a position to share that connected volume investment. John Christmann : Yes, Charles, I don't know where you got any ideas on time line because it wouldn't have been from us, but just because Total is operating. I would say the Krabdagu 2 moved on pretty much as expected. We're just in a period now where we're gaining data through the buildup. And so that is the most important information in terms of connected volumes. I will say the Krabdagu 3 well is running a little behind, but that also was a brand-new rig that was brought in the basin. And so there's been some fits and starts on the drilling of the third well. So I wouldn't read too much into that other than it just is taking a little longer than anticipated. Charles Meade : Okay. And then going back to U.S. onshore in natural gas specifically, I want to commend to you guys before turning the dial back on that. It's -- I know it may be -- sometimes seems easier to do from seats like mine than the actual reality ever for you guys. But if we -- to your comments about being bullish on the longer-term outlook for natural gas, what -- can you give us a sense of what kind of price or what -- or how long at a certain price you would need to see natural gas before you would want to turn the dial back up on U.S. lean gas activity? John Christmann : As we said in the prepared remarks, we're seeing good results on the program there. There's no reason to invest the capital today into this price environment. And so I think we want to see the infrastructure kind of get resolving it through this and feel like we're in a good place because we're making long-term investment decisions here. I'm very pleased with the results but we want a clear pathway on a more constructive price environment for gas. Stephen Riney : Yes. And -- if I can just remind people also, John, we sell all of our gas produced in the Permian Basin in the Permian Basin. And so we're getting Waha or El Paso Permian prices for that gas. And we have our transport obligations to the Gulf Coast, but we buy gas and sell that on the Gulf Coast. We make that margin regardless of whether we produce a molecule of gas in the Permian or not. So everything has to be evaluated on the basis of we're selling this at Waha, not at the Gulf Coast. Charles Meade : Right. But no -- nothing you're prepared to share about what Waha needs to be for some duration before you decide to put dollars back there? Stephen Riney : Well, I think the simple thing would be to say that Waha has to be attractive enough to compete with more oil drilling right next door. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Cheng at Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Gentlemen, can we go back into Permian? It seems that you're going to maintain 5 rigs and you're not going to do additional well in Alpine High. Should we assume in the second half, the number of wells you're going to bring on in the Permian is going to be higher than what you previously assumed? I think previously, based on your fourth quarter presentation, it looks like we may be talking about 22 wells in the third quarter and 10 wells in the fall. Should we assume it's going to be higher? Also then, in the second quarter, with 21 well, we thought the production will be higher than what you saw here. Is it the timing of the well coming on stream? Is winning in the -- in the quarter? John Christmann : Yes, Paul, I'll let Dave jump in. But it is timing. We said most of the wells came on late in the first quarter in the Permian. And then effectively, your well counts are going to be pretty similar because we're dropping the gas-weighted drilling in the Permian, and we're adding some oil weighting. So it shouldn't have a big impact on the numbers, I wouldn't believe. But Dave, I'll let you... David Pursell : Yes. In calendar year '23, it won't have a big number. The numbers we're looking at are a little bit higher than what you have, Paul, but not materially. And I think when you look at the 21 wells in the second quarter, they're big pads, and those pads come online. The Delaware pad, for example, is 11 wells on our Titus acquisition. And so we'll be bringing that online. It will come on at pace, but back-end weighted towards the end of the quarter, not the beginning. Paul Cheng : Okay. And on the second question, the gross production for Egypt, can you just remind us then what is your full year expectation now? And also over the next several years, what kind of budget and what kind of growth rate that you have in mind on the gross production for that? David Pursell : Yes. Paul, we had talked about 10% exit to exit on gross in Egypt, and the goal would be to, in the next couple of years, think about something in that range. Paul Cheng : And what's the risk -- what's the biggest risk that you will not be able to achieve that for this year? David Pursell : For this year? Paul Cheng : Yes. certainly the first quarter second quarter is definitely, I suppose that is below what you've been looking at. And so you need to step up. And some of the challenge seems it's going to totally go away. So I mean, how big is the cushion when you're talking about 10% year-over-year exit rate? David Pursell : Yes. I think for us, Paul, we have pretty good visibility on -- we have really good visibility on the program, and that program consists of new well drilling as well as recompletions. And both of those have a significant impact on the ability to grow production. So we have -- again, we still have confidence in our ability to hit that growth rate. Paul Cheng : And do you have a budget that you can share for the next several years, we need to related to Egypt to achieve that plan? David Pursell : We haven't shared that yet, Paul. Operator : Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann at Truist Securities. Neal Dingmann : John, my first question is on capital discipline, specifically. Really just in broad strokes, wondering how you all think about managed [indiscernible]. Is this more to insure you're generating sort of a cash flow in a bottle tape like we're in? Or do you think more about -- maybe ensure that you do not complete any wells that won't be high return threshold? John Christmann : I mean you're cutting out a little bit on the question. So I didn't -- I think I -- it's about capital discipline. I'd say, I think, in general we feel good about where we are. Most of our capital costs are under contract. So it's about cost control and execution. We've made some choices to move some things around and you're seeing the impacts of those. And that's some of the flexibility of the portfolio. But everything is within line and really, we don't plan to drill wells that we wouldn't want to complete. And that's why you see us kind of curtailing the drilling in the gas-weighted programs in the U.S. Neal Dingmann : Great details. And then my second, just on OFS inflation. We've heard a number of people talk about domestic softness. Just wondering if you've seen the something some of your international areas. John Christmann : I would just say it's early, right? Everything is still under contract. I think where you'd start to see that as we start looking at, thinking about the '24 pricing and so forth, as you start pricing that in towards the middle of the year into next year. But right now, as you know, the cost structure always lags. And so we haven't seen any real direct softness today. Operator : Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram at JPMorgan Securities. Arun Jayaram : Maybe, Steve, I want to ask you a little bit about the working capital build in the quarter in Egypt in the U.S. and just thoughts on the drivers of that. And would you expect that to reverse in 2Q over the balance of the year? Stephen Riney : Yes. Arun. Yes, as I've indicated earlier, there was a $500 million working capital increase. $300 million of that was because of a paydown of accrued compensation obligations that were accrued through the 2022 calendar year, and $100 million of that was due to the paydown of other payables, other accounts payable. And then there were a bunch of other small items, ups and downs, that amounted to the full $500 million. And I did indicate that buried within that was the $180 million increase in Egypt accounts receivable. I think that most of that is going to reverse during 2023.  As every quarter, we accrue the incentive compensation that will be payable at the -- in the first quarter of the following year. So a lot of that's just going to reaccrue as we go through calendar year 2023. Arun Jayaram : Great. And just my follow-up, maybe for David. David, in order to hit, call it, the midpoint of the full year oil guide, the business would have to average oil production in the upper 160s for the back half of the year. Just -- it sounds like your 2Q guide is a little conservative. But maybe if you could help us walk through and give us comfort on hitting those levels because the midpoint is 159 for oil. David Pursell : Are we -- we're talking Egypt gross? Arun Jayaram : No, just full year oil or the component. David Pursell : Yes. So I think there's a -- if you -- without getting into the granularity of each asset, we feel confident in the ability to hit the Egypt exit to exit. The U.S. is going to grow. We have 21 wells coming online in the second quarter. We have more than that in the third quarter. A fair number of the wells that were brought online in the first quarter were 3 milers that were brought on towards the end of the quarter. So we feel good about the U.S. ability to execute. And then on the North Sea, which is kind of because of the EPL, everyone's kind of forgot about that, but we're actually having a pretty good operating success so far this year in the North Sea, both with platform operating efficiency. But we also brought on a really nice well at the end of the first quarter, and we have another well to store. It's the last subsea well that the Ocean Patriot drilled. It will be online here relatively quickly. That's going to be a little bit higher gas mix, which in the North Sea is not a bad thing right now. So we feel really comfortable with our ability to hit the portfolio growth targets. Operator : Our next question comes from Leo Mariani at Ross MKM. Leo Mariani : Just a question here on Suriname. Obviously, you guys are still going through the appraisal process at Krabdagu, but perspective [indiscernible] oil there, if you look at it in the radio and what you've already done appraisal wise at [indiscernible] are kind of enough to move forward with the development of a nice pool of oil here? John Christmann : Yes, you're cutting out for most of your questions. So I think it's -- do we have enough. And I think the answer is, as we've said all along with Krabdagu, we're looking at an oil hub, which incorporates both Sapakara and Krabdagu. And the thing we've been focused on is a scope and scale right. So at this point, it's all I'll say the connected original in place. We put in the documents this morning does not include the appraisal work from Krabdagu yet. So we're making good progress. Leo Mariani : Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the U.S. side, Alpine High, you got 3 wells. You kind of mentioned that you're pleased with the progress. I was hoping to maybe get little more color on those 3 wells in terms of maybe how long you've been flow testing? And then I guess, is there any update on the Austin Chalk for APA? John Christmann : At this point, no update on the Chalk. And on the Alpine wells, we're flowing them back at constrained rates, but we're very pleased with the deliverability and the early results. Operator : Our next question comes from Roger Read at Wells Fargo Securities. Roger Read : Yes. I guess maybe follow up a little bit on some of the oilfield inflation, deflation issues and broaden it beyond the U.S. to take a look at what the currency issues might portend for the cost structure in Egypt. Or does that not matter given the overall structure of the contract there in terms of the net barrel performance? John Christmann : Well, number one, there's not a lot of competition for rigs or services in Egypt, right? So we've seen pretty stable cost with the devaluation that's actually helped cost structure now. But as I said earlier, we are assisting our nationals and doing some things to help with the inflation. Roger Read : So you wouldn't expect a net reduction given like you said, kind of devaluation issues. John Christmann : No, not big. Not big. Roger Read : Okay. And then in the U.S., you mentioned obviously contract structure in place. But I was just curious, are you looking at indexed contracts? When is the next time we should see any potential for an inflection up or down in terms of the next contract rollover as we think about the rigs and the services? John Christmann : We kind of keep a portfolio where some are on long term, some are on short and some are multiyear. And so it's a constant process of rejigging those, and that's kind of underway now and will continue. But it's not going to have a near-term material impact on our current cost structure of this year's capital program. So it will really start to show up in the $24 next year. Operator : Our next question comes from David Deckelbaum at TD Cowen. David Deckelbaum : I just wanted to follow up a little bit on just Alpine High. The decision, obviously, to reduce activity there makes sense in light of commodity pricing. But as we think about fulfilling contracts like the Cheniere contract and others, are you content to just fill with third-party gas? Or is there a certain level of organic gas that you'd like to maintain out of Alpine High as you get into '24? Stephen Riney : No. For quite some time, our is that every molecule of gas we produce in the Permian Basin is sold in the Permian Basin, and our trading organization will take care of both the long-haul transport obligations through purchasing and selling gas, and we'll also take care of the Cheniere contract with purchased gas. David Deckelbaum : Got it. And then maybe if I could just wrap up on Suriname. I guess as we think about moving towards an investment decision, do you anticipate that we'll have enough data points, just given some of the Krabdagu delineation and appraisal work in combination with we already know at Sapakara to reach a decision this year. Is that in line with your internal thinking? John Christmann : I would just say we're waiting to see results, right? I mean we're making good progress. As I've said a number of times, we're kind of focused on potential scope and scale of what that first project would look like as there's an incentive for everybody to size upwardly. But we'll know when we get there. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin MacCurdy at Pickering Energy Partners. Unidentified Analyst : There's been much discussion in this earnings season about potential deflation on shale well costs, but I'm curious what you're seeing on the international side. Outside of the increased receivables, what is your view on raw materials and services in Egypt and the North Sea? And how is that trending relative to last year? John Christmann : Well, in general, we -- like I said a few minutes ago, we don't have a lot of competition for services in Egypt. So it really kind of goes with the commodity fuels up, for the most part, chemicals. In the North Sea, we're going to be popping the Ocean Patriot. So if anything, capital spending is dropping there, but nothing major, nothing surprising in the way of the international service side. David Deckelbaum : Great. And congratulations on reducing your 2023 CapEx budget. Kind of going back to the Ocean Patriot rig, are the savings from dropping that rig already built into your updated budget you released yesterday? Or have those savings effectively been redirected to the Permian? John Christmann : They were in the plant from early on them because we plan to drop that rig midyear at the start of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Neil Mehta at Goldman Sachs & Co. Neil Mehta : John, as you started off in your remarks, there's a lot of uncertainty in the near term as it relates to the commodity price and the global economy. And so I'd love your perspective on how you as an organization are building downside resilience if there is a harder landing. And what are the lessons learned from experiences in 2015 and 2020 that you can carry forward?  And one of the things that I think you guys have made terrific progress on since COVID has been really cleaning up the balance sheet and taking out $3 billion worth of debt. So maybe you could speak to where you are in that route. John Christmann : Well, I'll say a few comments and I'll let Steve jump in on the balance sheet. But I'd say, first and foremost, the best flexibility you have is being able to reduce your activity. And you've seen us do that with the lean gas drilling in the U.S. You've seen us do that in the North Sea. So when it's time to stop investing, you need to stop investing. And those are the lessons we've learned. Stay focused on cost and maintain that flexibility to invest in the projects that are going to continue to generate the long-term returns. Stephen Riney : Yes. I'd just add that in the last two -- quarter years, we've reduced debt by $3.2 billion while also buying back $2.4 billion worth of equity. The biggest thing, I think we accomplished in the bond reduction, the debt reduction flows in the near term. And in the near-term maturities, we've got 30% of our bond debt matures here in the next -- well, between now and 2030. And only around $350 million of that matures in the next 5 years. So we don't have much of a runway to worry about.  And then 70% of our debt is 2037 and beyond. We've got some -- we've got a really good profile for debt maturities as well. And then the last thing I would add is cost management. John talked about the ability to reduce the capital budget, but we've been very disciplined on managing our cost structure as well. Keeping that low helps certainly build resiliency. Neil Mehta : Can you remind us where you are in terms of getting to investment grade with all the agencies? And given what you've done with the balance sheet, I feel like you're getting close [indiscernible]. So any perspective on Stephen Riney : Yes. Maybe you could kind of help us next time we go talk to the rating agencies, but appreciate that. But we feel like -- well, we talked to the rating agencies at least twice a year. We are investment grade with Fitch now, and we're on positive outlook for an increase to investment grade with S&P and Moody's. We have talked to them recently. We'll see what happens. I think we -- as you've kind of alluded to there, I think we are due for an upgrade. Hopefully, that comes in 2023. And I think we trade -- I mean we benchmarked very well compared to some of our peers that are already investment grade. So I think we are due for that. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeoffrey Lambujon at TPH & Co. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Maybe a few on the Permian ex Alpine High. First one is just on what your outlook is for productivity out of your Midland and Delaware this year just relative to the last few years and relative to internal expectations for what's left on inventory and then what aspects of the program operationally you're spending the most time on today from a design perspective. I think you noted the 3 milers earlier, I'd be curious on how you think about the mix of those in the program over time and how much inventory that might apply to and, again, if you're thinking about any other areas we're spending time on. David Pursell : Yes. So Jeffrey, good questions. This is Dave. On the 3 miler question first, we tend to like to drill 3 milers where the acreage is set up for that. It's very capital efficient. We've been able to execute those really well, both on the drilling and the completion. So where it's possible, we'll do that. But I think you should think about the majority of our portfolio or 2-mile laterals. So the typical well is going to be a 2-miler. On productivity, we continue to -- the team's work and study and try to squeeze out productivity gains on every pad we get on -- and we continue to have pretty good results with that.  So we're -- I don't know how you think about that externally if we've got some -- a pretty good process in place and feel comfortable with it. We've got a good methodical pace of drilling and completions and are pleased with that pace at this point. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Great, Dave. My next one is just on the sustainability of that productivity that you're seeing today, you could frame inventory depth as you look at the Midland and Delaware individually if we just kind of assume maybe the current pace for starters on an annual basis. And then I'd also be interested in how to think about steady state quarterly run rate activity as we think about next year, just given the shape of the program this year that was referenced earlier in the Q&A with that dynamic of Q3 completion count in the low 20s and Q4 going into the low teens or a little bit lower exiting the year. David Pursell : Yes. So inventory, we've consistently said we've got line of sight kind of through the end of the decade. And we keep adding things to it. And that number will move around over time. At the current cadence, I think you could look at the second and third quarter activity pace and roll that through into '24, but we haven't really given guidance yet on '24 on what the capital program and activity would look like. We're assuming that we kind of hold serve on productivity gains. But again, the aspiration is to continue to squeeze more out of each completion. Operator : I would now like to turn it back to John Christmann for closing remarks. John Christmann : Thank you. Before closing the call, I want to leave you with the following thoughts. First, our asset teams are executing well. Safety performance continues to be good, and contributions from our drilling programs are strong. We are managing the portfolio to optimize returns and near-term cash flow and keenly focused on cost control. Second, we continue to make good progress on our appraisal program in Suriname and look forward to sharing more information in the future.  Lastly, we remain committed to returning at least 60% of annual free cash flow to investors through dividends and buybacks and believe our stock is a compelling investment. We plan to participate in a number of investor events over the next 2 months and look forward to seeing you. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",

After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. The floor is your sir. Gary Clark : Good morning and thank you for joining us on APA Corporation\u2019s Second Quarter 2023 financial and operational results conference call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John Christmann. Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results and outlook. Also on the call and available to answer questions are Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President of Development; Tracey Henderson, Executive Vice President of Exploration; and Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations. Our prepared remarks will be less than 15 minutes in length, with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday\u2019s press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apacorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures today. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today\u2019s call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. I\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John. John Christmann : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, we will review second quarter highlights and discuss our outlook for the rest of the year. APA delivered strong results and made notable progress on a number of fronts during the quarter, most specifically with regard to drilling and completion efficiencies in the US and Egypt. A reduction in year-over-year per unit LOE and G&A costs, working capital improvements in Egypt and the appraisal of Krabdagu in Suriname. We also delivered on our production goals with total adjusted production of 325,000 BOE per day coming in at the high-end of our guidance range. This was driven by good Permian Basin in Egypt oil performance, partially offset by price-related dry gas curtailments in the Permian and unscheduled compressor downtime in the North Sea. Total adjusted oil production of 154,000 barrels per day exceeded our guidance by 4,000 barrels per day, driven mostly by the US. Capital investment during the period was in line with guidance as our average operated drilling rig count remained steady at 17% in Egypt, five in the Permian Basin and one semisubmersible in the North Sea. As previously planned, we released the Ocean Patriot in the North Sea at the end of June. US oil production increased by 6% compared to the first quarter and we are projecting a similar percentage increase in the third quarter. Our steady drilling program in the Permian is delivering substantial efficiencies and oil production increases, which we expect will continue, though the timing and size of pad completions can result in a lumpy production profile. APA's Permian rig activity is directed towards oil development in the Southern Midland Basin, where we currently have two rigs operating and oil-weighted development in the Delaware Basin, where we currently have three rigs operating. As we noted on our last call, we are deferring additional drilling and completion activity at Alpine High until natural gas and NGL prices improve. That said, the most recent wells placed online at Alpine High are performing in line with expectations, and we look forward to returning to work there in the future. Turning now to Egypt. Gross oil production of 141,000 barrels per day was in line with our guidance, drilling efficiencies, new well connections, completions and exploration success were all consistent with our expectations for the quarter. As a result, we are projecting gross oil production will be up 5% in the third quarter to 148,000 barrels per day and we are making good progress toward our fourth quarter guide of 154,000 barrels per day. In the North Sea, second quarter production of 42,000 BOEs per day was well below our guidance due to the previously mentioned compressor downtime. We expect volumes to increase in the third quarter to a range of 46,000 to 48,000 BOE per day, driven by higher operating efficiency and the positive impact of our store North well which went on production in late June. In Suriname, Block 58, we are currently focused on appraising last year's Krabdagu discovery. As previously noted, we have completed testing at Krabdagu 2 and results were consistent with our predrill expectations. At Krabdagu 3, we are in the pressure buildup phase, and data collected thus far is very encouraging. The DD3 semisubmersible rig is still on location and will be released upon completion of operations. We believe that no additional appraisal or exploratory drilling is necessary in the Sapakara and Krabdagu area at this time. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we expect drilling programs to remain constant in both the US and Egypt. As a steady operational cadence in these areas enables more efficient operations. That said, we have reduced our full year upstream capital investment outlook to reflect previously noted North Sea platform drilling reductions, no additional drilling in Suriname this year and some minor service cost declines. We are also reducing our full year LOE outlook from $1.5 billion to $1.4 billion, which reflects our ongoing success in actively managing these costs down, as well as some price decreases associated with shorter-cycle items such as diesel and chemicals. APA remains committed to returning at least 60% of our free cash flow this calendar year to shareholders. During the first half of the year, we generated $366 million of free cash flow, 94% of which we return to shareholders via dividends and stock buybacks. Since the commencement of our share repurchase program in October of 2021, we have repurchased nearly 20% of total shares outstanding at an average price of just under $34 per share. In closing, we believe the investment case for APA and the E&P industry is strong and that the longer term outlook for hydrocarbon prices is very constructive. APA has a diversified portfolio and the operational flexibility to quickly respond to commodity price volatility and other externalities. We are committed to our shareholder returns framework into allocating capital for the long-term benefit of investors. APA seeks to produce oil and gas safely and to reduce the environmental impact of our operations. Last month, we issued our 2023 sustainability report, which highlights recent achievements on these fronts, as well as our current ESG goals and initiatives. I encourage all of you to review this report, which you can find on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney. Steve Riney : Thanks, John. For the second quarter, under generally accepted accounting principles, APA reported consolidated net income of $381 million or $1.23 per diluted common share. As usual, these results include items that are outside of core earnings, the most significant of which are mark-to-market appreciation in the value of our Kinetik stock ownership and unrealized gain on Waha basis swaps. Excluding these and other smaller items, adjusted net income for the second quarter was $264 million or $0.85 per diluted common share. Free cash flow, which for external purposes excludes changes in working capital, was $94 million in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases, we returned 131% of this amount to shareholders during the quarter. As John noted, both operational and cost performance were very good during the quarter. Compared to the same quarter last year, total adjusted oil production was up 14%. Adjusted oil mix increased from 44% to 47%, and we held lease operating expenditures nearly flat. G&A expense was $72 million, significantly below our underlying actual run rate cost. This is a result of APA's lower stock price at the quarter end and the mark-to-market impact on previously accrued share-based compensation. Underlying quarterly G&A costs remained stable around $100 million. Switching to forward-looking guidance. Oil production is expected to increase significantly in the third quarter in all three of our operating regions. Our full year guidance implies that oil production will increase again in the fourth quarter in both the US and Egypt. Declines at the mature Qasr gas field in Egypt and at Alpine High, where we have deferred drilling and completion activity will result in total company natural gas production continuing to decline through the rest of this year. Next, I would like to provide some color related to our changing guidance for profit or loss on our gas transport obligations. As most of you know, we hold just over 670 million cubic feet per day of Permian Basin takeaway capacity, we sell our produced gas in basin and we manage the transport obligation by purchasing third-party gas in basin for resale on the Gulf Coast. We realized a net trading margin based on the price differentials less the total transport cost. Since the transport cost is mostly fixed, this activity will generate a profit when price differentials are wide and a loss when they are narrow. In the second quarter, this activity generated a net profit of $13 million as we have all seen, the differential between Waha and Gulf Coast pricing is compressed dramatically since late May. Based on the forward strip, we anticipate these trading activities will result in a small loss in both the third and fourth quarters, and we have adjusted our guidance accordingly. The flip side of this is that we are now getting higher realizations on our gas produced and sold in the Permian Basin. We commenced deliveries under our Cheniere gas supply agreement on August 1. At current strip prices, this contract will generate approximately $120 million of free cash flow for the last 5 months of 2023 and an estimated $385 million for the full year of 2024. As you know, these cash flows are likely to be volatile from quarter-to-quarter. As a reminder, these projections are net of all costs, including the cost to acquire and transport the gas to Cheniere. Our complete guidance for both the third quarter and updated full year 2023 and can be found in our financial and operational supplement. Finally, a brief comment on Egypt receivables. We have a long-standing well-functioning relationship with Egypt based on nearly 30 years of working in their country. Like many parts of the world today, they are experiencing some challenging financial times and we will partner with them through that process just like we have in the past. Since the first quarter earnings call, we have had very constructive conversations with Egypt. As a result of steps already taken, the receivables balance came down in the second quarter, and we are confident further steps will keep us on the right track. In closing, our original full year production guidance is unchanged and we have reduced our 2023 budget capital and operating expense in aggregate by about $250 million. Our balance sheet and debt maturity profile are in good shape. This was most recently recognized by Moody's, who returned us to investment grade in June. Since the beginning of 2021, we have significantly improved our capital structure by reducing our outstanding bond debt by $3.2 billion, while also returning $2.9 billion to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Q \u2013 Doug Leggate : Good morning guys. I'll take that. Thanks for taking my question. John Christmann : Good morning, Doug. Q \u2013 Doug Leggate : Yes, it's more exotic than it probably should be, but\u2014good morning, John. So couple of things from me. So I want to ask about Egypt, not about the working capital progress, which is terrific. I think you've addressed that, Steve, with your commentary. But I want to ask about the confidence in the medium-term oil growth trajectory in Egypt. That seems to be the only knock on the quarter is that folks or maybe a lot questioning whether you can actually deliver that. So, how is that progressing? What is the outlook today? And I've got a follow-up, please. John Christmann : Yes, Doug, the nice thing being early August, we have the luxury of seeing a lot of the wells we've got coming on in the near future. And if you look and you won't see it. But our July volumes have actually averaged 145,000 barrels a day on the oil side were up already in July. Over the second quarter, and we've got good line of sight on what's coming, and it's going to be a good back half of the year. And I'll let Dave Pursell jump in with a little bit more detail. Dave Pursell : Yes, Doug, as John alluded -- or John said, the gross oil at 145,000 in July gives us confidence. We have a couple other data points. We've had good success on exploration in both the [Indiscernible] Basin. So we have good line of sight on the well stock remaining through the rest of the year that will come online. If you look at expected wells online in the back half of the year, it's significantly higher than the front. So, just some numbers first half of the year, we brought 48 wells online. In the back half of the year, we expect to put over 70 wells online. So more wells, high-quality, good confidence in what those wells look like. So again, our confidence in the back half guidance is very good, very high. Q \u2013 Doug Leggate : And what about beyond 2023, Dave? Dave Pursell : We continue to look at the 2024 plan, and we're too early to give guidance, but we have confidence in the ability to keep the growth engine moving. Q \u2013 Doug Leggate : Great stuff. Thank you for that. John, I apologize, I'm going to have to be predictable. But so Total hoping Analyst Day at the end of September, I think they've a pretty good steer that they're going to have something to say there on Suriname? So, I know you don't want to front-run that, but I do want to ask you about resource scale to the extent you can and what you know today? And I'll frame it like this. When [Indiscernible] sanction in Guyana with similar DORs, the capacity of the development, 600 million barrels, 120,000 barrels a day. From everything we know, especially with Baja and the connectivity there. Tell me why resource of that scale is wildly off the mark? John Christmann : I mean at this point, a couple of things, Doug. Number one, we still have the rig on location, so it's early. Number two, we came into this year with the primary objective being appraising the Krabdagu Fairway. And you had the original discovery well -- if I flip over, it's a totally different set of partners in Block 53, but we -- when we announced the Baja discovery, we said it was a down dip low above that fairway. So yes, it does stretch from there all the way now back to Krabdagu 3. Krabdagu 3 was 14 kilometers from the discovery well. And as we've said, the results are very, very encouraging. We do -- we can confirm its oil, but it's early for me to comment or say anything at this point. We've got a lot of technical work to do. It's a very large fairway and there will be resource in there that you're not going to see from the flow test. So there's just a lot of technical work that we need to do, and we'll come back in due course with information in the relatively near future. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question and that will come from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James. Your line is open. John Freeman : Hi, guys. Steve Riney : Good morning, John. John Freeman : Yeah. The first topic I wanted to address was on the shareholder returns. You returned the 131% of free cash flow this quarter. Last quarter, you did 81%. So I'd just be curious kind of your thought process and kind of how you'll determine when it's the appropriate time to kind of really lean into to shareholder returns, like you did, obviously, that was more than double the minimum 60% target that you'll have. So just sort of how you all think about when it's an appropriate time to kind of lean into these things. Steve Riney : Yeah, John, this is Steve. If I just -- if I step back and take a look at the year, we always plan that the second half free cash flow would be greater than the first half. And that's going to come from production growth. It's going to come from the Cheniere contract. It's going to come from a lower amount of capital spending that we'll have in the second half. And now as we look at the actual prices for the first half and anticipated prices for the second half price will also be a bit of factor there. So to address one potential concern that maybe we've done most of our share buybacks in the first half, I'd say the second half -- there's still plenty of buybacks to do, plenty of capacity to do that. We've always said the 60% is a minimum. And I think every time period that we would look at, we've exceeded that minimum. We did in that fourth quarter of '21, we did it for the full year of '22 and certainly doing it first half of '23 and I'd just say we did front end, we chose to, obviously, to front-end load the buyback program in 2023. I'd just say that we're very happy with the share prices that we got, especially in the second quarter and we'll see what the second half of the year brings for us. John Freeman : Okay. And then my follow-up, just kind of following on to Doug's questions on Egypt. Just sort of what you all identified in terms of the you got the mature natural gas field that's declining so that oil mix as we've seen now for the last three quarters just keeps inching up. It looks like just ballpark that for 2024, like something in that like 65% kind of oil mix would be possible. Just sort of any commentary about how you all see that oil mix sort of continue to evolve as it continues to ramp up. John Christmann : John, that's a great point. I mean as cost continues to decline, you're going you will see our oil mix and need to rise. And if you go back is a legacy large field 3 Ts. It's been on decline and it is declining. And so as costs continue to decline and our programs are in the more oily driven areas, you'll see that mix rise. And so it's early. I don't want to get into '24, but it wouldn't surprise me, and I would probably anticipate that the oil mix will be higher in '24 than it did in '23. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Your line is open. Neal Dingmann : Morning, guys. John, can I ask maybe one more in Egypt. Just specifically, given an ample, I'm just wondering, are you seeing ample equipment and personnel there to continue to run the 17 rigs and if so, given the strong results and your strong balance sheet, any thoughts to boost activity next year? A \u2013 John Christmann : Neal, it took us a little bit on last year with training programs to kind of get the program where we wanted it. We're there today. So we feel good about that. We've put a lot of training in place I think right now, 17, 18 rigs is a pretty good number. I think it's about all that's in country and from a staffing perspective. So I think we're in a pretty good place. And you're seeing us finally get the results and the efficiencies where we were hoping we'd get to. So we feel like we're in a good place. And right now, that's what I see for the foreseeable future. Neal Dingmann : Very good. And then my second for you guys is just on the Southern Midland. Could you speak to now, have you changed or are you walking up the average size, lateral length seems like some of your peers are continuing to get larger wells, larger pads to try to get more efficiencies. So I'm just on the same mindset. A \u2013 John Christmann : Yes. We came into this year really with our programs focused on the longer laterals, a lot of two and three milers. So Dave, I think you've got little more color or some statistics there. A \u2013 Dave Pursell : Yes. So just on the Permian in general, we continue to walk lateral length higher. If you look at last year, we averaged just over 10,000 feet. This year, we're going to average closer to 10,500 feet for lateral. Again, there's variance. There are some 3 milers and there's some 1.5. But on average, the program is getting longer. And in 2024, we anticipate the links will continue to inch a little bit longer as well. And I think on the frac side, we've tended to lean to a little bit looser spacing and larger individual frac stage size. And have had good success to that. And so I don't know that we'll get any bigger, but we've -- we're pretty comfortable with where we are on our completion designs at this point. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Scott Gruber : Yes. Good morning. I'm going to peer around the corner a little bit too here to 2024 on the US side, it looks like implied in the full year guidance that your US oil reduction can continuing the decline in 4Q, you're maybe getting to the mid-80s. How should we think about 2024 at this juncture in terms of oil growth in the US? A \u2013 John Christmann : It's early in terms of numbers. I mean we typically don't start getting into 2024. I can tell you, we're working the 2024 plan and a lot of detail right now that we start getting into reviewing that and so forth in the fall. I would anticipate pretty level activity sets from where we are today. And so if you look at that with the programs we're delivering and the types of laterals we're drilling, I would expect fairly similar increments of growth may be on a little higher base in terms of with the volume that we're growing this year. But it's always lumpy. We're running five rigs with the timing -- so I don't know how the timing will line up year-over-year, fourth quarter over fourth quarter, some of those numbers. But I would expect a very strong continuous program in the US and in Egypt for 2024. Q \u2013 Scott Gruber : And if deflation in service costs here in the States, if that turns out to be more material? Do you end up recycling that back into more drilling, or would you kind of keep the program the same in light of that deflation and just reap the benefits in terms of greater free cash? John Christmann : I mean, I would say right now, the plans would be to take the program and let the program dictate because five rigs, we're working 1.5 frac crews, a pretty good cadence there. It's hard to just add incrementally without going up in stair step function. So I would anticipate that the service side, whatever benefits there would come to free cash flow and the program will be pretty stable. We do try to go in every year with a pretty set framework on the capital side. And so a lot of what's going on this fall will dictate what our service costs will look like for the portions that we will try to lock down for next year. So we'll just have to wait and see how things play out. And clearly, you've had a little bit of softening in some areas right now, but I think everybody is waiting to kind of see what prices do in the back half of the year. to really steer next year's capital. Operator : Thank you. That will come from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Your line is open. Charles Meade : Good morning, John, to you and your whole team there. John Christmann : Good morning, Charles. Charles Meade : John, I have to say I'm as I'm sure you guys all are to see all the -- or to learn about all the appraisal results at Krabdagu, but I recognize we're going to have to wait a little bit. So I want to instead ask about Waha. And specifically, what your plans are or what the considerations are for appraisal there? I recognize that you guys said it's in the same deposition system as a Krabdagu. And perhaps as part of talking about your plan for appraisal, can you also address it, is it also one of these shelf slope kind of targets, or has it is -- are you maybe starting to hit the transition into the basin four fans out there? John Christmann : I can let Tracey in a second, get in a little bit to the geology, but what I'll just tell you first on Waha, it is a discovery that we discovered the discovery well is in Block 53, where we have a separate set of partners as opposed to Block 58, it's in Total. We are the operator of Block 53. And so I can't say a lot at this point other than we've got a lot of work to do in terms of does Waha potentially flow into an oil hub in Block 58, or does it make up its own project in Block 53. So at this point, I can't sell a lot there other than, obviously, there's a lot of work being done, a lot of different angles looked at. And Tracey, I'll have you chime in a little bit on the geology. Tracey Henderson : Sure. Good morning, Charles. I think great question on the fairway and your initial assessment there about in a system what we've discussed in the past. So what we're describing is a fair way. And as John mentioned in his remarks, something we've defined now that's roughly 25 kilometers from Waha to Krabdagu 3. So you've got a very robust system that's coming through here in a series of slope channels that you call from our original release at Krabdagu 1, which are stacked systems. So correct in your assessment, we're seeing slope channel systems, as John said, we've got more technical work to do. We still got a well on location and a lot of work to integrate going forward. Charles Meade : Thank you, Tracey, thank you, John. That\u2019s it for me. John Christmann : You bet. Operator : Thank you.  One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is open Roger Read : Thank you. Good morning. John Christmann : Good morning, Roger Roger Read : John Just like to ask about Egypt and not from an operational standpoint, but it's been more financial, I don't know if I'd call it risk or just it's Egypt being Egypt. But I was just curious how things are going in terms of your ability to from the operations in the country, return capital out of the country as needed or as desired and anything else we should be watching there? John Christmann : No. I mean, as Steve mentioned in his prepared remarks that Egypt in a lot of places around the world right now are going through some difficult times. There is stress in the system. If you look at wheat prices and things, but from a standpoint of our business, it's been pretty much normal course in terms of movements and things like that. And you've seen us working constructively with Egypt to make progress, and you're seeing that. So. Roger Read : Okay. I'll take that as a good answer. And then my other question is just as you look at operations in the Permian, what would be the broader description of sort of productivity and efficiency gains you're seeing sort of leaving any service cost inflation or deflation aside, but just what you're seeing in terms of performance on the drilling side, on the completion stages, things like that. Dave Pursell : Yes, Roger, this is Dave. So on the drilling side, we continue to improve our drilling performance. Again, there's any number of metrics, which I won't bore you with. But the drilling team is doing a good job of getting our wells down in a very efficient manner where I think you might be going is on the productivity side. Lateral lengths, as I talked about earlier, getting a little bit longer and that helps. But on a lateral length adjusted basis, relaxed spacing and bigger fracs have been a benefit to us in getting those lateral length adjusted productivity numbers to continue to improve. And it's always hard to forecast or we're going to keep getting better, but we're happy with the program so far, 2023 looks pretty good compared to 2022. And the team -- we have a pretty good or very good subsurface team that continues to try to push the envelope productivity per foot, and we're striving to continue to move that into 2024. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Securities. Your line is open. Arun Jayaram : John, good morning. I wanted to get your thoughts on how the process you think will move once you fully evaluated the Krabdagu 3 results towards the declaration of commerciality and perhaps an FID decision? John Christmann : Yes. I mean, Arun, first of all, it's -- like we said, we're rigs still on location, and so we've got a lot of technical work to do. But we'll come back at some point with more data. That is exactly what you just mentioned would be the steps you'd take. And we've got a lot of work to do to be in a position to do that. And obviously, we'll be working with our partner in Total. So. Arun Jayaram : Got it. Got it. I mean I just wanted to maybe follow up there. Total has a frame agreement with the subsea provider, John, as you know, and they've raised the scope of the SURF package to over $1 billion from previously to $250 million to $500 million. Anything to read into that in terms of potential boat size at this point? A \u2013 JohnChristmann: The only thing I'd say, and I'm going to defer, we'll let Total handle those relationships, and that's what they're -- they'll be operator, right? I'll just leave it at that. But I mean, I would say we came into this year with the goal to appraise Krabdagu because we said it could impact scope scale. And clearly, we've had a positive result at Krabdagu 3. So that was one of the objectives with the appraisal program and the number three well was designed for a very large step up to better understand potentially what type of resource we could have there. So we've got a lot of technical teams do the work, but that was the objective coming into this year was to help better understand scope and scale. Arun Jayaram : Great. A quick follow-up on the North Sea. John, oil prices, Brent is now moving eclipse 80. What do you think needs to happen for the North Sea to attract capital next year? And -- and maybe just thoughts on the broader portfolio. If we get in the situation where the Northeast is not competitive. Are you just comfortable with, call it, two legs of the stool ex-Suriname at this point? A \u2013 JohnChristmann: I mean obviously, the nice thing is, is having a diverse portfolio where we've got places to put capital. And we basically program in the North Sea with the Ocean Patriot for six months. You see us in a good position in terms of sustaining and growing the company. So as we look at next year, we'll factor in what makes sense. But right now, more importantly from the North Seas perspective, you'd need to see some stability in the regime to make long-term investments. And right now, we have not seen any stability. And so I would not anticipate us jumping in because prices are up and deciding to put a lot of capital in the North Sea at this point than what we need to do for maintenance and integrity and safety. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Leo Mariani with ROTH MKM. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Leo Mariani : Hi, guys. I just wanted to follow-up quickly on Suriname here. So certainly seems as though you guys have found significant oil here, Krabdagu based on the comments you've made. I understand there's more technical work to go. But I'm just curious little bit kind of around the thought process on kind of stopping drilling for the rest of the year. It feels like you've got great momentum there. You found a lot of oil at the end of the day, why get rid of the rig for the last, call it, four or five months of the year, why not sort of building that momentum, drill some of the other exploration targets just given how vast the basin is at this point in time? A \u2013 JohnChristmann: Yes, Leo, I mean, we've got a large block. We've got a lot of time for other prospect areas and so forth. And I think the key was coming in, there's been a focus on let's get to project and an oil development, and that was what the focus was this year. And there are other prospects in the Krabdagu and Sapakara area. But at this point, we don't think it's necessary to drill those right down so. Q \u2013 Leo Mariani : Okay. And then just in terms of the US well performance, you guys talked about this a little bit. It sounds like there have been some changes to the completion design potential here with a little bit kind of wider spacing. But it seems like the oil performance there has been a lot more consistent. You guys basically said that it looks like 2023 well performance is a little better than 2022. Just kind of wanted to get a little sense of what do you think the kind of running room here is on kind of the Tier 1 Permian acreage. If you look out handful of years. Do you guys have kind of an estimate on how long you can kind of keep five rigs running and kind of how much inventory you have maybe in terms of kind of rig years or something? Dave Pursell : Yes. Leo, we've talked about kind of our visibility is kind of through the end of the decade on this run rate in this program and -- no change to that. So we're pleased with -- we're looking at a 3- to 5-year plan and pretty happy with what we have in there. So stay tuned. A \u2013 John Christmann : Yes. The other thing I would add is if you look at the evolution of the program, a lot of the stuff we're drilling today that's Tier 1. Two years ago, we had it at Tier 2, Tier 3, right? We've got a nice acreage footprint. And so you're always also looking to see the evolution of the resource. So we've got strong confidence in the U.S. inventory at this program rates. Operator : And thank you, one moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Jeffrey Lambujon with TPH. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Jeffrey Lambujon : Good morning, guys. Appreciate taking my questions. I wanted to ask my first one on US activity. Just wondering if the two Midland and two Delaware quits good to assume as part of that base case of steady activity. And if you could talk about how you think about toggling that in the near term, if at all, whether in terms of inventory comparing the two or any of the factors, I'd imagine the flexibility of the Delaware in terms of proximity of the Alpine High plays into some degree if you can also maybe speak to what you want to see there in the macro or from the wells to add back any sort of capital there? A \u2013 Dave Pursell : Yes. Jeffrey, just a good question on the Midland versus Delaware split. If you -- again, as rigs are fungible, we could there's no magic a Delaware rig could move over to the Southern Midland Basin. But if you think about a the next 18 months or so, two in SMB and three in Delaware Basin is to make sense. And then the question on Alpine, it's really about not just gas price, but what gas price does it take for those wells to be competitive versus an oil rig line, either in SMB or Delaware. And those are the decisions we'll be looking at is Matterhorn comes online sometime back half of next year. Q \u2013 Jeffrey Lambujon : Okay. Great. That makes sense. And then maybe just a follow-up on the North Sea. I know it's already a relatively smaller to the budget and getting smaller, just looking to next year with the release of the Ocean Patriot, as you guys highlighted, but can you talk about what sort of operations we should think about there just in terms of steady state going forward and what that means for CapEx? It seems like year-over-year, you could maybe be looking at something like maybe half the spend that was originally budgeted for this year. A \u2013 John Christmann : Yeah. I mean I think if we look at the back half of 2023, we've got around $50 million of capital in the North Sea. And that's probably what you'd assume going into -- for each half of next year. I'd say so $100 million, give or take, is what it would look at like today roughly. I think the biggest thing there is just philosophy change. I mean, we're going to be operating for safety and integrity and managing decline and managing free cash flow. And there's still a lot of life left. I think the important thing is even by pulling the Patriot out, it doesn't really change our timing on when we see abandonment. I think we're still well into the early 2030s. And so we're going to do as good a job with that asset managing it for free cash flow. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is open. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Good morning guys. John, maybe guiding, but I think at one point that's a number talking about your Suriname so far, the discovery, say, around 800 million barrels. Just wanted to clarify if that is the right number, and that's in pace or are we comparable way and whether -- I assume that's not including the Krabdagu-3 lastest appraisal. And just want to see, is that the geologies that to make what kind of reasonable recoverable weighting pace that we should assume any reason that you won't recover more than 50% of the resourcing pace? That's the first question. John Christmann : Yeah. So Paul, the -- you get to the 800 million as we've disclosed at Sapakara from the original well, the second well, we had more than 600 million barrels of connected resource. So that's where six of it comes from. And then the original 200 was from the discovery well from the flow test we did there at Krabdagu. So the 800 million number is -- would be a connected resource in place, and it's not a recoverable number, but it also does not include Krabdagu-2 or Krabdagu-3 and the integration work that's going on now that will move forward. So -- and Dave, you might reference just it's really high-quality rock, and it'd be early to talk about actual recovery factors, but you can give some insights there. Dave Pursell : Yeah. Paul, I think if you can just look at historical recovery factors in big deepwater discoveries to put a range on it, the recovery factors are a function of the field development plans that you have. We're going to have gas injection here. And again, there'll be a lot of pressure maintenance. These are high-quality reservoirs. So I think you'd expect high recovery factors. But at this point, it's way premature to try to put a number on that. Paul Cheng : Do you have a rough estimate, what's the gas cut in that content there? Dave Pursell : Yeah. You're talking about gas cut, Paul? Paul Cheng : Yeah, yeah. What's the gas percentage, or what's the oil percentage either way? Dave Pursell : Yeah. I don't have that at the tip of my fingers, but we've put the GORs in the prior press releases on the Sapakara and the Krabdagu discovery, and we've not disclosed anything yet on Krabdagu-2 or 3. John Christmann : Yeah. Sapakara was 1,100 GOR, roughly. And the discovery well at Krabdagu had a couple of different ranges from around the high-teens to the high 2000s. Paul Cheng : Okay, great. And on Permian, you've done a number of three-mile wells. So just want to see that, is there a number you can share what percent of your inventory backlog that you could do three months? And what percent of your work program for the next couple of years is going to be in the three miles? Thank you. A \u2013 Dave Pursell : Yes, Paul, this is Dave. I don't have that number. It's a relatively small percent of the total work plan. We're happy with the results from our three milers. It's really just a question of where does the acreage footprint allow that to allow us to drill the three milers. You can tell just on the numbers I threw out earlier, most of what we're drilling are two milers. But the team, any time we get a chance to drill three miler, we'll do it and that's just acreage footprint. But from a modeling standpoint is probably best to just assume they're all two milers program. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Umang Choudhary with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Umang Choudhary : Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. A \u2013 Dave Pursell : You bet. Q \u2013 Umang Choudhary : My first question is on the $100 million savings from your operating cost management program. You talked about diesel and chemicals driving some things there. Any additional color you can provide in terms of any other buckets, which is driving those savings? A \u2013 Dave Pursell : Yes. This is Dave. If you look at it, it's really just across the board. It's a lot of things. And really, it's -- the operating team has shown really good cost discipline through the year. We came into the year with some inflationary headwinds and the team kind of took that as a challenge and really is doing a great job in all the areas, Egypt, North Sea and the US and trying to keep those costs in check. And so it's -- diesel and chemicals are easy to see. But everything else, it's just a lot of little things that add up to material numbers. And then I would echo comments from earlier, excited to see more on Suriname down the road. But separately, would just love your thoughts around the M&A landscape and how does that -- how does that compare versus some of your organic opportunities here? John Christmann : I mean, I think, in general, you've seen a couple of deals take place in the Permian. They've traded at what we viewed as pretty high valuations. You look obviously focused organically. But you've always got to be on the lookout for things that could make sense. And obviously, that's where we are and what we do. We come in every day to try to make this company more valuable and more attractive. So\u2026. Operator : Thank you. I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. John Christmann for any closing remarks. John Christmann : Yes. Thank you for participating on our call today. I want to close with the following thoughts. Our asset teams are executing at a high level, and we have a high number of quality wells scheduled for the back half of the year which gives us confidence in achieving our full year production guidance. We're progressing in a positive direction in Suriname, and we remain committed to our capital return program. We look forward to keeping you apprised of our progress. Thank you. Operator : Thank you all for participating. This concludes today's program. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to first your speaker today, Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gary Clark : Good morning, and thank you for joining us on APA Corporation's third quarter 2023 financial and operational results conference call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John Christmann. Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results and outlook. Also, on the call and available to answer questions are Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President of Development; Tracey Henderson, Executive Vice President of Exploration; and Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations. Our prepared remarks will be about 10 minutes in length with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you had the opportunity to review our financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apacorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. The full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that, I'll turn the call over to John. John Christmann : Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today's call, we will review third quarter highlights, discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter and provide a high level overview of our capital plan and anticipated production in 2024. For the third quarter in a row, adjusted oil production exceeded the high end of our guidance range; good execution and strong well performance in the Permian are the primary drivers of this trend. We also achieved the high end of our guidance in the North Sea during the quarter, which benefited from the production ramp of the Storr North well. In Egypt, gross oil volumes grew by approximately 4,000 barrels per day, which was a bit below expectations as previously disclosed. On a total company basis, third quarter reported oil volumes were up more than 15% from the same quarter in the prior year, and we are very pleased with this progress. Activity in the U.S. and Egypt remained steady, while we suspended drilling activity around mid-year in the North Sea. Our investment program in the North Sea is now directed towards safety, base production management, and asset maintenance and integrity. In Suriname, we achieved a very important milestone during the third quarter with the completion of a successful appraisal drilling program at Krabdagu on Block 58 and the subsequent announcement by our partner TotalEnergies of plans to proceed with feed work for a 200,000 barrel per day FPSO in the Eastern portion of the block. The planned oil hub is underpinned by an estimated 700 million barrels of recoverable oil resource at Sapakara and Krabdagu and is targeted FID by the end of 2024. Turning now to our outlook. In yesterday's financial and operational supplement, we issued fourth quarter guidance, which anticipates slightly lower production on a BOE basis compared to the third quarter. The primary contributor is in the North Sea, where the temporary shut in at Brae Bravo will result in volume deferrals of about 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the U.S., completion timing will lead to a relatively flat quarter consisting of unchanged oil production and a small decline in natural gas. And in Egypt, a combination of higher oil and lower natural gas volumes should deliver BOE growth, but not enough to fully offset the downtime in the North Sea. Let me provide a bit more color on production operations in Egypt. In February, we established a gross oil target of 154,000 barrels per day for the fourth quarter. We now estimate that number will be closer to 150,000 barrels per day, which is up about 5,000 barrels per day from the third quarter. After successfully working through the challenges associated with ramping our rig count from 11 to 18, our drilling program is now performing as planned. However, we have experienced a growing backlog of work over projects over the last two quarters and a corresponding uptick in barrels offline. To address this, we have begun to increase our work over activity, which Dave can discuss further in Q&A. During the fourth quarter, we are opportunistically accelerating the completion of eight Permian wells from January into December and adding a 6th rig in the Delaware Basin. This will result in an increase in our estimated fourth quarter upstream capital to around $500 million and bring full-year upstream capital to just under $2 billion. I should note that these investments will not have a material impact on fourth quarter production. As we typically do at this time of year, I would like to provide a high level overview of our 2024 outlook, which we will follow-up with formal guidance in February. Recall that we entered 2023 with a planned upstream capital budget of $2.0 billion to $2.1 billion. As of today, we expect a similar range in 2024, albeit with some changes in regional allocation. We are targeting low-single-digit oil production growth next year, with expected increases in the Permian and Egypt more than offsetting declines in the North Sea. APA remains committed to returning at least 60% of our free cash flow this calendar year to shareholders. During the first three quarters of the year, we generated $673 million of free cash flow, 65% of which we returned to shareholders via dividends and stock buybacks. This leaves more to do in the fourth quarter, and we will fulfill our minimum 60% commitment for the full-year. One of APA's core principles is to produce oil and gas safely and to reduce the environmental impact of our operations. I am pleased to announce that we recently achieved an important milestone in reducing methane emissions with the conversion of over 2,000 pneumatic devices in the Permian to lower emitting technologies. Our programs to identify and eliminate emissions throughout our global asset base are ongoing, and we continuously seek to expand and improve them. In closing, we are committed to our strategy of maintaining a diversified portfolio and maintaining operational flexibility to respond quickly to commodity price volatility and other externalities. We are demonstrating this today through the reallocation of capital from the North Sea into the Permian and Egypt. We also remain committed to investment in a portfolio of exploration projects which have the potential to drive differentiated future growth and competitive full cycle economics. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney. Steve Riney : Thank you, John, and good morning. For the third quarter, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, APA reported consolidated net income of $459 million, or $1.49 per diluted common share. As usual, these results include items that are outside of our core earnings. The most significant of which was a $93 million release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax asset. This was offset by a loss on the quarterly mark-to-market of our Kinetik stock ownership and unrealized derivative losses on our Waha basis swaps. Excluding these and other smaller items, adjusted net income for the third quarter was $410 million or $1.33 per share. Free cash flow, which for external purposes excludes changes in working capital, was $307 million in the quarter. Through dividends and share repurchases, we returned 32% of this amount to shareholders during the quarter. As John indicated, year-to-date, we have returned 65% of free cash flow to shareholders. Please refer to APA's published definition of free cash flow for any reconciliation needs. In our 3Q earnings prerelease, we anticipated G&A expense would be significantly higher than our underlying run rate of cost, which is around $100 million. For the quarter, reported G&A was $139 million, mostly because of APA stock price appreciation and the mark-to-market impact on previously accrued share-based compensation. As we have explained in the past, the mark-to-market of share price movements also impacts LOE, CapEx and exploration expense. Thus, these items were also higher during the third quarter for the same reason. North Sea taxes also came in above guidance in the quarter by $46 million. This was the result of an incremental cargo lifting late in the quarter, which was not anticipated at the time we provided 3Q guidance in August. In accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, we recognize cargo liftings in the quarter they occur, which increases revenue and current tax expense, but has no impact on reported production volumes. To be clear though, this is just a movement of revenue and income tax expense from the fourth quarter into the third quarter and has no impact on our anticipated full-year North Sea production revenue or income tax expense. As previously noted, our Cheniere gas sales contract commenced on August 1 and contributed two months of free cash flow in the third quarter. You will find this impact on our P&L in the two line items, which capture the revenue and costs associated with oil and gas purchased for resale. In the third quarter, the Cheniere contract contributed free cash flow and pre-tax income of $32 million. We currently anticipate it will contribute approximately $90 million in the fourth quarter and $375 million for the full-year 2024. In closing, as anticipated, the second half of 2023 is poised for improving production and free cash flow versus the first half of the year. With the improving performance, we are tracking very close to our original full-year guidance across most of our key financial and operational metrics for the year. We will continue to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And while our balance sheet is much stronger than a few years ago, we continue to recognize the need for further progress on debt reduction. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug, your line is open. Please go ahead. Doug Leggate : Thank you. I think Gary just lost a bet on name pronunciation, but thanks for getting me on. Guys, the North Sea, I wonder if you can offer a little bit of color on what you see as a declining curve there with no capital. And where I'm going with this is obviously you've got, I believe the gas compressor. These are all the assets, I guess you're having to take it off the platform and so on, that's going to come back. And obviously production will decline because you're not spending any money. But my question is, how does the decline look versus the free cash flow in the North Sea. It strikes me that the free cash flow in a declining curve could actually be higher. John Christmann : Yes, Doug, it's a good question. We're in the process right now working through the 2024 plan. Clearly, we've got some downtime that we've announced in the North Sea in the fourth quarter, as we do have a compressor that we had to haul onshore. We'll get that back on sometime early next year and then you'll be back at your base decline both for Forties and barrel. Forties is underwater flood, so it's got much lower decline than barrel. But we do not have the rig. We'll continue to focus on maintenance integrity projects and we'll come back early next year with a detailed look when we give out the 2024 plan. Doug Leggate : But is it fair to say that versus 2023, when you were spending capital, that free cash flow could be higher, John? John Christmann : I think it's early on the -- Dave Pursell : Yes, Doug. Yes, I think it's -- as John was about to say, I think it's a bit early to state that for 2024. It's certainly a possibility, but let's get to February. We'll have a detailed plan and then we'll -- and we'll know kind of what type of price environment we're looking at as well, and we'll have a better analysis on that at that point in time. Doug Leggate : All right. Thank you. John, my follow-up is in Suriname; I managed to get a red eye to Total's Analyst Day this year and asked Patrick a very specific question about timing. And I wanted to get your perspective on this. What -- my understanding is that the 2028 schedule for first oil assumes a 42-month new build FPSO, but since that announcement, I understand that SBM has been selected with an early hull. In other words, a year earlier on that timeline with some 70% expected to be contracted at the time of FID. I know you're not the operator, but I wonder if you could confirm or offer any color around those points. John Christmann : Yes. I would just say for now, I mean kind of the official timeline is FID by the end of 2024 and first oil by 2028. But obviously there's incentive and motivation to try to accelerate that, and I would expect that they will do everything they can to do so. Doug Leggate : Fair enough. Thanks, guys. John Christmann : Thank you. Operator : Standby for our next caller. And that is John Freeman with Raymond James. John, your line is open. Please go ahead. John Freeman : Yes. The first question I had on the sixth rig that's getting added in the Permian well is the plan for that rig to operate exclusively in the Delaware or potentially toggle between Delaware and Alpine High? John Christmann : John, it's a spot rig, we're picking up. It'll kind of go pad to pad. It will start in the Delaware on some oil pads, but then there's flexibility and we'll come back in February with a little more detail obviously on the 2024 plan and how that would sit. John Freeman : Okay. And then, just my follow-up question, I appreciate the preliminary sort of outlook on 2024. If I take kind of what you said about the budget being in a kind of flattish versus 2023, and I think about like the sixth rig that's largely kind of funded with the North Sea CapEx reduction. And then Egypt, you've said previously is kind of status quo next year. And so it seems like just of your three main operating areas that's kind of flattish and the wild cards kind of expiration. Was your commentary about kind of a flattish budget? Is that all in? Does that include the expiration side? If you can kind of just walk us through kind of how you see the expiration in a year where there's probably a step down in activity and concern on ahead of FID? John Christmann : Yes, John, it's a great question. Yes. It includes about $150 million of expiration. I think you laid it out pretty accurately. You'll see a full-year without drilling in the North Sea. You'll see an increase in the Permian, relatively stable drilling lines in Egypt, and you will see about $100.5 million in terms of expiration is what we're sketching out at this point. So relatively stable program with continued exploration investment like we've done over the last several years. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Bob, your line is open. Please go ahead. Bob Brackett : Yes. Good morning. You talked about in terms of the Permian; if we think about 12 net completions in 3Q is kind of driving flat production QonQ in 4Q, 20 net completions in 2Q allowed you to grow the following quarter. And it sounds like you've already connected 12 wells in October with 18 coming in the rest of the queue. Does that imply a pretty strong cadence into sort of 1Q of next year in terms of the Permian? Dave Pursell : Yes. It's a good question, how timing of completions drives the quarterly production cadence, this is Dave Purcell, by the way. The remaining completions this quarter will be weighted more towards December, and then we'll provide you in February with what the cadence of completions looks like in 2024. And as you can imagine, there'll still be some lumpiness and we'll provide that in February once we get the plan finalized. Bob Brackett : Okay. Quick follow-up, if there is an FID in 2024 around Suriname, does that change that CapEx budget of 2.0 or 2.1 or it's kind of a rounding error? John Christmann : No, at this point, we've factored that in, Bob. Operator : Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Neal, your line is open. Go ahead. Neal Dingmann : Thanks for the time. So my first question is just on Egypt. I'm just wondering if the 2024 plans will continue to have sort of a similar level of exploration development activity. And if so, should we assume somewhere around I mean in your estimate around that sort of same drill and success next year? John Christmann : Yes. Neal, program it will be pretty stable. We're running 18 rigs in Egypt and it is a steady diet of both development and exploration and I anticipate that to be very similar next year. And we do expect to be able to continue to show good growth in Egypt. Neal Dingmann : Very good. And then, my second John asked a little bit on this but just on the Permian gas plans. I'm just curious if your decisions if and when to go back and boost that activity. Is that based more on how those gassy well economics compete against your oily Southern Midland or Delaware economics or is it just simply if those gas returns would provide a certain rate of return? John Christmann : I mean it's really more a function of stability in the Waha pricing. And the wells we've drilled this year have been strong and very competitive. I mean I think at $3 at Waha, they're very, very competitive with Permian oil. So -- but it's really more a function of when we believe we'll have stability there at Waha that you can produce some end of the infrastructure. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Scott, your line is open. Go right ahead. Scott Gruber : Thanks. Can you just coming back to Egypt, you mentioned growth next year. Is that going to be on a year-over-year basis or do you think the exit to exit will be up as well? John Christmann : Yes. We'll give you the details when we rollout the plan in February, but we'll show growth most likely year-over-year end exit. But let us give you those details in February. Scott Gruber : Okay. And then, just think about the next few years. You have a project that would be moving forward in Suriname and obviously you have the carry from Total. You still have $1 billion or so of commitment. Can you just speak to whether that impacts your cap allocation across the rest of the portfolio on a multi-year basis? John Christmann : Yes. I mean we look at the multi-year plan and that's the beauty of the carry is it's going to keep that in a very, very manageable place from where we've been. So I mean that we basically structured that deal, banking on success and you'll see that start to follow through if we move through the next phases. So got to FID a project first, but that's where the carry will kick in. Operator : Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo Securities. Roger, your line is open. Go ahead. Roger Read : Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Just to follow-up Egypt had a little release of capital or working capital this quarter. Just how do you think that looks going forward? And also in Egypt, given that they've had some gas issues related to imports in the med, any interest or pressure from Egypt to have you increase gas production there? Is that something that could occur in 2024? That's not really a reasonable assumption given locations of fields and takeaway capacity, et cetera. John Christmann : There's no doubt Egypt needs more gas production. We're flowing everything we can into the grid, which is where our gas goes. Our program has been focused on oil as we receive 265 per MMBtu there. But short-term there's not anything we could do to increase gas production. But there are some longer-term projects, but we would need to work on a higher gas price there. Roger Read : And on the working capital thoughts? Steve Riney : Yes, on the working capital, this is Steve. So we did have an increase in working capital in the quarter in Egypt, as you will see in the supplement. So the receivables did go up during the quarter, but receivables from EGPC actually went down during the quarter. And if we go back to first quarter of this year, when I think the concern about the payments from EGPC kind of surfaced at that point in time with the first quarter results in May. Since that time, from first quarter -- end of first quarter to the end of the third quarter, EGPC receivables have gone down and so have the past due receivables from EGPC. So I think we're in good shape there. We've made making progress; we've made some good progress. And as John always says, we're in constant contact with the highest level folks in Egypt about managing that receivable balance. So we're making some good progress there. More to go, but we're making good progress. I think the issue with a reason why receivables went up in the third quarter is because we were exporting more cargoes than selling them to third parties. And those third-party receivables have gone up during the quarter because we were -- third-party receivables were low at the end of the second quarter and higher at the end of the third quarter. So those are receivables that are just paid under normal terms from our normal credit worthy and on time paying purchasers of the oil coming out of Egypt in export cargos. Roger Read : And that's in that situation, just normal seasonal or month-to-month kind of changes, nothing to read into that percent of that. Steve Riney : Right, right. And you'll see there is a -- at the corporate level, not just in Egypt at the corporate level, there's a meaningful increase in working capital during the quarter. And that also is just seasonal type things. We had some payables in particular a large one around taxes, large cash payment in taxes in the UK that comes in the third quarter. And so a lot of seasonality to working capital movements for the company as a whole. Operator : And our next caller is Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Welcome, Charles. Your line is open. Michael Furrow : Hi, good morning. This is Michael Furrow actually filling in for Charles Meade. John Christmann : Hello, Michael. Michael Furrow : Hi, okay, just one question for me regarding Suriname. I know FID is not expected until late 2024 and this might be a bit premature, but when do you think that further exploration could occur within Block 58. And I recognize that Total is the operator here. So maybe a better way to frame it would be when would APA like to further explore Block 58 and maybe if you could even speak on Block 53. John Christmann : No, it's a great question. The focus this year was appraisal of Krabdagu, so we could start a project in terms of getting it moving into the next phase. And we're in a position to do that now. We do see several high quality, low risk prospects in Block 58. A lot of the program at Krabdagu that obviously appraised that fairway also de-risked in our mind a lot of prospects. There's no urgency in terms of getting to them in 2024, but we will be working through those with our partner. And when I look at the two blocks, we see more prospectivity in 58 over 53. We're working with our various partners there on the next steps at Baja, but I think we would see more prospectivity in 58 over 53 at this point. Operator : Please standby for our next question. And our next question is from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Scott, your line is open. Scott Hanold : Yes. Thanks. My question is going to be on just general exploration. I mean, obviously you got Suriname going on, but more recently, you've kind of farmed in a position in Alaska. And on top of that, obviously you've got different things in Uruguay and Dominican Republic. Can you tell us in general, just first maybe starting with Alaska and then how you think about these other prospects moving forward for APA? John Christmann : Alaska fits our exploration strategy and that is trying to build a high quality portfolio. We've got a proven operator, its state lands, very, very prospective acreage and it's something we look forward to sharing more in February. And it's all about a portfolio on the exploration side and having choices to high grade and drill the best things that are going to create the most shareholder value. Scott Hanold : So when I think of APA, and look, I mean it seems to be in contrast with some of, I guess, your U.S. or even just E&P peers where there's a lot of, I guess, M&A going on there for domestic shale. But it looks like APA is taking a little bit different angle or is there still a desire to potentially maybe even bulk up in the Permian or other focus areas where you do have more, I guess, proven production at this point? John Christmann : Yes. I mean I think we like to look at both avenues, both the organic and the inorganic. And we stayed committed to an exploration program and you're seeing that pay off in Suriname and longer-term, but I also think you saw us last year bolster some acreage in the Delaware. So it's a diet of both that you're constantly looking at and you've got to continue to focus on adding to the assets as well as what can create value for your shareholders. Scott Hanold : So when you look at the Permian Basin, do you all feel at a five, six rig pace? You've got -- what you'd say ample inventory of kind of Tier 1 stuff? John Christmann : Yes. I mean, I think with where we sit today, five to six rigs, David say, into the decade pretty easily. And that's focused on higher quality, longer laterals and we're always -- we've got a nice footprint that we're always moving inventory from one category of up into the high graded as we continue to test and find ways to make it all work, so. Operator : Our next question comes from David Deckelbaum with TD Cowen. David, your line is open. David Deckelbaum : Thanks for taking my questions, guys. John, I wanted to just ask, are you able to tell us the $150 million you have earmarked for exploration next year? This I guess to be more pointed about it, how much of that is included for ex-Suriname exploration? John Christmann : At this point, we'll come back with more color next year on the program. It's a placeholder and we're working through. There's some other things we'll be doing. You've got exploration in Egypt that we've always funded and some other things, but we'll come back with more color in February. David Deckelbaum : Appreciate that. Maybe if I could just follow-up on Egypt. You talked about the growth trajectory in the next year and I certainly know that U.S. oil is anticipated growing next year. Can you give a little bit more color just on what's happening with the increased work over activity? What's driving that? And are there any alterations being made that this won't be a drag into next year? Or is this being factored in with greater frequency now that you have this increased rig count? John Christmann : Yes. I mean it's a situation where we've always had, I'll call it a wells or a volume offline that requires work over. We have a lot of sub pumps in Egypt and we've had some increase in the failures in a few areas and that number's ticked up. And Dave can get into some more color, but we've just got more barrels offline that we need to get to on the work over side. And we're addressing that, so it's something we're jumping all over. Dave Pursell : Yes. And so just to follow-on what John said, we're working on a root cause analysis just to understand, are we seeing a structural change in well failures, we've seen a reduction in ESP run times, but we're doing a broader look at that. And to put some numbers on John's comment, on base level of work over inventory, that typically represents about 5,000 barrels a day of production that's offline at any given time. We've seen that increase to over 10,000 barrels a day, really from the end of the second quarter through today. So we've added a work over rig. We're doing some other things to start working that backlog down over time. Operator : With Roth MKM, Leo, your line is open. Go ahead. Leo Mariani : Hey guys just wanted to follow-up briefly on Egypt here. I think you guys maybe added a rig recently. I think you were at 17 earlier in the year, if I sort of got it right. So just curious, is that just because of lower North Sea activity or just kind of reallocating dollars here? And then I guess just in general, obviously there's been significant instability there kind of in that Sinai Peninsula area bordering Israel there with the conflict that's happening right now. I mean, do you guys have any concerns over potential spillover into Egypt and have you been kind of in contact with the Egyptian government regarding them? John Christmann : Yes. It's something that it's interesting. We're coming up on our 30th anniversary of being in Egypt. So we've got a great history there. We've been there a long time and we've been through watched Egypt go through a lot of trying times. This year has been difficult for them and it's really been driven more by inflation and currency devaluation and some of those factors. We're closely monitoring the situation. I think the good thing from our perspective is our operations are all West of Cairo into the Western desert. And if you go back in history, even over the Arab Spring, we have not had any shut-ins or major interruption in our operations. So I think the good news there is the government continues to prioritize oil and gas operations. They know they need the in country production and we've been watching things very, very closely, so. Leo Mariani : Okay. That's helpful. And then, in terms of the $150 million in exploration next year, I don't want to beat a dead horse here, but as you kind of looking at that at a high level in your mind, does that include some dollars in Suriname at this point or is that just sort of kind of still an open ended proposition? John Christmann : It's in general right now; it's a placeholder for the things we want to do. But there's seismic that'll be being shot in Suriname in the where would be the development area, some other things. So it'll capture our exploration spend for next year and we'll come back with more details in February. Operator : And our next question comes from Geoff Jay with Daniel Energy Partners. Go ahead, Geoff. Geoff Jay : Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. Really my question is around U.S. oil production, which looks like it's taken a pretty impressive step change. I mean, obviously you completed some more wells but obviously several quarters where it was just kind of locked into the 70s. Now we've taken this 8,000 barrel a day step-up in Q3. And I'm wondering a) what changed and b) if there's something that's happened that has kind of prompted this decision to add another rig in the Delaware. Thanks. John Christmann : There I mean it's really just a continuous program. I mean, we're seeing the benefit of the deliberate approach we've taken. We've been focused on long laterals and really locking the rig lines down and giving the teams time to execute and you're seeing that we've continued to drill long laterals and we're continuing to have good results. It's really just a function of the timing of the completions. In terms of adding the sixth rig, it's really more allocation of capital from the North Sea into the Permian. And -- but we look forward to continuing to deliver strong results. And if you look fourth quarter is a little flattish compared to third quarter. A lot of that's because third quarter is running ahead versus fourth quarter running behind. So we're very, very pleased with the execution level in the U.S. Operator : I am showing no further questions at this time. So this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back to John Christmann, President and CEO, for closing remarks. John Christmann : Yes. Thank you for participating on our call this morning. I want to leave you with the following thoughts. We've completed a successful appraisal program in Suriname at Sapakara and Krabdagu and will advance a project through the feed process during 2024. In Egypt, gross oil production continues to increase on the success of our drilling program. And lastly, we continue to deliver outstanding results in the Permian, where we've added a sixth rig which will add to the momentum as we enter 2024. We look forward to telling you more about the things in February and thank you for the call. Operator : And this does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Gary Clark, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gary Clark : Good morning, and thank you for joining us on APA Corporation's Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2023 Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO, John Christmann. Steve Riney, President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results and outlook. Also on the call and available to answer questions are Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President of Development; Tracey Henderson, Executive Vice President of Exploration; and Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations. Our prepared remarks will be about 15 minutes in length, with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you've had the opportunity to review our financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apacorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude noncontrolling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss on today's call. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. Also, please note that the forward guidance we provided with our fourth quarter results reflects our outlook for APA Corporation on a stand-alone basis only and does not incorporate pro forma effects of the pending Callon Petroleum acquisition.  And with that, I will turn the call over to John. John Christmann : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call today, I will review our key accomplishments in 2023, comment on fourth quarter performance and provide an overview of our 2024 plans and objectives. APA has a long-standing strategic framework for managing our business that emphasizes investing capital with a focus on long-term full-cycle returns, pursuing moderate sustainable production growth, strengthening the balance sheet to underpin significant cash returns to shareholders, responsibly managing costs, including rightsizing the organization commensurate with lower activity levels, growing inventory, both organically through existing play expansion and new area exploration, and more recently, building scale and/or adding inventory inorganically through acquisitions such as Callon. We have patiently employed this strategy through periods of considerable price volatility, and our approach going forward will remain unchanged.  Looking at APA's results, there were a number of highlights in 2023. The more notable achievements include on the whole, delivering on all of our production and financial metrics very close to original guidance. Egypt gross oil production lagged expectations for most of the year, but this was offset by continued strong performance from the Permian. Free cash flow generation of nearly $1 billion, 66% of which was returned to shareholders. We repurchased $329 million of common stock and paid $308 million in dividends. Adjusted oil production increased 4% from the fourth quarter 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2023, driven by Midland and Delaware production, which was up in excess of 20% over the same time period. We successfully appraised the Sapakara and Krabdagu discoveries on Block 58 in Suriname, identifying an estimated 700 million barrels of recoverable oil resource. On the ESG front, we now have implemented more than 70% of the projects necessary to achieve our 2022 goal of eliminating 1 million tons of annual CO2 equivalent emissions by the end of this year. Additionally, we replaced or converted more than 2,000 pneumatic devices in the United States during 2023, which aligns with our priority to reduce methane emissions across our operations.  And lastly, I want to recognize our operation teams for delivering the lowest recordable incident rate since we began tracking and reporting this metric. We highly value this commitment to safety and excellence, and thank you for your continued diligence on this front. Moving to fourth quarter results. Upstream capital investment of $520 million was slightly above guidance, as we spent $27 million on the initial phase of our winter exploration program in Alaska. The U.S. delivered another strong quarter, with oil production in line with guidance and up 12% compared to the fourth quarter last year. Throughout 2023, our 5-rig drilling program was highly efficient, meeting or exceeding all key performance metrics. Similarly, well connections and well performance were in line with or better than expectations. Our Midland and Delaware Basin teams are driving outstanding results, and we expect that will continue this year. In the North Sea, production for the quarter was below guidance due to unplanned compression downtime at both Beryl Alpha and Forties during the month of December. And in Egypt, adjusted production exceeded guidance, primarily due to higher natural gas production and the positive impact of lower oil prices on volumes within the PSC construct.  Gross oil production, however, was lower than expected for a few reasons. For several quarters now, we have been working through some activity delays and scheduling constraints associated with limited available workover rig capacity in Egypt. In addition to routine well maintenance and uphole recompletions, we also utilize workover rigs for completing many of our new drill wells. With the increased size and improving efficiency of our drilling program, the demand for workover rigs to complete new wells has exceeded expectations. This meant the workover rigs were doing fewer recompletions than planned and our workover backlog increased throughout the year. Thus, while production from the new wells was a bit better than expectations, Egypt gross oil volumes fell behind as we could not adequately support the recompletion and workover programs. Compounding this, we also experienced a number of early life failures on new electrical submersible pumps known as ESPs. During 2023, we had 9 new wells impacted by early ESP failures, 2 of which occurred in the fourth quarter on high-volume wells. We have traced this problem to 1 manufacturing facility, and the situation is in the process of being remediated. In 2024, we will gear down the Egypt drilling program a bit, which will free up workover rig capacity to reduce the workover and recompletion backlog. I will say more about the effects of this on 2024 activity in a few minutes. Turning now to our 2024 outlook. Given the potential for a flat to lower price environment this year, we have established an activity plan and budget based on $70 WTI and $75 Brent. We continue to diligently manage overhead and operating costs, and we are reducing our total capital investment to less than $2 billion. This includes approximately $100 million of investment for exploration activities and $50 million for FEED work and potential long-lead items in Suriname. This year's budget will redirect capital to the Permian Basin, resulting in reduced Egypt drilling program, which I mentioned earlier. The outcome of this investment profile should be relatively flat year-over-year adjusted oil and natural gas production, but lower NGL volumes given our current plans to reject ethane. As in 2023, we expect robust Permian oil production growth to roughly offset production declines in the North Sea, while Egypt adjusted production remains relatively flat. In the U.S., total volumes will be up about 2% on a BOE basis despite our current plan to reject ethane for the entirety of 2024. We also project a strong finish to the year, with U.S. oil production up more than 10% in the fourth quarter of '24 compared to the fourth quarter of '23. This growth will be driven by the Midland and Delaware Basins, where we expect to achieve our goal of returning oil production to pre-COVID levels by year-end.  In Egypt, we anticipate that our moderated pace of drilling will result in a gross oil production decline. However, adjusted production should remain relatively flat year-over-year, primarily due to lower oil price expectations and the moderating effects of the PSC. And in the North Sea, with our significant reduction in capital investment prompted by the energy profits levy, we anticipate a roughly 20% year-over-year production decrease. This includes the effect of a lengthy planned maintenance turnaround that will impact both second and third quarter volumes. Before closing, I'd like to take a minute to highlight our performance in the Permian and provide some thoughts on our pending acquisition of Callon Petroleum. For several years now, APA's Permian operations have been hitting on all cylinders and exceeding oil production guidance. We have delivered continuous improvement in well productivity and capital efficiency, and we expect this to continue in 2024. Since 2019, we have invested considerable time and technical resources in optimizing our drilling economics in the Permian Basin, and the results have been excellent. Our Midland Basin well productivity has moved up into the top quartile producers as measured by third-party analysts, and we continue to improve Delaware Basin productivity measures each year. The Callon acquisition we announced in early January will bring scale to our Delaware position and balance to our overall Permian asset base, making it fairly evenly weighted between the Midland and the Delaware upon closing. While Callon has experienced operational and productivity challenges in the past, more recently, they have begun to make good progress towards demonstrating the upside potential of their acreage. By leveraging APA's technical capabilities and work processes across the Callon acreage, we expect to further build on their progress, most notably in the areas of capital productivity from well spacing, target zone selection, frac design and drilling, completion and infrastructure efficiencies.  When we first announced the acquisition, we assigned only $55 million to operational synergies and improvements. However, we are confident that there is substantial upside to this number. While the transaction is accretive on cost synergies alone, the big win-win for shareholders of both companies will be the integration of the assets into a larger Permian platform and the technical optimization, capital allocation, process knowledge and discipline that APA brings to the table. We look forward to updating our 2024 U.S. guidance upon completion of the transaction.  In closing, we are managing the business with a clear and consistent strategy, adhering to our discipline and delivering on our commitments and financial objectives. In the last 3 years, we have reduced outstanding bond debt by $3.2 billion and repurchased $2.6 billion or 20% of our shares outstanding. Our Permian Basin and Egypt operations are delivering a high level of free cash flow, along with moderate oil growth in aggregate. We have progressed a large-scale exploration and appraisal program in Suriname to FEED study, and we believe this will drive high-margin oil production beginning in the 2028 time frame. And more recently, we have further expanded our exploration portfolio with large-scale opportunities in Alaska and offshore Uruguay.  While the industry may experience some near-term commodity price weakness, we maintain a constructive medium- and long-term outlook. Accordingly, we will continue to invest a measured amount of capital in the differential longer-term exploration opportunities. And lastly, we remain fully committed to returning at least 60% of our free cash flow to shareholders through our base dividend and share buybacks. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney. Stephen Riney : Thank you, John, and good morning. For the fourth quarter, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, APA reported consolidated net income of $1.8 billion or $5.78 per diluted common share. As usual, these results include items that are outside of core earnings, the most significant of which was a $1.6 billion increase in net income related to the partial release of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset. This was offset by a $167 million after-tax increase in the estimated net remaining decommissioning obligation for the old Fieldwood assets in the Gulf of Mexico. Excluding these and other smaller items, adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was $352 million or $1.15 per share.  Free cash flow was $292 million in the quarter. Through dividends and share repurchases, we returned 68% of this amount to shareholders during the quarter. And as John noted, for the full year, we returned 66% of free cash flow. Please refer to APA's published definition of free cash flow for any reconciliation needs.  G&A expense for the quarter was $75 million. This was significantly below guidance, mostly due to the decrease in the APA share price and the mark-to-market impact on previously accrued share-based compensation. In the fourth quarter, our Cheniere gas sales contract contributed free cash flow and pretax net income of $74 million, which was below guidance, as LNG margins over Houston Ship Channel narrowed through the quarter.  Turning to 2024. John already discussed our capital and production guidance, so I will just touch on a few other items of note. Based on recent strip prices, we currently anticipate our Cheniere contract will contribute cash flow of about $100 million for the full year and third-party marketing income related to our gas transport obligations will be roughly breakeven. In the Gulf of Mexico, our remaining Fieldwood-related decommissioning exposure is now $815 million. This is net of remaining security and anticipated future cash flows from the producing properties. These decommissioning costs are estimated to be incurred over the next 10 to 15 years, and in 2024, will amount to around $60 million. Finally, we are preparing for the closing of the Callon acquisition, with a joint integration team working through plans for day 1 and beyond. John already indicated our confidence in meeting or exceeding our $55 million goal for annual operational synergies. We are equally focused on the transition of G&A activities and the refinancing of the Callon debt. At this time, we still expect the sum of the G&A and financing synergies will meet or exceed our goal of $95 million on an annualized basis. A majority of the G&A synergies are expected to be realized on a run rate basis shortly after closing, with a small portion requiring a transition period, which may take up to a few months. The financing synergies will be realized within a few days of closing, with the refinancing of the Callon debt planned and ready to be put into effect.  We noted at the time of the acquisition announcement that the assumption of Callon's debt would increase our leverage metrics slightly. This has had no adverse impact on our discussions with the rating agencies, nor on their published outlooks. We continue to target a BBB rating or the equivalent thereof with all 3 agencies. For this reason, we remain focused on further debt reduction, which will be achieved through the application of cash flow and possible asset divestments. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Thank you. John, good morning, and Steve, it's always interesting to hear how the operator tackles it, but I'll take that. Egypt, it sounds like you've identified the issue. Can you give us some idea as to what the point forward resolution is then? When can you anticipate that? I mean, ESPs should be -- sounds like a really simple issue to solve. Now you've identified it. I mean, why would you not get back on a growth trajectory once this is resolved? I guess that's what I'm really trying to figure out, what do you see as the go-forward outlook? Take your time line, 3-year, 5-year, whatever, and when do you anticipate this turning around? John Christmann : Yes, Doug, I'll first start off and say the ESPs was kind of the second factor and kind of piled on. The underlying factor is just the ratio of the workover rigs to the drilling rigs. And these aren't just normal pulling units. These are good sized workover rigs. And if you go back historically, we've usually run close to 2x to 3x, the workover rigs to the drilling rig count. As we've said, we use these workover rigs to complete new wells, to perform the recompletions and do the workovers. And our ratio really has been just slightly over 1. And so we're ratcheting back, kind of gearing down the rig program. We're still going to run 13 to 15 rigs. So it's not a major reduction, but we want to get the workover count work down. We've got a very large asset base there, and it's important that we're getting to the key workovers and the recompletions that underpin those decline rates. And so there's no reason to keep drilling more wells quicker and piling more ducks into the system right now, it's just not the most efficient use of capital given the workover rigs. On the sub pumps, you're exactly right. These were the high rate sub pumps that we needed as we brought on 9 big wells last year. There was a problem with the manufacturing. We've identified that, and we are in the process of fixing that. So that will get straightened out and is being addressed right now. But it's really more a function of trying to balance the workover rigs and the number of wells we're drilling with the drilling rigs on a go-forward basis to kind of get into equilibrium to make sure we're investing the capital wisely and efficiently and getting the most out of it.  So once we work that down, I mean, I'd say today, we estimate we've got close to 13,000 barrels a day that's offline that needs to be worked over. We usually run around 5,000 barrels a day. So there's about 8,000 barrels a day there we need to work down and it's going to take a number of workovers and projects to do that. So we're on it. I think once we get into a good equilibrium point, then we can revisit the rig count at a later date. Doug Leggate : And on the medium-term production outlook, can you touch on that? John Christmann : We're just going to guide to flat adjusted production, net production for Egypt for now. Doug Leggate : Okay. We'll watch that. Gosh, I'm kind of torn as to where to go. I wanted to ask about Callon, but I don't imagine we're going to get much more from that today. So I would like to ask Tracey maybe about the exploration program. We only have to look back at some of your peers on what exploration did for their portfolios. And it seems to us, exploration never gets outlook until you've got something to show for it. So characterized for me, please, how you see the risk profile? Alaska specifically, I believe, is near field exploration, you're going to have 3 wells this quarter, I guess. So what -- I'm assuming you're already halfway through those wells. What are you seeing currently? How would you characterize the risk profile of your [indiscernible]? John Christmann : Yes. I mean I'll stop in, just a few things on Alaska, Doug, and then I'll hand it over to Tracey. But one, it's a large, underexplored area. As we put in the supplement today, it's 275,000 acres on state lands. It is highly prospective for what's become a proven play. And Tracey can get into some details into that in a minute. We are planning to drill 3 wells this winter. We are very close to spudding the first well. So we're not halfway through any of them at this point, but it's going to get fun here pretty fast. So Tracey, I'll let you talk a little bit more about the program. Tracey Henderson : Sure. I'll carry on from what John has mentioned about the exploration program first. And then just give a couple of comments, I think, on your initial question around a little more insight onto the program. I think as John said, in Alaska, it's a position that sits between Prudhoe Bay and ANWR in the Brookian plays. So we've entered into an area where we have analogs there that have worked, but are looking and exploring in an area where that particular play has not really been explored for. So we're testing in a region where play has worked in an under-explored region. As you said, we're drilling 3 wells this season. All of those will spud in Q1, and we'll come back with an update on that once we've completed this season's drilling program.  I think in terms of just the portfolio, if you look -- we talk a lot about play diversification and portfolio diversification. And I think what you're seeing us build is optionality both in risk with some areas that are more proven, with some areas that are going to be more exploration based like the Uruguay licenses that we entered last year. So what we're really seeking to do is build a portfolio that will give us play diversity both in types of plays, onshore, offshore and with risk through time, both in near-term optionality like we're seeing in Alaska and longer-term optionality like we're seeing in Uruguay. So more to come on Alaska in the near term later this year. John Christmann : And Doug, 1 more thing on your first question. We're limited in Egypt with the number of workover rigs that are in-country. So you're not in the U.S. where you can just go pick up workover rigs and pull in units. We're dealing with a constrained resource there. And so we have to kind of gear around that at this point. Operator : Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Neal, your line is open. Please check your mute button. Neal Dingmann : Hello. Can you hear me? John Christmann : Yes. Neal Dingmann : My first question is also on Egypt. Specifically, I want to understand -- definitely discuss and understand the need for the activity change in the region. John, can you just speak a little bit about what you're seeing on the recent well performance and productivity there versus last year? It seems to still be quite good. I would love to hear more color on that. John Christmann : Yes, Neal, the '23 program really performed in line as expected. So the new wells were good. We even had some -- what I'll call some really high success in the Barnes area, where we had the potential to bring on some high-impact wells. We just ran into some challenges on the ESP. So program has been good and the new well program is in line. So it's all about getting the balance together and just ratcheting back a little bit until we can go faster at a later date. Neal Dingmann : No, that makes sense. And then the second question just on the Permian. While I appreciate still not having yet the pro forma Callon guidance, are you able to say anything about just sort of broader decisions if you just simply add the D&C of your activity with theirs? Or I'm just wondering, maybe it's too early for that. And if it is too early for that, could you maybe instead just talk about the cadence, how we should think about the existing activity there this year? John Christmann : Yes. I mean as we sit today, we're limited on the company, the company interaction we have. We -- both companies have integration teams that are set up on the transition side, and so we're working through that. And as you clear certain hurdles, we can start to interact more. But at this point, we're working towards having a very smooth closing and transition. And we really believe that should take place sometime in the second quarter.  When you look at our operations, we'll be running 6 rigs Permian this year. They're running 5, and we'll start out with those 11 rigs, and we're very comfortable running those 11 rigs and really look forward to being able to integrate the Callon assets into our workflow and our schedules and so forth, but that's going to take a little bit of time. So as you know, we've been delivering outstanding results. And we're anxious to jump on their Delaware assets in addition to what we're doing in the Delaware and our Midland Basin. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Robert Brackett : All right. I think that's for Bob Brackett? John Christmann : Yes, Bob, you're good to go. Robert Brackett : Excellent. Following up with Alaska, kind of a 2-part question around setting expectations of what you're trying to do with this program and when you might be finished. In terms of what you're trying to do, it looks like this is a stratigraphic test more than anything and maybe a VSP to get some seismic control. And it looks like you guys have to kind of be done and off the ice end of April, and therefore, you might have some results by then? Is that fair? John Christmann : Yes, Bob, as you know, you're limited on the winter window, and we are getting ready to get started with the first well. And we'll actually have 3 rigs drilling kind of simultaneously pretty quickly. So we do anticipate being able to get 3 wells down prior to breakup. Robert Brackett : And these are stratigraphic tests? John Christmann : Yes. You've got -- I mean, Tracey can say a few words, but you've got good seismic control. And they're fully supported. So we feel good about them, but it is exploration. Operator : Our next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles Meade : John, to you, Steve, Tracey and the rest of the APA team there. John, my first question, I want to pick up, right, where you kind of left off, I think on 1 of the first questions about Egypt saying that more workover rigs was not -- is not an option that you're limited there. Is that a -- is there a time frame for that? In other words, I understand you might not be able to get 1 in 3 months. But maybe in 12 months, you could get a couple more workover rigs. So is that a possibility? And then the other aspect of that is -- you look at try to debottleneck your system, is there a possibility that you could bring in some wireline or coiled tubing to offload some of the work items on your workover rigs? John Christmann : Charles, I'd just say, first of all, short term, there's not any real options. And obviously, the -- there are several avenues and things we've explored and been exploring. But getting equipment into a country like Egypt takes time. And so at this point, we don't have any real near-term options, and it's something we'd be happy to talk about later if we find a solution. But right now, we're just -- we're limited to the 20 workover rigs that we currently have. Charles Meade : Got it. Got it. I appreciate it. And then back to Alaska. I saw -- I read that 1 of your partners there referred to the prospects that you're going to test as Pika lookalikes. And Pika being the Santos development that went FID in '22. So I guess I'm -- I'm curious, would you agree with that characterization? And for those of us who are just coming up to speed and learning about this, can you offer some details on what -- if you agree, is a Pika -- that the prospects are Pika lookalikes? What that means? Tracey Henderson : Sure. Tracey. Thanks, Charles. I'll weigh in on that one. Yes, I would agree with that. We're really looking at more play types like Pika and Willow versus Prudhoe Bay. And we're exploring that, and that is part of the Brookian play that we're exploring it for, but we're going to be exploring for it in a younger sequence, but it's absolutely sort of the same geologic model and setup that we expect to see basically just a bit further east than it's been explored for on the other side of Prudhoe Bay. So we would agree with that. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : John and Tracey, happy to apologize. First, if we can go back to Alaska. Let's assume the program is successful. What's the next step? And what kind of infrastructure you need to put on in order for that to be able to grow? And what is the time line on that? John Christmann : Yes. First of all, Paul, thanks for the question. I'll just say we're in the exploration phase at this point. So we've done a lot of scoping. It's onshore, it's state land, so things can move a little quicker than federal there. You're close to big pipeline capacity. But let's work through the exploration phase, see what we find and then go from there at a later date. So -- but we're excited about it. Paul Cheng : But can you maybe share that -- what type of infrastructure we've been needing if it is successful? John Christmann : Well, a lot of that will hinge on, these are 3 separate tests of similar play concepts. And a lot of that would just hinge on what we found. So at this point, we're purely in an exploration phase. And we'll just have to come back and give you some characterization if we have the success there that we hope we have. Paul Cheng : I see. On Egypt, I just curious that, John, is the workover availability issue just happen, something happened in the country and that what used to be available no longer available? Or that your own need for the workover rig have just increased substantially last year? And if that's the case then, is that something that's happening in the rest of that, that led to that? John Christmann : Yes. I would just say, historically, we were running -- if you go back to pre-modernization, we are running 5 drilling rigs and 12 workover rigs. We took the rig count up more than 3x to 15 to 18, and we were only able to take the workover rig count up to 20. So we could only double that when we tripled the drilling set. And -- so initially, it wasn't a major problem because we were trying to get the efficiencies lined out on the drilling side. But as we got the efficiencies lined out on the drilling side, the workover rigs they were required to complete the drilling wells. And ultimately, we've got to make sure we're managing the base. So it's just -- it's a new phenomenon. And it's something that ultimately longer term, we're going to need more workover equipment in country. And there's just not a good short-term fix to that. Operator : Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Yes. First question I had was just on Suriname. Maybe you could step back, John, big picture, talk about where we stand here. And we know we've got the FEED study that you're working through and you're targeting an FID in 2024. But what are you focused on as it relates to Suriname and any updates as it relates to that project? John Christmann : Neil, first of all, thanks for the question. Secondly, that's exactly where we sit today. We're working with Total. They're in FEED study. We've kind of laid a time line out there that we anticipate an FID before year-end, '24, which is this year, which is great news. And then as of right now, we would say first oil in '28. But I can tell you, our partner and us are working hard to try to accelerate those time lines. But that's where we are at this point. So we remain excited. We do see additional exploration potential in Block 58. But right now, we've kind of got most of the attention on the move in the first development project forward. Neil Mehta : And then the follow-up, we haven't really talked in Q&A about the U.S. production profile over the course of the year. Just maybe talk about your Permian plans. It sounds like it's going to be a little bit back half weighted with strong growth exit to exit. So just any thoughts on Permian oil and navigating the weakness, obviously, in local gas prices there, too. John Christmann : Neil, we've had a number a good run of years of really outperformance in the Permian. And when you're running 5 to 6 rigs, which is what we've done, then it becomes very pad dominated in terms of your timing and your sequences. And yes, we don't have a number of -- very many wells coming on early this year. Things are kind of second and third quarter back weighted with the way the schedule works. And so you'll see strong Permian growth on the oil side. We're anticipating up 10%, Q4 '24 over '23. And that's going to more than offset the decline in the North Sea. So continues to be underpin our backbone, and we're going to continue to lean on Permian. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Securities. Arun Jayaram : I wanted to first see if you could talk about the payment situation in Egypt. We did see an improvement in the working capital situation in the quarter. But Steve, maybe you could provide an update on where you stand in terms of ARO and how the collection trends have been with the Egyptian government? Stephen Riney : Yes, Arun, as you know, we've talked about this a number of times since every quarter. We have a very active and constructive working relationship with Egypt, but it does require that ongoing conversation and work of the issue. Fourth quarter, we ended fourth quarter with our lowest quarter end past due receivables for the year from EGPC. And so we continue to make progress. They've come down through the year. They kind of peaked in early second quarter. Today, we're about 25% to 30% below where we were at that peak level. So they're still elevated, past due receivables still elevated from EGPC, but they're lower and trending in the right direction, have been pretty much through the whole year. Arun Jayaram : Great to hear. And Steve, my follow-up is I wanted to go -- if you could go to Slide 30 in the deck. And just talk about -- I want to understand a little bit more about the abandonment cost impact to cash flow. Your costs incurred for the year were $979 million. Your total upstream capital is $520 million. Most of the delta is to ARO. So in 4Q, did you all have an outflow for that, call it, $347 million for ARO? And is $60 million, what you mentioned in 2024, maybe a good run rate for the next several years? Stephen Riney : So you're talking about the ARO for Fieldwood? Arun Jayaram : Yes, sir. Slightly... Stephen Riney : So that does not go through the capital program there. It's -- there's a booked liability on the decommissioning obligation there. And so it doesn't go through the capital program, that doesn't show up as capital expenditure. Arun Jayaram : Right. So -- but I'm looking at the costs incurred, which were $979 million in the quarter. Were there any outflows associated -- or maybe you could quantify the magnitude of outflows with ARO in 2023? Stephen Riney : Yes. Can we -- maybe we could just take that offline instead of reconciling through the group here. I'll work with Gary to get back in touch with you. We can work through. I just want to make sure we understand the question. Arun Jayaram : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks, Steve. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Leo Mariani with ROTH MKM. Leo Mariani : Just wanted to kind of get back to the exploration discussion here. Just wanted to see if you guys could provide a little bit more color on kind of the risk profile in Alaska. I mean do you see these wells as kind of 1 in 2 shots, kind of 1 in 5? Just anything you could do to quantify some of the risk profile would be helpful. And then on just Block 53 in Suriname, it looks like you relinquished most of that block. Just any update on the thinking there. John Christmann : Yes, Leo, I'll jump to Suriname first. I think we've been pretty clear that we see more exploration upside remaining in Block 58 versus Block 53. And so it was an easy answer to go ahead and let 53 go. When you look at the risk profile on Alaska, these are 3D and amplitude supported, but you're going to be -- this is a step out in an area where there's risk associated with it. So I'm not going to give you a number on a ratio, but it is exploration. We're taking -- we're going to drill 3 wells. And they are risky, but they're high reward. So -- and I don't know, Tracey, anything you want to add to that? Tracey Henderson : Yes, I'll just comment, I think, on a little on both pieces, which is the Block 53 exit. I think we saw -- we mentioned on the previous call that we really saw the prospectivity in Block 58 as being more prospective than what we saw in Block 53. So what you're seeing with that exit really is strategic portfolio management and continuous high-grading of the portfolio where we saw more prospectivity both in Block 58 and in other opportunities that we had in front of us. And I would just echo what John said on Alaska. There's -- we have a range because these are exploration prospects that have risk associated with them. But clearly, what interested us in the block is that we do see materiality with these prospects that we -- warranted expiration. Leo Mariani : Okay. That's helpful. And I just wanted to follow up on some of the comments that you guys made here. I just wanted to make sure I understood this. Did I hear a comment that APA might be adjusting its headcount a little bit downward in response to some of the lower activity levels? I know clearly that once you guys integrate Callon, I'm sure you'll have to take a fresh look at the whole organization. But did I hear that right, but perhaps you think that maybe you might cut some of the APA headcount here at some point? John Christmann : I mean, I'll just say, we're always looking to rightsize organization with activity levels. I think the comment in the prepared remarks was that we find ourselves in a much lower price environment. We're always wanting to reduce activity and associated staff if we need to do so. But we have gone through an exercise in the North Sea as we're kind of rightsizing for late life. And so we have gone through some steps there. But we're, quite frankly, very excited about integrating the Callon assets and pulling those into the organization. And we do see some synergies there, but activity levels are still going to be strong and relatively close to where we were last year. Operator : Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to John Christmann, CEO, for closing remarks. John Christmann : Yes. Thank you. We have chosen to reduce our capital this year and maintain roughly flat production given the potential for a lower commodity price environment while still funding our strategic initiatives. We have intentionally directed more capital towards the Permian, which is performing at an extremely high level. And we look forward to integrating the Callon assets into our Permian operations as well. And lastly, we will keep you up to date on our progress in Suriname and our other exploration plays. Thank you, operator. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker for today, Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Gary Clark : Good morning, and thank you for joining us on APA Corporation's First Quarter 2024 Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO, John Christmann. Steve Riney, President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results and outlook. Also on the call and available to answer questions are Tracey Henderson, Executive Vice President of Exploration; and Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations. Our prepared remarks will be about 15 minutes in length, with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apacorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude noncontrolling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss on today's call. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. Please note that the first quarter 2024 results reflect APA Corp. only as the Callon acquisition was subsequently closed on April 1. Accordingly, our full year 2024 guidance reflects first quarter APA results on a stand-alone basis, plus 3/4 of APA and Callon combined. And with that, I will turn the call over to John. John Christmann : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call today, I will review our first quarter performance, discuss the compelling opportunities we are seeing after the closing of the Callon acquisition and review our activity plan and production expectations for the remainder of 2024. During the first quarter, Upstream capital investment of $568 million was below guidance due primarily to the deferral of some planned facility, leasehold and exploration spend. We continue to deliver excellent results in the Permian Basin with the first quarter marking our fifth consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding U.S. oil production guidance. U.S. oil volumes were up an impressive 16% compared to the first quarter of 2023, and we expect organic growth to continue through the year as we integrate talent. On the natural gas side, we chose to curtail a substantial amount of production at Alpine High, primarily in March in response to extreme Waha basis differentials. This dynamic has continued into the second quarter. In Egypt, gross production was in line with our expectations, while adjusted volumes were just shy of guidance due to the PSC impact of higher-than-planned oil prices. As discussed previously, we are in the process of rebalancing our drilling rig to workover rig ratio in Egypt to further optimize capital efficiency. In the first quarter, we averaged 17 drilling rigs and 21 workover rigs. While the workover rig count will remain flat, we will reduce the drilling rig count over the next 3 quarters, allowing workover rigs to be redirected. The amount of oil production temporarily off-line and waiting on workover remained at around 12,000 barrels per day during the quarter. We expect to make progress on this as the drilling rig count comes down and freeze up workover resources. The challenges we experienced in the fourth quarter 2023 with faulty new electrical submersible pumps have now been fully remediated through vendor change-out and design modifications. Turning to the North Sea. First quarter production was impacted by a decrease in average facility run time at barrel in March. As a reminder, this type of downtime tends to occur more frequently and is less predictable when managing late-life assets like those we have in the North Sea. On the exploration front, we recently concluded our 3-well Alaska exploration drilling program. As a reminder, our 275,000 acre position lies on state lands, roughly 70 to 90 miles east of analogous industry discoveries. Our King Street #1 well confirmed a working petroleum system on our acreage, discovering oil in 2 separate zones. The other 2 wells, Sockeye #1 and Voodoo #1 were unable to reach their target objectives in the allotted seasonal time window due to a number of weather and operational delays. We are currently analyzing all the data and we'll come back later with more commentary on next steps in Alaska. Lastly, in Suriname, we are progressing the FID study on our first development project, which we hope to FID before the end of the year. Turning now to the Callon acquisition, which closed on April 1. We are 1 month into the integration process and are making very good progress. As anticipated, we are finding tremendous opportunities to reduce costs, improve efficiencies, leverage economies of scale and create value by applying our operational expertise and unconventional development workflows to the Callon acreage. Accordingly, we have increased our estimate of annual cost synergies by 50% from $150 million to $225 million. Steve will comment further on the timing and nature of these synergies in his remarks. The most exciting and compelling value capture opportunity we see with Callon still lies ahead. That will come from capital efficiency improvements which will enhance overall development economics and potentially expand the development inventory that form the basis of our transaction value. For the remainder of 2024, we will be revising most of Callon's operational practices and workflows. This includes everything from contracting and logistics to well planning and design, drilling and completions, facility construction and many aspects of daily operations. At a high level, you will see wider well spacing, fewer discrete landing zones and larger fracture stimulations. Improvements in capital efficiency will manifest in fewer wells to deliver the same amount of incremental production volumes. While it will take some time to realize the full benefit of these changes, the implementation has already begun. In the meantime, we are modifying many aspects of Callon's previous 2024 plan to capture as much near-term benefit as possible. Turning now to our activity plans and outlook for 2024. In yesterday's release, we provided guidance for the second quarter and full year 2024, along with our expected oil production rates for the fourth quarter. In the U.S., we have been running 11 rigs in the Permian since April 1. We expect to average approximately 10 for the remainder of this year as we actively manage changes to the combined rig fleet. You will see the rig count change as we drop some rigs when their term ends and pick up other rigs more suitable for the planned drilling program. Similarly, we will be making a number of adjustments to our combined frac schedule. In terms of oil volumes, we noted in our first quarter materials that we expect U.S. oil production in the fourth quarter to be around 152,000 barrels per day which represents an 11% growth rate from our second quarter guide of 137,000 barrels per day. Switching now to Egypt. In February, we commented that adjusted production would remain relatively flat in 2024. Today, we anticipate adjusted production will decrease slightly as a function of the PSC impacts of higher-than-planned oil prices. And in the North Sea, production guidance for the full year is unchanged with an expected dip mostly in the third quarter as we conduct scheduled platform maintenance. In closing, we continue to manage our business with a clear and consistent strategy and deliver on our capital return commitments and financial objectives. The Callon acquisition is complete and the path to value creation is clear and well underway. Post Callon, our Permian Basin unconventional acreage footprint has increased by approximately 45% and our Permian Basin oil production has increased by more than 65%. The Permian Basin will represent an estimated 73% of APA's total company adjusted production in the second quarter and will approximate 75% of our Upstream capital this year. Notably, our oil production weighting in the U.S. will increase to projected 46% in the second quarter from 39% on a stand-alone basis in the first quarter. Finally, Steve will discuss our priorities around debt reduction, but I want to emphasize that our shareholder return framework has not changed, and we will continue to return at least 60% of our free cash flow via dividends and share repurchases. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney. Stephen Riney : Thank you, John, and good morning. For the first quarter, under generally accepted accounting principles, APA reported consolidated net income of $132 million or $0.44 per diluted common share. As usual, these results include items that are outside of core earnings, the most significant of which was a $52 million after-tax addition to the provision for costs associated with Gulf of Mexico abandonment liabilities. Excluding this and other smaller items, adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was $237 million or $0.78 per share. The resulting adjusted earnings for the quarter include some significant exploration dry hole expenses, specifically, we took a $59 million charge for the 2 exploration wells in Alaska, which were unable to reach their targets. Additionally, we wrote off the remaining $42 million we were carrying for the Bonboni exploration well in Suriname, which was drilled in 2021, as we now have no active plans for further exploration in the Northern portion of Block 58. The total after-tax impact of these items on adjusted earnings was $88 million or $0.29 per share. In the first quarter, we returned $176 million through dividends and share repurchases. As John indicated, we remain committed to returning a minimum 60% of free cash flow to shareholders. We are also cognizant of the need to strengthen the balance sheet, and we are looking at non-core asset sales as a source of debt reduction in addition to the 40% of free cash flow not designated for shareholder return. Our priorities for debt reduction will be the 3-year term loan we used to refinance the Callon debt and the revolver. Finally, we incurred roughly $20 million of costs associated with the Callon transaction in the first quarter and expect to incur an additional $90 million of such costs. The vast majority of which will be in the second quarter for professional services, departing Callon employees and other closing costs. Now let me turn to progress on the Callon integration. One month into the process, we are on track to realize more cost savings than originally projected. As John noted, we have revised our annual synergies from $150 million up to $225 million. Recall, we put expected synergies into 3 categories : overhead, cost of capital and operational. Annual overhead synergies have been revised up from $55 million to $70 million. This is moving quickly, and we will capture approximately 75% of this on a run rate basis by the end of the second quarter. We expect by year-end, nearly all of these synergies will be realized and our go-forward G&A run rate will be around $110 million per quarter. Expected annual cost of capital synergies are unchanged at $40 million. The initial refinancing of the Callon debt realized a portion of these synergies and they will be fully realized when the debt is termed out or paid off. We are seeing the greatest amount of opportunity in operational synergies. Our original estimate for this category was $55 million, which we have revised upward $115 million. We are making extremely good progress in this area, some of the more impactful items that we are working on include recontracting of frac services in rig high-grading, artificial lift optimization which will lower LOE and reduce downtime, supply chain synergies for casing and tubing, sand, chemicals and other items, compression fleet optimization and economies of scale and well design improvements that eliminate extra casing strings and reduced drilling days. Further down the road, we see additional potential in areas like gas marketing and transportation and water handling disposal and recycling. To reiterate, these cost synergy estimates do not include capital productivity effects associated with improvements in well type curves and economics through well spacing, landing zone optimization and frac size. Turning to our 2024 outlook. John has already discussed our activity plans and production guidance. So I will just touch on a few other items of note. Other than reflecting the Callon acquisition and our outlook, the most material change to guidance is associated with gas pricing in the Permian and its impact on expected near-term production and third-party gas marketing activities. As most of you are aware, Waha experienced severe basis differentials in March and April. We expect this will continue through much of May. As a result, we have continued to curtail gas into the second quarter and our 2Q guidance now reflects an estimated impact on the quarter of 50 million cubic feet per day of gas and 5,000 barrels per day of NGLs related to the weakness at Waha Hub. Our income from third-party oil and gas purchased and sold, including the Cheniere gas supply contract is expected to be around $230 million for the full year which is up significantly from our original guidance of $100 million. You will also see that we have removed DD&A from our guidance at this time. We are still working on the Callon purchase price allocation and aligning our reserve booking practices. We will reinstate DD&A guidance with the second quarter results. Finally, as a reminder, APA will be subject to the U.S. alternative minimum tax starting in 2024. We incurred no AMT in the first quarter and do not expect to in the second quarter. Based on current strip prices, we will likely incur these costs in the second half of the year. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Freeman of Raymond James. Your line is now open. John Freeman : The first question I had, just to make sure that I understand sort of the moving parts in Egypt. So last quarter had about 13,000 that was offline. I think normally, I think you all cited that, that would be closer to probably 8,000 -- I'm sorry, 5,000 would normally be offline. So you've worked it down a little bit, and I see how the rigs keep coming down, the workover rig level stays level. But I think historically, John you all said that used to be sort of 2x to 3x the number of workover rigs to drilling rigs. So even as the rig cadence goes down the rest of the year, you still stay well below that level. So maybe just help me understand how you can -- you get that backlog or what's off-line worked down despite still being a good bit below that historical ratio? Like maybe why that historical ratio maybe doesn't apply anymore? Or just any additional color there? John Christmann : No, it's a great question. And as you acknowledge, historically, we have run a higher ratio of workover rigs or drilling rigs. Today, we're going to average 13 to 15 on the drilling rig side this year, and we're going to run right at 20 workover rigs. So it's going to take a little bit more time to kind of chisel away at that, but we're on it. It's coming down a little bit. There's also things we're doing with the drilling rigs to be able to complete some wells, which will also help some of that pressure. So it's just going to take a little bit longer, which is why you'll see a gradual move down on that number. John Freeman : Got it. And then just shifting gears. Nice to see the 50% increase in the Callon synergies and obviously making a lot of progress on the cost side. You all put out previously a presentation just sort of showing all Permian results relative to legacy -- Callon results. And I guess -- it won't be until 4Q, and we get to see basically wells that you all kind of started design drill completed from the get-go show up in your numbers, and you mentioned some of the things that could drive to the better well productivity, wider spacing, et cetera. Just to be clear, you all guidance just assumes legacy Callon well results right? Like it doesn't assume any uplift. Is that correct in your current guidance? John Christmann : Yes. Today, the guidance is what's in front of us, right? And it's going to -- obviously, Callon's drilled a lot of wells. We're immediately making changes on the completion side to the extent we can. But there are more wells drilled per section that we would drill. There are more landing zones. And so we're going to have to pump similar-sized fracs in terms of sand loads. I think the big thing will be changing is the fluid volumes will go up, but we're doing things with -- it's kind of a work in progress, right? We start with what Callon has and we modify what we can and what we think is going to be impactful. And then by the time you get to the fourth quarter, you'll start to see how we plan things and what will be full Apache workflow on that. Just a little color in terms of where the rig count sits and things today. We're running 11 rigs, there's 4 in the Delaware, there's actually 7 in the Midland. We've actually moved 1 of the Callon rigs to some Apache acreage that was ready and kind of plan like we want to drill it. So we've accelerated some there. So it's going to be influx as we work through this. But yes, we're anxious to get to fully Apache planned workflow and execution. And it's going to be a kind of a transition over the next 2 quarters until we get to the fourth quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann of Truist Securities. Neal Dingmann : I just had a quick one first on the Permian gas play. It's interesting the acreage and the potential returns there. I'm just wondering what would it take for you to bring some of that back? Is it just strictly it needs to compete against your now more oily play given that Callon and the larger footprint? John Christmann : Well, I mean, that is the big driver. It needs to compete internally on the oil side. And really, we measure that through Waha. So right now, you've had very, very weak Waha. Obviously, we've got Matterhorn coming on, but we're going to need to see much stronger Waha and it's going to need to compete internally with our oil projects. Neal Dingmann : No, that totally makes sense. And then just, again, maybe last one for you or Steve, just when it comes to shareholder return, you guys have continued and maybe sometime towards the end of the year, stepped a bit more into the buybacks and all. I'm just wondering, will that plan change? Or should we just think sort of more of the same when it comes to shareholder return? John Christmann : No. I mean I think big picture. We're committed to the 60%, right? We've shown that it's a minimum of 60%. And we will lean into that when we believe there's weakness, which we've historically done, and we'll continue to do in the future. That gives us the other 40% for debt reduction. We do have some non-core asset sales that we're targeting as we do believe we need to make some progress on the debt side with what we brought on with Callon, but you'll see us aggressively approaching both. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum of TD Cowen. David Deckelbaum : I wanted to ask a couple of questions around the capital program this year and your preliminary thoughts getting into '25 as you further integrate the Callon assets. One, can you just talk about, in this year, how many DUCs you're intending to work down and what you would carry going into next year? And as a follow-up to that, if we think about the combined company this year, should we be assuming improved capital efficiencies into next year that would sort of have you on this glide path of combined companies spending in and around $3 billion a year. Stephen Riney : Yes. David, this is Steve. So in terms of the capital program and the treatment of DUCs, what we've done is we've added some frac capital in order to come up to the $2.7 billion of capital that we have in the plan for this year now. We basically just combined the final 3 quarters of Callon's remaining capital program with ours. But then we added some frac capital in the second half of the year because we did see that both of us were building DUCs. Now I think it's probably best that we not get into numbers at this point simply because the program is still, I'd say, very much in the flux as you go out towards the back half of the year. We're working our way through it. As John said, we are changing a lot of the activity. There's hardly any activity that's going on, on the Callon acreage later this year that we're not changing from the Callon plan. And so you can imagine after 4 weeks that, that's still a bit in flux. And so maybe we can share some -- a bit more clarity on things like that with the second quarter earnings call in August. I think that would be better just so we can be through a bit of this, and we can solidify the remaining plan for the year. But just as a general statement, we don't believe that it's good capital efficiency in general to be carrying a lot of DUCs. There are some value to having some DUCs and there's some just basic need because of the logistics of matching up frac schedules with drilling schedules, but we don't believe in the capital efficiency of having a tremendous amount of DUC inventory. John Christmann : And the only thing I would add is, obviously, we believe the capital productivity will improve on the Callon portion especially as we go to our modifications and our workflows back half of the year. So combined companies going to improve and we're seeing that productivity on the Apache side right now, and we'll get the Callon assets there towards the back half of the year. David Deckelbaum : Appreciate that. If I could make those first 2 questions, I guess, into one and ask another one. I'm just curious if you can share any targets that you might have in mind on proceeds or timing from non-core asset sales? Stephen Riney : No, we don't have any specific targets in mind. But what we recognize that even after the progress that we made in '21 and '22 on debt, for Apache Corp. We knew that we needed to make more progress and we didn't make as much as we might have wanted to during the intervening time, and we just feel like we need to get on with that and get debt down. And now that we've added some debt through the Callon acquisition, we're going to just try to focus on that this year. We think it's a good time to be doing that. The market seems to be strong for some of these non-core assets and we'll see if we can get some of those off and get some good prices, and they will be focused on debt reduction. We're optimistic about that. We think that it's a good time to be doing that. Ultimately, the -- sorry, ultimately, the target is to get debt to a point where we are kind of a solid BBB type of rating on our debt so that you're not kind of dancing around the edge of investment grade and non-investment grade. And we slid into non-investment grade in 2020 with the massive downturn in oil price and we haven't been able to climb back out of that, even though we're -- we have the metrics of a lot of investment-grade companies. We're still not investment grade with everybody. We've gotten there with 2, but not all 3. David Deckelbaum : And do you think there's a path to getting there within the next couple of years? Stephen Riney : That's what we're trying to achieve. Yes. I think it's possible, and we're going to certainly give it a try. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Betty Jiang of Barclays. Wei Jiang : I really appreciate the color or the guidance that you have given for 4Q pro forma production for U.S. oil. If we think out to 2025, like Apache is delivering double-digit organic growth in the Permian this year. Do you expect to see continued growth on the combined assets going forward? Just thinking about the overall strategy, like approach from a growth outlook perspective? John Christmann : Yes. Betty, what I'll say is, as post the Callon merger, our Permian now makes up roughly 75% of the company. And we've been executing at a high rate on the Apache side. We're anxious to provide those workflows on the Callon side. We have added a little bit of capital, which is going to work down some of the DUCs in the fourth quarter of this year. So I mean, it's early to comment on 2025, but it's going to give us a lot of strong momentum as we exit 2024 with a very strong fourth quarter. So we're very anxious to demonstrate that, and we're very confident in what we can deliver from the Permian. Stephen Riney : Sorry, Betty. I was just going to add one thing to that. One of the reasons why we added the frac capacity in the second half of this year, number 1 is frac is pretty inexpensive these days. So it's a good time to be doing that. But also just -- with the scale of the operation now that we have in the Permian Basin, as John said, 75% of our company now, with that kind of scale and the amount of activity that we're carrying on, we ought to be able to plan activity to where we don't have these big lulls a big rush of completions and turn-in lines and then a big lull of activity, and we ought to be able to plan it maintaining capital efficiency, but plan it in a way that creates a bit smoother profile to production volume. And that's one of the things that we're trying to achieve as we bring this frac capacity into the back half of this year is to get a little more smoothness to that because we were -- we felt like we may have been setting ourselves up for yet another downturn in first quarter on volume, a little bit of a lull or a flat spot, and we don't need to be doing that, and we can do better than that. Wei Jiang : Great. I appreciate that color. Shifting gear to Egypt, a similar question. This year, seeing that growth of Egypt volume is down a little bit, but a lot of that related to the workover rig shortage. If we look out post the PSC contract renegotiation, there was an expectation of Egypt growing the single-digit range. Do you expect to go back to that type of profile. When do you think that asset will be ready to do that? John Christmann : Yes. I mean you've got one factor in Egypt is costs are big picture gas has been declining. So the gross BOEs have been declining because of that, and we've been growing the oil. We're in a place today where we're working to rebalance the workover rigs and the drilling rigs and find a good level in there where we can drive that production base. So we'll monitor that over the year and come back later this year with projections in terms of what we'll do next year. And quite frankly, how Egypt continues to compete with what we're doing in the Permian, will play into that as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani of ROTH MKM. Leo Mariani : I wanted to follow up a little bit here on Egypt. I wanted to just kind of get a sense from you folks what the situation is with the receivables there in country. I saw that Egypt recently got an IMF loan a little bit ago. I'm not sure if that's kind of improved the state financial well-being there. So maybe you could just kind of speak to that? And then also, could you speak a little bit to kind of your expectations for gross Egyptian oil volumes? I know you talked a lot about sort of net, but it looks like growth has come down in the last few quarters. How do you expect growth trajectory on the gross volumes to trade over the next couple of quarters? Stephen Riney : Okay. Yes. So sorry, this is Steve. Yes, on receivables. So as we've always said, we worked very closely with the Egyptian Government on things like that. We've received 2 payments during the first quarter of this year. But despite that receivables, especially with oil price and all, receivables increased slightly in the first quarter of 2024. We kind of made good progress through 2023, bringing it down most quarters. It increased slightly in the first quarter of '24, but it's still below the average of where we were last year. But more importantly, I think you hit on the point, I think Egypt is on a very good path right now. They've floated their currency, they devalued it and floated it. And with that, they had to raise interest rates to control inflation. But with that, their bonds are up and the ratings outlook is improving. The IMF loan, as you talked about, they increased their loan program from $3 billion to $8 billion. They've gotten a significant amount of investment coming in from other Gulf states, mostly around some real estate opportunities. And they've got pledges now from both the World Bank and from the EU to offer support as well. So I think all of the signs for Egypt are pointing up now. That doesn't mean that it's going to be an easy ride. It's not going to be a quick ride, but things are certainly improving. Liquidity is improving. It's just a big positive step in the right direction, and that's going to help as we go forward. And we have had indications from the Egyptian government that we will get a large payment in the second quarter of this year. So we're will be -- and will actually be in Egypt visiting with them around that same time. So that's where we are on the receivables. It hasn't changed a whole lot in the first quarter, but certainly all of the signs of things going on in Egypt are pointing up and improving. In terms of gross volume, we haven't declined for 2 quarters in a row. We've actually -- and if you look back to 2023, gross oil volume was pretty flat for a while and then rose. We're declining now from fourth quarter to first quarter. A lot of that is around completion timing. We actually completed 27 new wells in the third quarter last year, 26 in the fourth quarter and then we completed 17 in the first quarter of this year. So that's not necessarily a surprise that volume -- oil volume might be declining a bit in this quarter. We'll see where we go going forward. We are continuing to reduce the drilling rig count. So that is going to have an effect on the number of wells that will be available for completion. But we'll see as we go quarter-to-quarter through the year on gross oil volume. And then as we approach year-end. And as John said in the prior question, we've got to work through this issue of the balancing of workover rigs and workover capacity with our drilling capacity because it's not a very efficient use of capital to be drilling new wells when workover is so much more capital productive than drilling new wells. Nothing wrong with drilling new wells, but workover is cheap and normally returns quite a bit of production volume to -- on the line. So you got to make sure you have the capacity to stay on top of the workover program. And we've got a lot of ideas on how we can work through that. Ultimately, there is longer term, the possibility you could bring more workover rigs into the country, but there are a lot of other things that we can try to work through before we get to that. So we've got a lot to do in 2024 to get things balanced properly and functioning properly between drilling new wells and working over and working our way through that backlog. And then as we roll into '25, we'll give a better view to where Egypt is going. Leo Mariani : All right. That was very helpful, very good explanation there. And I guess just maybe turning to Suriname very quickly here. Just wanted to kind of get a better sense of kind of where things stand. I know you're still working towards FID kind of what's your confidence level with your partner on achieving that later this year. And it sounds like there's still no drilling happening in '24, but does Apache anticipate some drilling there in '25. John Christmann : Yes, I'd just say we're very confident be it still underway, and we would anticipate an FID by year-end. So it's all moving forward there. And then that's going to dictate timing in terms of drilling we've got till 2026 to start the exploration program. So there's nothing pressing on the '25 side, but we could be back to drilling in '25. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : John, I wanted to spend a little bit of time talking about the Callon cost synergies. And specifically on the operational side, you're talking about high-grading the service providers, stuff around casing, surface economics. So can you just spend some time getting us on the ground and giving us a little bit more granularity around some of those cost synergies on the operational side? John Christmann : Yes, I'll jump in, and I'll let Steve add a little bit more color. But in general, we're changing the program. So you're going to see fewer wells per section, fewer landing zones, larger fracs in general. The other thing is when you look at the well count in terms of how they complete their wells, Callon was putting 1/3 of their new wells on ESPs and 30% on gas lift. We've been running outside of Alpine High about 3% ESP and 60% gas lift. So that's the other place in terms of just how we're equipping the wells, how we're flowing the wells and producing the wells and then obviously, the power then that is needed to drive those sub pumps is another big factor. I'll also say that they turnkeyed a lot of their stuff. I mean they turnkeyed a lot of their frac operations and we're going to self source and do a lot of stuff there. So there's a lot of low-hanging fruit on the operations side. So those are some of the big ticket items. And we've already seen a lot of that, which is why you've seen us increase a lot on the operational side. Stephen Riney : Yes. Neil, I'd just add, if you went back to the Permian slide deck that we published in February, we specifically pointed out 3 areas where we felt like Callon was significantly kind of off the mark in terms of where we would want to be on LOE per BOE, workover cost per BOE and downtime percent. And they've -- Callon has a history of a much higher well failure rate including for new wells. They have a higher rate of ESP failures than we do. And many of those are around -- we feel around their equipping choices, and we're already making some changes on a proactive basis in that -- even on some of the wells that they've already drilled and completed and equipped. There was a lot of inefficiency around compression and the use of their compression fleet, and we're making across a larger set of operations, we can make more economies of scale around compression optimization and even on the rate negotiations for compression costs. As John pointed out, they have a tendency to use a lot of ESPs for which they purchase power. That's very expensive and a big contributor to their LOE per BOE. They use a lot of contract labor, a lot of our supply chain aspects of using APA rates around services and around product, using volume discounts that we get across the larger operations and just reducing overall usage. They had a very high water handling and disposal costs, which we believe we can do much better at. They had a high rate of rental, rentals of ESPs, rental of compressions where we think we can do better at that as well. On the capital side, we'll use more technology to drill to use -- to decrease average drilling days on wells. We'll get better rig rates. We'll do a better job of rig moves because we're not moving rigs across the basin between the Delaware and the Midland Basin. We will use spudder rigs generally for a lot of the wells that we drill. They did not have a practice of doing that normally. Frac rates will get better at proppant costs, again, more supply chain type of stuff. And then on facilities, we -- they typically have built facilities spec. We typically try to modularize that. We will typically go to multiphase flowing through a single line. They like to use test separators and meter 3 products in 3 different lines. So we think there's just -- and there's just a whole bunch more of stuff that we're going to be looking at and doing to reduce LOE per BOE and downtime and the workover costs. Neil Mehta : That's a very thorough and helpful explanation. And good look as you bring the asset into the fold. Operator : We now have a question from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Steve, I have to apologize. When you talk about dry holes, I sort of missed that. Can you repeat it? I think you're saying that you have a way of in share name on Block 52 that's I think 40-some-odd million. So what's the remaining with the driver expense at 123 -- the second question is that yes, go ahead, please. John Christmann : I'll jump in. The -- there's 1 dry hole in Suriname, which was related to Bonboni up in the north. It was one that we held and weighted because we didn't know how the North would factor in on the future exploration side. And so that's why we took that one now. And then we went ahead in Alaska and rolled off the 2 wells that we failed to reach TD on simply because the decision was made that it would be easier to go back and redrill those prospects with brand-new wells. And so that's what the dry hole expenses were for. Paul Cheng : I see. And John, on Alaska in King Street discovery, can you share that what's the thickness of the [indiscernible] that you have 2 [indiscernible] do you have any data about permeability or that any information that you can share? John Christmann : Well, it's very preliminary, Paul. But we're excited about both. I mean these are not shallow wells in the Brookie and play, 2 high-quality oils -- we were also very pleased with the early data, but we need to get the rock data back into the lab and analyze that and go through all that before we really share anything. I think one of the big read-throughs on King Street though, it was the smallest and the most risky of the 3 prospects, even though it's the one we got down all the way, but there is a very positive read through in the Upper Zone at King Street for the big target in Voodoo, so it's very exciting. And if anything, it has us feeling even better about the program and the acreage going forward. I mean we've moved 70 to 90 miles east of working hydrocarbon system. Truly wildcat area, and now we've proven petroleum system. We've proven oil, and there's also very high-quality sand there. So a lot to get pretty excited about going forward in Alaska. Paul Cheng : Right. And John, you're saying that you're going to drill the 2 new well for Sockeye and Voodoo. Is that going to be done? Or that is going to be drilled in the next drilling season? Or that you guys have not decided and may get pushed out further? John Christmann : I'll just say, it's highly likely that we redrill both prospects -- but it's -- we've got to work through the partners, and we don't have to make decisions yet on the 2025 drilling program. So we're -- it's something we'll be working through with the partners over the next several weeks. But at this point, it's something that could be done in '25. It doesn't have to be done in '25, but we'll be working through the partners with that. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to John Christmann for closing remarks. John Christmann : Yes. Thank you. In closing, our Permian is performing extremely well, and we have just bolstered it with the addition of Callon and is now approximately 75% of the company. We will be integrating Callon over the next couple of quarters. And by the fourth quarter, you should start to get a good picture of what we can do with the Callon assets. We have pulled from some frac capital into the second half of the year, which should really give us strong momentum as we head into 2025. On the cost synergy side, we have increased our expectation by 50%, and we'll capture most of these by year-end and we believe there is even more to do beyond that. And lastly, we'd like to make more progress on debt reduction by the end of the year while also meeting our 60% shareholder return commitment. Thank you very much for joining us today. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gary Clark : Good morning, and thank you for joining us on APA Corporation's second quarter 2024 Financial and Operational Results conference call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO John Chrisman. Steve Riney, President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results and outlook. Also on the call and available to answer questions are Tracy Henderson, Executive Vice President of Exploration, and Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations. Our prepared remarks will be less than 15 minutes in length with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apacorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss on today's call. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. Please note that the Callon acquisition closed on April 1st. Accordingly, our full year 2024 guidance reflects first quarter APA results on a standalone basis, plus three-quarters of APA and Callon combined. And with that, I will turn the call over to John. John Christmann : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call today, I will review APA's second quarter performance, discuss the Callon integration, and review our activity plan and production expectations for the remainder of 2024. Our second quarter results were strong across the board, with higher-than-expected production in all three operational areas. CapEx was lower than expected mostly due to timing of spend. In the U.S., oil volumes of 139,500 barrels per day were up 67% from the first quarter as we incorporated Callon into our operations. Production and costs were significantly better than expected on a BOE basis after adjusting for asset sales and discretionary natural gas and NGL curtailments. Our Permian Basin continues to perform at a high level and we marked our sixth quarter in a row of meeting or exceeding U.S. oil production guidance. On a BOE basis, oil now comprises 46% of our total U.S. production following the Callon transaction. With this increased exposure, APA's cash flow sensitivity to a $5 per barrel change in oil price is approximately $300 million annually. In Egypt, production also exceeded expectations. We saw positive contribution from new wells, improved results from recompletions, and continued strong base production. Base production is particularly benefiting from the implementation of several new water injection projects. We are also beginning to see a decrease in offline oil volumes waiting on workover as we moderate the drilling rig count to free up work over rig resources. Turning to the North Sea, operations were relatively smooth in the second quarter with better than forecast facility runtime driving higher production. Our ongoing focus in the North Sea is right sizing our cost structure for late life operations. In Suriname, our partner Total recently announced that it has secured the FPSO hole for our first offshore development and we remain on track for FID before year end and first oil in 2028. And in Alaska, we are still working through options for the upcoming winter drilling season and look forward to returning to exploration activities. Turning now to the Callon acquisition, note that in last night's release we increased our estimate of annual Callon cost synergies from $225 million to $250 million as we leverage economies of scale of the combined APA and Callon Permian businesses. Steve will speak in more detail about some of the specific initiatives driving these cost reductions. More importantly, we are just beginning to implement drilling unit design and operational changes that we expect will create substantial value on the Callon acreage via improved well performance and capital efficiency. Our preliminary estimate is that we can drill a standardized two-mile lateral for roughly $1 million less than Callon was spending in 2023. We recently spud our first APA designed drilling unit on Callon acreage, the five well Coleman unit in the Midland Basin and should begin to see initial flow-back results in the fourth quarter. Turning now to our activity plans and outlook for the second half of 2024. In yesterday's release we provided guidance for the third and fourth quarters which contained some notable positives. In the U.S. we will average nine to 10 rigs for the remainder of this year consisting of approximately five rigs in the Delaware and four rigs in the Midland. We plan to run three to four frac crews and complete about 90 wells by year end. This sets the stage for strong oil growth in the second half of the year. Accordingly, we are increasing fourth quarter U.S. oil guidance to 150,000 barrels per day which is up 1,500 barrels per day after adjusting for the impact of asset sales closed in June. This represents organic production growth of roughly 8% compared to the second quarter. We also expect an increase in natural gas and NGL production driven primarily by fewer discretionary curtailments than in the first half of the year. In Egypt we expect a continuation of the operational progress that we made in our second quarter. There will be some volume impacts from the rig count decrease but this should be mitigated by strong base production performance and increased workover capacity to remediate wells offline. By year end, we project that backlogged oil production will be closer to more normalized operating levels. On our May call, we said that adjusted production in Egypt would remain relatively flat in 2024, while gross oil production would be flat to slightly down through the remainder of the year. While there are a number of moving parts to the program in Egypt, we see no material variances to our May outlook, and therefore guidance is unchanged. Similarly, our full year production guidance in the North Sea is unchanged, though we now expect a bit larger decrease in third quarter volumes associated with maintenance and turnaround activity at Barrel, and a slightly larger subsequent rebound in the fourth quarter. In closing, second quarter was an excellent quarter operationally, and we continue to execute at a high level in the Permian Basin. We are realizing greater than expected cost savings from the Callon acquisition, and have a clear pathway and plan to improving capital efficiency on those assets. Egypt also had a very good quarter and is beginning to deliver significant capital efficiency improvements. Though our drilling rig count is coming down, continued strength in base production and the return of wells offline will help sustain volumes in the near term. At current strip pricing, the second half of the year is setting up to deliver a substantial increase in free cash flow compared to the first half. And lastly, I am very proud of our teams for delivering these results while remaining on track to achieve our safety and environmental goals for the year. For a detailed review of APA's safety and environmental performance, I encourage you to review our recently published 2024 Sustainability Report, which can be accessed via our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve. Steve Riney : Thank you, John. For the second quarter, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, APA reported consolidated net income of $541 million, or $1.46 per diluted common share. As usual, these results include items that are outside of core earnings, the most significant of which were a $216 million after-tax gain on divestitures and $98 million of after-tax charges for transaction reorganization and separation costs, mostly associated with the Callon acquisition. Excluding these and other smaller items, adjusted net income for the second quarter was $434 million, or $1.17 per share. During the first half of the year, we generated roughly $200 million of free cash flow and returned $311 million to shareholders, nearly half of which consisted of share repurchases. That's a lot compared to the $200 million of free cash flow, but we liked buying at those share prices, and we anticipate free cash flow will be much higher in the second half of the year. That said, the balance sheet remains an important priority, and I will talk about plans for further debt reduction in a few minutes. Now let me turn to progress on the Callon integration. As John noted, we increased our estimate of annual synergies to $250 million. Since we announced the Callon acquisition, we have categorized synergies into three buckets, overhead, cost of capital, and operational. We are now increasing our estimate of expected annual overhead synergies to $90 million. Most of this was captured by the end of the quarter on a run rate basis, and the remainder will be done by year end. At this time, we anticipate that our quarterly core G&A run rate as we enter next year will be approximately $110 million. With that, we will have eliminated about 75% of Callon overhead cost, so no material further synergies are likely. Our cost of capital synergy estimate of $40 million annually assumed terming out Callon's $2 billion debt at APA's lower long-term cost of borrowing. At the closing, we used cash from the revolver and a $1.5 billion three-year term loan to refinance this debt. Instead of terming this debt out, our current intention is to use asset sales and free cash flow to simply pay off the loan before the end of its three-year term. This would represent a significant step forward in the goal to strengthen the balance sheet and to fully realize these synergies. Lastly, we are increasing our operational synergies to $120 million annually, approximately 60% of which is associated with capital savings and 40% attributable to LOE. To reiterate, these cost synergies do not include capital productivity benefits associated with uplifting type curves and improving well economics through spacing, landing zone optimization and frac size. We believe this will be a source of material long-term value accretion. Turning to our 2024 outlook. John has already discussed our activity plans and production guidance, so I will just add a few items of note. We now expect that our original full year capital guidance of $2.7 billion may start trending down a bit. A number of factors could contribute to this, including further synergy capture from the Cowen combination, lower service costs, improving capital efficiency and potential minor reductions in the planned activity set, mostly in the U.S. For purposes of third quarter U.S. BOE production guidance, we are estimating further Permian gas curtailments of 90 million cubic feet per day. This would also result in the curtailment of 7,500 barrels per day of NGLs. As most of you are aware, our income from third-party oil and gas purchased and sold can change significantly from quarter-to-quarter. This is primarily driven by the volatility and differentials between Waha and Gulf Coast gas pricing regardless of the absolute pricing levels. It's important to note that APA's gas marketing and transportation activities are generally more profitable when Waha gas price differentials are wider. For example, the Waha differential was very wide in the second quarter. While Gulf Coast gas prices averaged around $1.65, Waha gas prices averaged closer to negative $0.34. Because of the nearly $2 differential income from our third-party marketing and transportation activities was well above expectations. At current strip gas pricing, we expect a similar dynamic in the third quarter. Accordingly, we are raising our full year estimate of income from third-party oil and gas purchased and sold by $120 million to around $350 million. Approximately half of the full year estimate is attributable to the Cheniere gas supply contract and half is attributable to our marketing and transportation activities. Lastly, APA is now subject to the U.S. alternative minimum tax. And accordingly, we are introducing new guidance for current U.S. tax accruals of $95 million for the year. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Leggate of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Doug Leggate : So I guess there are so many things on the quarter that I could go after. I'm going to just try a couple. But Steve, it looks to us that your CapEx run rate exit, call it, fourth quarter, it looks like you're going to be around $600 million, which would be about a 10% decline year-over-year, if that held into 2025. Is the objective after you grow, you got the momentum from Callon, is your objective to hold that flat in which case should we be thinking something around 2.4, 2.5 [ph] for next year? Steve Riney : Yes, Doug, I'd be careful just using fourth quarter. We're probably going to be a little completion activity in the fourth quarter because a lot of that is -- has been bunch into second quarter and third quarter this year just because of the timing of availability of wells for completion. So I think the easier way to do that would be to look at full year spend, take out the first quarter, which is just APA and then I would probably first adjust that for the exploration spend and then just divide it by three quarters because the quarter was high third quarter is going to be about average-ish and fourth quarter is probably going to be a little low. And then I think you'll get a number of something close to around $700 per quarter. Doug Leggate : Okay. All right. That's really helpful, guys. And then we'll get a chance to... Steve Riney : Sorry. If you take out the exploration, you'll probably get something closer to $675 million a quarter of capital spend on basically the U.S. onshore and Egypt. There's not a whole lot of capital activity, as you know, going on in the North Sea. Doug Leggate : Okay. That's what I was trying to get a run rate. So that's really helpful. John, I wonder if you've not wanted to be drawn on inventory depth since the Callon deal, but I'm guessing you're getting your hands around that now. So when you look at the drilling pace with, I guess, you're going to be at nine rigs in the second half. What are you thinking with the up-spacing and so on? What are you thinking about your inventory debt looks like now in the lower 48, and I'll leave it there? John Christmann : Yes, Doug, it's a great question. It's 1 we're working every day. What I would say is if you look at the existing U.S. Permian run rate. We've always said kind of end of the decade with the rig rate we're at. And when we said we're bringing Callon in pretty similar duration I think there's one upside on the Callon is that we can drive the productivity improvements that we think we can then there will be more inventory that comes into play that we did not pay for in our acquisition. So that's something we're currently working on. If you look at where we sit today, we've got a lot of flexibility going into next year. We're going to grow Permian a very strong clip from second quarter to fourth quarter on 9 to 10 rigs, about 8%. And so it gives us a lot of flexibility going into next year pace we want to go. And we've had plenty of inventory that we have visibility on that to carry us to the end of the decade. And we'll keep working that. Steve Riney : Yes. Just to add on, Doug, to what John just said, just to enhance that a bit. When we were working on the acquisition, of course, we are looking at a lot of outside service providers that look at inventory counts. And most of them probably would have said that Callon had more running room, more inventory, more years of inventory than we did based on our analysis, as John said, which is a fairly conservative view of the world. We said now it's probably more similar to ours in duration. And as John indicated, or we can get capital efficiency, capital productivity into the right place on the Callon acreage, the more that inventory quantum could grow back to what some of the other people thought it was, which is something that would extend beyond the end of this decade. Doug Leggate : Thanks guys. See you next week. Operator : Our next question comes from John Freeman of Raymond James. Your line is now open. John Freeman : Good morning, guys. Just kind of following up on some of Doug's questions. I mean, the Permian and Egypt both exceeding guidance and specifically on Egypt, a pretty solid job of getting that turned around. And I'm just trying to make sure that I'm thinking about this right, where you've got you averaged 16 rigs in the first half of the year, you're going to drop down to 11 rigs in the second half of the year. And -- am I kind of reading it right that even at that lower rate cadence in the second half of the year because of all the steps that you all outlined in terms of the improved kind of base production management, catching up on the recompletion, resolving kind of that backlog of oil off-line in the back half of the year. Is that 11 rigs sort of cadence in the second half of the year? I mean, is that like an acceptable number to kind of maintain volumes? Just trying to make sure I understand kind of the moving pieces. John Christmann : No, it's a great question, John, and you're on the right track. I'd say that the benefit we've had by dropping the rigs is, it's been able to free up the workover rig time, which is critical because we have a lot of recompletion. And really, we also have a lot of CTIs, which are conversion to injection projects that we've been able to get to. And so when we were running two workover rigs and 18 drilling rigs. There's not much slack by ratcheting that back, it's freeing up the time and it's letting us get to some very meaningful projects that are making a huge impact. Is 11 rigs. This year, we kind of guided to flat to slightly down, is 11% the right number. It's early to tell on that front. But having gotten back from Egypt, there's also a lot of other projects that we're talking to Egypt about, for example, some gas drilling and other things, too, which could be pretty impactful as well. So there's a lot of flexibility there. And we'll be working through that as we work through our planning sectors. John Freeman : Great. And then just my follow-up, John, you mentioned that you might -- you'd see the gas volumes on the U.S. side actually grow some, and it had to do with sort of the -- well, one of the drivers was the fact that you had less curtailed gas volumes potentially in 4Q. So in the current guidance, does it assume any curtailments in 4Q? I mean, obviously, you all -- you had some in 2Q, you have even more in 3Q. I'm just trying to get something that's built into that full year guidance? John Christmann : Today fourth quarter does not have any curtailments built in. But obviously, we had up the third quarter with September with were Waha sets. Steve Riney : Yes. And just second quarter actuals, the amount that was curtailed, we had 78 million cubic feet per day of gas and 7,6000 barrels of NGLs curtailed during the quarter on an average day, that's nearly 21,000 BOEs per day. Our forecast for third quarter, what we've effectively left out of our guidance is 90 million cubic feet per day of gas and 7,500 barrels of NGLs. That's 22,500 BOEs per day. Those are really large numbers as you might imagine. John Freeman : Appreciate guys. Nice quarter. Operator : One moment for our next question, which comes from Neal Dingmann of Truist. Your line is now open. Neal Dingmann : Good morning, guys. Nice update. John, maybe sticking with -- on the Permian or the Callon -- specifically, the Callon acreage development. Really just wondering here, you all talked about, I think, pretty openly potentially up space a little bit. I'm just wondering besides potentially future of spacing. Is there any sort of material other changes either on the completion or other side going forward, you could see potentially doing at this point? John Christmann : Yes. As I said in the prepared remarks that one of the advantages to is we're seeing impacts on the combined business just from the supply chain how we design the wells, we think we can drill a standard 2-mile lateral for about $1 million less than what Callon was spending last year, which is 20%. So we're anxious to see those numbers start to come through. But excited about what we're seeing. And quite frankly, we're just now starting to spud some of the Apache plan pads on the Callon acreage. So excited to see those results, but things are going extremely well on the integration side. Steve Riney : Yes. The only thing I would add to that on the completion side, with the Callon drilled wells or Callon spud wells since they were spaced quite a bit tighter than we hold space than -- we haven't really changed the profit loading much on those. We did on a few, but not many. But we significantly increased the fluid loading on those fracs. As we get to our wells, the ones that we drill, obviously, both proppant and fluid loading will be quite a bit larger. Neal Dingmann : Great. Great. And then maybe Steve for you. Just a second question on shareholder return. Specifically, your shareholder return continues to be quite active. I think it was down a little bit sequentially in this last quarter. I'm just wondering, can we anticipate a large step-up for many of the year? Or how would you like to think about the program for the remainder '24 to '25? Steve Riney : I tend to think of that on an annual basis, a calendar year basis, we've got at least 6% of free cash flow through dividends and through share buybacks, both with April 1 acquisition using shares, the outlook of dividends and for free cash flow finished quite a bit. But the framework doesn't change 60% at a minimum. We're obviously way ahead of that in the first half of the year. And we'll see what the second half brings. I think we've demonstrated in the past that we're not afraid to go over well over the 60% mark. But let's -- we also recognize there's continued need for balance sheet strengthening after the acquisition. And so we're going to -- we'll balance that on a by quarter, really day-by-day basis. We'll see where we are as we go from one year to the next. Operator : Our next question comes from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Your line is now open. Charles Meade : Good morning, John and Steve, the rest APA team there. I'm wondering, you kind of -- maybe you didn't surprise the whole market, we surprised a few people at least with these last couple of asset sales. And I'm curious if you can share or you might want to share what is next? And I guess I'm thinking most prominently about the Central Basin platform, which is an asset or an area that we don't really talk about much anymore, and it doesn't seem like you guys are deploying capital there. John Christmann : No, Charles. I mean, we typically wait to talk about property sales. But there's a chance, there's other things that we're looking at that are not core to us in places that we're not putting capital. So you may have some decent intel out there. Charles Meade : Fair enough. And then I have a question about the shut-ins and the marketing in the Permian. As I think about how I would manage that the production, given that you have that valuable firm transport to the coast, I would -- I guess, I'm surmising that, that 90 million a day and 7,500 barrels of NGLs is that essentially all of your dry gas and some of your liquids-rich gas? Or is -- are you -- is there more that you could curtail if that basis got wider? Steve Riney : Yes, Charles. So there's -- yes, we can we can actually curtail quite a bit more than that, a little more than twice that amount. And so what that is, is that's an average for the quarter, but it's in anticipation of there being periods of time where we're where we're curtailing quite a bit of gas and dipping into the rich gas well especially do that when price of negative or significantly negative. When prices are just low, we'll typically just go with the lean gas and not dip into the richer gas. So we do that based on a price basis. We do it -- we have specific prices where we moved from 1 tranche to another. We've got 4 specific tranches of gas going from lean to richer gas that we can shut in different pricing mechanisms. And so I just want to -- I want to make sure that we're really clear about one fact, and that is that the curtailment of gas volumes in the Permian Basin and the Alpine High in particular, is totally independent of our marketing activities because marketing is something that we have to do because we have firm transport on two large pipelines, more pipelines now with Callon. And we have to fulfill those transport obligations. And we do that with purchased gas in the Permian Basin, which we then sell on the Gulf Coast. And we have various access points both in the Permian and on the Gulf Coast to be able to buy and sell that gas. So we don't have a choice of doing that. If we choose not to transport gas, we have to pay the transport fee anyway. Charles Meade : It's a nice piece of business. Thanks for that detail, Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from Roger Read of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Roger Read : Hey, good morning. I'd like to maybe follow up on some of your discussions on Egypt, just to understand, where is the decision coming from on the switch from drilling to workovers? Is that all the partners? Is that your decision? Is it Egypt's decision? And then how should we think about that maybe reversing as we exit '24 into '25 to the extent you can offer any sort of guidance that way. John Christmann : Well, I mean, we have a joint venture there. We have a one-third partner with Sinopec, but we never have issues in terms of directionally what we think is the right thing to do and we have full support. And I think the good news is the performance has been strong. The projects are very impactful. And it just shows that getting that workover rig and drilling rig balance into play really gives us a lot more flexibility. I would just say there's -- it would be our choice in terms of adding activity, and there is flexibility to do that. And we're recently over there, met with President Sisi, met with some of his new cabinet members, very impressed with the new minister and excited to work with him, and outlined some frameworks under which we could think about bringing on some other volumes of things. So very constructive meetings, and it's just something we'll factor in as we go into the planning process. Roger Read : Okay. I appreciate that. And then just to come back around on the Callon integration, understand the changes in the synergies and all. But if you were to -- just give us an idea in the old baseball terms or football game quarters or whatever, as you think about the integration and the understanding of what Callon really brings to the Apache family, -- like are we early, we mid, are we late in the process of really kind of understanding all that? John Christmann : Yes. I think it's probably more like going through fall camp. There's phases that get ahead early and phases that you're still developing, right? But in terms of the organization and so forth, we've worked through that very quickly with the integration of the assets into the portfolio. We worked through that quickly. Obviously, the piece that's the most exciting is still to come is going to be what can we drive on the productivity improvements and what does that do in terms of inventory locations. So we're just now getting to the first pads and spudding our first Apache plant wells. And obviously, anxious to get on with those results. Steve Riney : Yes, I'd characterize it using the baseball analogy. I think going through the synergies and going through the headcount and all of that, getting the organization integrated, that's kind of the pre-game warm up. And as John said, we've just drilled our first well out here on Callon acreage. So I would say that we're at back the first inning, and we haven't taken the first pitch yet. So it's just starting. Game is just beginning. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Hanold of RBC. Your line is now open. Scott Hanold : I was wondering if we could pivot to Suriname. And what are your high-level thoughts on how you look at activity maybe spending in 2025? I know it may be a bit early and your partner has an upcoming Analyst Day and that we're going to get more color there. But what is your understanding at this point? John Christmann : Scott, I mean, we've been pretty consistent since this time last year that the -- after we finish the Krabdagu appraisal that we were highly confident we were going to have a project, and we stated we plan to have an FID by year-end '24. And obviously, we remain on track. It's consistent with the message that Total has now put out. I think that is the next step. And once we get to that step, then we can obviously talk a lot more about what that means and all of that, but things are going extremely well. Teams are working very well together, and they are doing their thing. So right now, I'd say we remain on track for year-end FID and first of all by 2028, and they're working hard to accelerate those. Scott Hanold : Okay. Understood. And my follow-up question is back to kind of the Permian inventory runway. You talked about being confidence at the end of the decade at this point in time. Do you all think that's a strong enough position? And so what I'm trying to get to is like what is your appetite for further consolidation? Do you feel comfortable with that position now? Or are there other opportunities there for you? John Christmann : Today, we feel very comfortable with where we sit. I mean -- and when we talk about inventory, we're talking about long laterals with extremely high PIs. So it's high-quality inventory. As you know, we've got a large acreage footprint in the Permian. We're always working on how we bring more acreage into drillable prospects, but it just takes time as you mark through and you've got a lot of tests along the way. But today, we're very comfortable with our inventory. We know there's a lot more inherently to do there, and we will get to that and improve that as time goes on. I think when it comes to transactions and things, you've got to continue to have a very high bar. We've had one. We've been very patient. We saw a lot of opportunity in Callon, which is why we moved on it. But today, we're very content with where we sit and believe that there will be even more to do than what we have visibility into today. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research. Your line is now open. Bob Brackett : Good morning. A bit of a follow-up on Suriname. Two interesting things that I interpret from your update. One is you all have gone out and with the partner secured a state-of-the-art slot on FPSO from a leading contractor, that's about the most expensive long lead item I can think of. Does that tell for your conviction in FID or am I overreaching? John Christmann : Bob, I think we've been really confident we'd have a project, right? So -- but we still need to get to FID. So it just tells you the seriousness the time line that they're looking to accelerate. But it's -- they did declare commerciality earlier this year. We just got a lot of work technical work it takes to get to an FID decision. But we've said year-end, and I wouldn't change that now. We just know we're trying to accelerate that. Bob Brackett : And then the second issue is you've disclosed that the field development area is agreed upon for kind of a joint Sapakara Krabdagu development. If I sharpen my crayon and draw a ring fence around Sapakara through Krabdagu I could capture the vast majority of all your discoveries out there, ring-fence that? And then under the PSE cost recover that and have a pretty good cost pool for future work? Am I thinking correctly there? John Christmann : I would just say when we talk about Sapakara, it's pretty much the fine field as we have it defined today. When we talked about appraising Krabdagu, we talked about appraising a fairway and seismically driven, right? And so -- and if you go back to the comments when we announced the Krabdagu appraisal wells, we said that not only did it confirm and appraise Krabdagu, but it obviously derisked a lot of other prospects. So at this point, let's -- the next step will be an FID, and we need to get there. But you're definitely starting to think about things directionally in the right way. Bob Brackett : Good thing. And I'll just throw a last one in, which is to say, you guys increased your acreage in Alaska by 20%, that suggests that you see something interesting there or perhaps the option value of that acreage is pretty low. Is that a good way to think of it? John Christmann : I would just say we're excited about Alaska. The King Street Discovery is -- it's proof of concept. It proves the play that we're chasing sits 80 to 90 miles east of where it's been proven. So we're in a good area. We said it was a high-quality discovery oil, high-quality sands. So we are anxious to get back and continue exploring in Alaska in the near future. Bob Brackett : Thanks for that. Operator : Our next question comes from Leo Mariani from ROTH. Your line is now open. Q - Leo Mariani I wanted to quickly follow up here on Egypt. So I know you reiterated your comments from May where you thought that gross oil would be flat to slightly down, Egypt certainly noticed that gross oil in the second quarter was up a little bit versus the first quarter. Just trying to get a sense. I know that the rig count is coming down a little bit in the second half, but do you think you can maybe hold that second quarter gross oil run rate in Egypt? Or do you think it's more likely that it comes down by the end of the year with some of the lower rig activity? John Christmann : Yes. I would just say we'll stick to what we said in the script. Clearly, second quarter was strong. Things are going well in Egypt. But at this point, we didn't see any reason to alter our guidance. Leo Mariani : Okay. Any update on the receivable situation there in Egypt that you guys can share? John Christmann : I'd say it just got back from being over there. As I said, I had a good meeting with the President got to meet some of his new cabinet. Things are going well in Egypt. I mean, I think if you step back and look at it, President Sisi has done a really good job of managing a fairly difficult situation. So we've been impressed with that. We have been receiving some payments this year. So all in all, things are going well, and they continue to work through a difficult situation, but we see no reason to be concerned at this point and a lot of positive things on numerous fronts. Steve? Steve Riney : Yes. The only thing I would add to that, John, is that the new Minister of Petroleum as a set of priorities and high on that list of priorities, just to get the oil companies paid off. And we sit on all of that with him as well. And he's serious about his list of one of his anxious to get started on this. Leo Mariani : Okay. That's really helpful. And you guys intimated in your comments that there could be some opportunities from additional gas there. I know Egypt has been short gas this summer. It sounds like they're a little desperate to get back at it. Would you anticipate some opportunities and then potentially that could be associated with the price change on some of the gas going forward? John Christmann : Yes. I would just say, historically, we have explored for oil in the West Desert, and we're mainly focused on oil. We do produce a lot of gas. We had a very large discovery in case a couple of decades ago. There is gas in the Western Desert and we've had some conversations about what it would take to maybe go after some gas projects that could be helpful to the country. So it's something that we're discussing with them. But it's early. And obviously, you'd probably look at something that made more economic sense at the higher price for future gas exploration. But it's early, but definitely something that could come into play in the future. Leo Mariani : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Your line is now open. Scott Gruber : Yes, good morning. I wanted to come back to the upside on the Callon acreage. So as we think about the productivity improvement potential from up spacing and the completion redesign, will there be a material improvement in 30-day IPs? Or will the improvement to manifest more over time in the six and 12-month cubes? I'm just wondering if the shift in the completion design targets a shallower decline and what that means for the 30-day IP improvement potential versus the longer-term improvement potential. John Christmann : Yes. Scott, we just need to get some down. But I mean, obviously, with the changes we'd be looking at, we're pumping a lot more fluid. I think you could see increases there, but also with a little wider spacing, you should see better longer-term performance. So we just need to get some wells down and talk from delivered results at this point, so -- which we're getting on to and anxious to demonstrate. Scott Gruber : Okay. Okay. And then just another follow-up on Egypt. So you guys spent about $135 million a quarter, running 16 rigs on average in the first half, and that will drop to 11% in the second half. Roughly how much will the fiber reduction drop Egyptian CapEx in FDU? Steve Riney : Yes. I don't have that number to hand. It should be relatively proportional, but we're running workover rigs and that some of that work is capital as well, and that doesn't change. So you could probably get with Gary, he could give you see some data on that. Operator : Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan Securities LLC. Your line is now open. Arun Jayaram : Good morning. John and Steve, I wanted to get your thoughts on how should we start thinking about spending in 2025, you mentioned maybe a run rate of $675 million per quarter heading into next year. And I was wondering, as we think about some of your exploration activities in Alaska as well as assuming an FID at Suriname. I was wondering if you could maybe help us think about maybe a placeholder for CapEx for areas outside of your base D&C program. Steve Riney : Yes. So first of all, let me make sure I was clear about the $675 million. That was a number that was -- it was about 2024 capital spending. And I was -- how do you get a -- it was a conversation about how do you get a grip on how much are we actually spending on a run rate basis with the current structure of the company with Callon included as well exploration, excluding exploration activity. And so that's what the $675 million was that's about how much we're spending on average between second, third and fourth quarter of 2024. If you exclude Suriname and Alaska exploration type of activity. As far as -- and so the point being that, that was not an indication that that's what our run rate is going to be going into 2025. Just to be clear about that. I think the best thing that we can do as we normally do is we're in the middle of the planning process right now. The great thing about our portfolio, John mentioned earlier, we've got a huge amount of optionality. It's a complex portfolio actually. And you've got to make a lot of capital allocation decisions with looking view of where you would be allocating capital where the best returns are going to be through other parts and so that's what we typically run our planning process starting in mid-summer through the fall. We have an upcoming conversation with the Board about that plan, a preview of that plan. And we've got a process that we run through. We typically in November, give a high-level view of what 2025 will look like. And then all of the details we typically give in February. John Christmann : The other thing I was going to say, Arun, if you look at what Steve was saying on the $675 million, Permian is actually growing at about 8% in the back half of this year. So there's a lot of room in terms of moderating if we choose to what is the right plan going into next year. And that's a lot of what we'll put into the decision-making process. Steve Riney : Yes. Yes, that's a great quarter, John. A lot of people talk about, well, okay, what's it takes to run flat going into 2025? And we had a little bit of a conversation about that around Egypt. We're running 11 rigs, can you hold flat -- Egypt flat with 11 rigs and we're down to 11 rigs because we had to create the workover capacity to get back at the -- to get us to recompletions and workover backlog, and we're also using that time to do some convert to injection for water injection on a number of these fields. So can 11 rigs hold Egypt flat? Maybe not. It might be a little low, but we were running 18 rigs earlier this year, and running flat in Egypt is much closer to 11 rigs than it is to '18. '18 was clearly more than we needed to be running in Egypt. And as John said, in the Permian, we're running 9 to 10 rigs for the second half of the year, and we're growing 8% from second quarter to fourth quarter. So clearly, the number is below that in terms of how many rigs do you have to run in the Permian to stay flat. Arun Jayaram : Great. And just my follow-up. This year's financial is obviously benefiting from weak Waha prices and your ability to arbitrage that along the Gulf Coast. Steve, how do you think about maybe a more normalized earnings picture for that midstream, call it, piece when you have Matterhorn on and maybe some other pipes. So just wanted to think about how you think about kind of the normalized earnings potential there. Steve Riney : Well, I don't know what normalized is anymore after the last several quarters. But in general, market dynamics would tell you that a balanced situation would be that differentials between Waha and Gulf Coast they need to formalized would be that, that should have over time we're basically just making money on the Permian and by buying something slightly below Waha pricing because we've got multiple receipt points and we can take best price, and we typically do, but you're talking about pennies per Mcf. And then on the Gulf Coast side, multiple delivery points where you can sell for pennies maybe above Houston Ship Channel here or there, and you can squeeze a few pennies out on both ends, but on 674 million cubic feet a day, that makes a difference over time. And it just pays for the transport and fuel costs. But in that oil and gas purchase for resale, remember that still includes the Cheniere contract, which, of course, has nothing to do with Waha differentials. Arun Jayaram : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from Geoff Jay of Daniel Energy Partners. Your line is now open. Geoff Jay : Hey guys. Just wanted to get some clarification on the DMC savings you guys talked about. I mean kind of $100 a foot for a colon 2-mile, I guess those are like $72 million of the total synergy. Just wondering kind of if you can give me any more granularity about what's in there? And are there any service cost deflation numbers in that figure? John Christmann : Yes. So what we've included in the $150 million of annualized synergies excludes the benefit of lower rig rates for frac. Exactly [technical difficulty] have some integrity and [technical difficulty] synergies of a transaction [technical difficulty]. That is excluding any market synergies. So while John talked about $1 million cheaper or lower cost to drill a single well -- that includes the market benefit, but we only took about 70% of that number because 30% of that is the -- some of the market benefits on steel, on rigs, on frac and other things. What is included in the $250 million is about $60 million of annualized run rate for the lower drilling costs on these wells. And what that $60 million is, is basically with 9 to 10 rigs running in the Permian Basin, that's about how many Callon wells we would drill in a given year. And so that's how we got to that number. We're are obviously not drilling 60 wells this year. So we're not -- it's not like we're going to capture a full $60 million of benefit in the calendar year '24. But if we keep running at a similar rate that we're running these days, then we'll probably capture something near that in 2025. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Your line is now open. Paul Cheng : Just one quick one. Alaska, John, can you share with us that what's the drilling trend over there? I mean, how many wells you guys are going to drill whether it's all exploration or is going to be doing some appraisal on the King Street? And what -- how much spending that we may be talking about? Thank you. John Christmann : Yes, Paul, it's early. I mean we're working through plans with a partner. So at this point, no update on Alaska, specifically for plans other than that, we will be doing some more drilling up there. Paul Cheng : Okay, all right. Thank you. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back to John Christmann, CEO for closing remarks. John Christmann : Thank you, and to wrap up really, just a couple of points here. Number one, we're delivering strong results in the Permian and the Callon integration is going extremely well. Secondly, freeing up the workover rigs in Egypt is letting us do two things, one, implementing some very impactful water flood initiatives. Two, reducing the backlog of wells waiting for workover recompletion and the results of both of those are very visible. And lastly, we are raising full year oil production guidance while seeing a downward bias to our full year capital. And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. Now, I will pass the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Gary Clark. Please go ahead. Gary Clark : Good morning, and thank you for joining us on APA Corporation's third quarter 2024 financial and operational results conference call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO, John Christmann. Steve Riney, President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results and outlook. Also on the call and available to answer your questions are Tracy Henderson, Executive Vice President of Exploration; and Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations. Our prepared remarks will be less than 20 minutes in length with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you've had the opportunity to review our financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apacorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss on today's call. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And please note that our full year 2024 guidance reflects first quarter APA results on a standalone basis, plus three-quarters of APA and Callon combined. And with that, I will turn the call over to John. John Christmann : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call today, I will discuss our key strategic accomplishments in the core areas of the portfolio, review third quarter highlights and results, and outline our preliminary capital, production, and cost outlook for 2025. Over the past several years, APA has delivered a number of strategic initiatives designed to enhance the portfolio and create shareholder value. In the U.S., since 2020, we have executed more than $5 billion of acquisitions and over $2.5 billion of divestitures, effectively transforming our asset base into an unconventional pure play Permian operation. This activity has three primary benefits. First, it has added scale to our unconventional Permian position, increasing unconventional acreage by more than 40% and enabling us to roughly double our unconventional production. Second, it has increased drilling inventory and extended inventory duration is the rig count today is lower than APA and Callon on a standalone basis. And third, it rationalized our portfolio by eliminating assets that did not compete for capital and significantly reduces per unit LOE. Our primary strategic accomplishments in Egypt are two-fold, both of which drive APA shareholder value and benefit the Egyptian people over the life of the PSC. In late 2021, we modernized and extended our PSC terms, paving the way for more efficient capital allocation, more operational flexibility and greater free cash flow generation. And we recently reached an agreement to increase the contractual price for incremental natural gas production in country making gas exploration and development more economically competitive with oil development. Shifting to Suriname. We are now seeing the culmination of our strategic efforts that began more than 10 years ago, when we made a countercyclical investment in long-cycle offshore exploration. The recently announced GranMorgu project FID gives us visibility into strong future oil production growth at the most attractive economics in our entire portfolio. Importantly, we believe this project can easily be funded over the next few years through operating cash flow allowing us to maintain our current capital returns framework. Turning now to the third quarter results and highlights. APA achieved several important milestones during and subsequent to the end of the third quarter. We announced the sale of a package of non-core Permian properties for $950 million, which is expected to close in December. We reached FID on our first development project offshore Suriname in Block 58 with a partner and operator, Total Energies. We signed an agreement in Egypt that increases our contractual natural gas price on incremental volumes and we received a credit rating upgrade from Standard & Poor's, thus achieving investment-grade status at all three major rating agencies. Third quarter results were strong across the board as we exceeded our production guidance, while capital and costs were below guidance. Cash flow from operations and free cash flow increased compared to the second quarter despite weaker WTI oil prices and significantly lower Waha gas prices. This resilience results from some unique attributes of the APA portfolio as well as some recent specific initiatives. These include the successful integration of Callon and associated cost synergy capture, cash flow resilience to lower prices in Egypt under the PSC structure, near-term organic oil production growth, strong cash flow from our LNG contract, and having the optionality to curtail US volumes when Waha pricing is negative, while still generating cash flow from gas trading, the real value of which lies in the preservation of resource for a better price environment. We expect all of these will continue to generate positive financial impacts in the fourth quarter. Turning now to our key operational areas. US oil volumes have now met or exceeded guidance for the 7th straight quarter. Since closing the Callon acquisition on April 1st, we have reduced our Permian rig count from 11 down to 8, which we believe is an appropriate pace given the prevailing commodity price environment. We have successfully integrated Callon and turned our focus to developing the acreage. Our initial wells on acquired Callon acreage are flowing back in the Midland Basin and the early results are encouraging. The first wells in the Delaware Basin on Callon acreage will follow later this quarter. In Egypt, operations are running to plan, and gross oil production is tracking accordingly. The reduction in our drilling program has enabled the workover rig fleet to reduce backlog oil volumes associated with delayed recompletions and workovers to more normalized levels. Pursuant to the terms of the new gas price agreement, we recently added one drilling rig, bringing our total rig count to 12. Moving on to Suriname. We recently achieved an important milestone with the announcement of the final investment decision on our first offshore development in Block 58. The operator, Total, summarized the project is having a $10.5 billion gross cost, 220,000 barrels per day of production capacity, a per BOE capital plus OpEx cost of $19 at a 15% IRR at $60 per barrel. These are very good returns and APA's economics will be further enhanced by the capital carry provision we negotiated in 2019 when we brought Total in as a partner. We plan to fund Suriname development capital out of operating cash flow for the next few years until production commences in 2028. As previously noted, we see significant opportunity for additional exploration in Block 58 that could extend the production plateau and enhance the economics of our first FPSO and or potentially support additional development projects in the future. Switching now to the North Sea. During the third quarter, production volumes were in line with guidance as we completed our platform maintenance turnaround at Beryl as planned. Earlier this year, the U.K. issued regulations, which will require substantial new emissions control investments on facilities that will operate beyond 2029. After six months of evaluation, we have concluded that the investment required to comply with these regulations at 40s and Beryl, coupled with the onerous financial impact of the energy profits levy makes production of hydrocarbons beyond the year 2029 uneconomic. As a result, we have made the decision to cease all production in the North Sea by December 31, 2029, well ahead of what would have been an otherwise reasonable time frame. Steve will provide further details on the revised schedule and financial statement impacts of this change in a few minutes. In the wrap up operations, we have finalized plans to resume exploration drilling on our extensive state lease position in Alaska, where we will test the Sockeye prospect during the first half of 2025. Turning now to our preliminary activity plan and outlook for 2025. We currently expect to run an eight-rig program in the Permian Basin and a 12-rig program in Egypt. In the North Sea, we will have a very limited capital program focused primarily on maintaining asset safety and integrity and a small amount of initial P&A work in preparation for long-term asset abandonment. Our 2025 capital budget for the U.S., Egypt and North Sea will likely be in the range of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion, with an additional $200 million allocated to Suriname development activity and $100 million for exploration, primarily Alaska. This capital program should broadly sustain production volumes in the Permian and Egypt on an adjusted BOE basis, while North Sea production will be down approximately 20% year-over-year. I would also like to highlight the significant cost reductions we are targeting in 2025. In aggregate, we expect per unit LOE, G&A, GPT and interest costs to fall by 10% to 15% year-over-year. In closing, we have made very good progress on our strategic portfolio initiatives in the US, Egypt and Suriname. We had an excellent quarter operationally and achieved all key guidance targets. The Callon integration is complete, most of the cost synergies have been captured and we look forward to demonstrating the potential of the acquired Callon acreage. Egypt is running at a much more efficient operational cadence, and we have the opportunity to unlock incremental value and assist the country with its natural gas needs, following the negotiation of a new price framework. Under our current price outlook, we will seek to generally sustain volumes in the Permian and Egypt for the foreseeable future while rigorously managing costs and increasing the free cash flow that these regions generate. Longer term, a successful exploration program can add tremendous value and fuel future growth as evidenced by Suriname Block 58. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve. Steve Riney : Thank you, John. For the third quarter, under generally accepted accounting principles, APA reported a consolidated net loss of $223 million or $0.60 per diluted common share. As usual, these results include items that are outside of core earnings, the most significant of which was a $571 million after-tax impairment of North Sea assets and non-core Permian assets held for sale. Excluding these and other smaller items, adjusted net income for the third quarter was $370 million or $1 per share. John noted in his remarks that we have revised the expected timetable for cessation of production and abandonment of our assets in the North Sea. This decision had three primary impacts this quarter. The previously mentioned after-tax asset impairment, of which $325 million was related to the North Sea, a $17 million barrel of oil equivalent write-down of reserves that we no longer expect to produce, and a $116 million increase in the net after-tax present value of abandonment obligations on our balance sheet. We now carry an after-tax present value liability of $1.2 billion for all of our North Sea ARO. We are planning to incur this liability between now and 2038. Approximately half of this liability will be incurred between now and the end of 2030. While there will be some overlap, the next five years will consist of mostly wellbore abandonment while the remaining eight years will focus mostly on facility abandonment. We expect Beryl Bravo will be the first facility to cease production likely in late 2027 or early 2028. Moving over to Egypt. We continue to make good progress on past due receivables. And during the quarter, both total and past due receivables decreased. When payments on past due receivables are made, there is a counterintuitive impact on our stated free cash flow for the quarter because of the way we define free cash flow for the purposes of our 60% cash returns framework. If you have questions about how to model these cash flows, please work with Gary and his team. Debt reduction is a continuing area of focus at APA. While total debt increased with the Callon acquisition, one of our goals is to liquidate the Callon debt as soon as possible. We made progress on this front in the third quarter and will continue to do so in the coming quarters. The Callon deal brought increased scale in the Permian, which, coupled with our commitment to return to pre-acquisition debt levels was a significant factor in our recent credit rating upgrade by S&P. To close, I would like to provide a bit of color on some of our changes in our fourth quarter and 2024 full year guidance. Our full year capital budget has increased to $2.75 billion, which primarily reflects increases to fourth quarter spend on development capital in Suriname, following the October project FID, our recent decision to drill another exploration well in Alaska this winter and the addition of a 12th rig in Egypt. These items, which were previously not contemplated in our guidance, were partially offset by the reduction of 1 rig in the Permian Basin. Turning to our US production guidance. You'll note that we have adjusted our fourth quarter outlook to reflect the estimated impact of frac activity deferrals and planned production curtailments. With much weaker-than-expected Waha pricing this quarter, we decided to curtail gas from our Alpine High area, as we typically do. We also decided to curtail some high-volume high GOR oil wells, which will generate higher revenue under a more constructive future gas price. We currently project this will have a 20,000 to 25,000 BOE impact on US production. However, this estimate is subject to considerable volatility depending on how regional gas prices progress through the fourth quarter. As most of you are aware, our income from third-party oil and gas purchased and sold is generally correlated to Waha price differentials. Accordingly, with the persistence of weak pricing into the fourth quarter, we are raising our full year estimate to $500 million. Approximately two-thirds of which is attributable to our gas trading activities and one-third is attributable to the Cheniere gas supply contract. And to close, most of our $250 million Callon synergy target should be realized by the end of this year. We anticipate reaching full synergy realization through 2025 and we did not plan continued reporting on these efforts from this point forward. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : Thank you so much. [Operator Instructions] And it comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Wolf Research. Please proceed. Doug Leggate : Thanks, guys. Good morning. A lot this quarter. So I'm going to hit two. One is Egypt, and one is the oil guide. So first of all, in Egypt, you've obviously -- you haven't given any color whatsoever around the gas price other than the fact that you got better pricing. So to what extent can you help us frame the impact of this? I guess it costs you about , I don't know, $25 million net for that additional rig. How do we think about the incremental free cash flow based on your current visibility on that gas price? That's my first one. My second one is, clearly, the oil guide has got a lot of moving parts, not least the sale of the Central Basin platform. So can you just walk through the moving parts on the apples-for-apples acquisition versus disposals to get us to kind of net number just to make sure that the Street is looking at it on an apples-for-apples basis. And I'll leave it there. John Christmann : Yeah. Two really good questions, Doug. I'll step in first on Egypt and let Steve follow up, and then we can come back to the Permian and the oil guide. But if you step back in Egypt in the Western Desert, we've historically always explored for oil. Obviously, the country of Egypt is now in a position where they need gas. And so we've been working on a framework, which would bring gas exploration wells up to parity with oil wells. It is on incremental volumes. We're not in a position to get into a lot of detail on how that is calculated, but you will be able to see it showing up on our income statement going forward. We've allocated 1 rig. We've got a lot of low-hanging fruit, as you know. If you step back and look at the Western Desert, while we've always run oil exploration programs, we found Caser, which is a 3 Tcf field back in the early 2000s. So there's tremendous potential for gas in Egypt. We've got a lot of low-hanging fruit. This will be on incremental gas volumes, and it's going to put our exploration program on par with an oil program. Steve Riney : Yes. So what we mean by incremental gas volumes is as part of the agreement, we've agreed with EGPC what our PDP decline looks like till for the full development or the full remaining life of the concession. So gas PDPs, a decline curve. And for every quarter, we'll look at how much gas was produced and any gas over that decline curve in that quarter gets the new price. It doesn't have to be from new wells. It doesn't have to be from new fields. So gas compression can bring on more gas volumes, enhanced recovery, step-outs, infield step-outs and infill, things like that, all qualify for incremental gas volume. As John said, we're -- we've priced it to where we're indifferent economically drilling an oil well or drilling a gas well. And as part of that agreement, we agreed to add 1 rig. As we've said, we have already done that. And I would just say we've got -- just to build on what John was saying, we've got 5 million acres of hydrocarbon-rich resource here. There's been, as John said, no gas-focused exploration. So we believe that there's quite a bit of prospectivity. We've actually got some previously discovered gas-focused resource. Some of that may need some appraisal, but there's quite a bit that's still -- that's ready for appraisal and development investment. infrastructure is in place because we do produce a lot of gas today. There is some haulage in that infrastructure. And to the extent that we might need it in the future, any further build-out of infrastructure was contemplated in the price that we negotiated. And I don't know, Tracy, if you want to talk about maybe a little bit about prospectivity for gas in Egypt. Tracy Henderson : Sure, Steve. As John and Steve said, we've really focused our exploration program on oil. So gas is really underexplored relative to oil, but we see significant potential. We have a good understanding of the geology and the source rocks having been there for two decades. And we know the areas that are more gas prone and the basins that are more gas prone. So we do have a known inventory of low-risk resource potential with material volumes. And in addition, we will be testing some exploration gas prospects and concepts to continue to grow that inventory over time. So we see a lot of potential in those opportunities, and we're excited to have a gas-focused program, and it's a great opportunity to grow the inventory and add value to our business in Egypt. Steve Riney : And Doug, just to wrap that point up, that question. So we're not going to share specifics about the gas price agreement with Egypt. We're just -- we're not going to do that at this point in time at their request. You will start to see this show up in results. We'll think about -- I understand your point about wanting to get to how do we forecast free cash flow. I don't know a price. We'll start thinking about how -- between now and February when we give a final plan for 2025 and possibly beyond. We'll give some help in being able to figure out what this means for free cash flow. We understand the point. John Christmann : And if I can take the second question, Doug, on the Permian oil, we've been running nine rigs. We've scaled back. We're at eight rigs, and that's what we plan to run for next year. If you take our Q3 numbers, which we just put out 143 on the oil side for Permian and you subtract the upcoming asset sales of 13,000 barrels a day. That's going to put you around 130,000. And we believe we can maintain that or hold that flat with a rig count that's down about 20%, turn in lines that are down 20% and CapEx, which is in line with that. So we think it's actually pretty strong. But for next year, you're looking at -- and this is obviously the preliminary view, as you know. We're looking at about 130,000 barrels a day of oil in the US that we can hold flat with eight rigs. Doug Leggate : Got it. Thanks guys. I appreciate the answers. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question is from John Freeman with Raymond James. Please proceed. John Freeman : Good morning, guys. John Christmann : Good morning, John. John Freeman : First topic, just a little bit more infill on the North Sea. So I just want to make sure that I'm understanding. So the way that you laid it out, Steve, of the ARO, you said about half would potentially be spent between now and the end of 2030. And I guess I'm just trying to understand in terms of just outflow of capital, as you all like ratchet down the CapEx in the North Sea over the next several years and then factoring the AROs, just sort of how I should think about just capital being spent in total in the North Sea over these next 10 full years. When I know the -- it's a minimal spend CapEx-wise in the North Sea next year, but just any color on that front would be helpful. Steve Riney : Yeah. So the spend on the ARO won't show up as capital. You'll actually see a number in the -- the costs incurred, where we provide some reconciliations to GAAP versus non-GAAP reconciliations in our supplement, and you'll see a number in there for the North Sea for the addition to the ARO. So from a GAAP accounting purposes, the increase in the ARO is considered costs incurred which is a GAAP kind of equivalent or somewhat equivalent to capital spending. So it shows up when you add to the ARO, it doesn't show up as capital spending in the CapEx program as we spend that capital or those dollars in the years in which we incur the ARO. And John, just to give maybe a little bit more color on the spend patterns. So as I said, the -- if you were to combine two numbers because there's a there's a gross obligation on the liability side on our balance sheet, and then there's a deferred tax asset because there's a 40% tax savings for every dollar that you spend on ARO. So there's two numbers on our balance sheet. Those two numbers net to $1.2 billion. It's -- with a 40% tax rate, you could probably figure out pretty quickly, it's about $2 billion of liability. It's about an $800 million tax asset on the balance sheet. And that $1.2 billion, as I said, roughly 50% of that will be spent between now and the end of 2030. A lot of that is being spent on wellbore abandonment. And so you figure out -- you figure okay, that's about $100 million a year for six years. And what I would say is the pattern grows through the period of time. So it's going to be way less than $100 million next year in 2025, starts kind of ramping up a little bit in 2026. The first three years are below $100 million a year, the last three years are above $100 million a year. John Freeman : That's perfect. I appreciate all the color on that. And then on the LOE, which you all are indicating a pretty big decline next year, 10% to 15% decline. And you mentioned the drivers, and there's obviously a lot of moving parts with the account synergies, the noncore Permian divestitures or curtailed volumes. Is there any way to give maybe just sort of a rough kind of idea of just ballpark, like the magnitude of each of those from like a driver of that decline year-over-year, just some way you think about. John Christmann : Yes. I mean, John, we really haven't thought about how to break that out. I mean what we've tried to do is just look at the stand-alone business next year as you're going into that and roll everything up. Obviously, a big chunk of that is on the Callon side is the synergies we've been able to drive out, but a lot of it comes to just a change in the portfolio changes that we've made in the US, selling the higher cost, declining waterflood assets on the Central Basin platform, which are typically much, much higher costs, and we handle a lot of water. So it's really a recharacterization of our unconventional Permian Basin business is what you're going to see. And I can also tell you, there's -- we're working hard on how to do more than what we've laid out at this point. Steve Riney : Yes. And I'd just add, John, we'll provide quite a bit more detail around that when we roll out the detailed plan in February. What we're trying to -- what we always try to do at this point in time in the year just kind of give a shape to the capital program and what that means to production volume more than anything else, kind of the meat of the direction of the firm. But there is that one chart in the supplement. And it's got multiple elements in it. You might want to just give Gary a call later today or sometime and he might take be able to take you through some of the details behind that. John Freeman : Understood. Thanks guys. John Christmann : Thank you, John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Please proceed. Bob Brackett : Good morning. I had a question around the cadence of the cash return strategy and the timing. There's a big moving part around your disposals and getting that cash in the door and 3Q percent of free cash flow return came down a bit. Should I think of that as timing versus anything else? John Christmann : I mean, definitely, it's just timing, Bob. We came into the year. We're running a little bit ahead. And then you look at Q3, we've had a lot of material things that were in the works that can sometimes prevent you from being able to get in the market at times. But in general, yes, it's more just timing that was out of our control. Bob Brackett : Very clear. A quick follow-up on gas curtailment and your latest thoughts are on the ground intelligence around Matterhorn. Matterhorn feels slow, but it's coming. Is that your expectation that we'll get some takeaway out of the Permian, realizations will improve, and that's when the curtailment ends? And what's your latest that you hear happening in the basin? Steve Riney : Yeah. I believe most of the price extremes, if you want to call them that right now are not related to Matterhorn, but are related to some downtime on other pipelines coming out of the Permian and to the Gulf Coast. And I think that's impacting the pricing extremes as we see them today. That maintenance activity, I believe, is planned to be completed in the next week or so. So I think this is a matter of perhaps just days first of month for December a couple of days ago, was $1.40, so not a great price, but at least better than negative $3 or $3.50. Bob Brackett : Very clear. Thank you. John Christmann : Thank you, Bob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed. Roger Read : Yeah, thank you. Good morning. I guess, I'd like to come back on the lowering of the cost. I mean, it looks obviously a piece of an LOE, but a lot of the G&A, and what is that? Or is that in addition to the synergy you anticipated from the Callon merger? I mean, I would think so, given the way it's laid out here. But I just wanted to understand what was driving some of these opportunities. John Christmann : I think, Roger, it's clearly synergies on the Callon side, but it's also some of the simplification on our business with the asset sales. Steve Riney : Yeah. And the other thing I would just add, in our synergies around the Callon transaction, we said that around $90 million of that would be related to G&A and Callon had a G&A cost structure of around $110 million a year. Our G&A right now is running basically flat with where we were prior to the Callon acquisition. So I think some of the G&A synergies are going to be around just growing the -- increasing or exceeding the amount of synergies that we thought, we basically -- it's not all Callon people because we actually have a number of Callon people here in the company, but we've equivalently eliminated the full Callon G&A. There were some one-off costs in G&A in 2024 around the transaction as well. Roger Read : Yes. No, I appreciate that. And then, John, my question for you since you got the Alaska exploration well. And obviously, all those decisions had to be made preelection. In terms of regulatory outlook, certainly, it looks easier to do business in Alaska with the federal government at this point, just wondering, how you're looking at that. Assume good or bad with this particular well, but as you think about the overall Alaska opportunity. John Christmann : Yes. I think the main thing there, I'll remind you, Roger, is we've got about 300,000 acres in our position, but it's state lands. And so we're in a position where you're fairly close to pipeline, and we're state land. So, you don't really have to bring the federal side in, but just on a few things. So we feel good about that. We're excited about Alaska. We had a discovery earlier this year on the well that we did get down. And we're going back to 1 of the 2 that we attempted last winter, but we're very excited about it. So it will be early, early next year when we spud, and we have added some capital to start building ice roads and stuff for this winter. Roger Read : I Appreciate that. But one federal roadblock is sometimes more than enough. So I just wanted to check on that. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question that comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Please proceed. Paul Cheng : Hi. Good morning team. John, you guys done the Callon deal, even though I think Apache probably do better than Callon. But when you go through that, have you found there's anything that you learned from them saying that they're actually doing better than us and where that they probably have done the worst? John Christmann : Yes. I mean, obviously, Paul, when you integrate 2 companies, you take good from both and try to replicate. I think Callon had some good people that we've integrated into the organization. Obviously, they've got some good acreage that we're excited to get after as well. And then we've been digging into a lot of their technical assumptions as well. But I think in general, you've seen us be able to cut costs just from our supply chain and some of our processes. We've cut almost $1 million per well in terms of the well cost side, we're anxious on the spacing, and we've got 2 wells flowing back or actually 4 now, but 2, we've got pretty good results on in the Midland Basin. And we're seeing some pretty good uplift on those 2. So we're pretty excited about Callon in general. Paul Cheng : No, I was just asking that. Is there anything that from a technology or process that Callon you actually find that they are doing well, and then you will be able to adopt their process or technology and enhance your operations? John Christmann : Yes. I would say on the spacing side, I mean, we're looking hard into the data and how they were approaching the development scenarios, and how we take -- how we designed it versus how they were and how do you modify that to what we think is a better answer. Steve Riney : Yes. And if I could just add to that. That's what I was going to say earlier was that it'd be really simple just to bring all of that acreage into the Apache process and just assuming, well, we're right, we've got everything figured out, and we're going to do it exactly the way we do everything else. Instead, I think it's always a good idea to just step back and think, okay, well, do they have any aspects of spacing and fracking and landing zones, and what's in communication, what's not in communication. So, it's good just to take the opportunity to step back and question what we believe and our fundamental beliefs there as well, and we're doing that. And I think it's worth doing. We will come to some conclusions in due course. But it's worth asking ourselves those questions. Paul Cheng : Steve, can you quantify what's the benefit? Because I assume those is not in your original synergy target? Steve Riney : No. At this point, I'd say I can't quantify the benefits of that. But we'll do that in due course. I think we'll -- I think we've got to get more wells drilled, completed and online and get some history to those. And we've talked about it in the past, at some point in time in 2025, we have the $250 million of annual cash operating -- operational and overhead type cost synergies, but we do believe that there are some meaningful synergies around the capital productivity or capital efficiency, whichever you want to call it. And we've said in the past, we will come back sometime in 2025 with a recap of where we think we are there. And that will include -- just like the synergies have included, that will include things that we've learned from the combination with Callon, and how that helps even the Apache approach to the rest of our acreage as well. Paul Cheng : Okay. The second question is on Alaska. John, you guys are going back? And can you tell us that you guys essentially going back to the same two wells that you suspend in last year program, and you're just going to redo that or that you are targeting a total new prospect? John Christmann : No, Paul, it's actually going back to the Saki prospect. [Technical Difficulty] Operator : Please stand by, we have some technical audio difficulties. Please stand by, ladies and gentlemen. And you may continue. Thank you for standing by. John Christmann : Yes. Operator : Yes, you are live. John Christmann : We're back up. I apologize. We had an internet disconnect, but we're back. So. Operator : So one moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with Truist. Please proceed. Neal Dingmann : Good morning. Thanks for the time, John. My question, maybe just around Permian Egypt production, specifically, you all -- the target you talked about for next 8 Permian and 12 Egyptian rigs. I'm just wondering, is that, again, kind of the plan to maintain. You think that's about appropriate to maintain stable production in both those areas. And I'm just wondering when it comes to base production. Has that changed much in either area? So I'm trying to get a sense of how we should think about sort of maintaining the flat production. John Christmann : Yes. We've designed that -- the early look design is a program to sustain Permian oil, Neal, around the 130 that I mentioned earlier with Doug's first question. And then in Egypt, it's really our reported production, but the gross has been coming down slightly. If you look at on the oil side with 11. Right now, you've got 12 rigs, 11 to the oil program, one to the gas is what we've got in there. At 11, we're slightly underinvesting in Egypt, but it's close. Steve Riney : Yes. If I can just add to that briefly. I mean we started the year with -- as people know, we started the year with 18 drilling rigs. We ended the year with 12. We went down to 11 at one point in time. If you just look back at the -- when we said that gross oil volume would slightly decline as we go through the year. Well, first quarter was 138,000 barrels a day. Second quarter was 139,000. In third quarter, it was 137,000. So we're on a slight decline. I would emphasize the slight aspect of that. And I think that, that's probably going to just continue into fourth quarter and on into 2022, absent a change in the drilling activity. But that's that if people go back to 2023, we were in the mid-140s with 18 rigs running for quite some time, and we were kind of struggling to maintain production volume or to grow it from there. So as we've commented a few times, we've actually -- with 11 rigs, we've achieved kind of a nice, very smooth operational cadence that's working really well. We have increased that to 12. The thing I would say about 2025 is that the 12th rig is drilling gas-focused wells, and some of those will be appraised. Some will be development wells, some will be low-risk appraisal type of step outs, some of them will be exploration, looking for bigger, better prospects, which we believe there are -- they are out there. And so the potential for gas, I would say, is unknown at this point in time. We're certainly optimistic. We believe there's good prospectivity, but the potential is still a bit unknown. The other thing I would say is that we've -- in the last, I would say, in the last 1.5 years, we've learned a lot about what we can be doing around improving our focus on waterflood management, and we've got a lot of plans in 2025 for working that. And I think the potential for that we have yet to really see what that can do on a decline mitigation basis, the best way to maintain production volumes in a country like Egypt is to mitigate decline, not to be trying to drill too many wells. So we're working on both fronts, and we'll see what 2025 brings. But if everything is kind of equal with 2024, we'll probably just continue on this pattern of just a slight decline. Neal Dingmann : Got it. And then just second, you've talked a bit about this already today, but just with shareholder return, I mean, you guys in other periods where the stock has gotten here, have been very opportunistic coming in pretty aggressively. I'm just wondering given recent pricing is that potentially in the cards? John Christmann : And I think clearly, we've got our time periods fastest. We're running ahead Neal, but we do think that share price is obviously attractive. We've got the proceeds coming in from the asset sales. The majority of that is going to go to debt reduction as we're also working to get debt paid down as well. Neal Dingmann : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. And it comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Arun Jayaram : I wanted to go back to Egypt and gas. Steve, you mentioned that over time that you can make up, call it, the PDP wedge with incremental volumes where you get the higher gas price I was wondering if you could help us think about what the PDP decline rate looks like for gas in Egypt and obviously in the Caesar field specifically? John Christmann : Yes, Arun, I'll take that one. Caesar's been on decline. We've gone through some stages of compression. It is the big portion of our gas is Caesar, but we also produce a lot of casing head gas with a lot of the other oil wells. So Caesar has been in the double-digits there. And obviously, we'll have to see with the new program can we fill the overall gas decline, but I think we've got an opportunity to add some incremental volumes that could be pretty material. Arun Jayaram : Understood. Understood. And then just maybe a follow-up. John, with the North Sea now in kind of a late cycle stage in terms of the life cycle of that development of the field. And then obviously, Suriname starting up in 2028, how are you thinking about \u2013 thinking about another leg to the stool in terms of the portfolio, obviously, you sold some assets recently. But how are you thinking about just the broader portfolio? And obviously, given the North Sea where it's at, adding another leg to the stool? John Christmann : Yes. I mean, I think if you step back, we've got what we believe are two really strong long-term legs of the stool with both Permian or kind of our reshaped and reworked Permian unconventional business. We think we can hold that flat at a very efficient rig count for the foreseeable future. Egypt is a large asset. We've been there now for over three decades. We see a lot of running room in Egypt as well. Suriname will start to come on in 2028 and will be very material. And so if you step back and look at that, and we just maintain the two large onshore positions. 2028, Suriname's going to put in some pretty nice growth relative to those two assets. So I mean I think portfolio is in pretty good shape. We're always looking to how we improve it. But I think we've got with Suriname stepping in and coming on in 2028, it's going to be a nice add to what are two really nice core positions, both in the Permian and the US and Egypt. Arun Jayaram : Understood. Plus the exploration in Alaska near... John Christmann : Absolutely. And I think the key there, Arun, is we've stayed committed. We've been spending a small portion of our budget in exploration. I think we've got a wonderful staff. And as I said in the prepared remarks, with successful exploration, you can add real shareholder value and Suriname Block 58 is a perfect example of that. So we've got a nice portfolio. We're excited about it. We'll continue to fund a little bit. But we also know where we make our real money is in our core assets and driving our free cash flow from Permian and Egypt. Arun Jayaram : Great. Thanks a lot John. Operator : Thank you so much. One moment for our next question, that comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Please proceed. Charles Meade : Good morning, John to you and your whole team there. John Christmann : Good morning, Charles. Charles Meade : Thank you. I wanted to ask a question about Suriname, and you put this slide in your supplement on slide 11, and I always -- I like these kind of mockup cartoons that give a sense of the development layout. But what -- when you guys decided to include this, what are you -- besides the numbers on the right side of the slide, what do you really hope people take away from this when they see this? And what's the -- so what you want people to get about the GranMorgu? John Christmann : Well, I mean I think it's just given -- it's a real project today, right? So I mean, we've got visibility now to volumes in 2028. And so I think it's time that you put some slides out there that bring it to life. And that's why we put the picture out there. You can see this is kind of looking from deepwater in. You'll see where the FPSO will be placed. This is a total slide. You see with Krabdagu, it's a fairway, as we've talked about in terms of the development opportunities that we've appraised there. And looking over at Sapakara, it's more of a field. The thing I would also say along that fairway is there will be more exploration prospects and potential tiebacks as well. So it's something we're excited about. It's material. It's large. But I think it's just bringing this project to life, because it's real today, and we're looking forward to 2028. Charles Meade : That\u2019s great. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you, John. John Christmann : You bet, Charles. Thank you. Operator : Thank you so much. One moment for our next question that comes from the line of Leo Mariani with ROTH. Please proceed. Leo Mariani : Hi. Thanks. Just wanted to inquire a little bit about the kind of activity plan in the US, it sounds like you guys are basically kind of pulling back there. Oil is roughly at 70. You guys are kind of citing a softer oil outlook. Just kind of curious, are you expecting kind of oil prices to be lower next year? I mean, obviously, you just bought the Callon asset. You saw some pretty nice organic growth the last couple of quarters on a combined basis, and now you're kind of choosing to pull back. Can you just provide a little bit more color on sort of the thinking there as we roll into next year? John Christmann : Yes. Leo, I just think we're in a softer price environment. We've got an asset base that we can sustain volumes with eight rigs. We're going to work on efficiencies. It's always easy to pick up those rigs up. But I think with where we're moving into 2025, it feels like a good place to be initially. And the nice thing is, like I said, if we can sustain Permian and roughly sustained Egypt. You've got Suriname coming in the next -- 2028 from an overall corporate level. Leo Mariani : Okay. And then maybe just jumping over to Egypt here, so I think you guys made a comment there on the call that you expect that we could see some very modest declines on Egyptian gross oil, but I know you're expecting to keep adjusted or net production on oil, relatively flat. So maybe you're expecting to get a slightly higher share of that oil. I don't know if that's just related to expectations for lower prices in the PSCs for next year. I was hoping you could address that quickly. And then also just on Egypt Gas, you got the gas rig going. What's your expectation there on gas production in Egypt for next year? Can that start to flatten out, maybe in the second half? Do you see any growth in Egypt gas as we get towards the end of the year or next year? John Christmann : Yeah. I'd just say, if you look in Egypt at 11 rigs, as Steve mentioned, we've been declining slightly at the top line. It's been very, very slight over the last four quarters. So at 11, it's about where we probably are on the gross oil side. We're actually getting after some of the waterflood projects as well, which the benefit those have is they flatten your decline. So then it's -- with the strong waterflood program, then you can improve that. And then on the gas side, our overall gross gas is declining. But with this program and we've got a one-rig program laid out and some nice quick prospects to get after that we can get to infrastructure. We'll bring new volumes on and then we'll -- we've got some bigger prospects to drill and then we'll see. So I think the key there is we're getting started with that. And after we get some prospects down, we'll have a better clue of scale on the gas side in the future. Leo Mariani : All right. Thanks. John Christmann : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Betty Jiang with Barclays. Please proceed. Betty Jiang : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I want to go back to the North Sea ARO conversation. So I think the $1.2 billion is on a present value basis. So wondering, if you could give the total liability on an absolute basis? And I think the as we think about the cash outflow related to this, does your free cash flow calculation include this outflow as you think about the capacity for tax returns in any given year? Thanks. Steve Riney : Yeah. So I'll give you -- I've already given you two numbers. I'll give you a third number as well. So again, the two numbers I've given are that we've got about a $2 billion liability on our balance sheet. US GAAP requires that we take what we think the current cost is of abandoning all of those assets as if we had to abandon them today. We inflate that into the future and then we discount that back at prescribed inflation and discount rates. So we've got that -- when you take the cost today, inflate them and then discount them back, you get $2 billion. Today cost estimate is $2.5 billion. So obviously, the inflation rate is lower than the discount rate that we have to use for that, which is our borrowing rate, for that 10 to 15-year timeframe. Then there's the tax benefit of all of that. The present value of that tax benefit is $800 million. So that's offsetting the $2 billion present value getting to the $1.2 billion net, which is a net after-tax present value liability on our balance sheet today. Two different numbers on the balance sheet, $2 billion liability, $800 million deferred tax asset. What was the second part of the question? Betty Jiang : Just on the free cash flow calculation, when you think about the organic free cash flow is related to cash return, does this cash outflow gets netted out of that? Steve Riney : Yes, it will. And just I think \u2026 Betty Jiang : Appreciate it\u2026 Steve Riney : \u2026and let's just remember, we've talked a lot, and I understand why we talked a lot and kind of focused on the abandonment activity that's ahead of us and the costs associated with that. Let's just not forget that we still have operating assets in the North Sea. Those continue to generate free cash flow even after a 78% tax rate. And those -- that free cash flow will help us pay for a lot of those costs here in the next several years. Betty Jiang : Understood. Thank you for that. My follow-up is on the gas marketing piece. This year, really surprised with how powerful the benefit on the gas marketing side in a weak Waha gas environment. Can you give us a flavor of under the current features, price on Waha spread, would you be able to continue to capture above normal marketing benefit next year as well? Steve Riney : Yeah, that's just going to depend a lot on what happens with Waha as we go through next year. And it's really -- it's not absolutely Waha prices. It's the differential between Waha and Gulf Coast versus the cost to transport fairly simple. If there's a $2, if -- I use fake numbers, if there's a $2.50 spread, and there's a dollar cost to transport, then you're making $1.50 on nearly 750 million cubic feet a day that we buy and transport to the Gulf Coast. And if it will all depend on what are those spreads for 2025, and as we've experienced here in 2024, they can be extremely volatile. Even over short periods of time, like for a weekend, we can find for a weekend, prices can go negative for three or four days as much negative as like negative $5, which means when we're purchasing gas over the weekend, people are paying us $5 to take to take gas and then we transport it for our transport costs, which we can't disclose, but you could probably figure out what it is, and we sell that on the Gulf Coast for what would normally be a positive price, a little less volatile pricing on Gulf Coast than you get on at Waha. Betty Jiang : It's certainly nice to have that pipeline right now. Just to clarify, the Gulf Coast benchmark are you looking at Houston share, or it's a combination of different hubs? John Christmann : Yes. It's -- it would be looking at mainly ship channel or depending on where the pipe takes you back to. Betty Jiang : Okay. Got it. Thank you. John Christmann : You bet. Thank you, buddy. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Jeoffrey Lambujon with TPH & Company. Please proceed. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Good morning guys, and thanks for squeezing me in here. Really just a quick follow-up to your commentary on the North Sea. A couple of questions ago, just around the free cash flow generation that you mentioned. Can you also help us understand what your outlook is for OpEx from that asset as production declines in the next year, or will just kind of help us dominate it along with the ARO dynamic that you already walked through. Thanks. Steve Riney : Yes. We'll probably go into more detail on that in the February call. We're just not -- at this point in time, we're -- like we say, we normally at this time of year, give a view to the capital program and production volumes and the general overall direction of the company. And that, as we've highlighted with this conversation is generally dominated by the longer-term oil price outlook. So that's all we really typically look to accomplish on the November call. We'll give more details around country-by-country specifics, and the line items between revenues and LOE and breakdown of capital and things like that in February. I can tell you, though, that the North Sea because of the situation we're in, in the North Sea, and we talk about it openly that we're in the business now managing operations -- day-to-day operations for free cash flow now. We -- practically any type of capital investment is not economic under the current situation. And so we manage that for free cash flow, and we will look hard at operating costs, and we are looking hard at operating costs. We never do so in a way that sacrifices or puts at risk, either human safety or the environment, but there's a lot of stuff that we spend money on that could be looked at and examined just to make sure that we're spending properly in an environment where we're just focused on free cash flow for the remaining life of the asset. So we'll get into more detail of that in the February call. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And with that, I will close the Q&A session for today and turn it back to John Christmann, our CEO, for closing remarks. John Christmann : Yes. Thank you. And first of all, I want to apologize for the Internet disconnect that we had during Paul's question. But in closing, as we've outlined, we've made great progress on the portfolio, and the assets are performing at a very, very high level. We have significantly scaled and streamlined our Permian unconventional position. We're adding a potentially very valuable gas program in Egypt and now have a clear time line to significant production and cash flow in Suriname. Going into 2025, we are looking at a potentially softer oil price environment and are focused on sustaining our core business, reducing costs and generating free cash flow. We provided an early look at a plan of eight rigs in the Permian and 12 rigs in Egypt, which should broadly sustain oil volumes at reduced capital levels. We will continue to work this plan and look forward to coming back to you in February with a lot more details. Thank you for joining us. Operator : And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect.",
