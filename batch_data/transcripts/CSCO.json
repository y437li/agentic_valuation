At the request of Cisco Systems today\u2019s call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections you may disconnect. Now, I\u2019d like to introduce Melissa Selcher, Senior Director, Analyst and Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, you may begin. Melissa Selcher : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to our 95th quarterly conference call. This is Melissa Selcher, and I\u2019m joined by John Chambers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Frank Calderoni, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rob Lloyd, President of Development and Sales; and Gary Moore, President and Chief Operating Officer. I would like to remind you that we have corresponding webcast with slides on our website in the Investor Relations section. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the Investor Relations website. As it\u2019s customary in Q1, we have made certain reclassification to prior period amounts to conform to the current periods presentation, the reclassified amount have been posted on our website. Click on the Financial Reporting section of the website to access these documents. Throughout this call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements and as such are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on the Form 10-K and any applicable amendments, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise stated. I will now turn it over to John for his commentary on the quarter. John Chambers : Thanks, Mel. In Q1 FY \u201814 Cisco delivered record non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.53 per share and revenue growth of 2% year-over-year. This level of revenue growth in Q1, while not inconsistent with some of our large peers was below our expectations for the quarter. Over the last few quarters, I\u2019ve shared with you what I\u2019ve been seeing, a microenvironment that is inconsistent and very hard to read, with business leaders confidence slowing purchase decisions. The last month of our quarter was during the U.S. government shutdown. The impact on our federal business was approximately $50 million. Our team there did an exceptional good job managing through this challenging period. However the shutdown, debt feeling negotiations and delayed key decisions exasperated the lack of confidence among business leaders we had highlighted over the past few quarters. As we walk through our business in detail, you would hear many positives. Our strategy to solve our customers\u2019 biggest technology and biggest business challenges is working. We delivered strong non-GAAP profitability. We are leading most of the major transitions in the market and our innovation engine is faring extremely well. That said, we are managing through several cycles in our business. First, emerging market weakness; second, the introduction of several new generation platforms in high end switching and routing; and third, our service provider of business evolution. Our intermediate long-term strategic view has not changed and we are continuing to lean forward and make investments that would drive our future growth. We are disrupting markets. Look at our Application Centric Infrastructure launch and Internet of Things and our NPS launch in just the last month to drive value to our customers and to our shareholders.  From where I see it, I believe we are well-positioned at the center as the long-term transitions shift into communications and IT market. We feel the momentum of our thought leadership in this market and we are experiencing our customers\u2019 confidence in Cisco expand as we move to become their trusted business partner and hopefully the number one IT partner. I know many of you speak with our customers and partners. And I'd be very surprised if you're not seeing and hearing the same thing. For Q1, I want to highlight five key takeaways. First, once again our financials are very strong. In Q1, we delivered record non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.53, non-GAAP operating margins of 29.3% and strong non-GAAP gross margins of 63%. We generated operating cash flow of $2.6 billion and returned approximately $3 billion to our shareholders, through the buyback and dividend. The one obvious exception is our revenue growth.  Second, our strategy is solid and we\u2019re leading on the critical transitions in the market. I look at cloud as one example. We are the leading cloud infrastructure provider as measured by Synergy Research and our cloud services business, including Webex hosted collaboration, elements of our own security and wireless portfolio are showing good momentum. And last week, we demonstrated how we expect to lead the SCM market, delivering an integrated system that drives to the core of solving our customers\u2019 top challenges. Speed of application delivery, virtualization, OpEx and CapEx reductions, complicity, security and scale in a single architecture. In every case, our ability to pull together the breadth of our portfolio to deliver architectures and solutions to meet customer outcomes that is apart.  Third, our innovation engine is executing extremely well. We continue to innovate through a build, buy partner strategy and are seeing the benefit. In the last quarter, we introduced game-changing core routing and core switching platform and took a significant step forward in our security business with the acquisition of Sourcefire. With these and other moves, we are uniquely positioned to help our customers navigate the demand of the cloud, mobility, the application economy and the internet of everything.  These platforms are expected to ramp over several quarters. But perhaps one of the things that I'm most pleased at and this is different than we\u2019ve ever done before on the new product development, high end switching and high end routing. Each of this new product, for example, Nexus 9000 with ACR, CRS-X and NPS are in line with our current margins from day one. Just a really nice job by engineering.  Fourth, we are managing through some economic, technology and product cycles. From a macroeconomic perspective, in the last two quarters, our order growth rate in emerging countries, which is over 20% of our product business, has gone from a positive 13% in total in Q3 to a negative 12% in Q1 of this year. You can do the math but that\u2019s a drag of between four to five percentage points on our growth for this quarter.  In service provider, we are managing through product cycles across our portfolio, including high end Core, Edge, and SP video. What you know about Cisco is that when we have focus on something we address it in IT and this is no different.  Fifth, we have a unique opportunity to be our customers\u2019 number one IT company. Our customers are asking us to step up in new ways to take a broader role in helping them achieve their business outcomes. At our recent CIO meeting with 95 of top global CIOs, they confirmed our leadership position and increased opportunity for Cisco over the next years in their own individual companies. And this was at a much higher level than the other top IP players that we talked about with the CIOs. This is a tremendous validation and is pushing us to move faster to offer our portfolio of technology and architectures, add solutions to address the business outcomes our customers need. Fortunately for Cisco, no one comes close and been able to meet their requirements and we are moving with speed to evolve, to capitalize on this opportunity. To provide additional detail on our Q1 FY \u201814 results, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Frank. After Frank, I\u2019ll then walk through some additional details and what we\u2019re seeing in the business, Frank will then detail our guidance and will wrap the call up with Q&A. Frank, to you. Frank Calderoni : Thank you, John. In Q1 FY \u201814, we drove solid profitability despite our lower than expected revenue growth. Our business continues to operate in an inconsistent and mixed macroeconomic environment and we had specific challenges in the emerging markets and service provider. At the same time, we had relative strength in data center, wireless, security and our switching business. From a top line perspective, total revenue was $12.1 billion growing 2% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS was $0.53 growing 10% year-to-year. In this quarter, we continue to execute consistently without portfolio approach to acquisition aligned to driving long-term returns. We announced the WHIPTAIL acquisition to celebrate our UCS strategy. WHIPTAIL is the market leader in high performance, scalable, solid state memory system and we also closed two acquisitions this quarter, Composite Software and Sourcefire. Sourcefire, a leader in intelligent cybersecurity solutions and brings industry-leading products, talent and an open-source approach to our security portfolio. Composite Software offers data virtualization software and services and will extend our next generation services offering. We also announced our intent to acquire the remaining interest in Insieme Networks as part of our application centric infrastructure-based data center and cloud solution. Total product from a geographic perspective grew 4% for the Americas, 3% for EMEA and decreased 9% for APJC. The overall product revenue increased 1% and total services revenue increased 4%. We delivered solid non-GAAP operating margins of 29.3% with consistent results in both gross margins and operating expenses with continued strong discipline in these areas. In Q1, our total non-GAAP gross margin was 63.0%, that compares to 62.7% a year ago and 62.1% last quarter. We continue to see good stability over multiple quarters and product gross margins, with non-GAAP gross -- product gross margins at 62.0% compared with the 61.5% year ago and 60.8% last quarter. Our non-GAAP services gross margin was 66.6% compared to 67.1% last quarter and 66.9% in Q1 FY \u201813. Total gross margins by geography where Americas were 63.6%, in EMEA it was 64.4% and APJC was at 58.8%. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.1 billion or 33.7% as a percentage of revenue and this compares to 34.8% in Q1 of FY \u201813. Our headcount grew less than 100 from the end of the fiscal year to 75,136. This reflects the addition of over 850 employees from the Sourcefire and Composite Software acquisition, offset by our workforce rebalancing that we announced in our Q4 FY \u201813 earnings call. As I mentioned on that call, the workforce reduction plan provides us the ability to invest in key growth areas such as cloud, data center, mobility, services, software and security to effectively manage our business for the long-term. Other income and expenses with $85 million reflecting a benefit of higher investment gains during the quarter. Now moving on to our non-GAAP tax provision rate. It was 21% and it was consistent with our expectations. Our non-GAAP net income was $2.9 billion representing an increase of 12%. As a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP net income was 23.7%. As I mentioned earlier, our non-GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.53 versus $0.48 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 and again this represents a 10% increase.  Our GAAP net income was $2.0 billion and GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.37. GAAP net income included $257 million of pretax charge related to our intended acquisition of Insieme Networks as I previously mentioned. As we indicated in our Q4 FY\u201913 call, as part of our workforce reduction plan, we stated that we expected to take pretax charges to our GAAP financial results in an amount not to exceed $550 million. During Q1, we recognized pretax charges to our GAAP financial statements of $237 million related to that announcement. Our cash returns to shareholders, balance sheet and cash flows were once again areas of strength. During the quarter, we returned $2.9 billion to our shareholders, including $2 billion through the share repurchase and $914 million through our quarterly dividend.  Our diluted share count decreased slightly as a result of the timing of our share repurchases. The remaining impact of the Q1 repurchase will be reflected in the reduced share count next quarter. As disclosed in our press release today, our board has approved an increase to the repurchase program of $15 billion, demonstrating our commitment to our capital allocation strategy. The remaining approved amount for share repurchases under this program, including the additional authorization, is $16.1 billion.  Total cash, cash equivalents and the investments were $48.2 billion, including $6.2 billion, which was available in the U.S. at the end of the quarter. We generated solid operating cash flows of $2.6 billion, increasing 7%.  In terms of our key balance sheet metrics, DSO or days sales outstanding were 39 days and finally, our non-GAAP inventory turns were a strong 12.1.  In conclusion, we are focused on the near-term challenges. At the same time we are investing in our portfolio of growth initiatives and driving profitability through operational efficiency. We are committed to our capital allocation strategy through the support of the dividend as well as the buyback and our overall objective is to deliver long-term profitable growth and return for our shareholders. John, I will now turn the call back over to you. John Chambers : Thanks, Frank. I will now provide some additional detail on the performance in Q1 and trends we are seeing in our business and in the market. I\u2019ll first walk through our product portfolio in terms of year-over-year revenue growth, followed by discussing geographic and customer segments in terms of year-over-year orders.  First, our switching business performed well with growth of 3%. Switching gross margins, including new products, continue to be very stable. We have introduced next-generation products across most of the entire portfolio, including the highly anticipated data center switching line in the Nexus family, the Nexus 9000. Developed by our recently acquired spin-in Insieme Networks. The Nexus 9000 began shipping in November and we will ramp over the coming quarters.  Wireless delivered another solid quarter with gross [ph] revenues of 8% and stronger gross margin. The comparison to 802.11ac is in the beginning stages with support now across our product line. Cisco\u2019s networking platform or Rocky continue to perform very, very well.  NGN routing revenue was down 1% for the quarter. We saw declines in the quarter as we managed the product transitions in that business. We shipped a new NPS platform to our first customer this quarter and continue to manage the transition of our CRS platform to the CRS-X. On the AS -- ASR 9000 had another record revenue quarter with growth constantly about 20%. But our Edge performance was impacted by declines in our traditional products, in both the Core and Edge we are focused on migrating programs that will drive upgrades to the new platforms over the coming quarters.  We saw decline in our ASR 5000 mobility revenues due primarily to timing of large orders. SP video revenues of $987 million declined 14% year-over-year. As we continue to focus on profitable growth, our set-top box business, which had an annual order rate of over $2.6 billion, declined over 20% as we evolved our business to the cloud and hold to our strategy to walk away from low profit deals. This obviously has a positive impact on margins that comes with some revenue pain. Let me be very clear, we know that video is one of the top priorities of all of our service provider customers and we are committed to the business. We are evolving our portfolio and have made leadership changes, which will strengthen our ability to meet strategic requirement of our customers and maintain the right business program for Cisco. Our data center business grew 44%, as customers continue to adopt our unified computing systems. We continue to see success with solutions such as SAP HANA that incorporates our UCS servers. Converged solutions from NetApp, FlexPod and EMC, VMware, Vblock are now each running at over a $1 billion run rate for their total business. These solutions are fueling our industry-leading strong data center growth across all segments and regions. UCS is one of the best examples of our portfolio of an architectural approach, delivering differentiated value to our customers and driving our market success. While most of our competitors in this area sell servers, with UCS we saw an architectural approach and in just four years have become the number one in the Blade Server market. UCS sets the foundation for our leadership data center, bringing together compute, networking and storage. And as you think about where this is going to go in terms of the next-generation driving IT growth, we believe it is around application centric infrastructure, which will build on this success and expand our leadership for the next decade as we simply converge applications, networks and security at scale. Overall, security revenues grew 8%, with particular strength in network security, up 12%. We closed the Sourcefire acquisition on October 7th and are already seeing the benefits of a focus and the assets we fully acquired. Security is our customers\u2019 top priority and according to them, we may be the only company capable of providing the full architecture they need to address their security challenges. We\u2019re off to good start and it\u2019s up to us to execute on this architecture. Moving on to collaboration. Revenue was up 1%, as our strategy and execution continues to evolve. Unified communication revenue declined by 3% year-over-year, as we move to a different revenue model in the business, increasing the amount of business which is reoccurring. Conferencing revenue grew 12% and Telepresence revenue grew 1%. Finally services revenue grew 4%. The technical services were up 4% and advanced services up 5%. Non-GAAP gross margins and services were very solid at 66.6%, down slightly from 66.9% a year ago. As we discussed last quarter, service revenues are tied closely to product growth. We were very pleased with gross margin and the technical services growth given the challenging services market. We do believe there is further opportunity to improve our advanced services performance, as we move from transaction to driving our customers top business opportunity and the results they want to get in terms of outcomes. I will now move on to provide some color on our geographic and customer segments. The following geographic and customer segment growth rates are in terms of year-over-year product orders for Q1, unless specifically stated otherwise. In Q1, we saw growth, momentum and opportunity in global enterprise and commercial. U.S. enterprise and commercial were both very, very strong, growing in the high single digits in terms of year-over-year orders. U.S. public sector actually grew 2%. However, the positive growth trends in orders were more than offset by the two factors mentioned earlier. Emerging Markets orders declined 12% and service provider orders declined 13%. As a result, total product orders declined 4% year-over-year with total product book-to-bill of less than one. We did see the weakness increased conservatism and slower decision-making on a global basis accelerate beyond our expectations, due to back end of the quarter. In our leadership reviews in mid-September, we believe our orders in the quarter would translate to revenue in our guidance range. To provide a geographic view of orders this quarter, the Americas declined 2%. In the U.S. in addition to the good enterprise and commercial momentum, we delivered U.S public sector growth of 2%, led by state, local and education up 13% and U.S. Federal down 3%. Service provider in the U.S. declined by 10%. The issues in the U.S. were similar to what we see globally in SP and I will expand on this in a discussion of SP segment. Moving on to Asia-Pacific, Japan and China, similar to last quarter, we again experienced the same challenge as many our peers. Overall, Asia-Pacific, Japan and China was down 10%. China continued to decline as we and our peers worked through the challenging political dynamics in that country. The Europe, Middle East, Africa and Russia region declined 4%, due primarily to the effect of the emerging markets public sector and SP. Central Europe continued to show positive growth. Southern Europe continues to be challenging. Europe, while there are positive trends remain challenging as seen in the recent ECB interest rate reduction announced last week. This action should help [indiscernible] economic recovery over time.  Across every geography, the impact of emerging market weakness was pronounced and accelerated to the backend of the quarter. Our top five emerging markets declined 21% with Brazil down 25%, Mexico down 18%, India down 18%, China down 18% and Russia down 30%. As we always had, we will continue to focus on emerging markets, investing through the challenges and expect to see return to growth in few quarters with all the appropriate caveats.  Moving on to the segment review. As mentioned earlier, enterprise grew 2% and commercial grew 1%. Public sector declined 1%. Service providers declined 13%. As a reminder, the service provider business continues to be lumpy and go in cycles, and our service provider growth rate is negatively impacted by the deliberate actions we are taking to manage the profitability of our set top boxes.  As we discussed before, the set top box orders which are approximately 20% of our total service provider business -- product service provider business was also down 20%. That means the service provider segment started the quarter down minus 4% to 5%, due to net decrease in set-top boxes.  Several factors negatively impacted the growth in addition to set-top box impact. First, we operate globally, the emerging markets challenge have some impact on the SP bookings. Second, we introduced two new platforms, NCS and CRS-X and the Core and are seeing slower growth than anticipated, customers to continue invest in the existing platforms and adopt these new platforms. As a reminder, NCS, like ACI on the switching side is an entirely new architecture requiring an additional time and test and evaluation.  And third, we lost some share on the low-end Edge which we need to win back. As you would expect, we have focused our leadership on what we can control to reaccelerate service provider growth despite the challenging macro over the next several quarters. We are focused on pulling together the breadth of our portfolio and innovation to solve our customers\u2019 top business opportunities, just as we've done very effectively in enterprise over the last 12 to 15 months and we clearly saw the results in enterprise in doing that. We are managing the evolution of our portfolio and aggressively moving to meet service provider requirements for greater virtualization of services across our mobile and wireline platforms. We are planning our resources to the opportunities for greatest growth. We are seeing very good customer traction in our new Core platforms, with active trials in many SP customers and moving from trial to production. I believe our global service provider stage is solid [ph] and we are unique in our ability to add service provider customer challenges with architectural solutions that deliver their business outcomes. We will continue to focus on the innovation and execution to drive the acceleration of the business. Managing through product and market cycles is part of being a leader in the technology industry. We feel very confident in our ability to work through these cycles over the coming quarters.  I\u2019ll now turn it over to Frank for guidance. Frank to you? Frank Calderoni : Thank, John. Let me now provide a few comments on our outlook for the second quarter. Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements and you should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statement. And that actual results could be above or below our guidance.  The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation to GAAP. As we look to Q2 FY\u201914, we do not anticipate material improvement in our order growth. This is impacting our revenue guidance for Q2. Given our orders performance in Q1, our backlog is significantly lower than we anticipated. As a point reference, approximately 70% of our product revenue is dependent on new orders each quarter.  With that in mind, we expect total revenue to decline in the range of 8% to 10% on a year-over-year basis. For the second quarter we anticipate non-GAAP product gross margin \u2013 non-GAAP margin to be in the range of 61% to 62%. Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q2 is expected to be in the range of 27.5% to 28.5%. Our non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be approximately 21% in the second quarter. Our Q2 FY \u201814, non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.45 to $0.47 per share. Given the guidance for Q2 \u201814 and the shift in momentum in our business, we thought it would be helpful to provide investors and share more detail on the full year of the fiscal year. We expect our FY \u201814 non-GAAP earnings per share to range from a $1.95 to $2.05. Within this, we suggest you model revenue conservatively. We have a strong handle on our gross margins, operating expenses and cash flow and we believe we can deliver this level of profitability even in an uncertain growth environment. We are not changing our long-term financial model. We continually revaluate our long-term model as you would expect as the market changes. We will update you at our Financial Analyst Conference in December, if we see the need for any adjustments. We remain focused on driving profits faster than revenue. We anticipate our GAAP earnings to be lower than our non-GAAP EPS by $0.10 to $0.14 per share in Q2 and $0.45 to $0.60 for the full year. This range includes an impact of approximately $100 million in Q2 \u201814 and $550 million for the full year, as a result of our anticipated restructuring charges related to our workforce reduction plan that we announced last quarter. Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for more detail. Other than those quantified items noted previously, there are no other significant differences between our GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructurings and tax or other events which may or may not be significant. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I thank you and turn it back over to John. John Chambers : Frank, thank you very much. There is no doubt that the pace have changed that we all feel and see is only accelerating. As I have been saying throughout this calendar year, things that used to occur in five years are happening in three. Things that used to happen in two to four quarters are occurring in one quarter. This is a new market reality. Let me be very clear, change has always been good for Cisco. We used these times to get closer to our customers, transform our business and drive new opportunities. I speak with many of you, our shareholders during the year and appreciate the investment you are making and understanding our business, including attending our launches and events, as many of you did in New York last week. I note from those meetings that you understand our strategy and where we can take this company. I also know that while we see these transitions as opportunities, these transitions can create unwelcome quarter-to-quarter volatility and can be frustrating for long-term shareholders. As we have always done, we\u2019ll commit to you to be transparent, letting you, our shareholders see the challenges and the opportunities as we see them. We remain very confident in our long-term strategy and are committed to managing the business to ensure we drive the greatest long-term value for our customers, employees, partners and shareholders. What can you expect as we address the opportunities, cycles and challenges in our business and the market over the next several quarters? First, I realized many of you spend a lot of time speaking with our customers and channel partners. As you know, our relationship with the customers has never being stronger. We are winning and they know it. They have asked us to play a bigger role in partnering with them to drive their business outcomes. We will continue to move quickly to capitalize on the opportunities they have presented to us. Second, we will continue to manage the business with focus on discipline, where we have challenges and cycles we will move swiftly and decisively to drive growth and continue leadership. Third, we will maintain our momentum on Cisco\u2019s innovation model of build, buy and partner. We planned to leverage our acquisition of Sourcefire to achieve our goal to become the number one security company and drive new product platforms and architectures like CRS-X, NCS and ACI to build multi-billion dollar business at Cisco. Let\u2019s discuss a bit deeper the application centric infrastructure launched last week. When we look back five years from now, I believe we will see ACI as a pivotal point in redefining IT. We were very pleased with the response to the launch but we were not surprised. We designed the system in ACI that would address the most pressing needs of our best global customer base, companies, government and service providers of all size.  A ecosystem as the major technology companies, our peers and competitors have publicly stated how strategic they believe the platform will be in their future priority and major cloud enterprise and commercial customers has chosen the ACI architecture to run their business. This is Cisco at is best. We delivered innovation on an entirely different scale than our competitors. A system that would drive revenue and productivity, reduce costs and mitigate risk, protecting their existing investment and future proof, and this is the first time I have ever used that word, future proof their solutions going forward. To quote some of you, ACI is a game changer and a significant step in the realization of the Internet of Everything. The two will move closer together, both the Internet of Everything and Application Centric Infrastructure and move faster than many people anticipate. And Cisco will be there to lead. First, we will continue to increase our commitment to you, our shareholders. As you can see from the announcement today, our board has granted a new share repurchase authorization of $15 billion, which we intend to put to work. You should expect that over the next several quarters, we will exceed commitment to returning at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders, just as we did this past quarter.  In summary, I want to thank our shareholders, customers and partners for their support, especially those customers and partners that were integral to our success for the launch of ACI. In particular, I want to thank the Cisco family for working together as a team to ensure that our company is in a solid position to capture the opportunities we see in front of us. Let me turn it back to you, Mel. Melissa Selcher : Thanks, John. I wanted to clarify one comment John made during his product statement. We are not quite yet number one in blade server market. We are number two in that blade server market.  All right. We'll now open the floor to Q&A. We still request that sell side analysts please ask only one question. Operator please open the floor to questions. Operator :  Thank you. And our first question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi guys. Your guidance is very low if I got the numbers right, it\u2019s about 11% sequentially \u2013 11% down sequentially for revenue. Then I went back to 2000 -- October 2000 and I've never seen such a low number outside of 2008 or 2009, I am looking at it January 2009, and at that time the world was about to collapse, January 2009. That\u2019s when all the problems hit the financial system. And I am wondering why are you guiding so low for next quarter? It looks like the environment may continue to be weak but it's not as bad as it was in \u201809 and certainly not as bad as it was in October 2000 etc. So what are the components of the weakness for the next quarter? John Chambers : Okay. Let me do both. Let me talk about the component of the weakness and the areas we feel the strongest, so on. There are no comparisons in a measured way to 2009 or 2001. You basically look at our business and let me answer that very crisply [ph], because I know it\u2019s a thought on many people's minds given what we\u2019ve just guided to. The U.S. enterprise and commercial, which are the areas that I watch for a long term U.S. economic growth, both are in high single digits. And we feel pretty good about their pipeline going forward.  Our federal team executed well in a tough environment, so our state and local government and federal government is solid. Service provider, we need to make improvement on and we have a multiple step approach to how we are going to do that in terms of direction. You look around the world, the emerging markets, I have never seen that fast a move in emerging markets and that is something that when I talk with our industry peers, while there are exceptions, most of my CEO counterparts can almost finish my sentence in terms of what's occurring. It's also occurring with many of our customers where if you were to talk about Brazil as an example, they can finish each other's comments to CIOs about their business whether it\u2019s the consumer business or whether it's the manufacturing segment in terms of the direction.  We're very comfortable with our leadership and our share of spin gains in the marketplace. We do have to work in three areas. In terms of the focus on the emerging marketplaces, we are modeling for a challenging next couple of quarters. We believe that more than half the world\u2019s GDP occurs there. But we\u2019ve put in place a plan over a year ago that we will learn to continue to drive through the slowdown. Part of the reason, Gary, when we laid off people was to free up resources to move to emerging markets and you will see us increase our sales headcount in the appropriate emerging markets as we go forward to capitalize on that. We will literally expand focus on a countrywide prioritization and if you watch what we did in Israel, which is clearly a developed country, we will do that across other emerging markets. We will expand the executive contact and there will always be some unique situations where Cisco needs to execute well in one of our top 15 countries or there is unique issue like exist in China, that\u2019s just part of what emerging markets go. The service provider focus, we\u2019re in the middle of product transition, when product transitions occur at the CRS-X and NCS level, you begin to see a hesitation on how much the customers buy the current products. Rob, your sales team and Chuck\u2019s sales team have gone through and walked through where we are in that, but there\u2019s a natural kind of hesitation given uncertainty in the market and uncertainty business leaders about how fast they will move through these new platforms and how much they will continue to expand, which overtime they absolutely will the existing platforms in terms of the direction. Set-top box, we\u2019re going to take a 4% to 5% hit for a number of quarters in the future. What we\u2019re going to do on that, however, is continue to accelerate the movement to the cloud which has much higher gross margins. We made some leadership changes, as I said there earlier and we\u2019re also going to work on really value-add engineering, Gary, which I think your supply team has done an amazing job, so that we can look on more deals that would have better profits as we move forward. We are not going to change the organization structures that we have. We are organized in business entities to expand but we are going to change in terms of having a couple key leaders go across the whole company just like we did in enterprise where Chuck Robbins and Rob Soderberry with myself and [indiscernible] helped them to prioritize resources throughout that segment of the market and we will apply the resources to where areas that we had not moved as much resources, especially since now, we have done a good job at the high end core to other segments. That\u2019s kind of a summary of the position, Tal. What happened was we were $600 million to $700 million short of what we expected orders to be in this last quarter. It was almost all backend loaded and literally down to the last two weeks, we were disappointed by multiple hundreds of millions in terms of what we normally closed in the last couple of weeks. You have that shortfall not being in backlog going into next quarter and when you look at your sequentials, Tal, you have to go off of this new number as you look going for it. You add the two together that\u2019s a $1.2 billion challenge. Frank, would you add to that? Frank Calderoni : No. I think you covered it, John. I mean, it includes the key things what you said, material shortfall and orders in the back half of Q1 and specifically as we saw in October. This immediately hits not only affected our Q1 performance with the revenue being shorter than what we had provided in our guidance. So you are looking at the mid range of our guidance but it also ended up with a significant shortfall in the backlog at the end of Q1 and that affects the business opportunity that we have going into Q2. And then overall if you look at the business momentum now in Q2, specifically in emerging markets and service provider as you articulated earlier, those businesses as well the most challenged in Q2, when you look at that offset by the related impact that we have with the services business that ties to that as well that results in the guidance that we provided. Melissa Selcher : Yeah. Thanks, Tal. Next question, operator. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays. Ben Reitzes - Barclays: Hey. Good afternoon. John Chambers : Hi, Ben. Ben Reitzes - Barclays: Thank you. Hi. Couple of things that you didn\u2019t mention but I was wondering in emerging markets especially there\u2019s been a lot of concern out there about the NSA snooping and the impact that\u2019s had on global IT and global IT brands like yourself? And you maybe alluded to this with regard to your comments on China and the political situation? But I noticed Russia was perhaps down even more than China and what not? Do you feel that there\u2019s something more going on, this -- we\u2019re all floored by your guidance here? But is there something a little more to this that with customers outside of the U.S. thinking a little bit more about U.S. IT brands and is that impacting your business and if so or if not, then what do you do in the future? Thanks a lot, John. John Chambers : Sure. Ben, I think, if you look at it, it is an impact in China. I think we\u2019re all aware of that. I think it\u2019s totally impact on the total emerging country business, however, is fairly nominal. I do think we are seeing a slowdown in these emerging markets both in the decision making and their economies. And so I do not think it is a major factor across all of emerging. I do think it is a factor however in China. Rob, would you add anything to that? Rob Lloyd : I would just add, John, that this issue has caused increasingly customers to pause and another issue for them to evaluate, in all of those complexities that you've already discussed. So it's not having material impact but it's certainly causing people to stop and then rethink decisions and that is I think reflected in our results. Frank Calderoni : I think then what you articulate and we're trying to do too, the amount of inconsistent data is just causing customers to hesitate including at the country level. Operator : Our next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs & Co. Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, thanks very much. So it sounds like one of the issues you're dealing with is the transition on the routing side of the business and obviously you just introduced some fairly large platforms on the switching side, which is even larger than your routing business. Would you expect to see a similar top haul [ph] basically in the switching business in the next couple of quarters as you work through that? John Chambers : That's what we have modeled into it. It won't be a haul, but the growth will not be what we would normally experience. Once again, the sales teams have set up our products by individual areas, but you combine with just a very slow spending environment. Simona, let me back for a second. When I talked to CIOs on the issues of Business Council, as an example. Half the CEOs that they surveyed, Chief Executive Officer they surveyed believed the economy is going to grow between 0% and 2%. They are modeling their budgets conservatively and as they think through this the CIOs will hesitate as they have product choices, doesn't mean they won't continue to buy our Core 7000s and other products, they will but they are going to strike a balance of what do they want to do in terms of the mix and as they commit through. So, yes, we had modeled this in Q2 and Q3.  And yes, to the indirect part of your question, as you come into Q4 and come up to Q1 of next year with all the appropriate caveats because of where we are on product cycles, where we are in terms of what we're going to double down on in some of the things that we need to address, my goal for our company is to get back to positive revenue growth in Q1 and ideally in Q4. But that's a stretch goal with all the appropriate caveats associated with it. So, you will have product cycles working towards that. You will have our momentum in the market working to it and I think that is kind of what our expectations are. You saw Frank's bookends on the earnings. We did it deliberately so that you could understand the areas that we are operating in, Simona. Operator : Our next question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS Securities. Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS: I was just trying to understand your guidance again in the context of your deferred revenue growth. I mean, it seems like you got pretty strong growth both sequentially and year-over-year in product revenue growth \u2013 product deferred revenue growth. So just want to understand again, I'm really perplexed by the guidance here. I understand some of the pain points you identified, but maybe if you could just shed some light there. Frank Calderoni : So, if you look at the deferred revenue, Amitabh, the deferred revenue was up around 11%. If you look at underneath what that is, that shows a lot of the business that we have on collaboration side, which is moving to more of the recurring. So we have more deferral associated with some of the offerings that we have there. That's a majority of where that is. So that\u2019s the good news from the perspective, it starts to show some of the momentum that we have in the collaboration businesses, is one of the businesses John mentioned earlier that we have been really investing in on the product portfolio over the past year and we're looking at this product set over longer period of time and also looking at some of the model that our customers are looking to purchase. And some of that is going to be more of a recurring revenue model which is kind of improving the deferred revenue. John Chambers : An example on that, Amitabh, would be security and with the movements on Sourcefire. It was an area that really began to take hold this quarter. I think our customers realize we are very serious about moving to be the number one security player. You will see us expanding consultancy in this area, and as we did that, even our network security grew 12% which had not grown as you all know for a very long time. But in the security, if you look at this next year's reported, we'll report \u2013 Mel, I want to make sure we deliver on the commitments. We will report a booking growth and revenue growth. And it would not surprise me in these areas to see booking growth in the low 20s and revenue growth in the low \u2013 in 10%, 11%, 12% because of the conversion to future deferred revenues and licensing.  So we are moving as fast as we can because Gary is kind of hunting this model for us, it is a juggling act in terms of how do we move to recurring revenues to more applications, so that more and more of our business is a given each quarter and we can be more where most of our peers are, where they get the majority of their business already done before they enter a quarter. But it takes you a while to get there and that is also built into our factors, Amitabh. Frank Calderoni : And the number I gave, that's 11% year-on-year for product and then the services was up about 2%, total deferred revenue up about 5%. Melissa Selcher : Thanks, Amitabh. Operator, next question please. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Kulbinder Garcha - Credit Suisse : The question, I just want to clarify on the guidance again and this is for John and Frank, I think. It sounds like, I understand the set-top box issues and how that\u2019s impacting revenue growth. I understand the emerging market and macro issue in China is more than just a macros issue it sounds like. So I\u2019m curious John how you fix that, it seems that\u2019s a very complicated, highly political subject then? And on the service provider side, did the actual product transition impact on your revenues or did it actually surprise you, I would have thought you would have known about that going into this period of time? Thanks. John Chambers : Okay. So in reverse order, a series of questions but I think all very fair. I understand the way that we do our revenue and booking forecast is, we have a very good sales team and they roll up the forecast and we do it by regions and by countries and by products. We then based upon that forecast determine what our revenue guidance is for a quarter. Now, they take into consideration what they see in the product pipeline, what percentage of the pipeline they expect to fill out very, very detailed approach to it. The field, of course, however, almost never get sale burst, up or down. And the pace of change that you\u2019re really seeing in this, Kulbinder is that, it\u2019s almost what occurs in a quarter just a year ago will now be two or three quarters worth and it was almost, if you were to a pick a quarter, you didn\u2019t want to end up here, it was in early October this year doing the uncertainties in terms of the balance on that. But no, in terms of the product transitions just 120 days ago when we reported the last quarter, none of us anticipated the change in Washington, the uncertainties, the business confidence that would occur from this and I\u2019m not making excuses, this is what the customers are telling us. And in terms of their going into next year, their expectations are down for the year, their budgets are down for the year, they are not taking as much risk. Now the good news is this can turnaround just as quickly as it slows. But in terms of the overall approach there were positives and there were negatives in the groups and it was a quarter of very inconsistent data, much like we articulated that our customers see in terms of the economics and other issues. Melissa Selcher : Okay. Thanks Kulbinder. Operator, next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank. Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank : Hi. Hi, John. John Chambers : Hey, Brian. Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank : Couple of questions for you, first, can you just run down on switching in terms of how you see that capital versus data center switching how you see both of those doing over the next couple of quarters? And then with regard to your guidance you do talk about gross margin still being kind of in the 60%, 62% range even with revenues down like this just mix, lower set-top box sales or is it something else with regard to what you are doing to manage the margins in that range? Thanks. John Chambers : Sure. So a number of questions and I want the first one and I\u2019m going to ask the gross margin question. Gary, we have done very good job on gross margins. We are focusing on that across the Board. Our guidance has been very consistent 61%, 62% gross margins for a long time, Frank. And we don\u2019t see things material in the market that that cause us uncomfortable with that. We have done a very good job of value engineering, a very good job of modeling this path, a very good job of designing our new products and it might have slipped by some people, when we say we design then for the current gross margin level, we\u2019ve never been able to do that before and we did that following some of our experiences back in 2011 and 2009. So, we learn, we do it different in terms of the direction. We are continuing to anticipate set-top boxes falling and that is built into our next several quarter phenomena. Now I missed the first part of the question, I apologize. Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank : It was switching mix? John Chambers : Oh! Switching, Mel, won\u2019t let me talk about a specific quarter in terms of the guidance. So let me fast forward to summer this next year. Summer this next year we will have the best switching architectures in the industry by ourselves. We basically would take all of the advantages, merchant silicon and custom silicon and put them together. We will bring the promises of SDN to life literally in an open and simplistic way. It won\u2019t be slideware. This will be complete production and it will literally accomplish the separation of applications from the infrastructure with a common policy. So if you looked across all of our switching lines for the Nexus in 5000, 7000, you begin to look in terms of what we\u2019re doing with the 9000 within semi and you begin to look at Rob Soderbery\u2019s product group, which I think he\u2019s completely refreshed Rob Lloyd, if I remember right. Our switching portfolio is the strongest it\u2019s ever been in the marketplace and looks really solid. To the indirect part of your question, on the routing side we feel equally as good. I like where we are with the high-end products. And remember, NCS is an architecture. It's kind of the nervous system of making all this work. And with the CRS-X, it has the new capabilities that the same chip designs, et cetera we put on NCS. So high-end, we're never going to let that get taken away from us again. It happened 10 years ago, never going to let it happen. But now we need to move the resources to be able to address the access level, where it\u2019s an area at the low end we have to do better than couple of our competitors are doing well.  At the high-end VPN capability, ASR 9000 actually is growing comfortably over 20%. But as other legacy products we have to do better. So in terms of product portfolio, it really looks good. Our ability to bring them together looks good. We got to I think pick up our game in a couple of areas in service provider to think of solution selling as opposed to box-type of selling and that we are going to have Pankaj Patel, who is our Head of Engineering and Nick Adamo, who is the Head of the Americas two together with myself and Pankaj flying cover for them to be able to address this.  And when we started on this on enterprise, Gary, a year ago, enterprise at this time did not really have the pieces together, because the business entities are great on products but not combining them and you combine that with, Gary and as to our services you can certainly provide a solution service provider the same way. I have run this strategy off of several of the top CEOs in the country and in the world on the service provider side, they will buy into it if we can execute. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein, Cowen. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co.: John, I apologize, I know this question has been asked ten ways till Sunday. But I am trying to parse -- John Chambers : Okay. We knew it would be asked again. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co.: In trying to parse out your commentary about emerging market, service provider is a general proposition in terms of as being the bulk of the weakness. In your commentary from a timing standpoint regarding the last two weeks of the quarter, two questions here. One, I know \u2013 assuming what you saw in the last two weeks of the quarter has extended into the first two weeks of November; and secondly, can you give some additional color on top of what you have already said in terms of those two different issues that collapsed in the last two weeks, the very recent Vantage collapse and the more generic commentary about emerging markets and service provider? John Chambers : So the first two weeks of the new quarter are not really indicative of where you go. But the last two weeks of last quarter was really tough. So, no it did not carry over in that type of format. I think you deserve a fair answer to that. Not deserve. We want to be very transparent on it and I think it's the right way to answer your question in terms of the direction. The second part of the question was -- Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co.: Mainly around the last two weeks of the collapse and I don't think you characterized it as a collapse. It was more around the last month being slower and normally we pick it up and we didn't. John Chambers : Yes, Paul, if you look at it, just using Q4 as an example, we went into the last month a little bit off the numbers we expected. The forecast came down and the last two weeks of the quarter, they actually came up $300 million over their forecast. That did not happen. This sales team is really good and so, the fact that we missed it that much in the last month and that much during the last two weeks, we clearly factored in assuming that we're going to continue to see challenges in this quarter and the next quarter. So we did build that in. Hopefully, it'll be conservative, but we always believe when you see trends on this broader basis, especially in the emerging, you have to adjust to it and say it'll last for a couple of quarters. What we saw in emerging was very consistent across the board. Every one of our top 10 emerging countries missed their forecast and was off by a fair amount. So it wasn't just that it was down, the last couple of weeks, they kept dropping and dropping. I think, Rob, if I remember right, it was over half of our shortfall, the last couple of weeks versus forecast. Rob Lloyd : Yes, it was John, and our top five emerging countries all had negative performance in the quarter between \u2013 I think it was a low of 18% to a high of 30% down. So it was -- those are the big ones that really contribute to the numbers and it was consistent across all of those major countries. John Chambers : I would rather there have been a couple of countries, Paul, because then you can say let's go fix them, and there are always a couple of countries that we'll either have issues on, some we create ourselves, some of them are done to us, some of them are way beyond our control. But the consistency of that number is what concerned me. And we usually unfortunately see things couple of quarters ahead of our peers. This time we were little bit surprised. We saw the softening in Q4 and we were very upfront with it to every one about what happened in our top five emerging countries in Q4 where we said they went from 13% growth the quarter before to flat in Q4. The other 15 countries continue to grow in low teens. This time all of them came down and so out of our top 10, it was pretty brutal on that. The fact that a player like IBM saw -- too has probably 60% of their business given in the quarter and saw that this extreme indicates what we think is going to be more of an industry phenomenon, not affecting everyone but currently affecting lot of people. Melissa Selcher : Thank you, Operator. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets. Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets : Thank you. Frank, just a quick one, does the guidance include Sourcefire and -- a question for you, John. If I think about Cisco as a company has a lot of product, a lot of regional breadth and your portfolio approach typically gets you balanced, so if one region or segment underperforms, that\u2019s usually offset by some -- another region or segment that is outperforming. So we\u2019re not getting that historic offset and instead we\u2019re getting this deterioration. So just wondering if you feel that this is maybe a structural change to the switching and routing in data networking market. And it does sound as if it will take several quarters at least to refill the drained backlog, was there some consideration to reset your 5 to 7 long-term top line growth rate and should we also plan for some more OpEx cuts as you protect your earnings? John Chambers : I\u2019m going to have Frank comment about overall view on OpEx. I\u2019m going to address first the structural change. It\u2019s actually reverse. If you watch what we\u2019re doing, the architectures take time to sell, our customers buy into it. Mark, if you had been at the CIO conference and I encourage you to go watch it, now it\u2019s up on the website. In that, we had 95 of the top CIOs around the world in the session. We asked them about every major high-tech player. Now, we delivered into their hands because that would\u2019ve been fair. But we asked them where they were out of the whole room and it shocked me because I knew it was a couple critics. When I asked them how many of you are going to be more committed to Cisco and we\u2019re going to be your key partner, more of a key partner, year from now than you were a year ago. The whole room raised their hand and I walked out to the audience and a couple of people asked and they said, John, we\u2019re a believer and when we asked about other IT players on that, no one more than 10 raise their hand on any of the other top six IT players in terms of that type of commitment. Mark, what that says is we got our vision and strategy right. We mailed it, they know we mailed it and they said now let\u2019s see you execute and then they said by the way, security would be one you ought to go after much more aggressively because we can\u2019t solve on it and it\u2019s our top issue in terms of the direction. So the structural change, the answer is no. We got it right in terms of the products. Our customers know they actually saw from the ACI launch. Look at the ecosystem that was up there with us. I mean it was commanding. It was powerful. Look at the customers out there with us. When you have the top cloud players from Europe, they are already on the stage with you and talking about why they are committed to this architecture, when you have players such as EMC and NetApp there in terms of -- here they see the opportunity. You have a Microsoft nearly sit on stage and if you watch that for 5 minutes, it was probably the most articulate view of where they see the industry going and why they are going to align with this on ACI from Satya who is one of the top players there and he gets it. So no, it\u2019s not a structural issue. We do however any structure that you have in the engineering has strength and limitations. And so when you\u2019re focused on product and we have done amazing job, Gary, on the product verticals that\u2019s a very effective structure you have. We now need to leverage across it to combine these and be able to move resources around to where either our opportunities are or our exposures. And so when you finish in high-end routing and you\u2019ve done extremely well and you\u2019ve got your leadership, how do you align resources quickly, they say, let\u2019s go to very low end access. And this is very unique and this is why we\u2019re putting two of our best on it. By the way, those are the same two who did this 3.5 years ago. They got our leadership and service provider to be able to save work across the group, combine it with services and combine it in terms of go-to market. In terms of 5% to 7%, you would be disappointed and shocked in us. If after just a quarter and a cycle here with emerging markets and something that service provided that we can and will crack if we suddenly say, we\u2019re going to change things. We will listen very carefully. We will provide more guidance in December but in terms of winning, we\u2019re winning big and you all know this. You talked to customers, you all go to channels. We had some issues that we can do better. We\u2019re going to address that but you have issues in terms of the emerging markets which are largely in our opinion macro driven and we will power through that. We're going to do exactly what we did before during slowdown, other people will pull back. We will put more resources in, we'll come out of it stronger and larger market shares. You never say, no pressure, because I know Frank would get me, but we have no abnormal pressure on gross margins. Gary, what the team is doing across the board on that, the execution is world class. Even our low-margin stuff, we continue to do value engineering on it and the direction.  The reason I'm going on a little bit longer is we have all the pieces here. Barring a huge surprise we're going to be the number one IT player and none of our customers say, you haven't got a shot at it. They say you got to execute, but if you watch none of our players are aligned with that, and none of the other players are able to look you all in the eye and say on gross margins we aren\u2019t facing major pressures. We have done extremely well there. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a structural issue on it, I think it's really the three issues we talked. New product transitions which by the way we are not going to ever get behind again at the high end. I have done that once, that is painful and it took us four or five years to get it back. We are now at the high end switching, nobody matches what Insieme does on this. High end routing, nobody can touch what we did in terms of the routing, the throughput, the download, the whole NetFlix library in one second across your technology. So I feel very comfortable with where we are and very comfortable on it. We will always be transparent. We promised you all when we see something we'll tell out exactly like it is even if it is painful and I'll ask you again today you want to be sure you want to but this is what we are seeing. Hopefully we're being conservative and Frank to the question I think it was on expenses. Frank Calderoni : There were two questions. One, Mark asked if Sourcefire is included in the guidance and the answer is yes. And secondly, as far as looking at, you were asking about op expense and restructuring. We talked last quarter about the portfolio that we were carrying into FY\u201914 making the adjustments to ensure that we're making the investments and being able to afford the acquisitions that we did like Sourcefire, like Composite Software to make sure that we are emphasizing areas in the portfolio [indiscernible] growth opportunities like security, like mobility, like cloud, like services. And we put plans in place to be able to do that. We feel right now we've got to continue to execute to that. We do have more just continuing on what we announced on the restructuring, we did some this past quarter, with some another quarter, outside the United States which was part of the plan. And then the other important thing is to make sure that as we go through the fiscal year, that we continue to make sure that we follow through on those investments both the acquisitions as well as the internal investments. So that we can see the ability for a long term growth. John Chambers : Mel, I know we ran a little bit over versus our goal being through about 2.30, but thank you for that [ph]. Let me turn it back to you. Melissa Selcher : Yes, absolutely. Thanks John. Cisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our FY\u201914 second quarter results will be on Wednesday, February 12, 2014 at 1.30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4.30 p.m. Eastern Time. Again, I would like to remind you that in light of Regulation FD, Cisco plans to retain its longstanding policy to not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it's done through an explicit public disclosure. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation and continued support. This concludes our call. Operator : Thank you for participating on today's conference call.",

At the request of Cisco Systems, today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I will like to introduce Melissa Selcher, Senior Director, Analyst and Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Melissa Selcher : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our 96th quarterly conference call. This is Melissa Selcher, and I am joined by John Chambers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Frank Calderoni, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Rob Lloyd, President of Development and Sales and Gary Moore, President and Chief Operating Officer. I would like to remind you that we have a corresponding webcast with slides on our website in the Investor Relations section. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, and cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the Investor Relations website. Click on the Financial Reporting section of the website to access these documents. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both, GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements and as such are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-on-year basis unless stated otherwise. I will now turn it over to John for his commentary on the quarter. John Chambers : Mel, Thank you very much. In Q2 FY'14, Cisco delivered record non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.47 and revenues of $11.2 billion, down 8% year-over-year. The market and the dynamics in our business played out largely as we described in our last quarterly conference call. We saw the impact for emerging markets, service provider and high-end product transitions in our business as we discussed last quarter. I will provide more detail in the business update. As we navigate these economic and product cycles, we are managing our business to deliver shareholder value. In this quarter, we returned a record $4.9 billion to shareholders through dividends of approximately $900 million and $4 billion in share buyback. We managed non-operating expenses, reducing them in the high single digits year-over-year and Gary, Frank, really nice job on that. We built backlog just as we said we would. We believe this strategy that has enabled us to emerge stronger from every previous cycle remained solid. We capitalize on the major market transitions, we partner with our customers to deliver innovation and solutions that fuel their business. In our view this next wave of the Internet, the Internet of Everything will encompass every technology transition we are seeing in the market today. With the network squarely at the center, we are building the platform for the Internet of Everything with scale and security to address the unparalleled complex the requirements. We plan to continue to disrupt the market and disrupt ourselves to deliver the value and solutions our customers require. Last year, we introduced entirely new approaches to networking, designed around future proofing the best customers are making today and enabling them to harness the benefit of Internet of Everything. As we capitalize on these transitions, I would like to summarize the dynamics of our business in the following five points. First, the Internet of Everything has moved from an interesting concept to a business imperative driving opportunities across every major vertical. It was the central conversations at the Consumer Electronics Show and the World Economic Forum, the last couple months with CEOs, industry and country leaders globally. Anyone walking away from these events should characterize this year as the tipping point. Second, we continue our strength in U.S. enterprise and U.S. commercial as we said we would at last quarter's conference call, with year-over-year orders up 13% in U.S. enterprise and 10% in U.S. commercial. While we face SDN, white label servers and public cloud solutions to this market we see our ability to deliver architectures and cost portfolio solutions with scale, security and CapEx and OpEx savings as a driver of our success in this market. Third, we are managing through the economic and product cycles, just as we outlined at the last call. Emerging market orders declined 3% year-over-year as compared to last quarter's down 12% with the BRIC, Mexico down 10% this quarter. SP orders declined 12% and product transitions in core routing and switching contributing to double-digit revenue declines. As we move to reaccelerate growth across the businesses, we remain focused on managing the levers to deliver value to our shareholders, while making the investments to position Cisco for the long-term. Fourth, we believe our focus on architectures is really paying off. As the pace and complexity of IT increases, Cisco's ability to bring together technologies, servers and solution across silos should continue to drive differentiation, preference and, over time, gross margins. Point players will be faster at times, but I believe you will see our advantage in delivering integrated architectures at scale win in the end. Fifth, we said last quarter that our goal is to build product backlog and we exited Q2 with book-to-bill greater than one. We are pleased with our progress managing through the cycles in our market and our business and as such wanted to give you an update on our Q3 revenue guidance before Frank details guidance later. That allows you to help frame the rest of the discussion in this call. For Q3, we expect revenue to decline in the range of down 6% to down 8%. As we execute on our plan to return to growth over the next several quarters, subject to all the appropriate caveats discussed during this call, we also plan to continue to build backlog. There is no question that we have moved from a compute centric to a network-centric model for IT. Cisco is building the simple, smart and highly secure solutions that will enable our customers to capitalize on the cost efficiencies, agility and growth opportunities that lie ahead. Our approach is unique. It starts with the central role the network, which is the only place to connect everything, people, process, data and things. Our transition is from selling boxes like most of our peers to selling business outcomes. Our delivery is through architectures, partners and services and we will help our customers utilize their 180 billion Cisco install base to capture the most value today and build for tomorrow. As we move into this next era of the Internet with our customers, our commitment to you is to invest to sustain our industry leadership position while balancing the evolution in our business and a very strong focus on shareholder return. Frank, at this time, I would like to turn it over to you. Frank Calderoni : Thank you, John. In Q2 FY '14, our business performed as we expected. We continue to manage through the transitions in our business and challenges we outlined in our last earnings call. From a top and bottom line perspective, total revenue was $11.2 billion, down 8%, non-GAAP net income was $2.5 billion and non-GAAP EPS was $0.47 per share down 8% year-on-year. Our GAAP net income was $1.4 billion and GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis were $0.27. Product revenue declined 11% and service revenue increased 3% with product book-to-billed greater than one. Overall non-GAAP operating margin was 27.8%. In Q2 our total non-GAAP gross margin was 61.3% within our expectations of 61% to 62%. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 58.8%. As our overall volume of business was down this quarter, it negatively impacted our non-GAAP product gross margins in several ways. First, we have less leverage in our cost structure. We did not get the full benefit of cost efficiencies at the lower volumes. Second, as our volumes in higher margin core products were lower, we saw an unfavorable mix impact toward lower margin products such as SP video and servers. Third, while the impact from pricing was consistent with prior quarters, it was at the higher end of the historical range in Q2. As we improve business volume, we expect it will balance the drivers of our product gross margins. Our non-operating expenses were $3.7 billion or 33.5% as a percentage of revenue that's compared to 34.1% in Q2 of FY'13. Our headcount decreased by approximately 1,000 from the end of the fiscal year to 74,065. Our expenses benefited from reduced variable compensation expense as a result of our lower financial performance and efficiencies associated with our recent workforce rebalancing. GAAP net income for the second quarter fiscal 2014, included a pretax charge of $655 million related to the expected cost of remediation of issues with memory components in certain products sold in prior fiscal years. The charges related to the expected remediation cost for certain products containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010. These components have been determined to have the potential to sell due to a design or manufacturing defect. These are widely used across the industry and are included in the number of Cisco's products. Although the majority of these products are beyond Cisco's warranty terms and the failure rates are low, Cisco is proactively working with customers on mitigation. This results in a charge to product cost of sales during the second quarter fiscal 2014. This charge has been excluded from non-GAAP results as Cisco does not believe is a reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments were $47.1 billion, including $3.3 billion available in the U.S. at the end of the quarter. We generated operating cash flows of $2.9 billion during the quarter. We continue to drive our capital allocation strategy. As you recall, in Q4 FY'12, we committed to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually through dividends and share repurchases. In FY'13, we returned over 50% of free cash flow and I am pleased that in the first half of FY'14, we have returned in excess of the 150% of free cash flow to our shareholders comprised of $6 billion of share repurchases and $1.8 billion a dividend. In Q2, we returned $4.9 billion to shareholders, a quarterly record for Cisco. This included $4 billion to share repurchase and approximately $900 million through our quarterly dividend. Our diluted share count decreased by approximately 100 million shares, driven by these repurchases. We expect the remaining impact of the Q2 share repurchase to further reduce share count next quarter. In addition, today, our board approved an increase of $0.02 to the quarterly dividend to $0.19 per share an approximate 12% increase, representing a yield of approximately 3.3%. This dividend increase, combined with the anticipated share repurchases in the second half of the fiscal year, would comfortably exceed a return of over 100% for the full fiscal year of our free cash flow. In Q3, we anticipate incurring additional debt to refinance our maturing bonds and enhance our domestic cash balances to support our ongoing commitment of returning cash to shareholders. John, I would turn it back over you. John Chambers : Thank you, Frank. I will now provide some additional detail on our Q2 performance and trends we are seeing in our business and in the market. I will start with an update on the three economic and product cycles we outlined in our last call. First, we saw emerging orders declined 3% year-over-year compared to the 12% decline in Q1, with the BRICS [plus] Mexico down 10% as I said earlier. What we saw some improvement quarter-to-quarter, emerging markets remain challenged as we discussed in the last conference call. While this economic trend remains out of our control, we have put in place important programs and efforts designed to capture growth and position Cisco to capture share even if these markets remain challenged. Second, service provider orders declined 12% year-over-year, SP Video orders including the set-top boxes were down 20%. Service provider orders, excluding SP Video, were down 7%. Product transitions and core routing, along with the emerging markets weakness, also negatively impacted service provider results. Third, product transitions. At the end of last year, we introduced new switching and routing platforms which typically ramp up over four to eight quarters. Our next-generation routing business saw year-over-year revenue decline of 11% with orders down 5%. As we manage through these transitions, we have announced reference customers for the NCS platform including Telstra, KDDI and BSkyB. We expect both the NCS and CRS-X to ramp through back half of the year. Switching revenue declined 12% year-over-year with orders down 6%, as we saw some deals delayed as customers architect and qualified their new application centric infrastructure systems. We were very pleased with the first shipping quarter of the Nexus 9000 as the booking pipeline from the beginning to end of the quarter nearly tripled. We believe we are firmly taking share in the 10Gig and the 40Gig data center switching markets. I will now walk through the elements of the product portfolio that I have not yet mentioned in terms of year-over-year revenue growth. Data center revenue grew 10% with order growth rates in the mid-30s. Revenue this quarter in data center had some impact from lower backlog coming into the quarter and the timing of shipments. The pipeline continues to look very strong and UCS continues to take market share. Wireless declined 4%. Cisco's cloud networking platform, Meraki, continues to perform very well growing over 100% year-over-year and more than doubling customers from 4,300 one quarter ago to 9,600 in this quarter, due largely to the power of the Cisco channel. Approximately one-third of Meraki's business is deferred. We are also seeing the wireless impact to more complex architectural deals in our large enterprises and service providers where wireless is part of a much broader solution which have long sales cycles. Security revenue grew 17% with particular strength in network security up 21% and content security up 5%. We are seeing orders grow significantly faster than revenue up 30% this quarter as we continue to shift toward more recurring revenue models in this business. The Sourcefire acquisition continues to perform very well and there is no question that the Sourcefire acquisition has accelerated our position as a leading security company and in our view, the only one capable of delivering an end-to-end architectural approach. We are very pleased with the performance of both Meraki and Sourcefire acquisitions as part of our build, buy and partner innovation strategy. Now moving on to collaboration. Collaboration revenues decline 7% with a decline of 9% year-over-year in unified communications as we plan for the upcoming product refresh with our customers. The WebEx conferencing business had a very strong quarter up 21%. In WebEx we so many matrix including billable minutes and new customers options grow quite well. This growth came from both very large enterprise deals as well as good traction in the SMB space. It is worth noting that our goal to move more Cisco's revenue to recurring is taking place today in our collaboration businesses, security businesses and with respect to some of our recent acquisitions like Meraki. This quarter we saw product deferred revenues increase approximately $100 million quarter over quarter. Over time, you will see us introduce new consumption models in other parts of our business that align with how customers want to buy IT today which will also help us drive better visibility going forward. Services revenue grew 3% with both technical services and advanced services up 3%. As we discussed last quarter, service revenues are currently tied closely to product growth. So the deceleration in product momentum continues to impact service revenues. Continued investment and consulting services, remote monitoring smart services and analytics would drive additional opportunities in the quarters to come. We did begin delivering a new set of security services this quarter continuing to better address our customers' top priority. Now on to our cloud business. We will not report this as a specific product category but rather reflected across our product categories continues to grow very well. On the cloud infrastructure side, we once again advanced our position as the leading cloud infrastructure provider. In Q2 we saw double-digit booking growth with massively scalable data center customers as they chose and purchase the Cisco UCS and Nexus portfolio. Our cloud services business also continued very strong growth. As mentioned before, we experienced very strong growth in Meraki web ask and security cloud services business. At Cisco Live in Milan, in January, we announced several important additions to our cloud portfolio, including Cisco InterCloud, the ability to create interoperability and highly secure hybrid cloud environments across multiple public and private clouds. While our peers' talent workload mobility within their proprietary cloud offerings, only Cisco can enable organizations to combine and move workloads, storage, compute and applications across different clouds and hypervisors, securely, with all the associated network and security policies. I will now move onto provide background on our geographic and customer segments in terms of Q2 year-over-year product orders unless specifically stated otherwise. In Q2, product orders declined 4% year-over-year. As we said earlier, total product book-to-bill was greater than 1. To provide a geographic view of orders this quarter, Americas declined 5%. In the U.S. balancing out strong enterprise and commercial momentum, U.S. public sector declined 4%, within U.S. public sector state and local and education grew 7% and U.S. federal declined 16%. U.S. service providers declined 11% as we managed through the SP Video transition and product cycles mentioned earlier. Now moving on to Asia-Pacific, China and Japan, which as a region declined 5%, China declined 8% as we and our peers continue to work through the economic and political dynamics in that country. The Europe, Middle East Africa and Russia region declined 2%. Northern Europe and the U.K. are showing good momentum, while Southern Europe continues to be challenging. Signs suggest Europe is stabilizing, they are still fragile especially in the South. Moving onto a segment view, enterprise declined 2%, commercial grew 1%, public sector grew 1% on a global basis, and as mentioned above, service provider declined 12%. As we said on last call, managing through product and market cycles is part of being a leader in the technology industry, we feel very confident in our ability to work through these cycles overcoming the coming quarters. We will continue to tell you exactly what we see and manage the business to perform to the expectations we set with you as we did this quarter. Frank, I am now going to turn it back over to you. Frank Calderoni : Let me provide a few comments on our outlook for the third quarter. Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in these forward-looking statements and that actual results could be above or below our guidance. The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with reconciliation to GAAP. As John discussed earlier, we expect total revenue to decline in the range of 6% to 8% on a year-over-year basis. For the third quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 62%. Given the business volumes assumed in our revenue guidance it is most likely to be at the low end of this range. Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 is expected to be in the range of 26.5% to 27.5% and our non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be approximately 21% in the third quarter. Our Q3 FY'14 non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.47 $0.49 per share. As we communicated last quarter, we expect FY'14 non-GAAP earnings per share to range from $1.95 to $2.05. We anticipate our GAAP earnings to be lower than non-GAAP EPS by about $0.10 to $0.13 per share in Q3'14 and $0.56 to $0.62 for the full year. This range includes pre-tax impact of approximately $50 million in Q3 FY'14 and up to $550 million for the full year as a result of our anticipated restructuring charges related to our workforce reduction plan that we announced last quarter. During Q2 FY'14, we recognized pretax charges to our financial statements of $73 million related to that announcement. Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for more detail. Other than those quantified items noted previously, there are no other significant differences between our GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance. This guide assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructuring and tax or other events which may or may not be significant. And as a reminder Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now hand the call back over to John for detail on the business momentum and trends. John? John Chambers : Frank, thank you very much. Managing transitions has been a core foundation of our success for nearly 30 years. The Internet of Everything is the biggest market opportunity ahead encompassing every technology trend in the market today. In recent months the Internet of Everything has become the center of most every conversation with CEOs, industry and country leaders. 2014 will be the inflection point for the Internet of Everything. The level the excitement we see in the conversations were having today and with customers about the next wave of the Internet, reminds me of the mid-1990s. At that time, we saw the Internet and e-commerce moving from just a tech thing to something that did impact every industry. Like customers did when the Internet and e-commerce were becoming mainstream, customers are turning to Cisco as a trusted partner today to capitalize on the opportunity and minimize the risk in their business as they move into the Internet of Everything. As we saw in the e-commerce day, there is a light between thought leadership and mainstream adoption and we still are only in the beginning stages. We are seeing tangible early traction, for example, in our top 50 targeted accounts with over $2 billion opportunity for Cisco. We are managing the transitions in our portfolio today and building for the Internet of Everything for tomorrow. This is how I am looking and evaluating our progress. First, our willingness to change and disrupt. You heard me say for at least two years, the pace of change has become exponential. Multiple transitions are occurring at the same time requiring Cisco to transform on multiple fronts faster than we have done before. Our scale, customer relationships and number one market position in most of our targeted categories gives us a huge advantage as we deliver a new model for IT. The next generation of network will collapse the OSI stack from seven layers to three, bringing applications, networking and security together at scale. This will not only happen in the data center as we are seeing today but across the campus, access and into the cloud. Second, customer traction. We don't get to decide whether or not we will emerge as the number one IT company. Our customers do. What we do get to decide is how we continue to deliver the value to our customers to retain the market leading position. This will be done by selling business outcomes enabled by architectures. I look closely at how we are engaging with customers and moving from technology provider to a trusted business partner. Whether it is the $3 billion of value creative in the city of Barcelona through connected and intelligent infrastructure or the first digital country Israel or several major retailers basing the networks on Cisco in order to prepare for the Internet of Everything, our customers are coming to us to capitalize on the opportunity. Third, operational excellence and disciplined cost management. We managed non-GAAP operating expenses very well this quarter, decreasing 9% as we focus on cost management and productivity. This execution shows we are able to focus on cost as we transition the business. We continue to focus on operating as an efficient organization while at the same time making the right investments to drive long-term growth. Fourth, creating shareholder value. As we execute our strategy to become the number one IT company, we have also committed to returning at least 50% of cash flow annually to our shareholders. As Frank said earlier, we will comfortably exceed the amount for the balance of the fiscal year. When our operating results have been impacted by a challenging macro environment in the emerging markets along with choices we are making to transform the company, we demonstrated that our confidence in the future and our support for shareholders by materially increasing our capital return as we did last quarter. We continue this focus on shareholder value with the $4 billion share repurchase this quarter and the dividend increase we announced today. Change has always been good for Cisco and our track record for transforming ourselves, both as a company and as leaders, is unparalleled. We are as close to our customers and partners as ever. We understand their challenges and where they need us to be there, and we are using this position to build the products, solutions and platforms to meet the demands of the market. This to me, has always been the key leading indicator of future success and financial results, and gives me confidence that we will emerge as the number one IT company. Mel, let me turn it over to you. Melissa Selcher : Thank you, John. We will now open the floor to Q&A. We still request that sell side analysts, please ask only one question. Operator, please open the floor to questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking question. Question is on the product gross margin, which decline quite a bit sequentially and was at the lowest level we have seen in a while and you went through some of the volume and mix issue some calls, so I was hoping to touch upon the competitive environment from both, traditional and nontraditional vendors to what degree there was any change in pricing. Perhaps beyond Q3, do you think you can get the gross margin back towards the mid to upper end of the 61% to 62% gross margin ranges, volumes improve and new products ramp or should we be thinking about the lower end of this range longer-term? John Chambers : Okay. Frank, I am going to have you handle the second part. The first part, there was nothing abnormal about this quarter's pricing trends at all. No abnormality in terms of competitors we saw, new or existing models or new startups. The field is going to go after key wins and opportunities to capture major franchises and key strategic beginning of architectural plays. I think it's good as we begin to drive for growth. In terms of timing what we said traditionally in terms of the growth, you watch our order improvements, you watch our steady progress each quarter, which I think we have done up to this point in time and are going to do it again this next quarter and you will see as we come through these product transitions at the high end routing and switching, and as you see us began to grow our service provider strategy more together, you will see these turns up in Q4 and Q1 and Q2 in terms of momentum from an order perspective. Frank, I am going to switch it over to you in terms of gross margin comments. Frank Calderoni : Jess, as I mentioned, we came in at 61.3% within the range of 61% to 62%, and provided the guidance in the range of 61% to 62% for the next quarter and saying it's at the low-end of that range, primarily in Q2 as well as Q3, the issue is volumes, so to answer your question and that's driving both, most of the cost as well as the mix that I talked about, so as volume does improve that gives us the ability to also improve the gross margin. When I think about it from a long range perspective, we talked about 61% to 62% for some period of time as volume improved and we get into a more growth scenario from a topline perspective that enables us to be at the high end of that range or even above that range. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities : Great. Thanks. John Chambers : When you rethink about it, Jess, we have control over our pricing, our expenses and gross margins and we are managing these as levers. As volumes come back as Frank said, and I believe very firmly they will, you will see the gross margins improve as well, but reminding everybody for the last couple years, I have been saying gross margins will be in the 61% to 62% range and plus or minus 1% or 2%, and I think the last time we said very openly was impact in 2012. Melissa Selcher : Thanks, Jess. Operator, next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS. Amitabh Passi - UBS: Hi. Thank you. John, what is the risk that you have yourself to spread across to many areas where you are fighting multiple battles on multiple fronts we have just a massive rate of flux in each of the markets. The reason I asked you as I am little surprised with these service provider segment for you continues to remain relatively weak. NCS has been off for some time, so I am surprised we are not seeing any traction there, so we would love to get your thoughts in terms of the portfolios there, room for further rationalization\u2026 John Chambers : First, the answer is no. If you are a single product company in today's market, you are going to have a real tough time competing against a number of different competitors, and differentiating yourself. We saw these trends coming and we have articulated for four, five years the importance of architectures where you combine products that combine '13 products that are number one in their field, four products that are number two in terms of market share and two product areas that are number three. You combine these into architectures with services and partners that very quickly bring you to solutions and dramatic differentiation and that is what you are seeing them play very strongly in the U.S. commercial and U.S. enterprise as proof points. The second part of your question in terms of service provider, we basically are again going with an architectural approach. We are literally saying how do you influence the key issues that are most important to the service provider from mobility to video, to cloud, to speed of services delivery, so reducing OpEx and CapEx and say how you approach these with an architectural approach. So I think this will be an industry where architectures will win and I think we are very well positioned versus our key traditional IT players and future challenges. Melissa Selcher : Great. Thanks, Amitabh. Next question, operator. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Subu Subrahmanyan with The Juda Group. Subu Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group : Thank you. My question is on the product transitions you are seeing. Is there anyway to quantify the impact of data center transitions and core routing product transition in this quarter? And John, as you look at the recovery in these, is there a timing expectation? Which one will rebound first between these two? Frank Calderoni : As you look at it, let's go to the data center and let's go to switching. If you watch and you see the Nexus 9000, as an example, our product pipeline is up to 522 customers. That's almost a 2.9% increase quarter-over-quarter. Our win rate is extremely good versus traditional players and new challengers. You will see us over the next four to five quarters go by, some of the early startups in this area and if you look at the transition I think you watch our orders in Q4 and Q1 in this area and we are going to follow a path very similar to what we did in UCS. A similar game plan that this team has done so many times before from a technology perspective. We will put in place our steps in terms of how we identify the top customers, how we get the close rate, how we amp the volume and at the same time tie that to what we do in the Nexus 7000 and below in terms of the data center. In terms of the routing, the routers are a little bit longer sales cycles. As you know when you put these routers that has such tremendous capability and function where you can really transfer the whole Library of Congress in a second or the Netflix library in a second, you basically are talking about tremendously powerful capabilities with the NCS and the CRS-X. That will take a little bit longer. I would watch our franchise wins in Q3 and then you should begin to see orders pickup in Q4 and Q1 on those. A little bit longer sales cycles in terms of implementation. Melissa Selcher : Great. Thanks, Subu. Operator, next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank. Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank : John, hi. Switching to the Nexus 9000 order ramp. Will you see that this quarter? Our checks continue to get more evaluation phase in the products still. Will we start seeing that ramp this quarter? Will that help get switching back in the positive territory heading into July and into fiscal '15? Can you give us an update on campus switching and how that's doing? Thank you. John Chambers : Sure. Again, Rob [ph], I am going to give you the campus switching piece. Let me go to the Nexus piece. Literally, I review almost every other week with the team where we are on this, reminding everyone this team has never missed in terms of our telephony approach, our combination of storage with the network with processors that really made us a major player in the data center and now what you watch on this when you are going to see a steady ramp to grow where we would just pick up momentum in key accounts and we are tracking these key accounts. The volumes are small. We won one, for example today. That is a huge opportunity but it was the first opportunity but it was the first opportunity to get the door in the foot. So we deal with first getting the pilots in and then scale that this is a product that is extremely competitive and every aspect of the commitments they made on the product are on schedule on the quarters that they committed to. So I feel very comfortable with the product ramps on this and as you begin to see the Nexus 7000 and 9000 both available market then you will move through perhaps a little bit of pause where a customer is saying which way I would go and I have a hesitation here. Rob, additional thoughts on campus? Rob Lloyd : Yes, John. In addition to the data center, I think that the entire two big transitions which are from 1Gig to 10Gig and now from 10Gig to 40Gig are playing to the strongest hand we have had in terms of our portfolio. So we have a product for every part of the market right now and you covered some of the data center technologies. We haven't talked about the new 40Gig uplinks our Nexus 5000, an important part of the product and of course the 10Gig and 10Gig links on the campus switch which is a 68000. So right across the board, great portfolio strength and you mentioned it, but we give the pedal to the metal on the 10Gig to 40Gig transition and I think you are going to see some good market share movement in the quarters ahead. John Chambers : Yes, I think the market share gains on that are going to be dramatic. Melissa Selcher : Great. Thanks, Brian. Operator, next question. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer: Thanks, guys. John, I want to focus on two specific segments, the wireless and the data center. Both, for a couple of quarters, have now either completely flattened out or in the wireless case, have declined on a sequential basis. I am trying to understand, I understand I would assume that some exposure there relates to emerging markets and that's probably one of the sources of the weakness, but nevertheless for you those are very hard growth opportunities, especially on the server side and on the wireless. Many of the competitors are still growing at very cliff, so I am trying to understand if there's something going on in those two businesses that's not related to the macro issue you have been discussing. John Chambers : Okay. First on the data center, the answer would be no. If you watch the rate at which our orders come in. As I said in the script, the order rate was in the mid-30s and this is more of the time and the shipments, book to billed across most of our product lines you can do the math quickly as I can, all of them were in good shape in terms of book-to-bill. We clearly built backlog in many of the categories and I would be very surprised if you don't see the numbers up in the 30% range this next quarter with all the appropriate caveats. That momentum feels good. We are very, very well positioned versus competition. On the wireless side of the house, there were areas such as Meraki that was just very, very good for you going with solutions and position it. Some of the other wireless decisions on very large service provider decisions are long sales cycle such as the Small Cell SP WiFi etcetera on it and I think you are going to see as we brought out some additional product functionality that just came out with our wireless LAN capability, Rob, you will see the orders in that category that backup as we look out over the next couple quarters. On the data center, we are going to win that one and I think you see tremendous position of momentum there and we have no fear there. That really feels good. Then in terms of wireless, there are couple of areas that we need to pick momentum back on. Rob, I think we know what we want to do on that. You talk to that group the other day, I think. Rob Lloyd : I talked to them the other day and again this morning, so we have got some actions in place. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer: Sounds good. Melissa Selcher : Thank you, Ittai. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Paul Silverstein - Cowen: I am hoping through this is clarification, but let me give it a shot. Going back to gross margin I just wanted to confirm something. With respect to the pricing environment, I think so and if I go back to the previous quarter you were fairly assertive in your commentary about the healthy pricing especially with the new products that they were coming consistent with your current margin structure to returning to this quarter is it essentially volume issue or we when we look at pricing, when we look at the new platforms has there been any change in terms of the margin profile, those new products in particular and more generally all in terms of the overall product portfolio. I heard you response on a call previously, [issue] but I just want to clarify to what extend is this a volume issue or is there something more? Frank Calderoni : Paul, great question. It allows me to expand a little, bit it's purely a volume issue. If you look at cost, you look at mix, you look at pricing et cetera, those to come together. Volume is what is driving each of the areas. The area that you are being very general with me on as you are saying all right John if you see an unusual things and switching is that going to surprise. Even within the switching segment our gross margins are remarkably stable even with lower volume, so we are not seeing anything unusual in the switching at all. We are very, very competitive and as we mentioned before, Paul, these new products which were just now begin to get out and enhancing the effects on gross margins are all coming in gross margins that are very typical of our high-end gross margin. That a much better job than ever done when high-end products, where usually you bring them out in the low 50s and over literally almost 2 years bring it back up to more traditional margins, so I feel good with that, so it's volume and volume ties to what the cost, what the mix and what you see overall in terms of pricing in the field. Pricing the field is a little bit up versus what we seen before, but with well within the range of what we see, a point plus or minus or half point. Melissa Selcher : Thanks, Paul. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Kulbinder Garcha - Credit Suisse : Thanks. Just a question on the services side, I think Frank mentioned earlier on the call that service should follow a product revenues and I guess what we are seeing product revenues of declining new self-service offset dollars at risk the two quarters out about maybe quite how should we think about the dynamic. Then just one further clarification on gross margin if can. Are you saying there is no real change to the pricing environment? It's all volume-driven. The reason why I ask is, you guys knew that revenues were going to be weak this quarter and your guiding for low gross margins will weaken in front of this quarter. They are going to be relatively weak next quarter, so why aren't the cost issues is coming through more long. Any point on that would be helpful. Thanks. John Chambers : Gary, do you want to take the service. I don't know if you could hear it or not. Gary Moore : I think, I do, John. So, Kulbinder, on the services. The services business is tightly tied to product but we have added a number of services that John mentioned during the call earlier and those are ramping up and the fact that our product decline has been what it's been, those services aren't coming up as fast and offsetting that. But we are very happy with the way we have been able to drive continued growth in the services business as well as continuing to drive the margin that we have had. Kulbinder Garcha - Credit Suisse : In terms of the gross margin comments? Frank Calderoni : As far as the gross margin, just to reiterate, so as far as the guidance that we gave last quarter 61% to 62%. That said, we came in at 61.3%. So we did assume the lower volume when we gave guidance and then also assuming the lower volume for Q3 in the guidance that we just gave for the coming quarter. As far as the volume and the cost impact, so when you take your volume down we have a fixed base within a manufacturing organization, things like logistics center, things like the data center that supports WebEx and things like that. When you have lower volumes, you are spreading that fixed base over those lower volumes and therefore you don't get some of the magnitude of cost-benefit that we have seen in prior quarters. So some of initiatives that we are driving like value engineering will continue to drive those. We don't see the full impact when the volumes are down because it's offset by the fixed cost piece of it. So as I said before, if the volume improve back to, let's say, normal levels then you can definitely start to realize those deficiencies from a cost and then also from a mix standpoint as the volumes improve in switching and routing, that was one that basically had the most cell sales on a quarter-on-quarter basis which tend to have higher margin that's going to overall affect the mix in a positive direction. So we are having those impacts in periods when the volumes are lower and as the volumes improve they should be offset. John Chambers : Very simple, if we were seeing major pricing pressures, we would just tell you. The switching is the prime example where even in the product transition time period, the margins are remarkably stable on that. So we control the pricing, we control the expenses, control the gross margins and we think we are positioned very well versus the changes in competition at this time. Melissa Selcher : Great. Thanks, Kulbinder. Operator, next question. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets. Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets : Thank you. John, I am sorry for the background noise. (inaudible), so I guess the bigger the better in your (inaudible) architectural approach, yet some of your assets are past their peak cycle and having a negative impact o your financial model. So on the other point that Cisco has to choose between customers and margins and Cisco actually proactively looks at the corporate ecology so that we can actually have margin, customers happy and investors happy as well. John Chambers : I think I got part of the question. The question is, do we have to choose between customers and margins. I would say the two actually come very tightly together and this is something that I think we need to both articulate and give you a feel for the examples. When you begin to look at an architectural sale and I was just at that World Wide Tech this last week, WWT, technologies and they this last year did about $2.8 billion as a partner reselling for us growing in the high-20s year-over-year. They align completely with our architectures and they align completely with us as we make the transition into the Internet of Everything. Now bear with me as I walk through this so you understand why I am sharing this with you. They standardized on Cisco and they are rally building their labs, the architectures, instead of interfaces customers with white papers or slides, they basically say here is what you can do to architectures and it is why you have to have all of these 18 different product areas to be able to get the result that you want when you combine it with services to get the outcomes much faster. They already show that in each of their labs with the capability to bring it to life. So you see the growth, you see the realization on it. On the Internet of Everything, they are almost ahead of us there in terms of, they are already talking to areas like in mining where you connect the sensors to all of the equipment in a major mining operation. They just feed, as you can imagine, probably 10,000 sensors feeds per second. It goes into six or seven different databases applications. As you begin to think about the Internet of Everything and as they show that architecturally, you almost can show by doing this how you can make the decisions with people, process, data and things much quicker, get the right information at the right time to the right person or device or machine to make the right decision. So this is why you have to be in these various product areas. This is why when you bring those together your gross margins come up, because you are delivering the results. This is why you don't want to be a single product group like a router or a switch or a wireless capabilities et cetera. You can get caught in a huge squeeze as you move forward and if that combination that provide gross margin capabilities. If you are in service providers and of course we look at the analysis as we go forward. We are very much committed to the video side of market, because video mobile is the number one application area that they really see differentiation and two thirds of the load on mobile devices and just a year will be video, so you have to be in these areas where you can tie up together. Does that make sense? Melissa Selcher : Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ehud Gelblum with Citigroup. Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup: A couple of clarifications and a couple of questions, clarification were that if you can give us, Frank, maybe because you are buying back so much stock, what the ending quarter share count was that would be helpful. Then a comment on linearity if you could. Clarification on the services business I thought, because at your Analyst in December you took 80% of your services as maintenance. I had thought it was more a function of your installed base that on quarter-by-quarter product revenue, so if you can just clarify that. Then another question is about service provider. Service Provider Video, obviously continues to fall is there a bottom just a spot the calculate and kind of look it and you touch for ways when that kind of bottoms out and you should be modeling that and then core routers, you have got a cyclical funk that we are in right now in core routing? John Chambers : You so many questions, I can even write them down quick enough. Let me stop right now quickly and see if we go through it. I am going to take the take the linearity question. The quarter was very linear, no surprise on that at all, and played out much in the range that we do with the first month being a little bit average and 25%, let's say, let's say second a little bit more in third month in the 40% to 45% range depend on which quarter you are in? This quarter was very, very, much in line with what we traditionally see Q2s, I want to say so that nobody understands this. We exit the quarter with the best booking backlog in terms of weeks that that was in 10 years in Q2, so the number of weeks of backlog we had was very solid coming out of the quarter. Frank, I will give you a minute to look up to share count. Frank Calderoni : The diluted share count, the average diluted share count at the end of the quarter was about approximately 5,300. As I said, it came down by approximately $100 million quarter-on-quarter related to the buyback that we did $4 billion of the buyback that we did in this past quarter. I also noted that when you do the buybacks over a period of time, depending on the timing you won't get the full impact of the reduced share count. It takes another quarter, so we will see further reductions this coming quarter and would have other additional buyback and we do in Q3 and Q4 will then reduce it even further. It also has offset any increase to the share count related to options and RSUs and SPV the normal increased, so we have offset that and then reduced through the buyback and our objective as we said over to the period of time is to manage share count down over the next couple of quarters and over the next several years in order to help improve the return to shareholders. John Chambers : Yes. Frank and I always provide a good balance. We are going to be aggressive in the market. You are going to see us well above our 50% free cash flow, buyback and we have continued to be opportunistic there as much as we were in the first six months of this year. Gary, in terms of services, let me break the question in three pieces. First, how much services is actually tied to the product side of the house? Maybe a real quick discussion the technical services versus advanced services and advanced services and that advanced services however going to move more outcome-based. Two minutes. Frank Calderoni : First part of that is, roughly 80% and that the combination of technical support services as well as advanced subscription services those, contractors are normally one to three years and you book them and then you deal that revenue out over on equal basis over whether it's 12 monthly or 36 months, so as the product revenue and bookings have ramped down over the last several quarters, there is no new attach to that on either TS or AS. On the business that is not what subscription the advanced services that are more advanced engineering and capabilities around support services that our project oriented when people aren't building out new networks or were not deploying large deployments then that business also comes down and that has come down fairly significantly as well over the last several quarters. We are ramping up in the areas that John mentioned around smart services, the analytics around that, as well as remote managed services, some large wins there. We are really doubling down on our capability there. And then we have also shifted and brought together, we are building out a very architecturally oriented with technology people as well consulting services and then security and we have already delivered some of that. Those are ramping up and that's why we have this gap here. You will find us being less dependent on product as we go forward and you will see us continue to manage that business extremely well through automation and things that will allow us to drive the margins we do. John Chambers : So two real quick thoughts, because I think unifying services really make a difference in our future. Gary and I have given us the challenge to move 50% of these event services to outcome-based capabilities. That's only about 20% today. Very important in the transition. If you look at the Internet of Everything, surely the consultancy piece over the next several years is a $1 trillion market that we can address. So you begin to look at us looking at this is a major new revenue scenario most of consultancy services but more important point through our own whole product architectures. Once again going back, there is a reason that so many people fail with Internet of Everything they do in cities. They do it one step at a time. It is complex. It has got to be able to scale. It has got to have the architectures all come in together. It has got to be mobile. It has got to be data center. It has got to be analytics at the edge. It has got to be secure. It has got to be collaborative. And you have to have a game plan to bring these customers together and just using cities or countries as an example when you bring them together with these architectures that's why you win. That's why you see a digital Israel where really our business grows in the high-teens year-after-year because of what we have done together there. Melissa Selcher : Okay. Thanks, Ehud. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Tal Liani with BoA Merrill Lynch. Tal Liani - BoA Merrill Lynch : (Inaudible) very much for the questions. I have just one question left which is, I am still trying to understand, in your numbers what related to the loft quarter, what's related to the next quarter? What I mean by that is, the quarter is definitely weak but I don't know if it is incrementally weaker than last quarter and what are the parts that are incrementally better? So maybe you can just go through kind of the major segments, just to tell us where did you see improvement from the previous time that you updated us about three months ago and just overall kind of the delta from the last time? Thanks. John Chambers : Sure. Just repeating some the same things and expanding on them. The quarter played out on this exactly as we expected in terms of the three areas that were challenged. And in those challenging areas from a revenue perspective using high-end routing switches as an example, they were down in double digits, bookings were down in the -minus 5% and minus 6% respectively. The emerging countries were better this quarter than last quarter but way too early to call a trend and I don't want anyone to take away, we are basing our estimate on this next quarter with no improvement in terms of the current economic scenarios or what we are seeing with inconsistencies in emerging countries in terms of the direction. The product orders were down 4% in the direction and as we alluded to earlier, there were several areas that we felt very, very good about in terms of security and the data center progress that we made. The reoccurring revenue, that's about 1% delta that we would have had if we had recognized this in traditional ways. It just increased from the last quarter to this quarter. So I feel very good about where we are now. I think the transitions are working. We are playing about. We gave guidance for this next quarter. Last quarter was 8% to 10%. We said this quarter 6% to 8% and you are going to see us just move this market right along through the transitions and returned to positive growth one quarter at a time. So I feel a lot better where we are now versus where we were a quarter ago. I don't know if you want to add anything to that, Frank. Melissa Selcher : Thanks, Tal. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian White with Cantor Fitzgerald. Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald : Yes. Hi, John. John Chambers : Hi, Brian. Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald : I am curious. We look, sales down 8% this quarter, 6% to 8% in the third quarter. To get growth moving again here, do you feel like Cisco needs a new product category? I mean you obviously are a leader in networking. You have done very well in servers in a short period of time. But to get the revenue growth to more reasonable levels, do you think Cisco needs a new product category? John Chambers : Let me think about that for the second to put my thoughts. Okay. I think, we have got four or five major product categories using your words in play at the present time. We have the explosion and remember, when we entered the data center saying we are going to bring together the network with server technology with storage which has really been a huge part of our growth and positioned us very well in the data center from the CIOs perspective as well and that's playing out extremely well. We talked about application-centric infrastructure. Remember just for four months ago, when everybody really got what we are doing with this and how you are going to have intelligence throughout your entire network and what we are doing with both, applications and the network in the infrastructure and the ability to do north bound and south bound API. I mean, that is a huge product category for us in terms of direction. Then as you pull together the Internet of Everything, and we have been on this for six years. Heavy lifting a year ago, if I had to buy somebody a drink for me to talk very long about the topic. Now, they are offering to buy us dinner and they bring the board of directors here. It's that light switch went off in a very, very positive way with the CES the World Economic Forum and when Google bought Maps, it was a light switch that all of a sudden every consumer, player, manufacturer realized. Now, the size of those markets is $19 trillion. That's a profits potential. That doesn't count all the infrastructure underneath of it $1.5 trillion in retail alone $2.9 trillion in terms of manufacturing, so you could imagine the conversations that we are having with the leaders in that and we don't go in there selling them routers and switches. We sell outcomes and there is probably no better example than outcomes fail than what we did in Israel. The challenge for the top government leaders in Israel 18 months ago focus on job creation, focus on inclusion of minorities, focused on healthcare, education, innovation, the ability to move some of the cities to their south, security and do this in terms of support with all three major political parties from the top down and we did that together and 18 months and we have won every single major bid in total on that. You really began to think about the key takeaway here is the network is at the center of every transition you are seeing. Every one of it and it's going to be an intelligent network and we positioned ourselves very well to both, - again the new competitors coming at us piece meal and the old peers to who piece meal. If you are just a piece meal hardware player with a single product, you are going to really have a tough time as you go forward. I believe architectures win and I think the categories we outlined, if we execute well, we fuel this growth for the next decade. As we think we have plenty in terms of the opportunities in front of us and I want to careful we prioritize in the right way. Melissa Selcher : That's the last question. John Chambers : Mel, you are the boss. Go ahead. Melissa Selcher : All right, so I think that that's going to conclude our call. Cisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our FY'14 third quarter results, will be on Wednesday, May 14, 2014 at 1 :30 PM Pacific, 4:30 PM Eastern. Again I would like to remind you that in light of Reg FD, Cisco plans to retain its longstanding policy to not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it's done through an explicit public disclosure. Please call the investor relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation and continued support. This concludes our call. Operator : Thank you for participating on today's conference call. If you would like to listen to the call in its entirety, you may call 866-513-1228.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to Cisco Systems Third Quarter and Fiscal Year 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. At the request of Cisco Systems, today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I would like to introduce Melissa Selcher, Vice President of Global Corporate Communications. Ma'am, you may begin. Melissa Selcher : Thank you, Kim. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our 97th quarterly conference call. This is Melissa Selcher, and I'm joined by John Chambers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Frank Calderoni, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rob Lloyd, President of Development and Sales; and Gary Moore, President and Chief Operating Officer. I would like to remind you that we have a corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information that will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements' full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheet, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the Investor Relations website. Click on the Financial Reporting section of the website to access these documents. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements and, as such, are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically, the most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise. As we have in the past, we will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer segment results in terms of product orders, unless specifically stated otherwise. I will now turn it over to John for his commentary on the quarter. John Chambers : Melissa, thank you very much. I am pleased with our solid performance in Q3 with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.51 on revenues of $11.5 billion. We saw strength in our non-GAAP gross margins of 62.7% and non-GAAP product gross margins of 61.4%. We also continued our disciplined management of the business with total non-GAAP OpEx down 6% year-over-year. We generated $3.2 billion in operating cash flow and returned approximately $3 billion to our shareholders through the dividend and share buyback. We are very focused on creating value for our shareholders, employees, customers and partners. Our conviction around how we're evolving Cisco is strong and resolute. You've seen us deliver incredible innovation, make bold moves in the market to capture future opportunities and disrupt our competitors and ourselves when necessary. We remain committed to doing the right thing to increase our long-term strategic value to our customers and advance Cisco toward our goal of becoming the #1 IT company. In Q3, revenue earnings per share and gross margins exceeded our guidance. Our product orders improved to be relatively flat year-over-year. Our book-to-bill was comfortably above 1. I am pleased with the progress to return to growth, and I'd like to give you an update on Q4 revenue guidance, which will allow you to frame our remarks on the business momentum. For Q4, we expect revenues to decline in the range of minus 3% to minus 1%, which would represent quarter-over-quarter growth of 4% to 6%, that is Q3 to Q4. We saw strength across a number of areas of our business and as we look across the world. From a geographic perspective, total U.S. product orders grew 7%, with U.S. commercial and U.S. enterprise both up over 10%. The momentum in U.S. enterprise and commercial remains very strong. As an example, in the U.S. enterprise, total deals over $1 million are up over 25% from Q3 start to Q4 start, and deals over $5 million are up more than 50%. As we continue to move to solutions, our enterprise customers are making more and bigger investments as they partner with us. We see continued stabilization across Europe, with order strength in the U.K., up 7%; Germany, up 5%; and Northern Europe as a whole, up 4%. From a product perspective, our new service provider platforms are showing good momentum. As we shared with you in prior calls, it takes time when you introduce disruptive, high-end products before the growth returns. This quarter, we saw high-end router order growth reversing a 3-quarter negative trend. While we are pleased with these results, these numbers will continue to be lumpy. The Nexus 9000 and our Application Centric Infrastructure, while still early, is gaining significant market traction. In just our second quarter of shipping new Application Centric Infrastructure, i.e. ACI-enabled platforms, specifically the Nexus 9000, we grew from 20-plus customers last quarter to 175 customers this quarter, with the pipeline approaching 1,000 customers. We saw major wins, including competitive wins and displacements at large financial institutions, large cloud providers, software-as-a-service and major service providers. Data center revenue grew 29%. UCS continues to cement its place as the leading platform for hybrid cloud environments, Big Data and virtual desktop services gaining market share for the 17th consecutive quarter since it was introduced. Security revenue increased 10% and orders increased 20% as the Sourcefire integration continues to fuel growth and opportunities with customers. There are several businesses that are starting to show improving trends. Collaboration is the first. While collaboration revenues decreased 12% in the quarter, collaboration orders increased 4%, reversing a multi-quarter negative trend. Positive revenue growth of software-as-a-service WebEx business was balanced by declines in Unified Communications and TelePresence. In this quarter, we began unveiling our next generation of collaboration solutions, specifically a new range of innovation, cloud-connected TelePresence products at a very competitive price points. Wireless. Revenues grew 3%, with orders up 12%. We did see some weakness in the service provider customer segment and at the low end of the market, but we saw a good strength in the 802.11ac ramp, with the AP 3700 now the fastest-ramping access point in our history. There are 3 areas of our business, which we have discussed for the last several quarters, where we are managing through challenges, both macro and Cisco-specific. First, emerging markets, from a macroeconomic perspective, continue to be challenging. Orders in our emerging markets declined 7%, with the BRICS plus Mexico down 13%. As we said for several quarters, we expect these challenges to continue. The challenges we saw in Brazil, down 27%; and Russia, down 28%, are consistent with those we are hearing and seeing from our peers and customers, while China declined 8%, Mexico declined 3% and India declined 1%. Our strategy with emerging markets has not changed. Our relationship begins with the engagement with the leadership of the countries, on key priorities for the country and technology development initiatives and drives all the way to local municipalities, their service providers and private businesses. Second, service providers. Service provider orders were down 5%, showing improvement from the minus 12% decline in Q2 and 13% decline in Q1. The weakness in emerging markets also negatively impacts the service provider customer segment. SP Video revenue declined 26%, which had a negative impact on our SP segment numbers as we continue to manage through the transition of that business. SP Video orders declined 11%. We are seeing some signs of stabilization in the SP business, but believe it would take multiple quarters to return to growth. We will continue to make changes we need to, to lead in the service provider market. And third, new product transitions in high-end routing and high-end switching. While we saw a momentum -- actually good momentum in high-end routing orders, as mentioned earlier, it is still early in the transition as revenue lags orders by a quarter or so. We did not see the benefit on this revenue in this quarter. This lag, combined with the challenges on access layer and the mobility business, led to a decrease in next-generation network routing revenue of 10%. On the positive side, the strength of the ASR 9000 continues, with revenue growth of 59%, and it is Cisco's fastest-growing and most successful high-end router since the 7500 introduced over a decade ago. We did see next-generation routing orders relatively flat, and saw orders of the NCS 6000 and the CRS-X grow above our expectations, though again, it is still early in the ramp and of relatively small numbers. Overall switching revenue declined by 6%. We continue to manage through declines in our campus switching portfolio, specifically at the high-end, with the exception of the Catalyst 3850, which is growing very well. We are pleased with our momentum in data center switching, but it's still early in the high-end switching transition. As a result of these transitions, it will be several more quarters before we see growth in overall switching. Switching gross margins remain strong. Stepping back, I am pleased with the momentum we are continuing to drive across our business despite these challenges. We will continue to take it one quarter at a time, as you would expect. While competitors at times may gain share on us in a given quarter or 2, we believe that our strategy of driving architectures to deliver business value will win in the long term. I've met with over 100 CIOs in the last month, and they understand where we're going, our strategy and our differentiation, and are asking us to partner even more closely with them on their business outcomes. Looking forward, we are driving the innovation and making bold moves to lead the major market transitions our customers are facing today. Two transitions that I would like to highlight this quarter are cloud and the Internet of Everything. On cloud, in this quarter, we announced our InterCloud strategy, leveraging our Application Centric Infrastructure, together with our partners to deliver the first global open network of clouds. Customers, providers and channel partners are turning to Cisco to create an open and highly secure hybrid cloud environments. Cisco is unique in our ability to enable a seamless world of mini clouds in which our customers have the choice to enable the right and highly secure cloud for the right workload. We have already announced major global InterCloud partners such as Telstra and with more to come at Cisco Live! next week. Rob, I think, you'll be announcing them at that time and getting pretty exciting. Robert Lloyd : We will, John. John Chambers : As you would expect, we have added some of the best and brightest cloud talent to our team. We are also seeing our partnerships in delivering converged infrastructure, such as VCE and FlexPod, leveraging Application Centric Infrastructure and the InterCloud fabric to provide on-ramps to the InterCloud. As part of our InterCloud strategy, we do -- we'll deliver a portfolio of Cisco cloud applications and services. The Cisco cloud applications, which are already in market, namely WebEx and Meraki, continue to perform very well. WebEx revenue grew 7% with annual recurring revenues up 12%. The total number of available users was up over 26%. Meraki, our cloud networking business, grew over 150% with the customer count growing approximately 30% sequentially. We also see -- I'm sorry, we also continue to cement our position as the #1 cloud infrastructure and the #1 cloud provider, according to Synergy, delivering the innovation and platforms to fuel the world's largest cloud. That was again, the #1 cloud infrastructure and the #1 hybrid cloud provider. On the Internet of Everything, last quarter, I discussed the momentum we are seeing with our customers to translate the Internet of Everything opportunity to actual business requirements. We are making measurable progress connecting the $19 trillion value we have identified in the Internet of Everything to specific business opportunities and pipeline. Again, at Cisco Live! next week, our user conference, probably 20,000 people in person, and we hope 200,000-plus virtually, customers like Royal Dutch Shell and The Weather Channel will join us on stage to share how they are partnering with Cisco to leverage the Internet of Everything to drive innovation and business results in their own organization. Our close engagement with our customers to capitalize on the major market transitions like cloud and Internet of Everything will be a future driver of our services growth. Service revenues grew 3% this quarter with continued strong margins. Gary, nice job by you and Edzard and the team. Gary Moore : Thanks, John. John Chambers : We continue to be optimistic about the future opportunity. As our customers embrace cloud, mobility, social, analytics and the Internet of Everything, they are seeing Cisco as uniquely positioned to help them build and run the highly securable environments they require. We are helping them design secure and optimize cloud solutions, enabling industry-leading security for their mobile workforce and access data from anywhere to speed decision-making among other solutions. During the past quarters, we announced our new Managed Threat Defense service to help customers detect and prevent attacks across their extended networks, fueling our security services business opportunities. We will continue differentiate our approach to services, leveraging both technology and people to deliver business value. We continue to drive our evolution to software and services. And this quarter, we closed a first-of-its-kind multiyear deal to license Cisco's software portfolio to General Motors. This innovating licensing agreement, evolving our software and hardware where needed, will give GM greater speed and flexibility to drive business value. So for example, when GM needs to increase their collaboration solutions across the company, they have access to our full suite of products to do that. Going forward, Cisco and GM will continue to partner to deliver GM's business goals up to, and including, the Internet of Everything. We are evolving very quickly as a company to meet the changing requirements of our customers globally. And I am extremely pleased with the level of innovation and the value we are driving across the company in both technology and business models. We are leaning forward and will continue to make the moves and investments we need to ensure our leadership for the next decade. I'd now like to turn the call over to you, Frank, and do go into a little bit more details on the financials for the quarter and expand on our guidance. Frank Calderoni : Thank you, John. John Chambers : You're very welcome. Frank Calderoni : In Q3 FY '14, we executed well as we managed through the transitions in our business end markets resulting in our financial performance above our expectations. From a top and bottom line perspective, total revenue was $11.5 billion, down 5%; non-GAAP net income was $2.6 billion; and non-GAAP EPS was $0.51. Our GAAP net income was $2.2 billion, and GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis were $0.42. Product revenue declined 8% and services revenue increased 3%, with product book-to-bill comfortably above 1%. Overall, non-GAAP operating margin was 28.1%. In Q3, our total non-GAAP gross margin was 62.7%. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 61.4%, and product gross margin benefited from improved productivity as we had greater leverage with our cost structure, partly driven by higher revenue volume. These benefits were offset by pricing. Non-GAAP service gross margin was 66.8%, consistent with historical levels. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $4 billion or 34.6% as a percentage of revenue compared to 34.8% in Q3 of FY '13. Operating expenses were higher quarter-over-quarter driven by investments in cloud and acquisitions as well as higher variable compensation. Given the expected decline in our full fiscal year revenue, we do expect our variable compensation expense and, thus, total non-GAAP operating expense to be lower than originally forecasted. Our headcount decreased by approximately 230 from last quarter to 73,834. In Q3, other income and expense was $100 million, reflecting realized gains on sales of publicly traded equity and fixed income securities. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments were $50.5 billion, including $4.6 billion available in the United States at the end of the quarter. We generated operating cash flows of $3.2 billion during the quarter. During the quarter, we issued $8 billion of debt for general corporate purposes, including repayment of debt and a returned capital to our shareholders through our share repurchase as well as our dividends. The debt repayment portion covered $3.3 billion of previously outstanding notes. As you'll recall, our capital allocation strategy is to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually through dividends and share repurchases. So far, in fiscal year '14, we have returned approximately 140% of free cash flow to our shareholders comprised of $8 billion of share repurchases and $2.8 billion of dividends. In Q3, we returned $3 billion to shareholders. That included $2 billion through share repurchases and approximately $974 million through our quarterly dividend. Our diluted share count decreased by approximately 150 million shares driven by these repurchases. We remain committed to this strategy. Our balance sheet continued to be an area of strength in Q3, with DSO at 35 days, non-GAAP inventory turns of 11.2 and total deferred revenue growth of 4%. Let me now provide a few comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter. Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements, and that actual results could be above or below our guidance. The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation to GAAP. As John mentioned, we expect total revenue to decline in the range of minus 3% to minus 1% on a year-over-year basis. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 62%. As we have said in the past, forecasting non-GAAP gross margin has always been challenging due to various factors such as the volume, product mix, cost savings as well as pricing. So as a result, non-GAAP gross margins may vary quarter-to-quarter by a point in either direction of our guidance range. Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 is expected to be in the range of 27.5% to 28.5%. And our GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be approximately 21% in the fourth quarter. Our Q4 FY '14 non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to range from $0.51 to $0.53. With our Q3 performance and our current guidance for Q4, our non-GAAP EPS would be at the higher end of the full year FY '14 guidance of $1.95 to $2.05 that we provided earlier this year. We anticipate our GAAP earnings to be lower than our non-GAAP EPS by about $0.11 to $0.14 per share in Q4 FY '14 and $0.56 to $0.59 for the full year. This range includes pretax impact of approximately $60 million in Q4 FY '14 and up to $500 million for the full year as a result of our anticipated restructuring charges related to our workforce reduction plan that we announced in the second quarter. Substantially, all of these charges are expected to be recognized during fiscal 2014. During Q3, we recognized pretax charges to our GAAP financial statements of $26 million related to that announcement and $336 million through Q3. Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for further detail. Other than those quantified items noted previously, there are no other significant differences between our GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructuring and tax or other events, which may or may not be significant. And as a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I'll now hand it back to John for his summary comments. John? John Chambers : Frank, thank you very much, and well done. Reflecting on the quarter, the dynamics in our business and market continue to play out as we said they would. And we did what we said we would do. Our management team is executing well and driving innovation, transformation and discipline across the entire company. We're delivering solutions, not just technology, in a way we haven't in the past, and are transforming our business models toward more recurring product, software and cloud revenues. As we continue to drive the business, we remain focused on shareholder value creation by maintaining the flexibility to make the right long-term strategic decisions for the business, driving efficiencies in our cost structure and returning capital through dividends and share repurchase to our shareholders. In addition to the solid financial results, there are 4 key takeaways for how we are driving Cisco forward that were evident in this quarter. First, we made good progress on our plans to return to growth despite some macro and industry-specific challenges. At the same time, we are innovating and investing while becoming more efficient in taking costs out. As a result, we're delivering and often over-delivering on the expectations while transforming our business. I'm proud of what we've done and excited about what's to come. Second, we are delivering more innovation at a faster pace than any time in our history. I look at the new high-end switching and routing platforms, the recently announced InterCloud strategy, new collaboration portfolio, new pervasive security offerings, new data analytics, self-learning networks, services and all delivery capabilities, IoE and much more. And we're not just innovating in technology. The changes we are making in how we deliver value to our customers, leveraging integrated architectures, software and services to deliver their business outcomes are driving larger opportunities and deal sizes, as well as more recurring revenue. Third, we are disrupting the competition and, when necessary, disrupting ourselves to drive our leadership position. For example, we began work on Application Centric Infrastructure over 3 years ago. When we launched into the market in November, we laid out a roadmap for our customers on how we could deliver on the benefits and promises of SDN. The traction we are seeing with our Application Centric Infrastructure solutions gives me great confidence that we are leading the transition to SDN. We have similar disruption examples today in high-end routing, collaboration, our overall go-to-market and organization structures. Finally, I believe we are positioned to do extremely well on the major market transitions. When I look at our leadership in the Internet of Everything, our differentiated hybrid cloud strategy, InterCloud, our ability to combine SP and enterprise mobile solutions like no one else can, Cisco's unique insight into the network traffic to provide security and analytics solutions is second to none. And our ability to converge the network, compute and storage from the cloud to the data center to the wide area network, all the way to the edge, the network is clearly at the center of each of these transitions. We are creating tremendous value for our customers when we connect the unconnected, and opportunities are clearly exciting. Now Mel, let's move to the most fun part, which is Q&A. Melissa Selcher : Thanks, John. We'll now open the floor to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open the floor to questions. Operator : Our first question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Simona Jankowski : So this is one question with, perhaps, a couple of subparts. But I just wanted to understand, John, your guidance a little bit. So you are guiding for better-than-normal seasonality in the July quarter, and that's despite the continued weakness, both in emerging markets and in service providers. So can you just expand on what is driving that? And to the extent that some of that is driven by the Nexus 9000 ramp, where you highlighted 175 customers, can you just dig into a little bit on how many of them are also licensing ACI? And also does not include any of the top 10 cloud providers? John Chambers : Got you. A few questions, Simona, but you've been very patient with us over the years. So we'll do that -- in the future, we'll hold the questions right about into one. In terms of seasonality, you're right. The guidance seasonality-wise for our Q3, Q4 was 4% to 6% growth. If you look at it, Frank, if I know these numbers right, over the last 3 years, it's about 1.9% or 2%. Over the last 5 years, it's averaged just 3.2%. So it is above that. We're going in with stronger backlog. And by definition, we had a very good third month of the quarter. In terms of the weakness in emerging markets in service provider, you're correct in that we anticipate those continue for several more quarters, and that's going to be heavy lifting as we work our way out. But let me leave no doubt in anyone's mind, we are committed to emerging markets. We're going to position ourselves as we've done before when countries have seen economic downturns and position us for the future. In regards to service provider, we're going to do whatever it takes, Rob, to get back on top there and get that to return to regular growth. In terms of the areas that are growing well, you saw it in almost every product category. And while the revenue numbers, by definition, product revenues are down 8%, if I remember, Mel, right, and product orders were relatively flat, which means plus or minus 1%. It means in almost every product category, bookings grew faster, orders grew faster than the revenues, and we showed that. And so, you see areas like collaboration, which we've been getting a little bit longer in terms of our products before we introduce new products. And Rowan has done an amazing job there. They turned from what's been a 3- or 4-quarter -- 3-quarter, I think, it is, negative quarter-over-quarter to a 4% growth. And growing, on that, you take time to get that growth up to at least high-single-digits by the end of this next fiscal year. You will see new product announcements throughout this year in the collaboration area, making it easier to use. And product announcements, even the Cisco Live! next week where you almost want to think about it like a iMac combination with TelePresence on ease of use, and tremendous price performance so you can bring this to the desktop and it can be literally a phone replacement that also has a capability on a touchscreen to bring it alive. Now where you're leading me on other products such as the high-end switching, the Nexus 9000, I have not missed on a customer call and I probably called, like I said, 100 CIOs in the last quarter on the 9000 and Application Centric Infrastructure behind it. And I'm not that good a salesperson, Rob, none of us are. But it means that the product is really, really solid. And so, you're seeing us take leadership across the enterprise accounts. When you think about going from 20-plus customers to 175, going to 1,000 people in the pipeline, and you see us with the Application Centric Infrastructure with a simulation going on -- Rob, if I remember that number right -- I think it's over 50 customers that are doing that. Robert Lloyd : Correct. That's correct. John Chambers : And again, the receptivity has been extremely strong. Many of you come from financial institutions, so you might have seen some small startup and being we're combined because they've been out there for 5-plus years, we're taking most -- all of those back. Momentum feels very, very good on it. And I think you'll just see us knock them off one after the other. In the commercial marketplace, Allison Gleeson would say the 9000 is on fire. But to your indirect part of your question, Ramona -- I mean, Simona. It will take another -- at least one and probably 2 quarters before you get high-end switching growing well. They put a 9000 in, you do the ACI modeling, et cetera. So it's going to take us a few quarters to extend it out. But your overall premise is right. When we present our architecture strategy and our vision, the CIOs get it, they buy into it, and we are in extremely good shape in enterprise as you would guess from the 6% growth that we showed this quarter and improving. Melissa Selcher : Great. Thanks, Simona. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Ittai Kidron : I'll also take a stab at a 2-part question. First of all, referring to the last page of your press release... John Chambers : I'm happy because give us a compliment. Okay, 2 questions then we got to keep them to 1. Ittai Kidron : I'd give you another one, if I can get 3 questions. But speaking on deferred revenue, Frank, looking at the breakdown of your deferred revenue, you have a very nice increase on a year-over-year basis on the product side. But when we look at the split of that between current and noncurrent, it seems like most of it is concentrated in the noncurrent area. So can you talk about how the change in deferred revenue relates to the change in your business model as far as moving more into cloud, more into as-a-service type of consumption models for your customers? And then for you, John, on the competitive front. From a high-level standpoint, some of the switching vendors have talked about going aggressively after your Cat 6500 install base, which is quite substantial, still out there. How do you feel about your ability to defend that? And also with the -- some of the clearly good progress you've been making of UCS, how do you feel against IBM and HP these days as far as going after the service footprint, both standalone and on a converged basis as well? John Chambers : Got you. Okay. Frank, you get the easy part for revenue and what's occurring there. And I'll probably expand on that and then lead into the other questions. Frank Calderoni : Sure. So Ittai, as you know, so if you look at the overall deferred revenue, close to $12.7 billion in the quarter, up 4%, the key driver of the growth was the product side. Product side about $4 billion, close to $4 billion, up 11%. And within that, on the question that you mentioned, the driver has been growth that we've seen on subscription-type business. And that was up, within that segment, about 36%. And within that segment, it's the WebEx, it's security, it's Meraki, and it's our collaboration enterprise license agreement. So those are the areas that when we talk about even back in December, at the financial analyst conference, and we're talking about some of the cloud offerings, subscription offerings, that's the piece that is showing growth. And that's clearly what's driving the improvement in the deferred revenue on the product side. Good performance there. I'd just also put in perspective as far as the contribution, still small, contribution. But we do expect that continue as we see the investments over the next several quarters in the space. John Chambers : Yes. What's interesting is, Ittai, you know that we are seeing a number of our customers of all types begin to look at not just recurred revenue but kind of a pay as you go or pay as you drink type of approach. We've closed a number of key deals, and these are $100 million-type of deals this quarter alone, that we'll see the results on it over the next 3 to 5 years. But it shows very little impact in terms of this quarter or next quarter. And that's something we just have to manage through. And we'll try to keep you in tune what that means. It obviously means as you understood from the deferred revenue product growth, that it's 1% of our growth now goes into this category faster than before per quarter. And it would not surprise me to see it at just at 2% to 3% by the end of next year. And our key is do that, keep our balance on profits and revenue growth and earnings per share. At the same time, we build something that will give -- introduce more continuity in our revenue streams, which I think all of you want to see. So it's a little bit of a balancing act. It's one that we're up to. But kind of fun for Chuck Robbins, our Head of Sales, as he does this. In terms of the switching, I think your comments are right. The campus switching is where we're seeing some good competition. But our real issue is we have products like that Cat 6000, they're still going great guns and very competitive. But they are decreasing, as you expect year-over-year, by a fair amount. The 3850 in that category is very price competitive, but we're competing with much lower cost products. So trying to get the total on a number up when the price performance might be 2 or 3 or 4 to 1, it's a little bit of a challenge there. To answer the question about, that Simona hit on the 9000, our win rates on the data center switching is really, really good. Our share there is probably close to 70%. We're clearly built backlog just last quarter because a lot of orders came in late in this category area. And I feel very, very, comfortable with our ability to win -- not 9000 a alone, but how we're going to not only embrace SDN and benefit from it, but we're going to lead in SDN. And Rob, maybe depending on if we get some questions later, I'll give you the ball on that. But we're going to embrace it very tightly and bring the benefits of our virtual and physical architecture into one, and then take where the Application Centric Infrastructure straight down from the cloud data center all the way to the WAN to the Edge. So it's a great story to tell. In terms of UCS, candidly, our competition, IBM and HP and Dell, I feel very comfortable with us continuing to beat them pretty well. Our growth of 29%, I think the 3 of them had it together, might have been negative growth in terms of blade servers. Our real competition here is White Label. We saw this coming 3 to 4 years ago. We've going to sell architectures in the White Label approach, as opposed to standalone products. I personally believe standalone products from any company, whether standalone switch or standalone server, will get squeezed pretty hard. And so, our competition there is architecture, in how you bring compute and network and storage together, how you bring that together with Application Centric Infrastructure and bring it down the environment, that you get premium for. And we know how to sell it pretty well. And when I talk with our customers, they -- most of them will say that we're the only company that's really differentiating our server architecture in a way that will pay a premium for. Most of the others, they view it more as a commodity and a bid type of approach. Frank, do you have something to say? Frank Calderoni : I just want to go back to our -- just to clarify the, Ittai, first part of the question on deferred revenue. So I just -- I gave the balances for Q3 '13 that were growing at 11%. Just to clarify, last year, we had close to $4 billion, Q3 '13, going to $4.4 billion in product deferred revenue, that's up 11%. And the overall total last year, $12.7 billion going to 3 -- $13.2 billion, up 4% total. I just want to clarify that. Melissa Selcher : Thanks, Ittai. Operator, next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with Bernstein. Pierre Ferragu : Can you give us some color on how your gross margin evolve sequentially? So you've had a very good improvement in gross margin. I was wondering how much behind that was just operating leverage having better volumes? And if there was any synergies at all between this quarter and last in terms of product mix and, of course, pricing as well? And lastly, if you have some specific like cost actions over the last 3 months that helped so gross margin improved. And then maybe I have just one last question to ask here on the switching weakness. I was just wondering if you could give us some color geographically. Is like -- is there a big overlap between your weakness in emerging markets in switching, or is switching a market that is seeming like a weakness much more broad-based across the globe? John Chambers : Okay. So first on the gross margin question, Frank, keep me kind of balanced on this. If I look at gross margins this quarter, we moved a fair amount of products, Gary, that you'd been -- and the team in engineering. So John Kurd [ph] had been working on in gross margin improvements. For the last quarter, we didn't have as many of those products to work our benefit on. Also, the mix was to our benefit. You saw set-top boxes continue to decline, even though orders slowed -- declined a lot less than we've seen in prior quarters on it. And the UCS was good at 29%, but it was at 29%. So we had a very good mix advantage for us on that. You're seeing pricing issues but, contrary to what people worried about, I'm not seeing these pricing issues because of SDN. We actually are -- our win rate there is really good. And our story, Rob, and really bringing it to home application-wise and production-wise, it's very, very good, and you see that in the data center. We are seeing some pressure on the campus switching area, where there are different price points as you move into the market. A little bit of it was due to volume, but I think also what you saw on this time is almost 1% above our 61% to 62% guidance. You're going to see the swings 1 point above, 1 point below that guidance periodically. And I urge you not to overreact or underreact, to either one of them. We clearly did not give you guidance of 62.7% for this next quarter, nor is it like it will be 61% to 62%. And there'll be quarters when it goes below that 61%. If we see a trend coming, we would tell you. Right now, we're comfortable on that 61% to 62% gross margins, where actually what I worry about most is the mix and a little bit aggressive pricing out of emerging countries and other [ph] market, where if you've got to win some strategic deals, you're going to discount pretty aggressively. That's not a function of architecture SDN, it's purely a tough market in a UCS-type environment or a campus switching type environment. Frank, how close was that on what you would say? Frank Calderoni : Very close. So the 61.3% from last quarter to... John Chambers : That's a good answer, Frank. Sorry. Frank Calderoni : I just want to clarify one point, though. John Chambers : Okay. Frank Calderoni : Just recap. The mix was pretty much, as you said, was to a slight benefit quarter-on-quarter, if that helps. Pricing was fairly consistent. We haven't seen much change from a pricing standpoint. We did get a benefit in the volume because last quarter we did talk about the drop in the volume that we had from Q1 to Q2. So volume improved, so we got that. And as a result of that, we were able to get a substantial amount of the cost benefit. Some of which came from last quarter that was delayed and others that we kind of worked on this quarter. So cost was a big plus for us in the quarter, which enabled us to get to the 62.7%. Melissa Selcher : Great. Thanks, Pierre. Operator, next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Kvaal with Northland. Jeffrey Kvaal : I would like to follow up on the gross margin question, if I could. And that is to say, you have a couple of new products that, theoretically, should be very accretive to the gross margin structure that are in the pipeline, i.e. the new high-end switches and routers. Why wouldn't we see the gross margins be stable, if not even a little bit above where we are today as those products blend into the overall mix? What are some of the offsetting forces there? John Chambers : Got you. So in regards to the new platforms, let's go first to switching. The new products we're introducing is very much in line with our high-end switching margins. They're very good. We're able to protect it very well. We win in terms of the architectures, comfortable with -- they just turned on a major volume. And while 175 customers is exciting up from 20-plus, it isn't 1,000. And we need to move to those bigger numbers, and then to have the big volume rollout as ACI stimulation moves to ACI implementation, not just across our Nexus 9000, but down to our other catalysts products as well in terms of direction. And the routing products again were designed from the beginning with good gross margins as opposed to -- if I had to do over something, we've done throughout our history for almost 20 years, we developed the products and brought them in at 50% gross margins. And an over period of 2 or 3 years brought them up to their normal margins of 70% or whatever you're aiming for. We won't make that mistake again. We're bringing them in at higher gross margins. But again, the volume isn't as much to that. Rob, would you add anything to that? Robert Lloyd : No, John. I think you covered it. Frank Calderoni : Well, I would say our gross margins have been consistent. I mean, last quarter, given the volume, which we talked about. Historically, we've done everything we said we're going to do around gross margins, 61% to 62%, plus or minus, 1% or 2% every quarter. John Chambers : Yes. But we don't one to give anybody the impression, we are not all over this. We clearly are and we don't want to give anybody the impression that we know a mixed issue could put pressure on us here. So we're working on it hard. And that's one of the things we got to execute on and continue to execute well on. Melissa Selcher : Great. Thanks, Jeff. Operator, next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Modoff from Deutsche Bank. Brian Modoff : A question around the AC or the Wi-Fi piece. Just wireless was, I think, up 3% year-on-year. Orders up 12%, if my memory's correct. Can you talk a little bit about what you see coming in next quarter? Do you see -- is this really AC transition that you kind of gone through for the last couple of quarter and you expect to come out of that? And when do you see a way to AC impacting the upgrade cycle and your campus switching business, the 3850 specifically? And then if I could do a follow-on, I'd appreciate that. John Chambers : All right. Since I loss control earlier, Mel, we'll get it back to one next time. Brian, in terms of the wireless, and I'm including all wireless on it. We lost a little bit of momentum due to a combination of factors. I think you're seeing us pick that back up. It's the very low end that we were exposed in for a while. Now with the new products coming out from upside [ph] of various groups, I think we're much more competitive there. You're right that we are going to combine the fixed and the wireless products together on it. I'm not sure how I would have ventured, in fact, turn up on that because they often take longer than we think. And then when they occur, occur faster, especially at the low-end on it. And your second question? Brian Modoff : The second question is really on the -- your license agreement with your software portfolio for GM. I wanted to just try to understand that a little bit more. What do you -- you mentioned collaboration, what are you specifically licensing? How is this going to play out? Just a little more color around what the agreement is and what products it might involve? And how could you see expanding this as your product line becomes more software versus hardware over time? John Chambers : Okay. So let me talk about the concept of GM and just put that to the side because that's specific to a customer in the first one. Think about what we are really beginning to share with our customers is an architecture in each product category we're in that combines the infrastructure with the platform, with the application, with services. And you go across all of these architectures from the Internet of Everything to cloud, to data center, to collaboration, to security, to mobility. And when you combine those together, and we bring a Cisco -- largely Cisco-powered environment to this, your operating costs drop dramatically because the customer doesn't have to do systems integration, and you get outcomes quicker. Now what's exciting about this deal, this is all about software. And you license that software all the way across everything from our IOS to the collaboration, to the security. And as you, therefore, begin to compete against products like White Label, you're able to say, \"All right, you've already got a license of software. You can be very competitive on the architecture.\" This is something that clearly, you and Rob and I and then Chuck Robbins, who heads up sales, want to drive through our whole company and this is what we'd like to see many other customers do. If we do this well, that really gets exciting. And this is a huge move on the transition to software, being more part of our portfolio. And tying those software pieces together, just like we are beginning to tie our hardware and ASICs. Gary, you're very familiar with the GM deal. I know we have to be -- respect their rights on this one. But any other thoughts to add to this? Gary Moore : Well, just a couple quick ones. One, it is everything that you've said. And I do believe we've already seen high interest from our other large enterprise customers, the CIOs you met with, et cetera. But the opportunity here is to put in their catalog all of the software that Cisco has. We've added switching, we've added everything we do to this. So now they have a software catalog that they prepaid. And now all they have to do is make minor decisions relative to what products. And our products give them that end-to-end architecture. Example would be moving stuff that might be individual products in a dealership that would be controlled with a floppy disk to now, a very easy and, for them, cost-effective solutions to IP enable it and control that from a single spot and downloaded it to any dealer they have, as an example. Same thing we do with stadium business division and some of our other solutions. Melissa Selcher : Great. Thanks, Brian. Next question, Operator. Operator : Our next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America. Tal Liani : I have a question on 2 things. Number one is, service revenues are down. If you sum up the last 4 quarters, service revenue growth is down to 2.5%, down from 7% the same 4 quarters a year ago. So similar period, down from 10%, 11% before. I understand that there is a link between product growth and service growth. But on the other hand, you do offer -- and you mentioned it, you do offer more service-based solutions. And with other companies, we have seen longer lag between the decline in products to the decline in services. So is there any fundamental change in services? Is there any discount on services' side or difficulties to charge for services? Can you tell us anything about it beyond just the product growth? John Chambers : I'll take -- Gary, you want to go first? I'll go second. Gary Moore : Okay. So Tal, I think, first off, your numbers are correct as it compares to last year. If you look at where we've been each of the quarters this year, pretty consistent as we look across that. I think the core product bookings over the last 8 quarters have driven us down. What we've done, though, is start -- and we've started this some time ago, to build these other Services that have a slower contribution in '14. We'll have a bigger one in '15 and a bigger one in '16. And so, we're building those out. And those are services that we are selling today, in large part, whether it's cloud enablement and adoption services as we look at InterCloud and helping customers build that hybrid cloud, the service catalog development and how these customers are managing that services catalog, helping them move their workloads to the cloud and from one cloud to another, as well as the Security Managed Threat detection that we announced last quarter. So those are all things that have a revenue ramp that are adding to the services revenue that aren't -- that won't be as dependent on core product bookings. That said, the ability for us to continue to manage 3% growth in the quarter relative to the margins that we continue to drive, look anywhere else, I think you'll see that is a very well-run services organization that contributes greatly to our customers and that they value. John Chambers : So I completely with what Gary said, Tal, especially on the profitability in the customer side that brings us. I think the technical services, what Joe Pinto has done there has been amazing. We split technical from advanced services out, okay? So it grew well. And its profitability is very good. And I think, given the product run rates that we're on, I'd give us an A in that. I think the point you're raising, Tal, is how quickly do we move in advanced services from not just bringing our products together to be able to work well or network audits or things of that type, to outcome-base. And the outcomes the Gary walked through, we're going to move through over this next year very aggressively. And only about 20% of our advanced services, if I remember right, Gary, are outcome-based today. And they're at more midlevel outcome-based as opposed to the transformation that we talked about at the GM or transformation -- hopefully, if we do our job right with diligence in a number of companies and countries. So that's where the growth has to return from, assuming that product numbers do not pick up a much more healthy rate. And I think what you're seeing is kind of -- I hate to always call it a leveling out, but I think you'll see us level out about this level, maybe one more quarter of this and then slowly start coming back up. But Tal, your constructive feedback and criticism is fair. We like where we are, we love the profits, we love the customer satisfaction but we got to make the transition here to services delivering on and those architectures and business outcomes before you're going to see the number grow well that you alluded to. Melissa Selcher : Great. Thanks, Tal. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS. Amitabh Passi : John, I only have one question for you. I wanted to maybe understand your sort of strategic rationale in some of the alternative areas where you're making investments. If I look at the radioactive market, you made an investment in a company, I think, called AltioStar. Your broadband access investments with the ME 4600. You're going after the converged packet optical market with the NCS 4000. When I look at each of these markets, they are large markets but they have very well-established incumbents, all of them with relatively low gross margin. So I guess, just given all the focus on gross margin, just wanted to understand how you're thinking about attacking these markets. How do you continue to sort of extract the premium, just given the fact that they're highly competitive with relatively low gross margin? John Chambers : Okay. So the reason we're not in radios is because the margins are terrible, and actually almost nonexistent unless you bundle it in to total solution. We make investments in new companies and new architectures, and we make investments to see if their strategy plays out and plays out well. And if it doesn't, it's a good investment and, hopefully, you get a reasonable return on it. If it does, then we partner very tightly or acquire off of that. So we've got $2 billion underinvestment directly and probably a fair amount more indirectly through a number of our joint funds we invest in the technology. Let's use AltioStar as an example, a real good team at the top, Ashraf Dahod, he is world-class. He did a star job as you all know, a serial entrepreneur, and he usually does extremely well. And we told him if he ever wanted to come back to Cisco and work and do something exciting together, we're very interested. And he did come back to us and say, \"All right, [indiscernible] and John, I would like to do this. Would you want to invest? Would you like to be a part of it?\" And when we looked at his new architecture and his price points he's designed into, they got really excited. Now we have to see if it's going to work. But I like the team that's in place, and that's what you look at when you invest. I like the fact he's got a marketing transition, not building an old world radio architecture of the past, but one for the future, probably starting in emerging markets then coming in to developed. And we'll see if it works out. If it does, we'll claim victory and we would tell you we're very smart. And If it doesn't, you might not hear us talk about it again on that. But if I were going to bet on a start-up team, we've got a couple of them inside of Cisco we do well with. But Ashraf's been extremely good, and so that's the classic way to invest rather than take a big risk and an unreasonable amount of upfront capital to see if he owns the whole thing and then see if it works. You do investments, keep them as an entrepreneurship running fast, you open doors for them and accounts and go for it. Does that make sense to you, Amitabh, of what we're doing? Melissa Selcher : Okay. Great. Think we might have lost Amitabh. Operator, next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays. Benjamin Reitzes : John, I wanted to ask about the pickup you saw in the U.S. and Europe. Is this it? Are things turning? And in particular, how sustainable would it be? John Chambers : Good question. I think the U.S. is sustainable, especially in commercial and enterprise with all the appropriate caveats, my few years of law school have taught me on that. But I watch the pipeline, I watch the approach, our U.S. enterprise and commercial are usually a very good indicator of GDP slowly increasing, or GDP decreasing. And we saw our turnup in U.S. in enterprise, and commercial back in summer of 2012. And if you bought the [indiscernible] , I think you ought to understand what would happen. So that feels good. And you combine that with the CEOs I've talked to, most of us feel 2.5%, 3% for the next 9 months is very doable number. Not anything to do backflips on, but reasonable progress. Europe is still a little bit fragile, but we did see stability across the North with some growth rates for a change. And Europe in total was finally positive, not counting the emerging markets for us. And even stability in the South looks like it's occurring. Now I know they still got structural issues there, and I know some of the countries are in transformation and have some tough decisions to make. But I think they're, out of this downturn, slowly improving. And when I talked with our customers and the top financial people in New York, which I did just a week ago, most everybody else is beginning to see very similar trends. In fact, it almost [ph] was scary because when you described the world just like I did earlier, including emerging markets and the challenges in Russia and Brazil, we can finish each other's sentences regardless of industry. So I think Europe is coming back. Again, it's going to be slow and heavy lifting there because they haven't addressed some of their structural issues, but more consistency. And even the South is starting to show stability on it in terms of direction. So good about the U.S., good about Europe. Don't feel very good about emerging markets. They're still very challenged, especially the BRICS. Melissa Selcher : Okay. Thanks. Operator, next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets. Mark Sue : The business is stabilizing and looking into your bookings linearity, more predictable. It feels like in a couple of quarters, the revenues may actually stop declining and then actually turn positive. Do you feel -- does it feel that you could hold this $46 billion to $48 billion annual revenue base because it's more predictable? And also how should we think about the annual OpEx? Is the $15 billion to $16 billion the right number, or should we expect some cost cutting? And then just on cash. eBay repatriated some cash. Recognizing your views on taxes, what else can Cisco do since half the market cap of Cisco is in overseas cash? John Chambers : Okay. So our clear goal was to return to growth. It won't be straight up into the right and it may be a little bit bumpy because we're still way dependent, too dependent on our orders coming in and shipping in the next quarter and during the quarter on it. But you are right, looking out over several quarters, we'd expect that. How long it would take us to turn back up to mid-single-digit growth, if that's what we're going? It probably won't be immediate once you get a slight growth quarter and then the next quarter is there. But I think you will see us do that over a gradual time. We are going to continue to watch operating expenses. Gary's is our champion here along with Frank tightly, but we have to put money into InterCloud and we have to put money into sales rep coverage as we make these changes. And as we get really good on security and collaboration, they require a [indiscernible] for a period of time to run with. So we are going to put investments into the area there as we go forward a little bit into next year. But I think your premise on slowly up into the right is right. It will be probably be a little bit bumpy. It won't be just one quarter you'll finally turn the corner and then the next quarter you're there. But we're going to take it a quarter at a time in terms of our guidance. So we want you all not to get ahead of us on this. We are very pleased with this quarter. Next quarter's set up pretty well. But we got some real heavy lifting to do. And I'm sure, a couple of bumps along the way, especially in emerging markets and service provider on the lifting. Frank talk a little bit about where we are in occasion, how we've chosen a different path than some of our counterparts did, and why we chose the path we did. Frank Calderoni : So we can't comment specifically in regards to what eBay did. But I think, Mark, the key thing for us and this goes to the outreach we've had with all investors in the last couple of years is to build a capital allocation strategy that our investors are looking forward to, the combination of investing both in the buyback as well as in the dividend, which we've done in the last couple of years. And our strategy to a minimum have 50% of our free cash flow to use for that purposes. As I mentioned earlier, this year, we've been fairly aggressive with 140% of that free cash flow through the dividend and the buyback. We expect to continue that strategy going forward. We feel that based on the amount of cash that we have in the U.S., the amount of cash that we generate in the United States on an ongoing basis as well as our ability, as we did this past quarter, to leverage the debt market that we have the ability to fund both near-term and long-term the continued support of being aggressive on that capital allocation strategy. John Chambers : Yes. We're pleased, I think, Frank, of what we've done here. And I think we're pleased to a pretty good extent without endangering our rating, et cetera, on it. So we just chose a different path actually, and very comfortable with the path we chose. Thanks, Mark. Melissa Selcher : Great. Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James & Associates. Simon Leopold : A quick one. I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit more about the Ethernet switch business and the transitions. You alluded to the idea that the transitions do take a long time. What I wanted to see if you could talk about is any kind of compare and contrast this transition to the 9000 family versus the prior transition you experienced when you move to the Nexus family. If we could understand a little bit better about how this situation is either similar or different from the past, that might help us. John Chambers : Sure. And then I'm going to put on the back end of that, Simon, I'm going to ask Rob to kind of tie it through where this fits on InterCloud and ACI throughout our whole family of Nexus products. So to answer the question very directly, we moved to the -- remember, the 9000 is a Nexus line, and we are going to take many of the capabilities on the 9000, including ACI and move it down through our other Nexus products. The 7000 was a slow startup, and it took us a long period of time. And candidly, we had tough gross margins on it, where you design it, et cetera, and it took us a while to add the features that we needed. Now I like very much where the 7000 is. You're going to see it have very continuous, very good growth opportunities. With the 9000 and the 7000 together, then I'll kind of judge the total growth there at the high-end switching on in terms of the capability. I think the 9000 will probably ramp quicker once you get a number of lighthouse accounts and they get their 2 and 3 and 4 systems working well on it. Remember, this is the engineering team that did the UCS where people said, \"This is going to have a very slow ramp, and it will take time to achieve that goal.\" And while it took us a little while to get the attention of the market on UCS, the numbers went up very quickly. And I just talked with Allison Gleeson, who heads up our Commercial Group, and what she and Tony are doing on focus on the market. And they're actually on pace for the number of customers in the pipeline that they had for UCS, which is amazing in the commercial market where, clearly, some of the commercial accounts won't be reaching to the 9000. So I think the ramp, once it goes, will probably be quicker. But it will be 7000 and the 9000 together. And Rob, bring this together, maybe a quick snapshot of this next week with where we are in InterCloud and how this move ties the where we're going with our switching architectures. Robert Lloyd : Sure, John. And I think just to continue on the comment you made at the 9000, it's a continuation of the Nexus family, running in standalone mode, using the same operating processes our companies rely -- our customers rely on, as well as in APIC mode where we begin to deploy the controller, that is the fundamental building block of our ACI architecture. When you think of the differences across not only our catalyst switch and our routers and access technology, the vision of ACI is to use a construct of a unique application policy, which no one else is talking about in SDN, and move that policy not only across both physical and virtual networks in the data center, but as well to the wide area into the access. So when we now begin shipping that technology in the next few months, the trials turn to production, you will start to see the idea of an end-to-end application policy evolve. And the really neat thing here is that same policy could run in my private cloud, on a UCS, or even now on a Vblock or a FlexPod, but as well, in a public cloud instance. And we'll be showing examples of how that policy can flow between private, managed and public clouds at Cisco Live! next week. So there's a lot of difference. We really do both physical, virtual, end-to-end across the network in terms of moving policies. We are starting to see that at scale. Earlier we were asked about public clouds deploying, we'll be announcing 2 partners that are deploying ACI in their public cloud environment. One of them is in the Gartner top quadrant, one of them is midsize. I think it's really catching on. And it is really different in terms of deploying the model our customers of which are embracing today, which is hybrid cloud. And I think we've really hit the nail on the head with ACI. Melissa Selcher : Great. Thanks, Rob. Operator, next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Inder Singh with SunTrust. Inder Singh : So a good quarter. And you sound decidedly upbeat, especially after the past couple of quarters. It sounds like the demand side has picked up for you. But also the product upgrades are starting to kick in. And I think you've spent quite a time on the switching side of it. I wanted to ask you about routing as well. Clearly, the company made a big bet with the CRS-X. And I think you alluded that you're seeing above expectations in terms of the demand for that. But can you provide some more color on that? And then just the other part of the question around the security business, same thing. We've seen all these networks come under threat. Clearly, perimeter security hasn't been working on networks. What are you doing differently here where the security business is starting to show growth for you now? John Chambers : Got you. So on that sequence. I'm usually pretty realistic where our competitors are, even though we know how we're going to beat them. At the high-end routing, we're by ourselves. And some people might have a product that might compete with a ASR 9000, say, that's high-end router product, it's really not. So on the CRS-X and NCS, they're both world-class, by themselves, type of capability. The ramp was actually good. But these tend -- they tend to buy a pallet, 10 by 10. And so you will see those numbers bounce a little bit in terms of quarter-to-quarter based on one big deal or 2, and Mel allows me to use the word lumpy now in terms of direction. In terms -- so I really like these products and, candidly, I've not had a customer concern on the ones we've put them in so far, which is unusual with new products. In terms of security, you're right. The market security, you tend to have a hot product company of 1 or 2 product areas. And as long as that product is hot, i.e. malware or firewall or whatever they're doing, intrusion protection, prevention, it tends to be a very good growth. The bad guys, as you alluded to, just go right around that and found weaknesses. And so, we're going to play in terms of security. You will see security go across the whole architecture from our [indiscernible] capability with InterCloud down through individual private clouds, down through the data centers, down through the LAN, down the access point. And this is where we're going to use both our merchant but also our customer ASICs. You will see us place security at each node throughout that environment in a way that nobody else can. And you will see us evolve to something -- we're talking about next week on self-learning networks to where it's very good for load balancing to the Internet of Everything. You have to have that given how unpredictable the Internet of Everything, 50 billion devices are going to be on loads and prioritization of applications. But its ability to hand all, distribute now, service tax and other thinks becomes very exciting. It was a gleam in our eye 15 months ago, we put a team on it and now looks like this is really going to hunt and I want to see a couple of big lighthouses moving from beta to growth. But that begins to change the competitive environment. And I think that's what you're going to see us do in security. You'll see us move on multiple fronts on security, bringing those products together in architecture and then providing what Gary alluded to and what Tom is leading for us in terms of the consultancy groups that really helps you before, during and after and does this virtually and physically together. So we're betting on this big time. I think the markets already figured out, it's got to be an architectural player that wins here. And if you don't have the ability to see what's going on in the network, you're playing with one arm behind your back, no matter how good your products are in terms of direction. Now this is heavy-lifting. And it takes multiple steps to do it, and you got up one step and then you plan it throughout. Then you get up the next steps, so I'm kind of [indiscernible] executing well hear. And I think that's a good question, Mel, to end on. But key takeaway is what you all asked us here at the end is this innovation engine has never been better. And think about it, we talked probably about 10 major product innovation areas today from InterCloud to what we're doing in the high-end routing and switching to self-learning networks, the collaboration portfolio with the refresh on it, how we're moving to software architectures on it, where we are going with security. And it's moving very well. The one area that we didn't spend as much time on was collaboration. And each of our enterprise customers would tell you what the CEO wants is first, operating cost reductions; and second, revenue growth. And that has changed over the last 6 months. The collaboration has been good from us and maybe one other peer. But it doesn't get the productivity at 5%, 7%, Gary, that we need inside Cisco and others. Watch what Rowan and team brings out this next year on products, ease-of-use, capability, creativity. And just notice that [ph] , when Rowan came here and we finally brought our 3 product areas together, with WebEx, which had been separate too long, and with TelePresence and with Jabber. And they took a small team to move very rapidly. It took him 6 months to develop these plans, 12 months to implement. He hit every milestone along the way. Now you're finally starting to see product start to come up, which are really world-class and -- something called Red Dot, which might not mean much to people in this audience, but Red Dot Is like the Oscars in this industry. We've won 6 in our history as a company. We won 6 just last year, all in this collaboration product groups, on product design and direction. So we're getting back to ease-of-use. Think of it like an Apple and TelePresence combined, that ease-of-use, and implementation. And I encourage you to look at it at Cisco Live! this next week. So innovation is going well. We've got a lot of challenges in front of us. We're not underestimating those. But I think this is a very good step, Mel, back to innovation and disrupting ourselves, which I know are painful at times for our shareholders. Melissa Selcher : Great. Thanks, John.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to Cisco Systems' Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. At the request of Cisco Systems, today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I would like to introduce Melissa Selcher, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Melissa Selcher : Thanks, Kim. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our 98th quarterly conference call. This is Melissa Selcher, and I'm joined by John Chambers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Frank Calderoni, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rob Lloyd, President of Development and Sales; and Gary Moore, President and Chief Operating Officer.  I would like to remind you that we have a corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, that will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the Investor Relations website. Click on the Financial Reporting section of the website to access these documents.  Throughout this conference call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements and, as such, are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically, the most recent reports on the Form 10-Q -- 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments, which we identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.  Unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise. As in the past, we will discuss product results in terms of revenue, and geographic and customer segment results in terms of product orders, unless specifically stated otherwise.  I'll now turn it over to John for his commentary on the quarter. John Chambers : Mel, thank you very much. I am pleased with our solid performance in Q4, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.55 on revenues of $12.4 billion, exceeding the guidance we gave you, and representing a record quarter for non-GAAP earnings per share and our second highest quarter in our history in terms of revenue.  We generated over $3.6 billion in operating cash flow and returned approximately $2.5 billion to our shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. FY 2014 was a year with many big wins and several challenges. Our fiscal year began with a number of external headwinds, including the federal government shutdown and the possibility of a U.S. default, combined with significant slowdowns in emerging markets. Even with this backdrop, FY '14 ended with revenues of $47.1 billion, representing the second strongest year in our history, and record non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.06 per share.  We maintained our non-GAAP gross margins, generated strong non-GAAP operating margins and exceeded our capital return target, returning 120% of our free cash flow to shareholders. Our innovation engine dramatically accelerated this year as we brought new architectures to the market with the next generation of networking, security and collaboration. At the same time, the journey we began 3 years ago to transform Cisco continued at a rapid pace.  Let me take a step back for a moment. In 2011, we saw how rapidly the market was changing and understood that would require transformational change in our company. We saw these market changes earlier than our peers and understood the market dynamics were not unique to Cisco. We required a strategic approach, not tactical responses, to the coming transactions. That is the core of what you have seen from Cisco over the past several years. Even in 2011, we saw a much bigger picture. We rolled out our transformational plan with 2 principal objectives : first, drive innovation, speed, agility and efficiencies in our business; and second, to transform the company to move from selling boxes to selling first architectures, then solutions, and now, outcomes.  Operationally, we've done a very good job against those objectives, which is affording us flexibility today in how we go after market opportunities. Our results are evident. We created significant operating leverage. In the past 3 years, revenue has grown nearly $4 billion, while our absolute non-GAAP OpEx expenses were virtually unchanged. That is very good execution, especially when compared with many of our peers.  During the same time period, our U.S. Commercial and U.S. Enterprise business grew orders over 37% and 28%, respectively, over these 3 years. They grew double digits this last year and closed with a very, very strong in Q4, with both segments growing orders over 15%.  These are the segments that have seen the early stages of our transformation,  meaning these segments are most successful selling integrated architectures, solutions and outcomes. Those of you who follow us closely and talk with our channels and our customers hear firsthand that our strategy is not just gaining traction, but most importantly, getting results. The changes we've made over the 3 years have enabled us to bring innovative products and solutions to market, while, at the same time, growing non-GAAP earnings per share to record levels and returning $25.2 billion to shareholders, including $16.7 billion in share repurchases at an average price of $20.58.  Our innovation this period has secured us the leadership position in cloud and hybrid cloud, made us the recognized leader with our customers in SDN and has driven new opportunities with customers embracing the Internet of Everything.  But we're far from finished.  As we head into fiscal year '15 and beyond, we will continue to lead our industry with innovation. The results over the past 3 years represent significant forward progress, and you should expect that we will continue to take actions to transform Cisco in every possible aspect, from how we're organize, to how we develop products, to how customers buy from us. Looking specifically at FY '15, we executed well in Q4 and expect our revenues for Q1, revenues for Q1 of FY '15, to range from flat to up 1%. While we are pleased with our improved performance, I will not extrapolate our improved performance into a more aggressive assumption for what we are likely to do for the next several quarters. Our focus is on executing to our transitions in the manner that appropriately sets us up for the long term. We are assuming that SP weakness continues for the next several quarters and are not expecting any material rebound in emerging market conditions. I think the best way to characterize this next year is that I fully expect that we will execute forward in a stronger position that we're in today. As we see changes in that view, we would tell you how we see it as we always do. Consistent with our disciplined approach to growing resources in an important area while managing costs, when Frank details guidance later in this call, we will announce our plans to do a limited restructuring across several areas of our business. These actions are focused on investing in growth, innovation and talent, while managing costs and driving efficiencies. We expect to reinvent -- reinvest substantially all the cost savings from our restructuring actions in our key growth areas such as data center, software, security, cloud and others. While there are tremendous opportunities for our business and we are moving the resources to capitalize on them, there is also significant risk, as we discussed. This is the technology industry, and change is constant and accelerating. We have navigated this industry successfully for almost 3 decades, while nearly every competitor we faced 10 to 20 years ago has either exited our part of the market, stalled in terms of market share, or has gone out of business. Our vision is clear and our strategy is working. And it has largely played out as we expected. In 2011, I said customers will view the network as the most strategic asset, not just in communications but in IT, and this would enable us to become the #1 IT company. I am confident that we can make this aspiration a reality.  Now let me move on to business momentum and specifically in terms of our geographies and customer segments. As a reminder, geographies are the primary way we run our business. In these areas, I will speak in terms of product orders year-over-year, unless otherwise noted.  We finished the quarter with product orders up 1%, product book-to-bill comfortably above 1 and a product backlog of $5.4 billion. Our business in Americas grew 2%, U.S. grew 5%, with U.S. Commercial and U.S. Enterprise continuing their strong growth, up 17% and 16%,  respectively. I think Rob, those are the highest  numbers I can remember in many years. So just a nice job by Alison and Brian.  We are seeing the continued strength in large deals. As an example, looking at deals in our U.S. Enterprise pipeline, the number of deals over $1 million increased by 22%, and deals in the pipeline over $5 million increased by over 70%. As we continue to engage strategically with our customers on their business opportunities, our Enterprise customers are making more and bigger investments as they partner with us. U.S. Public Sector, Pat Finn's group did a very good job. They grew over 6% in the quarter, with state and local up 3% and U.S. federal up year-over-year, 10%, in terms of orders. U.S. Service Provider declined 9%. Latin America declined 6%, with ongoing pressures in some of the largest emerging countries, including a decline of 13% in our business in Brazil.  EMEA grew 2% as we see continued relatively [ph] stabilization across Europe. In EMEA, Enterprise business grew 8%, and Commercial grew 7%. Leading the way, the U.K. grew 6%. And within the U.K., Commercial was up 18% and Enterprise was up 19%.  Germany, in this most recent quarter, grew 16% and again, within Germany, we saw the same characteristics. Commercial was up 13%, and Enterprise was up 17%.  In the U.K. and Germany, we assumed similar success in these marketplace as we begin to move to selling architectures, then solutions, then business outcomes. This is the transformation we're working on to drive more broadly. Just to give you a sense of an emerging country's impact on EMEA as an example and its growth, excluding Russia, which declined 30%, EMEA would've grown 4% instead of 2%.  Asia Pacific, Japan and China was down 7%, with China down 23% and India up 18%, while the remaining emerging countries in Asia actually declined 34%. Those are countries that do not include China and India. Overall, emerging countries within the 3 geographies declined this quarter by 9%. We saw the impact of economic and geopolitical challenges in China, Brazil, Russia, Argentina, Turkey and Thailand, and a number of emerging markets that many of our other peers are seeing. These declines are reducing our growth by several points from what we've expected and typically seen.  Though the trends were looking better in Q2 and Q3 for emerging markets, the emerging countries lost momentum in Q4. The BRICM continued in double-digit declines, and the next 15 emerging countries went from positive growth in mid-single digits in Q2 and Q3 to a 9% decline in Q4. Unfortunately, as we look out, we don't see emerging markets growth returning for several quarters and believe it possibly could get worse. When we see these markets coming back, we will share that with you, as we always do.  Moving on to our customer segments. As we've been indicating earlier, we saw strength around the globe in our Enterprise business, up over 9%, and similar strength in Commercial, up over 8%. Public sector, on a global basis, was flat. The same challenges continue in several -- in the Service Provider market, which declined 11%. Within the Service Provider market, the largest impacts came from continued decline in SP Video, with orders down 13%, and the ongoing decline in emerging markets, where Service Provider is a higher mix of the business.  Our Service Provider customers are dealing with transitions in their own business and have been aggressively consolidating, with the transaction volumes of these consolidations over the last 12 months about as much as we've seen in the past 4 years combined.  Let me now move on to products. I'll discuss our product momentum in terms of year-over-year revenue, but we'll share order information where it adds important color. [indiscernible] declined 7%. We saw continued strength in the ASR 9000, growing double digits, with strong penetration among the Web 2.0 customers, offset by softness in optical and mobile business.  Our new product platforms, the NCS 6000 and the CRS-X, continued to ramp, with each of our products crossing $100 million in orders for the year, with approximately half of that coming in Q4. In these markets, where a relatively small number of customers do the majority of the volume, we added 9 new customers for our NCS product line and 39 new customers for CRS-X during the last 2 quarters of the fiscal year.  Switching. Overall switching declined 4%. Similar to the last quarter, our campus switching business declined, specifically at the high-end, with a notable exception of the Catalyst 3850 continuing to grow very well at over 80% growth.  In the data center, our momentum with the Nexus 9000 and Application Centric Infrastructure continues to be very strong. Since the end of last quarter, the number of customers have tripled to over 580 customers. Last quarter, it was over 180. We continue to deliver on our Application Centric Infrastructure roadmap. And during the quarter, we began shipping the Application Policy Infrastructure Controller, which we call APIC. This industry-first innovation provides a central place to configure, automate and manage an entire network based upon the needs of applications. In less than 1 month of availability, we have over 60 paying customers using the APIC with very positive feedback.  We continue to see the strong growth of the Nexus 9000 and our Application Centric Infrastructure portfolio, with key wins across all major verticals, including cloud providers, hosting, financial services and technology providers. We believe we are leading this SDN transition, and you will hear the same from many of our customers. As we've discussed, we are continuing to manage the transitions with the Nexus 7000 and 9000, and we are seeing some impact on our numbers. As we said last quarter, we expect the negative impact to continue for a few more quarters.  Data center. Data center continued to be very strong. Growth of over 30% year-over-year demonstrates that customers continue to embrace our architectural approach in this critical space. I am very proud of the success we've driven in the data center market. In 2009, many questioned why Cisco was entering the traditional server market. UCS was far from a traditional server, and while we've displaced many of our traditional competitors, it -- we did it with an innovative, architectural approach to the market.  This quarter, Cisco UCS grew 30%, with more than 36,500 UCS customers. And this quarter, we grew our repeat business by 49%. In a market many thought we would exit, we gained share for the 18th consecutive quarter to gain the #1 position in revenue share for the x86 blade servers in the U.S., with 41% market share, 6  points above our nearest competitor. And currently, we have the #2 position worldwide, which I expect us to close to the #1 if we execute the way I believe we can, Rob.  Our UCS business now has a run rate of over $3 billion, and we continue to lead the converged infrastructure market with FlexPod with NetApp and with Vblock with VCE. The innovation pipeline is very strong, and you should expect to see announcements in the fall that will continue to accelerate our momentum with UCS and add to our competitive advantage. Wireless. Wireless grew 1%, with orders up 8%. While we experienced softness in the Service Provider segment, we saw continued adoption of 802.11ac portfolio in both our Enterprise and cloud managed network business. In this business, Meraki had another amazing quarter, with growth of 116% year-over-year and subscriptions growing approximately 80%, accelerating our software and reoccurring revenue business.  Collaboration declined 4%, as we transitioned our portfolio in this space. We saw declines in TelePresence and Unified Communications as we introduced additional new products, including our cloud family of solutions, DX70 and DX80, which are incredibly cool desktop collaboration endpoints at dramatically lower price points.  Collaboration remains a top priority for our customers wanting to drive employee productivity. We're confident our new portfolio will drive the next phase of productivity that is yet to be delivered by collaboration to this market.  We did see continued strength in conferencing and an increased customer shift towards software-based models, with Enterprise licensing agreements, ELAs, for our collaborative solutions up 42%.  SP Video revenues declined 10%. Video software and solutions grew, driven by deployments by satellite customers and growth in the control-plane business. But this was offset by declining video infrastructure due to lower CPE business and consolidation among our major service providers. We have made key top leadership changes in both of these areas.  Security grew 29%, driven by strength across our product portfolio, with network security up 35% and content security up 12%. Product orders grew faster than revenue as we continued to see solid momentum with our advanced threat solutions, including Advanced Malware Protection Everywhere, Sourcefire and ThreatGRID. Additionally, we also saw improved growth from our core business, including our high-end firewalls and ASA. A key part of our software growth strategy, security ELAs grew by 250% year-over-year.  We are pleased to see revenue from our Sourcefire acquisition accelerate even faster than before they were acquired, which speaks to the power of our combined security architecture in the marketplace today. We have taken security from a low single-digit growing business to business that we expect to grow comfortably in double-digits going forward. Chris Young that one is yours, but I know you'll bring it home for us. A little bit of pressure, Gary, do you think that's okay? Gary Moore : It's perfect. John Chambers : Okay. Services revenue grew 5%, up from 3% last quarter, and it is trending very well. Strong renewals, large multi-year service wins, strong technical services performance and growth in new businesses, such as consulting, cloud and managed services. And security services drove our growth in the quarter. We continue to deliver our strongest margins in this business, well above the industry norms. We are focused on the continued integration of our services and product sales teams to accelerate our ability to drive integrated solutions and business outcomes. We are also investing with more focus on our renewal engines.  While these are multiyear journeys, we see both efforts as creating more opportunities over the long term. There is strong interest in our InterCloud approach, which we've asked Rob Lloyd to lead for the entire company. Customers and partners view our approach to the cloud as differentiated and unique, recognizing that we offer the only solution to federated, private, hybrid and public clouds that enable them to move their cloud workloads across heterogeneous private and public clouds, with the necessary policy, security and management.  Over the last quarter, we expanded our InterCloud ecosystem with partners who are embracing the Cisco ACI vision and Cisco's open approach to differentiating their cloud offers through the value of the network.  We announced that NTT Dimension Data and SunGard Availability Services will both use Cisco InterCloud architectures to deliver cloud services to customers and resellers.  You will see us announce additional partnerships soon.  In the quarter, we entered into a 3-year go-to-market program with Microsoft to build InterCloud-ready, integrated infrastructure solutions, leveraging Cisco's UCS, Nexus Switching and the Microsoft cloud operating system. We are also growing a developer network to build applications on top of InterCloud, and that work is gaining momentum.  We believe we can grow DevNet developer community to at least 1 million developers by 2020.  We feel that our focus on delivering enterprise-class, hybrid cloud solutions, along with growing InterCloud ecosystem, is resonating with customers and our partners around the world.  Cloud is an example of an area where we're making significant investments to fuel our future growth.  In FY '14, we allocated over 2,000 employees to our InterCloud organization, including several of our top leaders. These investments will drive our leadership and opportunity to the results -- though the results would not show up in our numbers in a meaningful way for a number of quarters. I'd now like to turn the call over to you, Frank, for additional financial details. Frank Calderoni : Thank you, John. John Chambers : You're welcome. Frank Calderoni : I'll start with Q4 results and later discuss our full fiscal year results. In Q4, we continued to manage through the transitions in our business and markets, resulting in our financial performance at or above our expectations.  From a top and bottom line perspective, total revenue was $12.4 billion, flat on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP net income was $2.8 billion, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.55 per share. Our GAAP net income was $2.2 billion, and GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.43 a share.  Product revenue declined 2%, and service revenue increased 5%, with product book-to-bill comfortably above 1. We ended the year with product backlog of approximately $5.4 billion as compared to approximately $4.9 billion at the end of fiscal 2013.  Overall, non-GAAP operating margin was 28%.  In Q4, our total non-GAAP gross margin was 61.8%. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 60.3%. As compared to Q3, product gross margin was negatively impacted by pricing and product mix, partially offset by productivity. Non-GAAP service gross margin was 66.8%, consistent with historical levels.  Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.2 billion, or 33.8% as a percentage of revenue compared to 33.9% in Q4 of fiscal year '13.  Operating expenses were up 5% quarter-over-quarter, due to seasonality, and down 1% year-over-year. We ended the year with our headcount at 74,042, an increase of approximately 200 from Q3. For the full year, headcount decreased by approximately 1,000 from a year ago, which is net of an addition of headcount from acquisitions during the year of approximately 1,300. As we outlined in our headcount actions last year, we realigned and reinvested in talent to drive key priorities such as cloud. We continued to execute consistently with our portfolio approach to acquisitions aligned to driving long-term returns. We announced and completed 3 acquisitions during the quarter, Tail-f, ThreatGRID and Assemblage, to bolster our innovation and long-term growth opportunity in key growth areas such as software and security.  Looking at our geographic segment results. In terms of total revenue on a year-over-year basis, the performance was relatively balanced across segments, with the Americas and EMEA both down 1%, while APJC was up 1%. Total gross margin for the Americas was 62.3%, EMEAR was 63.5%, while APJC was 57.1%.  Moving on to our full year performance. Our total revenue was $47.1 billion, a decrease of 3% from the prior year, as we worked through the challenges in the emerging markets and Service Provider, as well as several product transitions. We were disciplined with our cost structure during the year as we addressed those areas.  We held our non-GAAP net income flat at $10.9 billion and grew our non-GAAP earnings per share, on a fully diluted basis, 2% to $2.06, delivering profitability which was slightly above our expectations for the full year. GAAP net income was $7.9 billion, or $1.49 per share on a fully diluted basis. We generated strong operating cash flow of $12.3 billion, free cash flows of $11.1 billion and returned a record $13.3 billion to shareholders through both the buyback as well as the dividends. This represented 120% of our free cash flow.  We are firmly committed to continuing our capital allocation strategy, returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders annually.  Looking back on this past fiscal year. We effectively managed our portfolio and investments, which enabled us to invest in our key long-term growth areas such as cloud, data center, software and security.  From a balance sheet and cash flow perspective, total cash, cash equivalents and investments were $52.1 billion, including $4.7 billion available in the U.S. at the end of the quarter. We generated operating cash flows of $3.6 billion during the quarter, and in Q4, we returned $2.5 billion to shareholders that included $1.5 billion through share repurchases and approximately $974 million through our quarterly dividend.  Our balance sheet continued to be an area of strength, with DSO at 38 days and non-GAAP inventory turns at 12.1. Deferred revenue was $14.1 billion, up 5% year-over-year. Product deferred revenue grew 12%, driven by subscriptions-based offerings and deal-related deferrals, while services deferred revenue grew 3%.  We continue to make progress in driving a greater software mix and higher recurring revenues.  Let me now provide a few comments on our outlook for the first quarter. Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements, and actual results could be above or below our guidance.  The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis, with also a reconciliation to GAAP.  As John mentioned earlier, we expect total revenue to be in the range of flat to up 1% on a year-over-year basis.  For the first quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 62%. As we have said in the past, forecasting non-GAAP gross margin has always been challenging due to various factors such as volume, product mix, cost savings, as well as pricing. As a result, non-GAAP gross margin may vary quarter-to-quarter by a point in either direction of our guidance range.  Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 is expected to be in the range of 27.5% to 28.5%.  Our non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be approximately 22% in the first quarter. This is up 1 point from the prior fiscal year, largely driven by the expiration of the R&D tax credit. This represents approximately $0.01 of impact to EPS. If the R&D tax credit is reinstated, we would reflect that benefit in our effective tax rate.  Our Q1 FY '15 non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to range from $0.51 to $0.53 per share.  As John also discussed earlier, we will be taking a restructuring action in FY '15 that will be focused on continuing to invest in growth, innovation and talent while managing costs and driving efficiencies. These actions will impact up to 6,000 employees, representing approximately 8% of our global workforce. We expect to take these actions starting in Q1 FY '15, and currently estimate that we will recognize pretax charges to our GAAP financial results of up to $700 million. We expect that approximately $250 million to $350 million of these charges will be recognized during the first quarter of FY '15, with the remaining amount recognized during the rest of the fiscal year.  We expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from the restructuring actions in our key growth areas.  We anticipate our GAAP earnings to be lower than our non-GAAP EPS by $0.14 to $0.18 per share in Q1 FY '15. Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for further details.  Other than those quantified items noted previously, there are no other specific differences between our GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructuring and tax or other events, which may or may not be significant.  We are executing well in a rapidly transforming market. As we have mentioned, we are not expecting a significant improvement in the emerging markets or the service provider segment in the near future.  With all of these types of uncertainties in mind, we will continue to provide our guidance with all the appropriate caveats one quarter at a time. We encourage our shareholders to have their same -- these same considerations. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.  John, I'll now turn it back over to you for some summary comments. John Chambers : Thank you, Frank. The dynamics in our business and market continue to play out as we said they would. Our management team's executing well, driving innovation and discipline across the entire company to disrupt our industry and ourselves when necessary. I am pleased with our leadership position and the strong receptivity we are getting from customers as we become the company that delivers architecture, solutions and finally, business outcomes.  We have transformed Cisco over the past 3 years and remained as focused as ever on the future, moving to become the #1 IT company our customers turn to, to enable their innovation, drive their growth, cut their costs and mitigate their risk. What does that mean for our investors? First, we remain focused on shareholder value creation by maintaining the flexibility to make the right long-term strategic decisions for the business, driving efficiencies in our cost structure and returning capital through dividends and share repurchase to our shareholders. Second, investors need to remember that change is nothing new for Cisco. We embrace it, we see opportunities for disruption all around us. And in nearly every case, Cisco is positioned extremely well.  In this environment, companies who use technology for speed and innovation will differentiate themselves. You see it in places never imagined, and it happens quickly, things like a new business model, delivering through a network application that disrupts the taxi industry.  Every company is becoming a technology company, and the common element is the network at the center, driven by applications, allowing for rapid introduction of new business models, disrupting old models in record time. We've talked about this opportunity for a while, and now you are seeing it play out. Every company is increasingly dependent on the network, not just for communications but for how they run, analyze and grow their business and disrupt their competitors.  In this paradigm, the reliability, scale, speed and application-centricity of a network is even more important, and this is where our unique strength lies. As the leader trusted by business and governments with 17,000 salespeople, approximately 70,000 partners and installed base of approximately $200 billion, Cisco is very well positioned to capture this opportunity, and I'm more confident than ever that we're doing just that.  As always, we have to deliver the innovation, the new business models and value to our customers to win in the market, and that requires continually reshaping how we operate. If we do not disrupt ourselves, if we don't have the courage to change, if we don't lead the change, we will get left behind. Disruption is happening amongst our peers and throughout our customer base. Management teams are being tested everyday. The question is whether they will make the right investments and take the bold action in order to move forward.  At Cisco, we are making these tough choices, transforming our company at a rapid pace, whether it is introducing revolutionary new platforms in our core and at a speed where we knowingly disrupt ourselves, or making long-term bets like we did with UCS and Internet of Everything and are now doing with InterCloud and ACI, Application Centric Infrastructure. We are investing in our leadership for years to come. We understand that the results of our strategy and many of the decisions we make may not be evident in a single quarter. And in fact, at times, will create volatility to our results from time to time. We also know that some of the investments we are making today will take several years to pay off. Taking a multiyear view, I am confident that when we look back in time, this transformative period will be a distinguished part of Cisco's history, where we made bold choices, moved aggressively and ensured our long-term strategic value for our customers, shareholders, partners and employees.  Mel, let me now turn it over to you for question-and-answer. Melissa Selcher : Okay. Thanks, John. We'll now open the floor to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open the floor to questions. Operator : And our first question comes from Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank. Brian Modoff : Let's talk a little more about switching. It's 30% of your revenues. You're talking about this transition to the 9000, and then you've also got the 3850. And from what we understand, you're bringing forward the 802.11ac Wave 2 APs later this year that because of the change in voltage requirements and higher data rates may create an uptick or a desire to upgrade switches on the campus side in the back half of the year. Can you talk about how you see the switching market is going to be doing in fiscal '15? Can we see a transition? Do you see growth in the market? Do you see a better '15 in that area than perhaps '14? John Chambers : The answer is absolutely yes. If you watch, we disrupted ourselves at the high-end segment of the switching market. The way I look at it, and what we said last quarter, that will take several quarters more to work out. And in today's market, the 7000 was down in the mid to high teens. And the 9000, obviously, was growing very, very well overall. So I kind of consider those 2 products together in our entire Nexus line. You'll begin to see a switchover in Q2 and Q3 in terms of this transition. And with all the appropriate caveats, I feel good about growth late Q3 and Q4 with good market leadership. So I do see our high-end switching and switching as a whole growing. We are positioned extremely well. And if I can, just a note on our competitors. Our competitors are coming at us with box solutions, and we're going to approach them with an architectural play that includes software and hardware, and that wins. We've been in 580 accounts, as I said earlier. And we've also taken back a number of one of the startups key flagship accounts again and again[ph]  In multiple areas. So I think we're positioned well, and yes, it is a growth market. And the transition is more 10 gig to 40 gig that I think will help drive these volumes as well. Operator : Your next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Simona Jankowski : I wanted to put your guidance in context a little bit. So you're guiding for 0 to 1%. First of all, that's a bit narrower than it has been in the past 2 quarters. So I just wanted to understand if there's better visibility or what's driving that. And then secondly, it's a lot lower than your product deferred has actually grown. I think you indicated something like 12% as a result of the transition to software. So can you just expand on that a little bit? It seems like that's something that's taking place at a relatively rapid pace. John Chambers : Okay. The visibility is improved in most of the areas, the 2 wildcards we talked about. As you come off of a very solid book-to-bill in Q4, which is normal, and we did it high end of normal book-to-bill, and as you said, we exited with $5.4 billion in backlog. I think last year was $4.9 billion. So the visibility for Q1 is pretty solid, and I like how we're positioned on that. We want to also realize we still have some headwinds we've got to get through. So I think we're just being our normal, conservative self, Simona. I'm not signaling any unusual lack of confidence on it. I like our hand a lot. And we actually did something, some of you suggested, we put our negatives at the front end of the call and the positives afterwards so we don't get you excited in the front end and then say here are a couple of challenges. But I think we're positioned extremely strong. Our switching play, as I said to Brian, is very solid. We've transitioned the high-end routing well. The outcomes are selling. If you look purely at Commercial and Enterprise, these are the best numbers we've seen worldwide in a very long time, even when the economies are struggling. So I think we're doing very well in a tough market, and I feel very good about our future here and very good about Q1 and the tight range that we did give you. Melissa Selcher : Do you want to touch on the deferred? John Chambers : I do -- oh, the deferred revenue, do you want to comment on it, Frank? Frank Calderoni : No, just pretty much what I said in the script. I mean, the deferred revenue is up 12%, primarily, that's product deferred revenue, mostly driven by-product subscriptions so it kind of shows that the WebEx, products like the Meraki, as well as the collaboration enterprise license agreements are really kind of showing some traction and they provide us with a stream of revenue going forward. The recurring revenue increased as well as far as going to the year. So all good signs from that perspective. But again, we had to put it in the context of, John, what you just said as far as some of the other factors that we are considering. John Chambers : Yes. If you watch, we are making that transition, and Gary, you've seen it from the General Motors of the world, to others who are starting to accelerate with enterprise license agreements. And just using security as an example. The security orders were dramatically higher than the revenues. And so you begin to see both that's filling up our recurring revenues, as well as the deferred revenues that go with them. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets. Mark Sue : I just wanted to have a larger discussion, John, on just kind of your stock price and the stock multiple. And when we talk to investors, the worry is that despite the consistent free cash flow, we might see a drop-off in the future cash flow, and that you will not be able to grow your dividend. Is there a way we can convince investors that Cisco can consistently generate $12 billion to $13 billion of free cash flow each and every year and continue to grow their dividend? And subsequently, should M&A be more about cash flow contributions so investors can worry less about that? And can you also maybe, Frank, if you want to chime in, explain why the weaknesses in emerging markets and Service Provider orders does not really impact annual free cash flows? John Chambers : Okay. So do you want to give me one or two questions? Let me address the cash flow question a little bit, and then a comment on tax policy. And Frank, keep me honest on this one. I feel very good about our cash flow. We are committed to the dividend and the share repurchase. We see no indication of ever changing our direction to have a minimum of 50% free cash flow returned to our shareholders. And as Frank said, it was 120% this last year. We obviously were pleased with the share repurchase. When we started down the dividend path, we knew that there would be periodic raises expected. And we have full intention of, at the right times, raising the dividends as we move forward. So not changing that at all. Frank, any additional comments? Frank Calderoni : No. Again, we've been down this path the last couple of years, thanks to a lot of feedback from the investors that supported both the dividend and the buyback. Clearly, we've had a very active year in both. We continue to support the dividend over the longer period of time. And I think, as you said, John, we're generating the cash, we're very pleased about the ability to generate that cash. Our cash flow has been fairly consistent even throughout this past year. And the assumption going into the next year is about the same. Operator : Our next question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS Securities. Amitabh Passi : John, I understand and realize that workforce restructuring decisions are always tough decisions to make. I just wanted to better understand the context of why now. And if you can give us any -- shed any light in terms of the areas where you might be deemphasizing. And should we think of the 6,000 employees as a net reduction or it's simply a reallocation of resources into some of the other areas? John Chambers : In reverse order. Reallocation of resources is the way you should address it. It is an investment in our growth areas that we felt strongly we needed to do quickly. In terms of why now, it's the uncertainties in the market, you're seeing a few headwinds and a lot of tailwinds. The pace of change is accelerating, and we felt we had to move with tremendous speed on it. We are going to put these investments into our growth areas such as cloud, such as software, such as security. And these are often skill sets that you have in one element of engineering that have to move to another. Pankaj has been planning that, Rob, I think, for almost 10 or 11 months, in terms of how to do this smoothly, focused more on the customers. And then you have the same issue in your market. Some of our markets are slowing down and unfortunately, you can't move sales reps from one country to another with different language characteristics. And Gary, in services, it's hard to move a person that's really good about installing networks to business outcomes on the manufacturing shop floor or with deep security experience. So the why now is if we're going to become the #1 IT player, which we are going to do, our ability to move requires decisiveness and requires investing in this growth and it really keeps this innovation engine. And while this last year was our best innovation engine ever, new high-end routing, new high-end switching, new security moves, new collaboration moves, aggressive moves on wireless, Internet of Everything took shape, architectures moved into solutions, we think we have to move even more rapidly and get these groups coordinated. So we focus the whole company horizontally on getting business outcomes. And so you're right, it is the most difficult decision we make as an operating committee, but it's one, the market waits for no one, and we're going to lead this market. We're going to be decisive in it. Operator : And our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : I just wanted to touch base quickly on the emerging markets. You suggested that they had slowed down in the most recent months, et cetera, and you weren't willing to talk about when you might see a recovery. Can you talk a little bit about what you think contributed to that slowdown? And clarify, when you talk about not wanting to talk about a recovery,  are you talking about when you -- like you don't want to speculate as to when they'll stop declining? Or should we expect a baseline but you don't want to expect -- talk about when they would expect to return to growth? John Chambers : Sure. If I could predict when the emerging markets are going up or down, I would love to do that for us all. We tend to be a very early indicator. And just kind of taking a step back to 1 year ago or 15 months ago, we saw the emerging markets, the BRICS slowed down first, and then one quarter later, the rest of the emerging markets slowed down. They felt like they were turning around in Q2 and Q3 and our numbers instead of being in double-digit decline were in the mid-single digits. We saw this last quarter, the BRICS plus Mexico stay at about 12%, but it was the next 15 countries that, in total, balanced out. Now these  can turn up or down rapidly. And so what we did today was to share with you that they had declined more than we anticipated, and that we weren't sure when you'd see a turnaround in Russia and the Ukraine and Middle East opportunities and challenges, and in China. Thailand, obviously, a key issue we're all familiar with, and an election in Indonesia. There are some bright spots for the first time in a while. I think Modi in India is going to turn around that country. You can see the enthusiasm of both the citizens and the businesses there. If I were betting on a single emerging market, I'd bet on India right now in a big way. And if you watch, we've navigated through challenges, regardless of whether they're in China or Russia, pretty smoothly. And so you'll see us continue to stay focused on emerging markets, but we just wanted to level set you that we saw this problem at the present time and we're not sure if they're going to continue to decline or not. But again, they can turn very rapidly positively. So we just want to give you the exposure on that. Operator : Our next question comes from Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities. Jess Lubert : I was hoping you could provide some additional details on the U.S. federal vertical. Orders picked up there, so I was hoping to understand if you're seeing signs of a fiscal year end flush, how you're thinking about the federal market moving forward? And then if you could also touch on the wireless business, how fast the noncarrier segment is growing? What the impact of Meraki is on overall growth? And perhaps comment on the competitive environment,  as it seems like some of your competitors are growing a little faster there. John Chambers : Okay. So I think our federal team and the state and local team have done very, very well. Pat Finn has done an amazing job there. And Pat, if you're listening, congratulations. I do not think it was a one-quarter phenomenon. Too early to call, and Mel will probably kick me if I get into too much detail. But I feel good about how we are positioned, both in federal and state and local as we go into this next year. And I feel very good about, obviously, U.S. Enterprise and Commercial. They don't normally be in the 8% to 12% range. I think it's last quarter, they just did an amazing job on big deals and they had a lot of financial incentives working for them at the end of the year. But I feel good about the U.S. economy. We got to do better in Service Provider and that's why you saw us change everything, change our engineering organization, change our global go to sales marketplace to a point of our stars, Rob, out of you and Chuck's sales team. And Nick Adamo, he's leading that globally. You'll see Pankaj literally within the engineering team. Had Kelly Ahuja lead Service Provider across the whole team. So we're now organized around our customers as opposed to selling them routers and switches and wireless and direction on it. So I think you will see us move well on Commercial and Enterprise globally as long as the economies continue to do okay. I think we need to do better in Service Provider, as I've said. That's a couple of quarter phenomena if we execute right, and then it's what is the Service Provider spend. So we have a little bit of headwinds there. But if you were to say how do I feel going into Q3, Q4 of next  year, I think if we execute well, you'll see us in better shape on the Service Provider, and then it's more a matter of the CapEx spend as you go forward. And you had one other question, Jess, which I'm excited to answer if I can remember what it is. Melissa Selcher : Meraki growth. John Chambers : Oh, Meraki growth has been outstanding. I think there is an example of taking a architecture and a play, combining it with collaboration and just literally expanding it in security and expanding across our whole base and blowing it through our channels. I don't know, Rob, if you'd add anything else to that. I haven't done the math on the question he asked within that, come to think of it. But I'll see if by next call, we can think about how to answer that. Operator : Your next question comes from Subu Subrahmanyan with Juda Group. Natarajan Subrahmanyan : My question's on gross margin. Can you talk about some of the points you made on some of the price pressures and mix? How those are impacting, especially as core products including switching and routing started to rebound? Should we expect an improvement from a gross margin perspective? John Chambers : I'm looking to see whether Frank wants to do it or I want to do it. We're seeing no abnormal gross margin pressures. We compete aggressively in the market, but we hold our gross margins pretty well. It's normally more of a mix issue. In terms of the switching, I like our switching gross margins. And I think contrary to some of the comments that are being made out in the market, you're going to see our new switching product gross margins be extremely good, and that's the advantage of selling architectures that lower your customers' operating expense and gives them solutions as opposed to selling boxes, which I think the time has come box competitors are going to face white label guys with a tremendous pressure. Something we've called out 3.5 years ago and moved to overall. You still have the mix going on. I love how fast our UCS is growing. When you're a $3 billion market growing at 30%, or 30% plus, I think bookings were even a little bit above that, you will see pressure from that side. But to your point, as we move into software and as we move into high-end switching coming back growth-wise, that kind of balances it. So no, I would not model an increase, There'll be pressure on gross margins. Gary, you and Frank are owning that across the company for us. Just Gary, you might spend a moment because I know it's important to the audience, talking about how we're going after this in every aspect of our business even more aggressively than last year? Gary Moore : Yes. I think this last year, we had tremendous performance out of the teams. And I think, we've focused the entire company on gross margins. It's not just the engineering team or supply chain. It's the entire company. A lot of the work, some of the systems we put in place to help the sales force have better visibility, better control on a deal-by-deal basis to see what discounting we're doing, as well as the pricing in the market, understanding our competitors better in that landscape, while continuing to do the value design, value engineering work and the continued investments that Frank and I had funded off the top [ph], if you will, to allow that work to continue. So we're very comfortable with what has happened and our ability to manage this going forward. We've asked the teams to step up even more significantly as we go into next year, and we're going to give them a lot of help to do that. John Chambers : Now Mel is probably going to lecture me after I make this next comment. For those of you who are out there who think SDN is going to drive down our gross margins, in my opinion, you're just wrong. You're going to see us embrace SDN. You're going to see us implement it for the value that it has. We not only will lead with it's implementation, it will allow us to get higher gross margins on our switching and architecture. And we'll do it off of an open standard and end results. And different than our peers, when we talk about 60 paying customers, we mean 60 paying customers, not taking an enterprise license and spreading it thin across the group. So we're going to take it to our competitors big and small. It doesn't matter if you're a major server player, we're going to gain share on you. It doesn't matter if you're a new startup. And one of the nice things about Cisco is our barriers to entry are very low, they're very open. So we love taking on the competitors, big or small. And I feel very, very good about how we're positioned there. And Rob, unless you're seeing something different than I am, I see SDN actually being something we'll embrace and get the benefits out of. And I feel almost no gross margin negative implications from it. Robert Lloyd : John, we clearly are the only company out there talking about connecting applications to the infrastructure, and we're the only company talking about the applications, not only in the context of the data center network, but the entire network, including at the wide area and at the access layer. So we've got more work to do. We're seeing customers everyday. Our partners are embracing this. Cloud providers are embracing this. So when we talk about one of our competitors being a great underlay to another company's overlay, it kind of feels like being the foam pad between the hardwood floors and the carpet. And we are not going to leave that alone. We're going to continue to drive the integration we have and we're going to compete very hard. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays. Benjamin Reitzes : A lot of good questions asked about margins and emerging markets. So I want to ask about carriers. There's a lot of debate about what the spending patterns are and what consolidation is doing to the marketplace. And what are you seeing? And what's embedded in your guidance for Carrier? I know you said you're assuming Service Provider doesn't get better. But what do you think's going on? And how does it get better? And what's your thinking as we you go throughout the year? John Chambers : Sure. Service Provider, just to give you a context, if you look in today's market, Service Provider, Enterprise and Commercial are all about 25% to 27% of our business. And so it gives you an idea of kind of the things that drive it, and public sector's down about 20%. In terms of where we see Service Provider overall, there are some headwinds there. And so let me talk first about what we're doing differently. We have focused our company on becoming entirely solutions and outcome-based selling, including our consultancy. We're moving to where we used to sell to the service providers. We'd go say, \"What's your business objectives?\" And then we sell them a router or a switch. We're now saying, \"How do we sell you solutions? \"How we help you go-to-market? How do we lower your operating expense?\" That's the transformation in the field. Some of our fields are well on the way to doing that. Rob, other areas have a ways to go. We also completely changed engineering, the way we look horizontally across engineering on how we go-to-market. The Service Provider customers love the approach. It makes all the sense in the world to them. When we come out, I've got, Gary, was why didn't you do it earlier. and so you'll see us as we get our arms around this, make a pretty good transformation. And now, Mel, I'm defining an A job. In the next year to 2, just like we did on Enterprise. Because 2.5, 3 years ago, we were just in great shape on Service Provider, and candidly, we're starting to lose our lead on Enterprise. And what you've watched over the last 2 years, we went with architectures, we combined the data center with cloud, with security, with mobility. We talked about operating cost savings, we talked about outcome-based savings. Our number of big deals have increased dramatically and we're selling to the business unit more than we are the CIO now when we do our job right, with the CIO's support in terms of direction. In terms of SP Services. You're beginning to see a global delivery at that type of capability. And Gary, that's where you've got [indiscernible], really hitting all the cylinders on our consultancy. And we feel good -- you haven't asked the question, but we feel good at services at the 5% levels. So you can kind of feel that's starting to gain momentum again. And we're finally looking at a global delivery as opposed to candidly being organized by geography, which is not how our customers want us to be organized. There absolutely is, when you have 2 major combinations, the Time Warner and Comcast just being one of them, and when you have more combinations, dollar- or volume-wise, in the last 12 months than you had in 4 years, there are a lot of these going on. Those tend to have temporary slowing effects, not shutting off, but slowing effects until they get their decisions together on how the networks come together where they make investments. And then over the longer term period, if we do our job right, there are actually increased opportunities for us in that market. And then they're struggling with their own business models. They're having fits making money, which means they're squeezing the vendors as hard as they can. Having said that, that's why you move to an architectural sale and value-added sale as opposed to standalone boxes, which I do think will be kind of ugly. So that's why, I think, if you look out, probably going to be tough for a little while, I'd like to see us make steady progress. I'd like to see us exit this next year in a lot stronger position than we are today and do an instant replay of what we did in the enterprise and commercial market. Operator : Our next question comes from Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Kulbinder Garcha : My question is maybe for John. How he actually sees the year playing out from a revenue perspective. It sounded, at the beginning of the call, like you said, don't extrapolate the near-term revenue visibility and strength that you have. On the other hand, you're very excited about some of your new products. And I kind of thought that we were going to see it, probably you're coming off a period of easier compares. So I'm just trying to think, as we go through this year, when -- is this the year that Cisco will return to growth, do you think, meaningfully at some point? How do you see that playing out? And then the other question I have is that with the Nexus 9000 being out for a while, and the APIC controller now being out, why doesn't the share and the value of your sales of that can drive to your business, just how meaningful at some point? Isn't that a very positive driver 6 months out or am I thinking about the timing of this transition to be much longer? John Chambers : Okay, so if I give yearly guidance, Frank would trade me in. And we knew we'd get asked a number of different ways on that. I feel good about where we are. You should read into my comments today,  we're very, very positive on what we can control. And even on issues we don't control as well, I see us exiting the year in a stronger position and potentially very much stronger than we are today. Therefore, let me answer your question about the 9000 and ACI. It's unfair [ph], guys. The key is, once you get into the account, they're going to put their pallets in, you've got to get the controller in place, you've got to then begin to scale. I've been through this with the team just this last week. We looked at the crossover points based upon forecast for when the 7000 in the 9000 get to a growth that Rob and I will do back flips over. And you could argue which quarter that will occur in the year, but somewhere in the middle, toward the end of the year, that will occur, if we do our job right and the acceptance from customers is really good. I have not missed on a call on that when we outline our architecture and our whole approach to market where we're going on it. So it's really going very well. I have almost no criticism. If I look at the number of customers and the growth quarter-to-quarter, we're growing dramatically faster than a startup has  grown in 5 years. We're at a run rate in 1 year, and it gets very exciting in this next fiscal year. So I would challenge a little bit the data about where we are. It is going extremely well. And candidly, I expect very big things from it this next year. Going from 180 customers to 580 in a quarter is off the charts in terms of direction. But then you've got to scale, you got to get ACI, getting the controller working in volume and ACI implemented across it. So I look for that -- those type of crossovers in Q2, Q3 to be meaningful. Rob, what else would you add? Robert Lloyd : I'd just add, John, that in some of our conversations with cloud providers, who are really focused not on chasing the commodity cloud business but are focused on enterprise workloads, they love the APIC controller. They love the scale, they love the integration we can deliver, they love the automation. So we're seeing that as a key building block of our InterCloud conversations. And when we build that APIC controller into so many public clouds, we're really going to nail the hybrid cloud marketplace, which is where we see all the growth. And it will augment the growth we're seeing right now with our UCS. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen and Company. Paul Silverstein : John, 2 clarifications, if I might. One, I think you touched on it earlier on services. This was the first quarter in the past 7 or 8 where there was a turnup in the growth rate. The obvious question being, is that a one-off? Or should we start to see that either stabilize or improve from here? It was a meaningful improvement over the past trend. And then the clarification. On your wireless LAN business, we x-ed out the small cell business, and we just focused on the Wi-Fi piece. What would the growth rate look like? John Chambers : Got you. I'm going to verify numbers on it. The first part of the question was on services. I feel -- no, I'm going to let Gary brag about it. Go ahead, Gary. Gary Moore : So look. I mean, services revenue, they grow 5%, up from 3% growth last quarter. I think the trend is it's trending well. I think we had, in Q4, very strong renewals. We had some very large multi-year service wins. We had very strong technical support services, as well as advanced services in the quarter. And I think some of that growth is coming from our new businesses that we've been investing in : consulting, cloud, managed services, as well as our security services offering, not only security services and consulting, but the new managed threat defense service that we've launched. And I think all of those things contributed to growth in the quarter. And as John pointed out during the call, we're very confident in where we're at with the services. We have, not only a great team, we have a great installed base. And we're doing things to continue to optimize that and bring value to our customers. John Chambers : And I don't have the individual wireless LAN data in front of me. I'm not dodging the question. But by definition, Meraki was strong, that was a little bit weaker than we would like to have seen overall in it, Paul. And I think you'll see us address that appropriately in terms of getting back on track on the wireless LAN capability. Operator : Our next question is coming from Jeff Kvaal with Northland. Jeffrey Kvaal : I was hoping to get a little bit more color into the trajectory that the recurring revenue is on. Could you tell us a little bit about how much of a percentage of sales that is growing, how quickly that's growing year-over-year? And then also to what extent that cost you on your top line growth? Frank Calderoni : The recurring revenue, it's about -- slightly under about $2 billion, if you look at -- from that perspective. It's been growing, I would say, in the range of about $100 million a quarter. And as far as I had mentioned before, it's a combination of looking at WebEx, some of the security products that we have that's recurring, collaboration, enterprise license agreement and it's also the Meraki. There's a portion of the Meraki which is part of the recurring, so that's been adding to it since we've done the acquisition. So it's a big piece of the product descriptions in all these categories that's adding to. And that gets, as I said, recurring revenue over a period of time. John Chambers : So if you look at it, we're going to move faster and faster in this area. We understand fully that when you do recurring revenue, deferred revenue, pay-as-you-go services, subscription, as opposed to onetime fees, you have all the expenses upfront and you don't get the payback on that. And that is probably one of the reasons -- 6 or 7 reasons why we are moving our expenses so aggressively on the limited restructuring. If we didn't free up resources and move them over, 2,000 people into InterCloud and clearly, it will be a number of quarters before we start to get the payback there. On these recurring revenues or many of the deals we've done on enterprise licensing, Gary,  you don't get your revenue up front but you do much better over 2, 3 and 4 years, but we get all the expenses upfront. So that's why we felt we had to move -- one of the reasons we had to move aggressively to position ourselves for the future. And you're going to see us move aggressively. The market doesn't wait for anyone? We're going to lead it, period. And the ability to do that requires making some very, very tough decisions. But it will be about growth for us, innovation and at the same time, focus on our own talent. And we will manage our costs very aggressively and drive efficiencies, which really, if you think about engineering, that's what Pankaj is doing, probably Gary, more than anything else, that's driving the efficiencies across then freeing up the resources for the new areas. So Mel, I think that's a pretty good one to end on. But it's your call. Would you want to do anything else? Melissa Selcher : No, I think we can end there. Do you want to... John Chambers : Yes. I think if you were to take a step back, we executed very well in a tough market. I feel stronger now than I did a quarter ago about where we are today. You're going to see us lean in and drive on transformation. Anytime you do a restructuring, that's hard on the leadership team, I don't want to mislead you. But we will always make the decision of what's right for our shareholders, our employees, our customers in the long run, and partners. The results look very good. I like what I see in front of us. I think the challenges are largely ones that are more external, that are hitting us with the headwinds. That doesn't mean we shouldn't do better in certain areas. And I feel very strong going into fiscal year '15 in terms of where we're positioned. Melissa Selcher : Great. Thanks, John. Cisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our FY '15 first quarter results, will be on Wednesday, November 12, 2014 at 1 :30 p.m. Pacific, 4:30 p.m. Eastern. And I'd like to remind you that in light of Reg FD, Cisco plans to retain its long-standing policy to not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it's done through an explicit public disclosure. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation and continued support. This concludes our call. Operator : Thank you for participating on today's conference call. If you would like to listen to the call in its entirety, you may call (888) 403-4665.

At the request of Cisco Systems, today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Melissa Selcher, Vice President of Corporate Communication and Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Melissa Selcher : Thanks you. Good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to our 99th quarterly conference call. This is Melissa Selcher, and I\u2019m joined by John Chambers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Frank Calderoni, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rob Lloyd, President of Development and Sales; Gary Moore, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Kelly Kramer, Senior Vice President of Finance. I would like to remind you that we have a corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information that will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the Investor Relations website. As it\u2019s customary in Q1, we have made certain reclassification to prior period amounts to conform to the current periods presentation, the reclassified amount have been posted on our website. Click on the Financial Reporting section of the website to access these documents. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both non-GAAP and GAAP financial results. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements and as such are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on the Form 10-K and any applicable amendments which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted. All comparisons through this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless other -- stated otherwise. As we have in the past we will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer segment results in terms of product orders unless specifically stated otherwise. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to John for his commentary on the quarter. John Chambers : Thank you very much, Mel. I\u2019m pleased to report another solid quarter, our strongest Q1 ever in terms of revenues, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP earnings per share. We grew revenues this quarter to $12.2 billion, up from $0.01 year-over-year, returning to growth as we said we would. We generated $2.5 billion in operating cash flow and returned closed to $2 billion to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. With strong total non-GAAP gross margins at 63.3% and non-GAAP operating margins of 29.2%, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.54. When I think about the quarter, there are three key takeaways that you will see we will call out in our following discussion. First, I would say, we are managing the business very well in a very tough environment. Second, we are seeing the results of our three-year transformational work. In this work moving from selling boxes to selling solutions and leading with innovation, speed, efficiency, as we disrupt the market. Third, we are leading the technology and business transitions in the market. Our strategy is playing out as we delivered innovative solution based on intelligent networks to enable the next-generation of IP and the Internet of Everything. We continue to focus on what made us successful many times in the past leading through market transitions. I give us very high marks on our execution. For example, in the data center where we are winning the SDN battle with application centric infrastructure. This quarter, we now over -- have over 900 Nexus 9000 customers, up from 580 last quarter with strong continued momentum. And it is first full quarter of shipments we more than double paying customer adoption of APIC and our ACI controller that enables automation and programmability of the network and the skill that\u2019s never been done before. The Nexus 9000 and ACI continue to see strong demand from customers, who are seeing the significant advantage of ACI in their application deployment and management. As I said last quarter, we had two principal objectives, when we rolled out our transformational plan in 2011, Gary. So how are we doing against these objectives? The first one is about driving innovation, speed, agility and effectiveness in our business. As you are all aware, we are navigating the same macro-environment as everyone else. At the same time, we are also executing on several transitions within our portfolio. Despite this, our results are at or near record levels and showing momentum on both top and bottomline. I'm optimistic as things play out this year and beyond, Cisco is very well-positioned. The second objective, move our business from model that selling boxes and standalone services to selling architectures and solutions that drive business outcomes. As every company, every city, every country is becoming digitized and we are seeing this on the results of our customer visits around the world. We are engaging with entirely new business models, leading with software and services, and delivering integrated solution. Recently we described an enterprise license agreement for our software portfolio we had signed with General Motors, a model we are replicating across our enterprise account at this time. In last month we discussed what success we've had together in Barcelona in Chicago as they digitized their city and evolved in the smart cities. We are tying together the breadth of our product portfolio to deliver solutions that drive growth and economic opportunity, with security and scale. These large strategic deals are becoming a blueprint for how we will move forward. In the last few quarters, we have talked about three headwinds, emerging markets, SP and product transitions at the hand of our switching and routing. The good news is that in the third quarter, the third area, high-end switching and routing has turn to a tailwind based on momentum in our new product introductions and we will share that with you shortly. As we said last quarter, we are executing and progressing as expected, and I\u2019m very comfortable with our growth trajectory. We are pleased that in spite of the headwinds, we are growing again and are very nicely positioned once we get a positive turn in service provider or emerging markets, ideally in both. For Q2, we expect to see mid single-digit revenue growth in the range of 4% to 7% and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.50 to $0.52 which would be an increase of 6% to 11% in terms of the earnings per share given the range that we covered. Our Q2 guidance reflects an added nature of conservativism primarily related to reduce spend at several large U.S. service providers. I will now provide more detail on the business momentum in our geographies and customer segments within our portfolio. As a reminder, geographies are the primary way we run the business. In these areas, I will speak in terms of product orders year-over-year unless otherwise noted. We finished the quarter with product orders up 1% and product book-to-bill below one in line with usual Q1s. EMEA was a highlight with growth of 6%. We saw very strong performance in the U.K., up 20% and strength in Germany, up 6%. Southern Europe grew approximately 20%. We saw some stabilization in the emerging countries within an EMEA with growth of 2% in the emerging segment of Chris Dedicoat\u2019s business. Based on the role we play in the digitization of countries and companies including our ability to bring innovation in job creation, we\u2019re more positive on the future business in Europe than perhaps some of our peers are. Our Americas business grew 2%. We saw growth in the U.S. of 3% and when you exclude U.S. service provider, growth in the U.S. was 12%. U.S. public sector had a very strong quarter with growth of 22%, U.S. federal grew an amazing 34% while state and local declined by 2%. U.S. commercial grew 7%. U.S. enterprise declined 1%. Last quarter we shared the U.S. enterprise grew at a very strong 16% growth year-over-year. As I mentioned at the time that performance was higher than normal and expected it to balance out this quarter. Looking at the pipeline next quarter, we feel good that this business will again deliver double-digit growth. U.S. service provider however declined at 18%. Within the Americas, Latin America grew 5%. Asia-Pacific, Japan and China declined 12% led by China down to 33% while India grew 6%. The remaining emerging countries in Asia declined 15%. Overall, emerging countries within the three geographies declined this quarter by 6%. The BRICS plus Mexico were down 12% while the other emerging countries actually grew 1%. Our position in the emerging markets remain strong and we believe we are positioned well for the inevitable upturn. However, as we told you last quarter that is not factored into our plans. Moving onto the view from a customer segments. In this quarter, global public sector grew 13%, global commercial grew 5%, global enterprise grew 2% and service provider declined on a global basis by 10%. Emerging markets remain challenged and we saw dramatically reduced spend at several large U.S. service providers. As you think about our service provider position, I would think about the following, all of which are in our control. We recently reorganized the best-in-line with what our service providers customer would want from Cisco. That was true of engineering, sales, services and how we go to market. Second, we had the same power to part with customers as they transform during their own challenging time period in terms of their growth and their profitability. Third, our market share and share spend is strong. And fourth, our traditional box competitors have never been weaker. At this point, I don't think many of them have the flexibility to reposition in a way to remain relevant to these service providers. So we are nicely positioned for rebound in NSP when it happens. I now will move on to the discussion of our momentum in terms of products and services. I will discuss our momentum in terms of year-over-year product and services in terms of revenue but where appropriate we\u2019ll share order information where it adds important color. As we move on, I want to draw out the convergence that we are driving across almost all of our portfolios. As a first example, one that you are very familiar with in the data center, we simply converged networking with compute and storage and moved into what I believe is the number 1 data center position. Now we're converting networking with applications, security and scale and that's our ACI implementation. In routing, our NCS platform converges IP and optical networking with virtualization. We successfully converged where in wireless into most all our products and convergence will also be very key for us for us in collaboration work, which we\u2019ll talk about later. In the industry, we are the only player with the assets to drive to convergence for our customers. And this is a driver of both revenue and margins across our portfolio. Now let me move onto routing. Routing declined 4%, reflecting both the lower CapEx spend by major service providers and challenges in the emerging markets. We did see growth in several of our high-end routing platforms this quarter. For example, the ASR 9K saw solid double-digit order growth and our new products the NCS 6000 and CRS-X continue to ramp well with new customer wins. Given the tough environment, we believe we are gaining market share in these routing areas. Moving to switching. It was nice to see overall switching move back into positive territory, growing 3%. We returned to growth after three quarters of decline, driven by our strength in data center switching portfolio. In addition to the 60% increase in the Nexus 9000 and ACI customers, we sold double-digit order growth from the Nexus 3K, 7K, 9K and ACI combined. We signed a record 600 new customers for the Nexus 3000 this quarter including several major Web 2.0 providers. Looking at our performance relative to one of our merchant base competitors making a lot of noise in this market. In Q3 FY \u201814, from a comparison perspective, we saw orders of the Nexus 3K and 9K, our comparable portfolio to pass their total revenue for the first time. In Q1, orders for the Nexus 3K and 9K were approximately 50% larger than their reported total revenues, growing in excess of four times faster than the reported growth rates. Yet again in just one year, we have grown back where they had gotten to in the whole history of their company. A year ago we were fighting an SDN perception battle, with competitors using PowerPoint instead of products. Today with ACI, we are bringing programmability and automation to networking on a scale well beyond what competitors define as SDN. Now we are in the market with products and solutions and don't see, either traditional box competitors or the PowerPoint newcomers able to keep up. And for those of you who were concerned about SDN\u2019s effect on our switching margins, our switching gross margins have been incredibly consistent over the last five to six quarters and as far forward, as were modeling we see no change. In this quarter's example, our switching gross margins were above the mean level of this consistency. Data center and cloud where we first converge networking compute and storage and today it has continued to hold the number one position in revenue share for x86 blade in the U.S. according to IDC. Data center grew 15% year-over-year. Five years ago, we invested in the market for converged infrastructures and brought it to life with our ecosystem partners. Today FlexPod, with NetApp and Vblock with EMC, are the leading converged infrastructure architectures and there's two common tale elements. Cisco\u2019s UCS and Cisco\u2019s networking. Also in the quarter, we announced innovation across our UCS portfolio, broadening the product line to meet demands of large cloud environments and also scaled down to environments with just a handful of servers. We continue to demonstrate that innovation is very much alive in markets, with standalone products considered largely commoditized. I will also touch on InterCloud, where we announced this quarter a 30 new InterCloud partners, really nice job, Rob, including Deutsche Telekom, British Telecom, NTT DATA and Equinix. This brings our world's largest interoperable network of clouds to 250 data centers worldwide across 50 countries. All of which are working with us to ACI plus InterCloud fabric, plus OpenStack roadmap. This is truly unique to Cisco and being able to pull this all together. We are frequently asked what Cisco is doing differently in the crowded cloud markets. Simply put, we see the same problem in cloud that we saw 20 years ago in networking, where numerous networks operated on different technologies that didn't talk to one another. As we blow down the silos with Ethernet, we made the Internet pervasive. We are running the same play in cloud as only we can, unifying private, public and hybrid clouds. Customers want to seamlessly move their workloads between cloud with a common goal of policy and security. They need scale, feed and reliability and they care about data sovereignty and openness. We will place this market as a solutions play, meeting the network requirements of enterprise class applications and providing the platform to deliver Cisco's growing portfolio of software-as-a-service offers. This would drive our strategic role with customers and over time our recurring revenue. I said earlier, the security was the number one issue facing many of our customers. Security revenues grew this quarter 25%. In this quarter, we combined our security products even more closely with the Sourcefire products and delivered a highly anticipated Cisco ASA with firepower services, which combined Cisco\u2019s ASA firewall with Sourcefire into one platform. Customer receptivity has been very positive. Our innovation and security is very strong. Security continues to be our customers\u2019 number one business priority at the CIO level, but perhaps even more important at the CEO level. And we are doing very well in this market. Nearly every initiative we have at Cisco has security as a key component and we are committed to becoming the number one security company. Compared with even a year ago, we are getting good marks from our customers as now more than ever. Customers need strong and trusted company like Cisco to lead. They see Cisco alone in the ability to deliver an integrated security architecture and security services and solutions across their business. I am very pleased that our leadership transition is going very smoothly in this area, and we are moving aggressively to capture the opportunity ahead of us. Last quarter, wireless grew only 1%. This quarter, wireless grew 11%, with strong momentum in our 802.11ac portfolio, which now represents over 50% of our access point revenue. Cisco Meraki [continued out there] [ph] with another outstanding quarter growing at 86%. In the area of collaboration, we are going to continue to transform a collaboration portfolio and move to more enterprise license agreements in subscription. In Q1, our collaboration business was down 10% in the quarter. As our new video products ramp well but at a dramatically lower price points, we saw declines in telepresence and unified communications. WebEx continued to grow well and remains one of our largest -- remains one of the largest FAS businesses in the industry. As I mentioned before, collaboration should be the greatest productivity driver for our organizations. In the next week, you will see some bold moves that will secure our leadership position in cloud-based, simple, secure and converged collaboration. I think we have great potential to grow this business over time. I really like our position and our pipeline and I\u2019m very optimistic about returning back to positive growth levels relatively quickly in the collaboration arena. Service provider video declined 12%, with set-top box business down approximately 20%. Revenue for service provider video software and solutions grew by 13%. The bet we are making is on the video transition to the cloud. And we are seeing our video software business continue to grow, as we help our customers\u2019 transition to cloud-based video solutions. Now moving onto services, pulling everything together is our services strategy and our services in this quarter grew 5%. Services now represent over 23% of Cisco\u2019s revenue on a 12-month trailing basis. We\u2019ve added around $2.3 billion in revenue over the last three years with strong margins. Today, at a $11.1 billion in trailing 12-month revenue, it is our second largest business after switching and that doesn't count the literally billions of dollars being delivered by approximately 70,000 strong partner channels around the world, where partners deliver solutions on behalf of Cisco, not just boxes. In many ways, it's a bit unfair to refer to our services business by that name. Since it draws the comparison to what investors typically see at other companies, while our large component is driven by maintenance and support. Unlike our peers at Cisco, nearly 90% of our issues we handle for our clients are solved with automation. We have many large customers around the world to depend on us and depend on Cisco to run their networks. We have also readout a unique set of consulting, cloud analytics and security services. As the network continues to increase in importance, our services become increasingly more important to our customers. To summarize my commentary, we have undergone a successful reorganization across the company and are seeing the results. Our employee sentiment data shows that employees both understand the challenges we have made and also are optimistic about our future and the changes we've made to deal with these challenges. Thanks to a lot of hard work which will continue. I believe that we have positioned Cisco to lead the market transitions in front of us, to the benefit of our shareholders, our customers, our partners and our employees. Frank, let me now turn it over to you. Frank Calderoni : Thank you, John. We executed Q1 with financial performance slightly above our guidance. From a top and bottom line perspective, total revenue was $12.2 billion, growing 1% on a year-on-year basis. The non-GAAP net income was $2.8 billion and non-GAAP EPS was $0.54. Our GAAP net income was $1.8 billion and GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.35. Product revenue was flat and service revenue increased 5% on year-on-year basis, with product book-to-bill less than one. Overall, non-GAAP operating margin was 29.2%. In Q1, our total non-GAAP gross margin was 63.3%, above our guidance of 61% to 62%. As we have said in the past, non-GAAP gross margin may vary quarter-to-quarter by a point in either direction of our guidance range. This quarter, we were above the range. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 62.5%. As compared to Q4, product gross margin was positively impacted by productivity improvements and by product mix, partially offset by pricing. Non-GAAP service gross margin was 66%, consistent with historical levels. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.2 billion or 34.1% as a percentage of revenue, compared to 33.8% in Q4 of FY14. Non-GAAP operating expenses were flat quarter-over-quarter and up 3% year-over-year, reflecting investments in key growth areas. Our GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 included a pre-tax charge of $188 million or $0.03 per share related to a patent litigation matter described in our most recently filed 10-K involving the Rockstar consortium. A term sheet has been signed and we are hopeful to achieve a resolution of the associated litigation in a manner that is constructive for the whole industry. Now moving on to the non-GAAP tax provision rate, it was 22% consistent with our expectations. We ended the quarter with our headcount at 72,247, a decrease of approximately 1,800 from Q4 of FY14. This reflects reductions from our restructuring activity, partially offset by key sales, service and engineering investments, as well as acquisitions. As a reminder, as we outlined in our Q4 call, in Q1 we began taking restructuring actions focused on continuing to invest in growth, innovation, and talent, while managing costs and driving efficiencies, which would impact our global workforce during fiscal 2015. We announced and completed two acquisitions during the quarter, Metacloud and Memoir Systems to enhance our innovation and long-term growth opportunities in key growth areas, such as the cloud and software-defined networking. Both were executed consistent with our portfolio approach to acquisitions to drive long-term returns. Also we along with EMC and VCE announced during Q1 the next phase of VCE. Cisco will continue as a strategic partner and will have an approximately 10% equity interest in VCE. We expect the transition to close in Q2 of FY15. Looking at our geographic segment results, in terms of total revenue on a year-over-year basis our Americas segment was up 3%, EMEA was up 2% and APJC was down 5%. Total gross margin for the Americas was 64.1%, EMEA was 63.8% while Asia Pacific, Japan and China was 58.8%. From a balance sheet and cash flow perspective, total cash, cash equivalents and investments were $52.1 billion, including $3.8 billion, which is available in the U.S. at the end of the quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $2.5 billion during the quarter. And in Q1, we returned $2 billion to shareholders that included $1 billion to our share repurchases and approximately $973 million through our quarterly dividend. Our balance sheet at the end of Q1 was strong with the DSO at 33 days and non-GAAP inventory turns at 11. Deferred revenue was $13.7 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Product deferred revenue grew 9%, driven largely by subscription-based offering while services deferred revenue grew 1%. Each quarter we are consistently driving a greater software mix and higher recurring revenue. Let me now provide a few comments on our outlook or guidance for the second quarter. Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filing that identify important risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements and actual results could also be above or below this guidance. The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation to get. As John mentioned, we expect total revenue to be in the range of 4% to 7% growth on a year-over-year basis. For the second quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 62%. As we have said in the past, forecasting non-GAAP gross margin has always been very challenging due to various factors such as the volume, the product mix, cost savings as well as pricing. And I said earlier, non-GAAP gross margins may vary quarter-to-quarter by a point in the direction of our guidance range. Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q2 is expected to be in the range of 27.5% to 28.5%. Our non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be approximately 22% in the second quarter. Our Q2 FY15 non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.50 to $0.52 per share. We anticipate our GAAP earnings to be lower than our non-GAAP EPS by $0.10 to $0.13 per share in Q2 FY15. The range includes a pre-tax benefit of approximately $125 million from the reduced VCE equity investment to 10% and also is offset by a pre-tax charge of approximately $100 million in Q2 FY15 as a result of the restructuring actions that we announced in the first quarter. During Q1, we recognized pre-tax charges to our GAAP financial statements of $318 million related to that announcement and we are now expected total charge to not exceed $600 million during the fiscal year of 2015. Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for more detail. Other than those identified and quantified items noted previously, there were no other significant differences between GAAP and non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructuring and tax or other events which may or may not be significant. Our guidance does not assume a significant improvement in the emerging markets was a service provider segment in the near future. And although we believe we are executing well in a rapidly transforming market with these types of uncertainties in mind, we will continue to provide our guidance with all the appropriate caveats one quarter at a time. We encourage our shareholders to have similar considerations. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done to an explicit public disclosure. John, I'll now turn it back to you for some summary comments. John Chambers : Thank you, Frank. And well done. I'd like to talk now about the leadership transition at the CFO level and I would then summarize the call. When you look at the quality of the financial leadership team, it is something that all of us take a deal of pride in. As you know, Cisco has successfully transitions through multiple leaders often five to eight of them in every major functional group in the company over the years. And recently, Frank has been exploring the right time to step down as Cisco CFO. Frank joined Cisco over 10 years ago and has served as CFO for the last seven years. Among his many accomplishments, frankly at our very successful capital allocation strategy, including implementing Cisco\u2019s first dividend, managed effectively some of our almost challenging macro and industry environments, and he has been recognized time and time again for his strong leadership. While I know that Frank has other ambitions, I'm also very glad that Frank has agreed to stay on as an advisor to the financial leadership team and for me over not just hopefully next several months but over longer than that Frank if you'll have us. Effective January 1st, Frank will be stepping down as CFO. At which time, Kelly Kramer will assume the role as Cisco\u2019s CFO. One of Frank\u2019s best and most defining leadership characteristics is his focus on building incredible leadership teams. Almost three years ago, Frank hired Kelly. It is a credit to the work of Frank that the leadership team and the board have concurred in appointing Kelly to assume the role of CFO. Kelly brings a wealth of experience to this role, both from her three years at Cisco and 20 years at GE. Frank Calderoni : Kelly, you look too young to have that many years. Kelly Kramer : Thanks. John Chambers : Unlike Frank, you haven\u2019t got any grey hair and like me, you\u2019re not losing hair but that\u2019s a separate topic. In your last role at GE, you were GE\u2019s healthcare systems business group and CFO of that group. She is known for a business judgment, no-nonsense approach and strong strategic leadership style. At Cisco, Kelly has led both Cisco's corporate finance and business finance groups, managing among other things, all the controllers of Cisco's business units, with a particular focus around pricing and margins. She has learned Cisco's business inside and out and has proven herself to be a highly strategic, thoughtful and influential leader. Kelly is not afraid to challenge all of us to think differently. And it has been impressive to see her do this, while becoming a trusted partner to our entire leadership team. Kelly, I\u2019m going to give you the same advice that I once got when I became CEO and then I gave Frank seven years ago. Do a great job, have fun and don\u2019t mess it up. We know you won\u2019t and I look forward to working with you even more closely. Frank, I mean this is really something I'm very proud of in your many accomplishments. Your integrity and ethics define you. And you have always kept our employees, customers, shareholders at the forefront of our long-term strategic business planning. You have been a great finance leader but more importantly, you have been a great business leader. You have built a world-class financial organization that is driving Cisco\u2019s transformation and ensuring we are positioned to execute on the opportunities ahead. I know the future will hold very exciting opportunities for you. And I look forward to our continued relationship. Thank you once again, Frank. Frank Calderoni : Thank you, John. John Chambers : And Kelly, congratulation. Kelly Kramer : Thank you. John Chambers : Frank, I\u2019m just looking at you. You\u2019ve weather this last seven years better than I have. I\u2019ve lost lot of hair, you\u2019ve got little bit of grey into it. Frank Calderoni : We have to see how it continues, right? John Chambers : Yes. All right. Now to summarize our call today. I've talked a lot about accelerating pace of change in the industry. Recognizing that in many cases, Cisco and our technology are driving that change. I am now more convinced than ever that the pace of change is providing an advantage for Cisco for number of reasons. First, the role of the network is at the center of every major technology and business transition and that is becoming very clear to our customers and to the industry as a whole. Most customers are no longer interested in piecing together disparate infrastructure from different vendors or buying standalone technology. They are digitizing their businesses, their cities and countries and want Cisco to be a strategic partner delivering solutions and business outcomes. They recognize that to move with agility and security they need, their solutions have to be based on an integrated architectures, combined with intelligent network. You are seeing this showing up in increased enterprise license agreements, enterprise services agreements, subscriptions, consulting contracts and other advanced services including cloud analytics and security. Second, we have proven our ability to move quickly and aggressively to transform Cisco into a leaner and more effective company. Remarkably since FY \u201811, we have added around $4.1 billion in revenue, with about $61 million in incremental non-GAAP OpEx. Said another way, for every dollar of revenue we\u2019ve added over this transitional period, we've only added about $0.01 of non-GAAP OpEx. There is not a peer who can come anywhere near close to this by a factor of 10 to what that performance has represented for Cisco and for our shareholders. And what\u2019s exciting is we're just getting started and our transformational evolution at a time that our peers are just starting their transformational work that we started 3.5 years ago. We have also successfully redeployed this operating leverage in many ways. We\u2019ve invested in innovation. We built entirely new skill sets within Cisco. We disrupted our largest businesses in order to move at the fast pace this market requires. And we built flexibility into our operating model, as we managed through these transitions. Throughout, we\u2019ve driven record annual non-GAAP earnings per share for our shareholders. Third, we have and we\u2019ll continue to evolve the leadership team and the talent to drive us forward. As we focus on what our people can do with the support of Cisco, we are unleashing incredible innovation and energy. And fourth, the power of our brand. Our global channels and our strategic relationships with our customers is only strengthening. We continue to earn the trust of our customers and that is translating into greater opportunity for Cisco. The day feels a lot like the mid-90s, when companies were coming to Cisco to learn about the Internet. Today, they\u2019re asking Cisco to help make the transition and transition them to digitize their companies, their cities and even their countries, as they prepare to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the Internet of Everything. To repeat where we started, we believe, we are managing very well in a very tough environment. We are seeing the results of a three-year plus transformational program and work, moving from selling boxes to selling solutions and leading with innovation, speed efficiency as we disrupt the market. And we are leading the technology and business transitions in the market. We have been very clear with you, when we have seen challenges in our business. We are in the environment and we will continue to do so. We have also managed the business very well in light of those challenges. We have made hard decisions, where we have needed to and are seeing the resulting benefits. To sum it all up, I'm very optimistic about Cisco's future and excited about the fact that we are on. Mel, let\u2019s move to my favorite part of the session, which is the Q&A and turn it over to you. Melissa Selcher : Great. Thanks. Operator, let\u2019s move to questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs : Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to ask you first about your product order growth. I think you said, up 1% year-over-year. That comes on the back of relatively easy comps relative to the year ago number. And our method implies that sequentially, bookings declined something like the mid-teens, which I think would be well below normal seasonality for this quarter. So just curious, if you can give us a little more color on the puts and takes in there, if you can touch on FX, China seemed to decline at a little faster rate and how much of that with some of the weakness in the U.S. carrier space that you referenced? John Chambers : Okay. So, Simona, I\u2019m going to go, as you would expect to the most positive and unlike last quarter where we had about fives up and fives down, this time most all the positives were in the right direction with the exception of service provider in emerging markets. So start with our high-end switching and high-end routing puts and takes. The high-end switching grew at 10%, as I alluded to earlier and that shows how good of a job we\u2019ve done on the transition and taking not just market share but I think, moving very rapidly to pull away from some of our key smaller competitors. Routing is probably gaining share. We have our best routing portfolio. We have at the high-end and both, Nick Adamo and Kelly Ahuja will head that up. [Like we say with Cedrik] [ph], we\u2019d say we're very well positioned in routing as well. Securities saw 25% growth. Data center was at 15% growth, Simona. And that was probably a little bit lower than you might have expected. Q1 as Kelly, I think we were talking about it. You see a slower quarter for us in terms of our server technologies and spins. I would expect that to come back up in Q2, more into the 20s. UCS at 16 % and I am saying the same type of number for that in terms of, and these again orders that I am referring to. I\u2019ve got revenue on the left and bookings on the right, okay. I am sorry. So using UCS as an example, revenues are 16% and bookings are 18% in the quarter. And I\u2019d expect them to come back up in to comfortable growth well into the 20s as well. Services, Gary, it\u2019s been very nice return to mid-single digits. We had hopefully what will be a bottom at 3% and not feel pretty comfortable about our services revenues more in the mid-single digits. Wireless, which is one of the things you all rightly pointed out last quarter said was a little bit challenging for us, which was fair, retuned back to double-digit growth to 11% on revenues and mid-teens on bookings. I expect a solid quarter next quarter out of it as well. Collaboration was the one area that I talked about that we didn't go into as deeply. I like, where we wore on bookings. Bookings were down just about 2% negative. The collaboration portfolio was 10% on revenues. And so that's the solid part, better growth in Europe that people anticipated, better growth in southern Europe, better solid area in the U.S. managed service providers. The two big issues Simona are around service provider and emerging markets. Emerging markets went down as much as they were last quarter, minus 9%, but they were down 6% and the BRICS were down 12%, with China being the heaviest in terms of the approach. The rest of the emerging markets were actually slightly positive I think averaging out to be 6% odd number. Service provider is the big challenge, let me be very explicit, that\u2019s due to two to three U.S. service providers, who have dramatically slowed the order rates and I mean dramatically slowed the order rates with us. And that's an implication also I think of some of the -- what you're seeing in terms of net neutrality, Titled II discussions going on, where in my opinion it would be a very disappointing in result if we moved back to regulation, the Internet like we did voice many decades ago. It would dramatically slow the ability of service providers to be on our broadband and at time that our country is finally cut backup. So my key takeaways, Simona, are the service provider business driven by primarily two or three large U.S. players. It\u2019s the one area that has its most focused. And we saw that in order rate in this last quarter to the tune of a pretty substantial amount. In fact, if you take out those three service providers, you would have probably seen positive growth in our service provider business in total, which you are beginning to see now. So our strategy in business is taking hold. And emerging markets are still a little bit, if you will, balancing with some very good ones and some challenging ones. That's how I would answer your question on puts and takes. Melissa Selcher : Great. Thanks, Simona. John Chambers : And I know you are going to say keep my answers [tight] [ph]. I don\u2019t know how I will. Melissa Selcher : Next question operator. Operator : And your next question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS. Amitabh Passi - UBS: Hey, Frank, first sorry to see you though, but wishing all the best. And John, I just wanted to clarify on the guidance, maybe just picking off from the previous question. Your guidance implies about a 4% decline in revenues. Again, should we assume that most of that, in fact all of that pressure is from service provider and emerging markets? Are you seeing maybe potential some slowing momentum in your switching side as well? Or should we expect that to continue to remain robust? I just want to clarify what's embedded in the guidance? John Chambers : Yeah. My three years of law school if I say it was entirely to do with something my team would spare me on, but it is almost primarily due to those major factors on. If you look at just repeating the U.S. number without service provider, it was 12% growth, major strength. And that was in spite of our enterprise business having a slow Q1 in terms of Brian Marlier\u2019s team, got a lot of confidence in Brian. We went to the forecast pretty carefully with them, Rob. I think they are going to be back in double-digit growth this quarter and feel real good. The pipeline feels very, very solid on that. Even within our service provider business, if you look out several quarters, our pipeline is increasing rapidly. And I think you are going to see us increase our share of wallet as well as our market share in many of our areas. The transformation that we've gone through over this last year with Nick Adamo, Cedrik and Kelly leading the group, you\u2019re beginning to see our relationship with these service providers even when their challenge change a fair amount. So I would say it is emerging markets, and again it's not all of them anymore, it\u2019s a better standard deviation, but still we are not going to turn on that. And it\u2019s service providers, but it's a lot of just a couple service providers here in the U.S. So I like our pipeline. I think we're going to be challenged here for a couple quarters. I think we will power through it and I feel very good about the end result. Melissa Selcher : Hey, thanks, Amitabh. Next question operator. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank. John Chambers : Hey, Brian. Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank : Yeah, John. How are you doing? And Frank yes congratulations on your retirement and good luck dealing with us Kelly. So a question on the gross margin reached 63%. Your guidance is decent as well. How do you see your gross margin? Some of they call it with the net -- you would see pressure there. It doesn\u2019t look like you have. How do you -- and looking at your mix in your forecast, how do you see your gross margins panning out over the next quarter? And then real quick if I could slip in, you mentioned General Motors again, can you talk about what that means in terms of your ability to sell into big U.S. and European telcos and software opportunities in terms of offering that type of product pipeline to them to sell to their customers? And how it might be as a recurring revenue stream over time? Thanks. John Chambers : Got you. Frank, why don\u2019t you take first the one? Frank Calderoni : So Brian, I am going to be a broken record at least one more time on this one. But from the gross margin standpoint, as we look at the gross margin, it\u2019s 61% to 62% give or take 1%. Going back on the first quarter, yes they were higher over 62%. We tend to see high gross margin in the first quarter. We did see a benefit from a mix perspective. I think the stronger switching helped. As well as if you look at the mix from a UCS perspective, it tends to be lower. Where I think Q2, A2 especially after the end of the calendar year, it tends to be a stronger UCS quarter. So we\u2019ll see a bit more of an impact from a negative mix standpoint in that quarter. So when you take all those gives and takes, that\u2019s where we get to that 61 to 62, give or take. And we\u2019ll continue to keep managing that balance as we look out over several quarters. John Chambers : Gary? Gary Moore : Yeah. On the ELA that we did with General Motors that John did mention again this quarter, that\u2019s a solid deal for them and for us. It has a lot of interest from other companies. And we are actually working a number them. And I think there's a lot of positive things about the structure of that deal certainly for the customer, but certainly for Cisco. And with the customer like GM, where they\u2019ve gone all in on us, on our strategy, it\u2019s very easy for them now to continue to grow and do innovative things that give them business outcomes that they weren't able to justify to the business before. And I think that\u2019s something that a visionary CIO will do with the company and the CEO and the CFO that really look for IT to be a competitive advantage and not an expense. And I think the team at GM has done that. And we have a number of other customers that we\u2019re working with along those same lines. John Chambers : What\u2019s exciting is these enterprise licenses, think of it in enterprise software license where literally you can fill in the hardware and then meet that within integration. As you can move from security to collaboration, you can feed against white label, you can bring in your consultancy services, you knowledge of a network and ways that no one else can do. You\u2019ve seen us doing the same thing with services, enterprise services agreement. And that has even more impact, where you go across the whole large enterprise and you do services tying all together their networks, their directions, get efficiencies from it, but then it really opens up your consultancy, your security, your collaboration offers, then you combine that with our architecture plays and you take it from cloud all the way through mobility, take it all the way down to the edge. That's why we win. One thing Kelly you pointed out to me the other night, you are educating Frank and I as well good potential detail. When you look Brian at the numbers, Q2 is usually a quarter. If you watch historically that has had lower gross margins than Q1, because we do a bigger mix of our products on service during Q2 because of the year end. So that\u2019s been fairly typical in terms of our pattern. Did I learn that right? Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank : That\u2019s right. John Chambers : Yeah. Okay. Melissa Selcher : All right. Thanks, Brian. Operator, next question? Operator : I think our next question comes from Ehud Gelblum with Citigroup. Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup:  Hey guys. Appreciate. Thank you. Frank, likewise, great working with you and lots of luck. Just aside on that, if you can just give us some sense of your thought process as to -- a, what you plan on doing next and kind of, what you are thinking as you went through the situation to retire that would be awesome to have some rationale? But I was looking more for some a little bit more, good guide into the enterprise business, where enterprise orders were down from being up last quarter. And putting that together what\u2019s happening were VCE and with the data center number of 15% that John said, you thought was little disappointing and I think it was about 30% last quarter. So putting it all together in one piece, can you give us a sense as to, a, is the question to a, how much UCS went through VCE and how much will that impact you as your piece of VCE goes to 10% from 35%. B, were all the issues related to low enterprise growth, the low UCS and data center growth? And you\u2019ve done your equity stake in VCE, was that all the same issue and what gives you confidence that all these issues, enterprise, UCS, data centers, et cetera, rebound next quarter and going forward? Thanks. John Chambers : Got it. So let me take it. Frank, maybe you could handle that one question with him one-on-one. In terms of matter and now, I\u2019d like to sit on that discussion. So let me address the enterprise question very directly. First, let use our Global Enterprise Theater run by Woody Sessoms. We didn\u2019t talk about in the call. It\u2019s our top-29 global enterprise accounts. It grew 15% this last quarter. And it grew across all those architectures and it is one of the very best with VCE, with FlexPod and total architectures. And so if you watch and we\u2019re progressing and predicting they\u2019re going to grow very well again this quarter, their pipeline looks really good. So, as you what you expect, testing to make sure the pipelines good where we\u2019re going, that would be an example and those are our global enterprise. In the U.S. enterprise, it was very simple. We finished up the quarter, they were in the running to become the top theater in the world and they won it. They pushed hard in the quarter and pushed financially to advantage and drive little bit out of the pipeline on that. They made organization changes to set up for this next year, got going on, even pushing harder on solutions, even harder on architectures and your CM. You\u2019ll not give it, extremely at 90% plus, you are going to probable see it. You will seem then returning to double digits and we\u2019ve been through Brian\u2019s pipeline. He is world-class, knows how to do it. There is no effect of our agreement with what we do with VCE that slowed at all. In fact, I think the VCE numbers, Gary felt very good. And I think both VCE and FlexPod are growing and also the billion dollar plus space is over 50% a year. Frank Calderoni : I mean, VCE surpassed the billion annualized in the run rate. We\u2019ve more than 2,000 people with thousands customers, 2,000 Vblocks up there and this did not slow them down at all. John Chambers : And I guess, I will draw the parallel, government is nothing more than a public sector of enterprise and you saw 13% growth in government around the world. Digitization of countries has taken off and I cannot tell you what it means, when A. Merkel, the leader in Germany says about in Industry 4.0, she is going to digitize her country. And what we could do together with government and with Deutsche Telekom in her cities and rebuild all kinds of it high, in terms of direction. Same thing with commercial. Commercial was solid at seven. It doesn't quite go up and down as much. I\u2019m sorry, I missed some? I will come a little bit closer. I\u2019m sorry. Frank was waving at me in a unique way and I wasn\u2019t sure in terms of the direction. So that\u2019s an answer that I feel really going on in enterprise. We are going to lead and breakaway from most every player in the enterprise and that applies across all products, including with our Applications Centric Infrastructure enterprise, which is going great guns. Nice way, I don\u2019t miss transitions like this. If I were concerned, I would tell you, we always want to watch the numbers stuff. Melissa Selcher : Thanks Ehud. Operator, next question? Operator : And your next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital. Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital : Yeah. Thanks a lot. John, could you talk a little bit more there about service provider? When do you -- what you need to see to have it turn? I thought that was interesting that you talked about neutrality, which is obviously a hot button issue right now and obviously the spending. But I think we\u2019re all trying to figure out, when it could possibly turn. It sounds like, there are several factors and your leadership on this issue, I think would be very helpful to us. Thanks. John Chambers : Several questions and thank you for the nice comment. On our service provider business, first let's assume for now that it won't change in the couple quarters. We, however, with our new structure begin to build different relationships at every single major service provider. Rob, you\u2019ve probably been the 30 of them in the last two months, at the CEO level, the CTO level, CMO level operations et cetera. And our relationship is changing with them and our ability to really bring a portfolio that addresses their top priorities in terms of what they are doing to mobility, what they\u2019re doing on video, what they're doing with new services. In a market that their traditional transport is commoditizing is pretty good. However, I don't want to ignore one issue, they are struggling big time in certain geographies with how to make money given the cost that are going flat to up, and their revenues that are coming back through. And so you are going to see certain service providers like AT&T said it very publicly. And obviously I\u2019m very close to Randall and John and Ralph there. We know that their CapEx is going to be down by fair amount this next year regardless. However, it will be down dramatically more, if we don't get our act together on this title to issues. There's a way to accomplish the goals of both sides. I thought Chairman Wheelers\u2019 original approach to this was right on and right compromise in terms of direction. And I think, it's very important that we send a message because you are going to see these service providers flow if not pause completely on broadband buildout, because if they can\u2019t make money on broad brand buildout, they aren\u2019t going to build it out. It\u2019s just simple as that. And we included that was the wild card factors that, Simona, you asked me about indirectly. We started seeing service providers spending slow a lot less quarter among the three big guys that might be most affected here. And so I think getting their act together there is key. We do plan to be very aggressive on this and trying to educate people on all sides about why this is not right for our country. I find it just last comment being very interesting that Europe looks at the U.S. that we\u2019ve got our act together. We head the right amount of competition that allowed companies to make profits, and the right amount of government regulation that allowed them to build out broadband. So they look at us like we\u2019ve got our act together and here we are thinking about changing it. So I think it\u2019s very important that the whole industry is active here. I think, it\u2019s going to have a negative impact for all of us that are connected to those large service providers in the U.S. here and the just last quarter and maybe one or two more quarters. And that\u2019s pretty much reflected in our approach, hope I'm wrong, but it feels like that\u2019s going to be very tight. Melissa Selcher :  Thanks, John. Operator next question. Operator : And your next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets. John Chambers : Hey Mark. Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets : Thank you. Good afternoon. At a high level, the patterns that we\u2019re seeing today is somewhat similarly. You have some regions positive, some regions negative and then we are seeing a subsequent reversion to the mean. Are their considerations to really think about -- can do things very differently, make big changes. So that all the effort that Cisco is making can lead to a corresponding outperformance, in terms of economic value added and also equity outperformance for Cisco. In terms, of looking at unlocking value, are there discussions going on or we had a point where Cisco will consider new inputs to change and formulate a better outcome. John Chambers : Well, Mark, a couple of thoughts. You\u2019ve asked your question that we could probably talk about for a half an hour but let me here it very high. We are winning almost all of our major market transitions moves. We\u2019ve been on our architectures, we\u2019re winning on convergence in the data center of storage and network and processing capability. We\u2019re winning big-time on application-centric infrastructure, and pulling away from the start-up competitors that being very bold, I would say, we are not only pulling away from, I think, while they have news left on the table, I think, it\u2019s game over, I think we have got them. There is no doubt about where we are leading with Internet of Everything. Our products are very uniquely tied together. That\u2019s why you have seen our gross margins be so strong. We moved to selling solutions and software and cloud. We have redone and transformed our whole company to move resources and freeing up by keeping headcount flat into new areas. We have moved with InterCloud with tremendous efficiency. We realigned our organization. So we transformed our company at a time that others have not transformed at all and are just beginning to get started, Mark, with some of the things that you are outlining, which I think is going to get into real trouble. So I love our position in the market. Our position with customer, Gary, you and I were out there all the time. It has never been stronger. And Mark, we are winning with great gross margins and where there are growth opportunities, we are getting share of it plus a lot, gaining market share in many of the areas. So fair criticism perhaps three years ago probably not a fair criticism today. Melissa Selcher : Okay. Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question. Operator : And your next question comes from James Fawcett with Morgan Stanley. James Fawcett - Morgan Stanley : Thank you very much. I wanted to go back to the question that was asked earlier on margins? Just wondering how we should think about opportunity to improve profitability. It seems like we are on the backside of a multiyear revamping of the internal organizational structure like you just said, John? And I am wondering if there is an opportunity to see some margin expansion as year-over-year growth persist or maybe to ask another way, what kind of topline growth do you think we would need achieve in order to show some margins expansion improved profitability as we get to the latter stages of the reorganization we have been under -- that\u2019s been underway for last three years? John Chambers : Yeah. So you are repeating first, I have seen that, I commented on and then we are in agreement the way you are leaving us. You look at the last three plus years to grow revenues by $4 billion and to grow operating expenses by $61 million. Our peers when we look at them, they were at $0.30, $0.50, $0.70, $1 per dollar revenue gain. We did it at 1%. I have to give us very high marks on that over the last three years. To the second part of your question, Gary\u2019s got the ball for me on that. Its about, how do we drive productivity and we are going to use, one, we can measure productivity per employee, which is just a easiest one to do, I know, its not anywhere near as sophisticated as, many of us would use different measurement that add up to that. But how we drive productivity of our company on that and to your point, there times either within segments of our business or times when there are market segments where we will improve productivity dramatically, and routing and switching would be good example. But even though we are breaking away new products, we are moving resources into other areas at the same time. Gary, your thoughts on that? Gary Moore : Yeah. I mean, there are several things that we have done. I mean, John spoke of the services revenue growth over the last three years and the fact that we are doing that with automation and analytics, and delivering higher value at a lower costs, I think, plays into that and there is a lot more that we can do there as we continue to buildout the things that we have been talking about, about cloud managed services, the security offering, the consulting, those kinds of things from services, as well as other things that, Rob, and the engineering team are doing with [broadcast] [ph] relative to the integrated portfolio. So from a margin point of view, we still have, we maybe on the backside of this. But as we\u2019ve said, this is the game that it doesn\u2019t have nine innings to it. We are going to continually turn the dials that we need to turn and we have all of those levers available to us to coincide with the growth, we are well-positioned. If things do uptick and we have moved a lot to Share Support, so we are at a really good position to expand margins, quite honestly in my opinion if the growth takes off, because of what we have build on the infrastructure that is global and scalable. And you will see us, probably, I think, given the market growth numbers, fairly, small numbers, be more conservative about adding the headcount once we got the growth, as opposed to betting little bit on the company as you move forward especially in this market. Melissa Selcher : Okay. Thanks, James. Operator, next question. Operator : And your next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham. John Chambers : Hi, Alex. Alex Henderson - Needham: Hi, guys. How are doing? John Chambers : Good. So, I was hoping you could give us a little bit more granularity on the service provider segment. The piece that is confounding the analysis to some extend is the set-top box business continuing to fall off and its falling off so many quarters in a row, it\u2019s kind of lost track of how big it is? Can you talk about what the service provider business would be doing ex the set-top box on an apples-to-apples basis, because that piece is obviously got a different trajectory? John Chambers : Yeah. I have got it. My team will verify on the numbers. The business answer just the way you worded, global service providers were down 10%. If you take a set-top box out of that, it would have been down 6% in terms of the approach. And it did vary globally, global service provider Europe group by 13% this last quarter and service provider in relationships with the companies like Deutsche Telekom, et cetera going extremely well in terms of where we go from that side. And you are seeing us build very strong relationship in new emerging markets with players like Reliance and Rob, you have got a list of 30 of our InterCloud type of partners in terms of the direction. And again, understand, I am not aware the set-top box is, I am aware to winning the battle in the cloud. And so we clearly use set-top boxes, clearly it\u2019s a stepping stone to get into the cloud and direction. And right now we have a pretty good portfolio and how this ties together. But it\u2019s all about winning software in the cloud. And you will see us evolve our company that way in terms of products that don\u2019t add much margin overtime. Melissa Selcher : Thanks, Alex. Operator, next question. Operator : And your next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer: Thanks. And Frank, the best wishes to you and thanks for the many years of good -- very good service and good luck to Kelly. I wanted to go back to the point of gross margin, John, if possible? John Chambers : Sure. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer: And I have heard all the explanations around it. But I have to go back literally two, three years to find a point in time where you had a product gross margin this high? And then, I looked at your guidance over the past few quarters and years, and you have beaten gross margin 10 out of the last 13, you never miss in the last 13 quarters? And I am kind of wondering, if we have gotten to a point in time where you feel that the, you have a much better handle on the product cycles, you have a much better handle on the competitive front, what is the possibility that you actually do start raising that gross margin range outlook going forward? Is that something completely unreasonable to assume? John Chambers : Yeah. It\u2019s a good question. We debated that at the operating committee, Gary, just a couple of weeks ago. And so to answer your question on part, we are -- all over gross margins. Gary leads the project with Frank and now Gary will lead with Kelly, every aspect of gross margins from, in the product cycle improvement to designing products to your point, let\u2019s not design a switch that comes in a 50% gross margins and we get at the 70% over three years. That was very painful and we did that across our line the last time. And with our new switching product they came in at very high gross margins and I said earlier are actually improving as volume picks up in terms of direction. I think the major issue quarter in and quarter out is more mix at the present time. We are going to go into next quarter, where UCS will be up and hopefully up dramatically and seasonally strong period for us in UCS, as well as otherwise. And I think there are certain transactions that we want to go after aggressively in an emerging markets are not which tend to swing it up and down. But are we focused on this, yes, and are we focused in each category, even thought the real play is for architectures, about how to improve the category and gross margins, the answer would be, yes. And then, final, the real issue on gross margins, if you can provide a solutions, it is three to five times the value to our customer providing products. And so when we tie together these architectures Mark at dramatically lower, dramatically lower operating expenses to get the solution to go to outcomes, that\u2019s what customers pay you huge premium for, that\u2019s where you are making a money, by Mark, I meant, Mark, referring back to his comment earlier. Why you don\u2019t change the structure when everybody else has left this wide open for us and we are breaking away. The last thing you do would be change that now that would result in opposite. So I think there are areas that we can improve on. And as we move more into cloud, as we move more into software, we should move into collaboration. We\u2019re looking at the margins and you\u2019ll see us where we can\u2019t get good margins, will walk them at the business. And we clearly are doing that with some service providers today. If we can get a good margin deal, it\u2019s important to us, we will walk and that\u2019s advantage of, I think having the discipline this leadership team has. Mel, that\u2019s probably a good way to summarize. If I would have to look at it, I\u2019d say in the comments we started off the quarter review with, I\u2019d end with. I think in the tough environment, we are managing very well. On the Enterprise, Commercial and Public sector, we are lighting up the world and I think we\u2019re doing very well there. The areas we make big bets on that some people challenges with its architectures or convergence or Application Centric Infrastructure or embracing SDN and bringing it to light with programmability and leading Internet of everything is finally taken off. You have an inflection point on that. We had the courage to change organization and make transitions that other companies struggle with and by the way, we're just now starting. We have been up for 3.5 years. I love our position. And I think we\u2019re going to win. So I want to thank you all for your confidence in Cisco. And thank you for the time. Mel, let me turn it back to you. Melissa Selcher : Great. Thanks John. Cisco\u2019s next quarterly call which will reflect our FY \u201815 second quarter results will be on Wednesday, February 11, 2015 at 1 :30 p.m. Pacific, 4:30 p.m. Eastern.

At the request of Cisco Systems, today\u2019s call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Melissa Selcher, Vice President of Corporate Communication and Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, you may begin. Melissa Selcher : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to our 100th quarterly conference call. This is Melissa Selcher, and I am joined by John Chambers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Kelly Kramer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rob Lloyd, President of Development and Sales; and Gary Moore, President and Chief Operating Officer. I would like to remind you that we have a corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information that will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the Investor Relations website. Click on the Financial Reporting section of the website to access these documents. Throughout this conference call, we will be making references to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements and as such are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and any applicable amendments which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted. All comparisons through this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise. As we have said in the past, we will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer segment results in terms of product orders unless specifically stated otherwise. I will now turn it over to John for his commentary on the quarter. John Chambers : Mel, thank you very much. Our Q2 results reflect continued progress as we transformed Cisco to become the number one IT company. In the quarter, we grew revenue to $11.9 billion, up 7% and grew non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.53, up 13% year-over-year. We generated $2.9 billion in operating cash flow this quarter and returned $2.2 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We delivered the strong performance despite a volatile economic environment. Our strong momentum is the direct result of how well we have managed our company transformation over the last 3 plus years and our leadership position in the key technology transitions, such as cloud, mobility, big data, security, collaboration and the Internet of Everything. The four takeaways I have from this quarter are the following. First, we are executing well and growing at a healthy pace in a tough environment. Second, we saw very good balanced growth, the best balance in 12 quarters across the majority of our key geographies, product categories and customer segments. Third, our financials are very strong and we continue to deliver value for our shareholders with strong earnings, cash generation and capital return, including another $0.02 dividend increase to $0.21 per quarter. And fourth, every country, every city, every business, every home and every car is becoming digital. In our view, Cisco is better positioned than any other company to help our customers reinvent their business and technology strategies as they become digital organizations. Today, every company and every industry is a technology digital company, something people would not have said a year ago. Over the last month, I have met individually with over 100 business and government leaders. Without exception, these leaders recognized the role technology plays in their future, not just how it creates opportunity, but also with customers around the world both business and governments are aligning with strategic partners in order to be more successful in the digital transition. They are increasingly choosing Cisco as their strategic partner and you are seeing the evidence in our financial performance. Let\u2019s start with a basic question, like why Cisco? With the network at the center, Cisco has the portfolio and ability to bring our customer solutions to drive down cost, help secure their businesses and increase the speed and agility, so they can innovate across their own organizations. In our view, our track record of disrupting markets by leveraging the power of the Internet is unmatched. Our strategy has always been based on understanding the direction of major market transitions, transforming ourselves to meet the needs of our customers and demonstrating the courage to disrupt not just the markets but even our self. The market is moving fast and change is exponential. We are in the strong position today we are today because we made dramatic moves in how we are innovating, how we are interfacing with our most important customers and how we are organized to ensure Cisco is leading where the market is going. Most companies resist changing until it\u2019s too late and their market credibility is eroded, the classic innovators dilemma. It was our choice to move early and boldly with incredible speed to realign 40% of our employees to priority areas. To be organized from product groups and to integrated solution teams, to replace more than 30% of our leaders. We are seeing the results and our relevancy with our customers and our operational excellence and that is driving our financial performance. Since fiscal year \u201811 we have added $4.9 billion in revenue with about $300 million in incremental non-GAAP OpEx. Said another way, for every dollar of revenue we have added over this transitional period, we have only added about $0.06 of non-GAAP OpEx, I think you will find this as best in class by a factor of 5 to 10 fold. In the 90s we were the best example of a company capitalized on the Internet. And that gave us tremendous credibility with customers and fueled our growth. Today, as every company becomes to digital, every CEO knows he or she needs to evolve their organization to move with speed, agility and efficiency. The Internet of Everything will demand of them. Our strategy is to be the model in how we have reorganized and the customers we are driving as a result. And we have done the heavy lifting with our peers and customers are just starting. As a result I am now spending a significant amount of time with our customers\u2019 executive teams and in their board rooms discussing how they organize for digitization, innovation, security and the Internet of Everything. We could not be better positioned in the market. We have worked very hard to get here your and the opportunity feels very much like it did in the 90s when the Internet became mission-critical to our customers. We have said for were several years that we believe the impact of the Internet of Everything will be 5 to 10 times greater than that of the Internet today. At CES and the World Economic Forum almost every leader we saw agreed. We have been building this opportunity. We have the innovation, operational excellence, speed, agility and efficiencies in our business to drive the greatest possible benefit for our customers, our partners and our shareholders. On to guidance, as we said for the last 2 quarters, we are pleased that in spite of the headwinds, we are growing well again. We are well positioned for a positive turn in either service provider or emerging markets. But we are not modeling those turns for several quarters despite the better results we saw in this last quarter for reasons you all are very much aware of. For Q3, we expect to see revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5% and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.51 to $0.53. Let me now provide some additional detail on the business momentum we see in our geographies, customer segments, products and services business within portfolio. In terms of business momentum as a reminder the geographies are primarily the way we run our business. For geographies and customer segments, I will speak in terms of product orders year-over-year unless otherwise noted. We finished the quarter with product orders up 5% and product book to bill greater than one. Let\u2019s move first to the Americas, the U.S. continue to accelerate growing 7% compared with Q1 3% growth. Latin America returned to double-digit growth at 12% versus Q1 of 5% and negative growth in fiscal year \u201914. Strength in the U.S. public sector continued growing 17% with U.S. federal growing 23% and U.S. state and local growing at 8%. Moving on to our Europe, Middle East and Africa operations, as we said on last quarter\u2019s conference call, we were more optimistic about Europe than most of our peers. And we saw that business play out as we called with growth in EMEA up 7% year-over-year. We saw phenomenal execution in the UK, up 17%, Germany up 12%, and something no one else in the industry is coming even close to Southern Europe actually grew 20% year-over-year speaking to the relevancy that we provide to companies and governments. Over the last 6 quarters, our growth year-over-year in EMEA has gone from minus 4% to minus 2% to minus 1% to 2% to 6% in Q1 and now 7% in Q2. And we remain cautiously optimistic. In Asia-Pacific, Japan and China, and China in particular we continue to see challenges that all of you are aware of. And we saw our China business decline by 19%. However, we saw India grow by 11%. The rest of APJC not including China was down 1% this quarter. And finally emerging markets, emerging markets total grew 1% with emerging markets excluding BRICS plus Mexico, up 8%, a major change from last quarter. We continue to see the BRICS plus Mexico challenged, down 6% in total with Russia down 16%, Brazil down 8%, China as I said earlier, down 19%. We did see growth in Mexico up 21%, India up 11%. While we are pleased with these results, we believe it is still way too early to call a turn in emerging markets and are modeling for them to be challenging for several more quarters. Customer segments, total global commercial grew a healthy 8%. Our success in the U.S. commercial continues to be very strong, up 12% in Q2. We have built a model based on success in the U.S. commercial and best practices from around the world and have implemented the model outside the U.S. DNR orders go from down 5% in fiscal year \u201814, to up 4% year-to-date. In total Cisco business terms that improved performance added a full point to our company\u2019s growth rates. Our new operating remodel and global service provider is also showing some traction. This quarter our service provider business was down 1% after having been down on average 10% or more for the last 5 quarters. Like many in the industry we are modeling total global service provider CapEx down in the mid-single digits for calendar year 2015. We are focused on growing share of wallet. We believe we are very well-positioned in terms of our portfolio and how we have aligned with our service provider customers, but we expect the next several quarters to continue to be challenging and service provider along with emerging markets remain our two challenged areas. Total global enterprise grew 10% versus 2% in Q1. We did see U.S. enterprise grow a bit slower than expected at 3% growth due in part to the timings in very large deals. The enterprise pipeline continues to see rapid growth in very large multiyear deals, which would benefit Cisco over several years. Our global enterprise U.S. customers which are the largest 28 enterprise accounts not included in regular U.S. enterprise discussion grew about 30% year-over-year. Global public sector continue to be solid at 7% growth year-over-year. I will now move on to discussion of our products and services business, which I will discuss in terms of revenue year-over-year unless otherwise stated. Starting with switching, we saw very strong switching growth of 11% with strong performance in both the data center switching and our campus switching business. We were especially pleased with the continued momentum of our Nexus ACI portfolio including the Nexus 3K and nexus 9K, and the APIC controller. As an example the nexus 3K plus 9K grew 350% year-over-year. We have seen the nexus 9K and ACI customers grow each quarter from 580 customers two quarters ago to 970 customers last quarter to1,700 this quarter. APIC customers grew to over 300 and the Nexus 9K passed 1 million installed port mark this quarter, less than one year after the first shipments. We are pulling away from our competitors and leading in both the SDN thought leadership and customer implementations. The market has recognized the benefit of ACI as compared to PowerPoint concepts of aspirational competitors. ACI and APIC will become the cornerstone of the next generation of networking architectures for many years, much like the UCS has become in the data center. I am particularly pleased that we have kept gross margins extremely stable in switching and have actually grown gross margins in many of our product switching areas, which were already very strong in new areas, such as the ACI portfolio. Moving on to data center, which grew an impressive 40%. UCS has now reached over $3 billion revenue run-rate with over 41,000 customers. More than 85% of the Fortune 500 have chosen UCS, because of the innovative architecture with particular traction in cloud, big data and enterprise application solutions. The innovation underlying UCS, the convergence of compute network and storage is continuing to fuel our growth in the data center and differentiates Cisco. Now, we are converging networking, applications, security, with scale for our ACI platform. And we are doing it with the speed and the scale that no one else is coming close to it. Next to NGN routing, which grew 2% year-over-year in terms of revenue. We saw strong performance in high-end routing, up 5% with continued strong performance in our new product introductions such as the CRS-X and NCS. With the global macro changes and headwinds like net neutrality and industry consolidation, we expect this business to be challenged going forward, but we believe we are taking market share and will continue to take market share. Wireless had another strong quarter, up 18% year-over-year compared with Q1, which was up 11%. We saw strong growth in our traditional business, but in Meraki, cloud networking business continues its stellar growth, up another 100% with an annualized run-rate of approximately $400 million. Security grew 6% with orders growing even faster. We saw very strong adoption of our Cisco ASA with firepower services, which integrates our Sourcefire software products together. Our acquisition strategy in our security business has been very successful as we integrate the various elements into our overall security architecture. We fight point players in some areas, but no other vendor can play at the level across the enterprise that our customers need. In this volatile environment with change happening faster than ever before, the importance of security has never been more significant. The level of danger has been raised from a firewall breach to the potential for enterprise destruction and having robust security solutions before, during and after attack is table stakes. In this environment, customers are migrating to partners they can trust who will lead with innovation and who will be around tomorrow. This trusted partnership is core to our success and drives everything we do. Cisco is the number one security player in terms of revenue and we are progressing nicely toward our goal becoming the number one security company in terms of mind share, which literally we announced a 1.5 year ago, an intention to do so. Moving on to collaboration, last quarter, we boldly stated our intention is to lead in the next generation of collaboration and become the number one collaboration player. After a complete portfolio of refresh and four quarters of decline, we made very good progress this quarter with growth of 10%. Kelly, I think it was flat or negative last quarter if I remember. Within collaboration, the strongest growth came from our telepresence business, where we saw on the back of our new telepresence portfolio, a 60% growth in units and revenue growth at 35%. We continue to grow our recurring business in collaboration. Our deferred collaboration revenue was up 26% in the quarter to $1.1 billion, SP video declined 19%. We have announced key partnership wins to develop the next-generation end-to-end video solutions from the set-top box to the cloud. Service revenues grew 5%. We saw our portfolio in cloud, security, consultant, and analytics all grew in double-digits. This quarter we launched Cisco Connected Analytics Strategy to manage the exclusive growth of data at the edge of the networks. As the Internet of Everything evolves we forecast as much as 50% of the data will be handled and decisions will be made at the edge of the network. Given Cisco\u2019s position in the network, Cisco is the only company positioned to manage and capture the insight from distributive data. This has the potential to be an important growth area for Cisco and even more importantly to drive the value of the Internet of Everything. Let me now provide an update on Cisco\u2019s momentum in the cloud. Cisco\u2019s cloud strategy is pervasive throughout our portfolio. We continue to lead in the hybrid cloud market and our InterCloud momentum continues. As you look at our cloud business, I would look at the following metrics to track our success. First, Cisco\u2019s leadership in cloud infrastructure was once more reaffirmed with the release of the latest Synergy Group\u2019s research report showing we have retained and strengthened our number one position for sales of hardware and software used to build cloud infrastructure. Second, we are growing our cloud services, including managed security, project squared and collaboration, EnergyWise and Meraki for enterprise. Cisco and Telstra are now both in production with open stack-based public cloud services. And third, our InterCloud ecosystem continues to grow and now exceeds over 50 partners more than 400 data centers across more than 50 countries, Rob just a great job by your team and your leadership. Customers are using InterCloud fabric and ACI to implement highly secure and on-premise hybrid cloud capabilities across heterogeneous environment. To summarize my comments, our customer conversations today are not about standalone products, they are about new revenue streams, growth and outcomes, about securing and about managing their businesses, about how they have to reorganize to drive the innovation their survival requires. We are executing across our business because we are bringing together our product leadership in every category into architectures and solutions that deliver real outcomes. I will now turn the call over the Kelly for her comments on the quarter and guidance for the next quarter. Kelly, welcome and great to have you leading the conference call. Kelly Kramer : Thanks John. Overall, we had a strong quarter and executed well. From a top line perspective, total revenue was $11.9 billion, growing 7%. We grew profits faster than revenue with non-GAAP net income of $2.7 billion, up 9% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.53, up 13%. Our GAAP net income was $2.4 billion and GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis of $0.46. Product revenue increased 8% and service revenue increased 5% with product book to bill greater than one. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 28.4%. In our guidance last quarter we told you that we expected total non-GAAP gross margins to be in the range of 61% to 62%. For Q2, our total non-GAAP gross margins and non-GAAP product gross margins came in at 61.7% and 60.8% reflecting the mix of our business and especially the strength of UCS. Non-GAAP service gross margin was 64.8%. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.0 billion or 33.3% as a percentage of revenue compared to 34.1% in Q1 of fiscal year \u201815. Non-GAAP operating expenses were down 5% quarter-over-quarter and up 6% year-over-year, reflecting investments in key growth areas such as security, cloud and software. Our GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share for Q2 fiscal year \u201815 included a pretax gain of the $126 million or approximately $0.02 per share related to the reorganization of our investment VCE. This gain is excluded from our non-GAAP results. Now, moving on to our non-GAAP tax provision rate, which was 22% consistent with our expectations. In connection with the recently reinstated U.S. Federal R&D tax credit, we had a tax benefit of $91 million related to fiscal 2014 that we excluded from our non-GAAP net income. The extension of the R&D tax credit did not have a material impact on our non-GAAP tax rate during Q2 and is not expected to have a material impact on our non-GAAP tax rate for the remainder of fiscal \u201915 since the benefit only extended through December 31, 2014. We ended the quarter with our headcount at 70,112, a decrease of 2,135 from Q1. As a reminder, we took restructuring actions to invest in growth, innovation and talent, while managing costs and driving efficiencies. We announced and completed one acquisition during the quarter, Neohapsis, a provider of network and security consulting services to enhance our offerings to our customers. Looking at our geographic segment results, in terms of total revenue on a year-over-year basis, our Americas segment was up 10%, EMEA was up 7%, and APJC was down 3%. Total gross margin for the Americas was 62.0%, EMEA was 61.8%, and APJC was 60.3%. From a balance sheet and cash flow perspective, total cash, cash equivalents and investments were $53.0 billion, including a $3.2 billion available in the U.S. at the end of the quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $2.9 billion during the quarter. Deferred revenue was $14 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Product deferred revenue grew 14%, largely driven by subscription-based offerings, while services deferred revenue grew 2%. We continue to build the greater mix of recurring revenue as reflected in our deferred revenue balance. Our DSO was strong at 35 days as compared to 36 days in Q2 fiscal year \u201814. In Q2, we returned $2.2 billion to shareholders that included $1.2 billion through share repurchases and $974 million through our quarterly dividends. In the first half of fiscal year \u201815, we have returned approximately $4.2 billion or 86% of our free cash flow to our shareholders comprised of $2.2 billion of share repurchases and nearly $2 billion of dividends. In addition, today, our Board approved an increase of $0.02 to the quarterly dividend to $0.21 per share, an approximate 11% increase representing a yield of approximately 3.1%. We remain firmly committed to our capital allocation strategy. Let me now provide a few comments on our guidance for the third quarter. Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements and actual results could be above or below guidance. The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation to GAAP. As John mentioned, we expect total revenue to be in the range of 3% to 5% on a year-over-year basis. For the third quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 62%. And as we have said in the past, forecasting non-GAAP gross margin has always been challenging due to various factors such as volume, product mix, cost savings and pricing. As a reminder, non-GAAP gross margin may vary quarter-to-quarter by a point in either direction of our guidance range. Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 is expected to be in the range of 27.5% to 28.5%. Our non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be approximately 22% in the third quarter. Our Q3 \u201815 non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.51 to $0.53. We anticipate our GAAP earnings to be lower than our non-GAAP EPS by $0.09 to $0.12 per share in Q3 \u201815. The range includes a pre-tax charge of up to $100 million in Q3 \u201815 as a result of the restructuring actions that we announced in the first quarter. During Q2, we recognized a pre-tax charge in our GAAP financial statements of $69 million related to that announcement and we expect total charges not to exceed $600 million during fiscal year \u201815. Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for more detail. Other than those quantified items noted previously, there are no other significant differences between GAAP and our non-GAAP. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructurings and tax or other events, which may or may not be significant. Our guidance does not assume a significant improvement in the emerging markets or the service provider segment in the near future. Although we believe we are executing well in a rapidly transforming market, with these types of uncertainties in mind, we will continue to provide our guidance with all the appropriate caveats one quarter at a time. We encourage our shareholders to have similar considerations. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now hand it back to John for his summary comments. John Chambers : Thank you, Kelly. Our results this quarter which were the best results in three years in terms of balanced growth across all of our geographies, products, and segments reflects the increased relevancy of Cisco around the world. The Cisco brand is as strong as it\u2019s ever been. Our vision has always been to change the way the people work, live, play and learn. And you have heard us say this for nearly 20 years digitization is the next and perhaps the most significant evolution of our vision. At CES, 15 years ago, we showed a network car Wi-Fi enabled and connected to a coffee shop, so you could order your own drinks and make changes to that. Fast forward to several years ago, we introduced the market to the Internet of Everything. While the concepts were thought leadership for many years, this year companies and countries are seeing the Internet of Everything as a business imperative and top priority. To take advantage of the Internet of Everything, every country, company, city, home and car has to be digital. The single most important investments are at the center of their digital business and technology strategy for our customers and at the center of that will be the intelligent network from the data center to the edge through the cloud, all brought together with an end to end security and Cisco is never ever been better positioned. In the 90s when companies need to get online on the Internet Cisco was the thought leader, the company with the product leadership and the best example of a company capitalizing on the all the transitions. Our customers wanted our help and to follow our example. Fast forward to today, the next generation of the Internet, the Internet of Everything should generate at least 5 to 10 times the value of the first generation of the Internet to-date. Again no one is better positioned than Cisco in terms of strategy, market position, product leadership, architectures and organization structure. I am not sure those outside Cisco appreciate the magnitude of the changes we have implemented over the last year largely because of our ability to continue to deliver to long-term value to our customers and to out shareholders despite the challenges in the market. Most companies wait to change until they have to. When it\u2019s obvious and it\u2019s often game over and those companies get left behind. In the last year, we were willing to disrupt our leadership position for example in switching and routing by introducing entirely new platforms. We knew, we'd see a short-term impact but told the market how we would grow. Once again, we did what we said we would do. This is just one of many examples and these are exactly the hard decisions our customers, employees, partners and shareholders have trusted us to make so we can lead in this market transitions. I want to congratulate and thank the Cisco team for believing in the vision and executing one of the most successful company transformations the industry has witnessed. Very few companies could do what we have done with the speed and the results we have driven and the opportunity we created for ourselves is truly exciting and in many ways just getting started. Our transformational work will continue as we help our customers digitize everything, secure everything and organize their companies, their governments, their businesses for the Internet of Everything because of the agility we built into our organization and our ability to align directly with our customer\u2019s goals, we are helping our customers with their business outcomes and let me very direct here. We're winning very large service provider, enterprise and public sector deals that we would not have won just as recently as one year ago. We do see our competitors struggling and no we are not immune from economic or other challenges in the market. While we believe we have positioned the company better than any of our peers, we do still see the same challenges we had discussed in the past few quarters specifically emerging markets and service providers as continuing to provide a negative drag for the next few quarters. What I believe the market now understands is that Cisco is managing effectively through a challenging macro leading through transitions, disrupting markets, increasing our relevancy with our customers and delivering value to our shareholders. Looking forward, we\u2019ve laid an incredibly exciting foundation for future growth, innovation and leadership. Reinventing the network with application centric infrastructure, a platform at the very early stages of its future potential. Our leadership and security, the most important topic in IT today in many ways. Our emerging role in data and analytics at the edge and how we will bring all this together to enable the Internet of Everything. We have our stakes in the ground to capture tremendous opportunities in front of us and are well on our way to becoming the number one IT company. The momentum in the business feels extremely good and we are excited about the opportunities ahead. We will now move, Mel, to what I enjoy the most which is the Q&A section and it\u2019s over to you Mel and I will try to keep my answers tight and I will do better this time. Melissa Selcher : Okay. Operator, can we please open for questions? Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS. Amitabh Passi : Hi, guys. I had maybe sort of two half questions. John, I guess the first one for you, services gross margin probably came in at the lowest level that we have seen in a few quarters. I was hoping you could maybe elaborate on what\u2019s happening there? And then just secondarily, on your security business, I know you have sounded very bullish on security and the momentum. 6% seemed a little disappointing, would love to get some clarity there? John Chambers : Got it. So, Amitabh, I like the way that you went. We probably had eight or nine areas that we are very close to the highest growth rate we have had in two areas and you are focusing me on the two challenges more than fair. So, let\u2019s go to the issue of services gross margins. If you watch, we start with a big picture. Our revenue growth areas, what is our gross margins, our OpEx, Kelly and I have a lot of leverage we can pull within that. Within the gross margins, we have never been more comfortable. And actually I said that\u2019s almost three or four quarters ago, Mel. I have never been more comfortable with any aspect of our business than our ability to maintain gross margins. It\u2019s a mixed issue as you go through it. To the services question, we have had great services gross margins unequalled in the industry. Gary, our technical services, what you and Joe Pinto have done is amazing there. Our advanced services is an area that we are moving very aggressively in and that\u2019s where you see all little bit of the pull down on the services model. And as you become outcome-based, as you refocus on these new growth areas being able to literally digitize a country, digitize a city, digitize a manufacturing company a healthcare company etcetera, you saw us invest an awful lot in vertical consultancy, you saw us invest in security in a big way with major expectations in terms of expertise centers, etcetera and in cloud. So, we are going to continue to make investments in these areas and I am very comfortable with our gross margin portfolio. I actually think our gross margins, has been the most predictable part of our total business, although we have a lot of various variables in that. On security, security will occasionally be bumpy. We reorganized our realization and realigned security across the whole globe with a separate sales force. As you make those changes, you occasionally lose a little bit of momentum before you pick it up. The order growth was actually at 9% for security. I expect security to grow very healthily as we move forward and you will continue to see us make a number of both resource investments in areas like services, sales investments to really lead in that and consultancy in a way that really brings this picture to light, but I think you are going to see good growth out of our security business. I think we are positioned extremely well and I kind of in a fun way challenge you. When an enterprise customer has 45 to 60 security players in the environment, how many they really have? And you look at a CEO in the eye and I get it done. We have got to consolidate this in the networks where it\u2019s going to get consolidated. So, very comfortable in terms of our security growth over time, do not see any issues in terms of strategy, vision or margins here. Melissa Selcher : Great, thanks Amitabh. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian Modoff from Deutsche Bank. Brian Modoff : Hi, John, I would like to talk about Meraki. You had obviously good numbers $400 million annual run-rate. At Cisco Live, you announced that you were expanding it out to a broader range of customers. Can you talk a little bit about that and what that might do to the growth there and how this might affect your overall margin mix as you continue to say you are comfortable with where that\u2019s headed? John Chambers : Sure. So, Meraki overall, Kelly keep me honest here, very good margins. We are very comfortable with that. When you begin to look at a company that is now at $400 million run-rate and grow to the 100%, I mean, that\u2019s harder than almost any startups in the industry with great gross margins. And what Rob is doing in leadership on cloud and what Nick is doing with our service providers and what we are seeing is a continued leverage of the Meraki type of vision for how we grow our resources and how we grow our relevance to our customers. Rob, would like to add some to that? Rob Lloyd : I would just add that we are expanding globally with recent additions of Meraki presence in EMEA as well as building out in Europe. They are not \u2013 there is no margin impact. It\u2019s a very profitable business model and we did expand and announced the expansion of the Meraki portfolio at Cisco Live in Milan in January, which will see an expansion of the enterprise offer, including a really neat mobile device manager. So, profitable platform John growing very, very quickly to 100% and geographic expansion is part of that model. John Chambers : Got it. It\u2019s a nice way of saying. This is really hot, it\u2019s going to Kelly, be one of our better acquisitions, but then you turn to Sourcefire which was the other big one we did in the last year and a half. It\u2019s literally on fire too. Thanks, Mil. Melissa Selcher : Very good. John Chambers : Yes, she is not so sure. Thanks, Brian. Melissa Selcher : Thanks, Brian. Operator, next question. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Simona Jankowski : Hi, thanks very much. So, you had obviously a good quarter and good guidance, but John, your tone seems even more bullish than kind of the numbers would suggest? And I mean, I couldn\u2019t count how many times you said that you have never been better positioned. And I just wanted to see if you can just provide another layer of detail behind that. So, just let us understand better what\u2019s behind that tone? I think you kind of referenced some large deals in the U.S. with enterprises, service providers, public sector and I noticed your deferred was up 6%, but the long-term deferred, even though short-term looks flat. So, are there large multi-year deals in there that are giving you that kind of a bullish outlook? John Chambers : Simona, it literally is across the board. And we see this in every country, every segment of our business, even those that are challenged like emerging markets and service provider, we make huge inroads because of the momentum we have gained. Mel told me not to be too enthusiastic on the call. I went out and ran 4 miles this morning. I had my best time. And as the last year lifted weight successor and I am sorry, Mel, just full of energy, it is exciting what\u2019s in front of us. And when you sit across from the customers, you could have been at with and I could take this to our shareholders. Anybody who walked out of with 21 of the sessions were about Cisco related areas from what you are going to do with infrastructure to digitizing countries, to cities, to how you bring this to bear and how does it affect the environment, we are right in the middle. And in so many different ways, we are not just in thought leadership no one can compete individual pinpoint products are going to get killed in this marketplace. And the different competitive models that you see evolving or different models we saw coming for 4 to 5 years, so yes, I feel really good and the only area that I would be critical was we got to do better in service provider video and we do have a portfolio like we have in customer segments and products, it feels good. But to your point, our relevance in major government bids and major enterprise bids, we are winning bids that we would not have come close to in a year ago. And it isn\u2019t just we are running from the beginning, we have got an ability to adjust in engineering and sales and services to meet their needs as we are not \u2013 we are taking to competitors. It really feels good and it\u2019s really fine. See you tomorrow by the way, Simona. Looking forward to be on stage with you. Go easy on your questions, tomorrow. Melissa Selcher : Alright. Thanks, Simona. Operator, next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : Thanks very much. Hey, good afternoon. Just quick question, you said that you are expecting a turn in service provider and emerging markets not for at least several more quarters. Others have indicated that they thought we could see a rebound in service provider spending maybe in the next couple of quarters. Just wondering what\u2019s making you a bit more cautious than that? And I guess trying to gauge your level of confidence that you can really see your service provider and emerging market businesses rebound, I guess exiting this year and going into 2016? Thanks. John Chambers : So, let\u2019s start with the overall premise. My premise on service providers is you are going to see negative growth in terms of CapEx for this year, with a lot of the experts saying it\u2019s actually going to be uglier in the next six months than it will at the back half of the year. So, our assumption is any gain in service providers will be share wallet gain and market share gains. What makes me very, very bullish on this is on the things we can control if you watch what Nick Adamo, heads up sales, Kelly Ahuja that Nike have done services Kelly is engineering. We are now winning big service provider deals that we would not even have been in the game in a year or two ago. And our ability to do this at a different margin level, our agility on this and we are taking it to our competitors and you are seeing this across the board. I would have vastly preferred it. You can never do it exactly how you want, but having had five quarters of 10% or more negative service provider growth, I would rather go on from negative 10% to negative 5% or 6% to negative 1% then positive went up from there. We have got a couple of deals writing this quarter, which caused us to go from minus 10% to minus 1%. That\u2019s more than I think anybody else anticipated in the marketplace, especially when you have areas like SP video, which drives you down by 2 to 3 points off of that. I just didn\u2019t want the market getting ahead of us. My comfort level with seeing growth this by the end of the year and probably that is extremely good in this market, but I am modeling all wallet share gains and market share gains. I do not think service provider CapEx will be up this year. I hope I am wrong, in which case we will get more of our share there. So, I feel very, very good into positioning. Was there second question on this? Okay, thanks James. Melissa Selcher : Alright. Thanks, Simona. Operator, next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Rod Hall : Yes, hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess the first one I wanted to start with was switching the quarter-on-quarter\u2026. John Chambers : Go ahead. Rod Hall : Sorry, can you guys hear me? John Chambers : Yes. Rod Hall : Yes. So, the quarter-on-quarter trajectory is switching seasonally a little bit more than normal about down 6% quarter-on-quarter, if our math is right, in the average a little bit below 3% over the last 5 years. So, the last year there was some Osborne Effect ahead of 9K, just wondering if you guys could comment on color there I mean what might have driven that seasonality, did we some FX impact, just normal seasonality from your point of view, etcetera. And then also John I know you are lifting weights and running doing all the stuff, could you just give us an update on your tenure at Cisco, I mean it doesn\u2019t\u2019 sound like you are in the mood to retire, but could you just give us kind of an update on what your plan there is? Thanks. John Chambers : The next time you hear Rod about any talk about the change will be when we announce that, that hasn\u2019t changed overall. We have got an amazing team with several of the players around this table being examples now that and we will make this a non-issue as we make the transition. To the first part of the question, no I disagree with your basic premise. We don\u2019t give booking by category, by seasonality. But if you watch our normal booking trends and if you watch where we have gone and let\u2019s use total bookings as an example. From Q1 to Q2, it was up at the very high end of our seasonality bookings sequentially and the year-over-year numbers. So either way you want to measure it, we are in good shape on that. I do agree with several of you premises in terms of the 9K growth, it feels very, very good. Rod you got to know I completely disagree dramatically with your comment about our switching products commoditizing. They are going in the opposite way. This is one that I think you are going to see us get our competitors very aggressively. And even in merchant silicon like Nexus 3000, we are doing extremely well in terms of growth in gross margins. It\u2019s an architectural play now. We saw this coming 4.5 years ago with switching you got to have security, you got to have collaboration, it\u2019s got to integrate to processor capability, it\u2019s got to tie the Internet of Everything. There has to be a architecture that brings us together, business results and I think are relevant in our value to the customers are exact opposite way. We have shown remarkable consistency in switching gross margins. And I feel very, very good about our future in that regard. Kelly Kramer : Thanks Rod. Operator, next question. Operator : And your next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets. John Chambers : Hi Mark. Mark Sue : How are you? The gross margin improvements and the cash returns was a major driver and your stocks outperformance last year, so I am trying to understand the opportunities ahead on top of the ongoing improvements you have made to-date. For example, I know that it\u2019s a multi-year progress, but the progress in terms of becoming a software company maybe if can give us an update there and your go to market. And as it relates to your financials maybe thoughts on future cash flow, returns to investors considering free cash flow is now on parity with net income? John Chambers : Got it. So I am going to let Kelly take the other part on thoughts about cash and where we are going Kelly and our overall and I don\u2019t mind you even comment a little bit about the programs we have on gross margins through that. And on the first part giving out that question the first question Mr. Mark was. Kelly Kramer : Just what the strength in gross margins last year was\u2026 John Chambers : Okay. So we have leverage in every single category. If you watch what we are doing whether it\u2019s operating expenses, whether it\u2019s the gross margins by products, products and switching, funding areas that don\u2019t have as good a gross margin picture to gain momentum, etcetera. And there is leverage really everywhere. We are seeing no unusual competition in the market, no unusual competition with white label or white box, nor will we in the future. We saw that coming as I said a long time ago, wins on architectures and this whole call literally is about that. So I feel very good about our total gross margin mix. We will absolutely be aggressive when we want to move consulting, as an example to play a much larger role in business outcomes. And our ability to have multiple leverage that we can catch on I think feels very, very good. We are going to invest in some of the areas and we are going to do a large part of it literally what we said earlier. Moving 40% of our resources around in a year is almost unheard of and then literally unfortunately taking down 6,000 people in backup, 6,000 people with the different skill sets speaks to the agility we have in the market. Kelly your thoughts? Kelly Kramer : Yes, I mean to answer your question Mark on our cash as you can to tell our commitment to the capital allocation hasn\u2019t changed as evidenced by giving back 86% of our free cash flow back as a dividend and the buyback and as well as increasing our dividend going forward. So that\u2019s not changing. We are extremely focused on increasing our cash flow. And to John\u2019s point focused on driving that through improvements in our margin both in gross margin and operating margin. So that focus will continue and we still have lots of flexibility with our balance sheet to continue the balance of giving back to our shareholders as well as having that flexibility strategically for M&A and other investments. John Chambers : Gary, you and Kelly are working jointly on gross margins any additional thoughts? Gary Moore : Yes. I mean so Mark I think we have demonstrated our ability to manage the gross margins and pull the levers and the different things that we have those haven\u2019t gone away. The investments we are making in value \u2013 design value engineering that gets \u2013 keep on giving. And we have double down our efforts so we will keep going. We are going through functional transformation. John pointed out $0.06 for every $1 of revenue over the last 3.5 years, 4 years. And I think we can continue to do that. So it\u2019s about freeing up the assets to reinvest in the growth areas for the future and we are doing that spot on. And we are looking at this for the long-term. John Chambers : And Mark and I was probably going to assume laps around here before I answer the question. But if you watch what changes architectures save our customers huge amount of operating expense. It allows them to get their business outcomes much quicker. And when you combine an architecture like data center with an architecture like InterCloud, with an architecture like collaboration, with an architecture like security, with architectures about big data edge of the network with mobility we can do that in a way that no one else can to get business outcomes. Customers will pay probably 3% to 5% - excuse me 3 to 5 times more per business outcome than they will for a standalone switch or standalone router. So as we make that transition this is where you re-see our relevance change. And this why when you talk about digitizing countries or digitizing cities we are all by ourselves and our ability to do it, it\u2019s about how we bring all those together in the Internet of Everything and that has great gross margins. That\u2019s where I think the market need to do a better job mill of explaining to the market why our gross margins and why we are so optimistic about our future if we do it right. Kelly Kramer : Great. Thanks Mark. Operator, next question. Operator : And your next question comes from Itai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Itai Kidron : Thanks and congrats guys on great execution on the quarter. Following up on this last point of gross margin John looking at the regional gross margin it seems like Europe was certainly standout we haven\u2019t seen that gross margin that poor since I have to go all the way back 2011, was that just a function of FX meaning with the move and that is depressing in dollars you had to do a little bit more active discounting in order to get the volume that you need, how do we think about that? John Chambers : Yes. A fair question, I think Europe is a great example. First of all, Europe was 7% growth which I don\u2019t think anybody else is getting. You take Russia absence it would have been 9% growth. But you did see remarkable growth across many big countries where they are really being impacted by foreign exchange, etcetera. The way we look at foreign exchange we do business in dollars as most of you know on that. So we perhaps can\u2019t draw the correlation as quickly as now this. But it does mean the deal size may not be as large where it does mean that there might be pressure on discounts to provide a total solution. And when you us grow at 20% across Southern Europe I mean I am not aware of anybody else that is growing in Southern Europe period much less of those type of numbers. It speaks to our strategy working. Foreign exchange does have some impact on it. And Kelly maybe if you would like to add some addition to that. Kelly Kramer : Yes. Just to add to the Itai from a pricing perspective actually our pricing is in line, our normal quarter-on-quarter pricing as well as the year-over-year if I look over the last 6 quarters. So we haven\u2019t really seen that increase on discounting. But we did see drive in the margins in Europe is definitely the mix of our strength in our UCS is a big, big driver of it. Melissa Selcher : Operator next question. Operator : And your next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Tal Liani : I have a question on switching, great growth, the question is can you distinguish between plain, vanilla upgrades just because you have new platforms. And between really changes to the architecture of data centers one has a short cycle, one has a longer cycle, longer impact on the company. Is there anyway we can look at it, think about our side, is there anyway we can have evidence that the cycle is longer rather than shorter when it comes to switching? Thanks. John Chambers : I think the data center switching cycle is a very, very long one I think we would all agree with in scale. And even though we will face new competitors white label etcetera in this market we saw that as I said coming a long time ago and this is where it is and about switching the data center it\u2019s about convergence about switching with storage with servers, with security even within the data center. And then the ability with application centric infrastructure to run that and the data center or a cloud in the wane all the way to the edge and that\u2019s about applications again with the network with security, with scale. You combine those two and we are almost unbeatable in the approach. You do have a natural upgrade cycle with new products coming in. And there was probably a little bit of a stall when we stalled ourselves a year ago deliberately and we knew what we are doing, but we need it to transition to the new ion switching and needed to signal people where we are going. There are additional drivers we are starting to win network refresh and some competitors refresh purely because of security. In this environment they are going to risk and this where we are just going to I can\u2019t say crush, I think there is white label. This is where we are going to really crush the white people. I mean, it\u2019s got to be a security architecture type of approach. If you just say, I am going to get merchant silicon and throw software on top of it and run data centers and run WANs and everything, all it takes is one breach and you have done more damage to your brand is it company or is it government, then you could in 100 years of saving on a little bit of switching difference and that\u2019s before you get to the outcomes in terms of the direction. Now, is switching going to grow double-digits? Of course, not, but I think more down to the mid single-digits and we will go up and down depending on the quarter. There will be a different mix in the data center versus campus. Melissa Selcher : Great. Thanks, Tal. Operator, next question. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Benjamin Reitzes with Barclays Capital. Benjamin Reitzes : Hey, thanks a lot guys. Can you talk about the new relationship you have with the VCE? Is there any change? The data center numbers were very good, but I was wondering if there is any impact on switching in the quarter and do you see yourself partner strategy changing and getting more robust perhaps with some other partners with what\u2019s going on with that, that could be material to revenue going forward? Thanks a lot. John Chambers : Yes, Ben. Let me ask you direct question in the second one that you didn\u2019t ask me which I know is on people\u2019s minds as well. In terms of BCE, we have a very good relationship with EMC. I look for that to be continued very strong. Gary, you are our key interface there. You and Howard and Joe and I all the time go back and forth. VMware is a competitor. We view them as a competitor. We are going to beat them as a competitor and we will beat them and have fun doing it. I wish I was a better person, but I am not. And we are going to take it to a bunch of our competitors and I think you like the projects that you are going to continue to see there. We are however going to continue to partner with NetApp, which is a great relationship almost no competitive overlap and we announced what we are doing with IBM. And I think to the second part of your question, when we talk about pace of change, it means that your strategic partnerships and the Wall Street Journal had an article, I think before December that talked about the role of strategic partnerships will dramatically change and this will be customer partnerships as well. We will be dramatically different looking out over the next several years and determine a company\u2019s success or not in ways they haven\u2019t in the past. And part of that pace of change is you are going to have at times even very good customers, very good partners go into our area, we are at the center of every transition, so, anytime anybody makes a networking announcement they are going to say either with Cisco or doesn\u2019t and you are going to see our evolution of our partners go on that. Having said that, you will see us do more strategic partnering, much deeper with many, many partners such as players like Rockville that you might have not thought it before or GE or players that we are literally closer to in terms of the direction here. Relationship with EMC is very, very good. We like them. They like us and we two have lot of business together. I think Gary the run-rate was 50% year-over-year growth together plus some. Gary Moore : Plus some and it\u2019s a strong relationship and the partnership has all the elements it does before. We have just restructured with them. John Chambers : Okay, thank you Ben. Melissa Selcher : Thanks, Ben. Operator next question. Operator : Thank you. We have our next question from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. John Chambers : Hey, Simon. Simon Leopold : Hey, John, thank you for all the detail as usual. I wanted to follow-up on the VCE relationship in terms of how it affects your business from a modeling perspective. As I understand it, you do sell a significant amount of the UCS products and maybe some switching products through that channel. If you could help us put that into perspective as to how significant that is as a source of revenue for the UCS? And then in terms of below the sales levels, I understand that you have some benefits exiting the VCE that you are not incurring the expenses you had been in the partnership? Can you help us understand the implications of this from a both revenue as well as operating expense perspective? John Chambers : Yes. If I were to summarize the revenue perspective, it\u2019s a very good one for us, just like NetApp is. The growth rates are unbelievable. Our field sales teams, the EMC\u2019s sales team and the Cisco sales team you often get some of the difference between them out in the field in terms of how they come together. It\u2019s very, very good for us and we feel very good growth from that relationship. And by the way the same is true with the other partners we have alluded to in terms of the direction. So, I think what you are seeing is just an evolution of a partnership model and some competition versus VMware, which is I think the world we live in today. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen & Company. John Chambers : Hey, Paul. Paul Silverstein : Hi, good evening. One clarification, I think it\u2019s obvious from your previous comments, but I just want to make sure I understood. The traditional breakout you gave us between pricing and productivity improvement volume, etcetera, it appears and again I just want to confirm that the rate of price erosion did not change from the trend we have seen recently and same thing with your rate of productivity improvement. Can you give us the numbers if you have them? John Chambers : Kelly? Kelly Kramer : Yes, hi, Paul. So we don\u2019t see that in our Q filing but I can tell you, the range, the ranges that we typically see on a quarter-on-quarter basis has been in the range over the last six quarters from half a percentage point impact on gross margin up to over a point and a half and we are well on the\u2014we are basically in the middle of that range and year-over-year in the middle of the range as well when I look over six quarter. So you will see that when we have our 10-Q filing. John Chambers : You know if I look and Mel has given me that I am out of time, so I wish we could do a couple more questions. I want to just summarize with, I have never felt better about our business and our future. We are as many of you have already said, we are back and this movie I have seen before and I wish I could just bottle with and I wish I could bottle the conversations that we have with government leaders and business leaders and how different than before it\u2019s just not one product area, it\u2019s how we can bring architectures together with services in a different sales motion. We had the courage to disrupt our sales starting three years ago and we did a huge amount of organizational evolution over the last year that allowed us to do fast innovation and agility and speed with which others cannot meet. There is no surprises to us in the market, and I mean none at the present time. It\u2019s playing out very much like we expected. It\u2019s a world that pace of change will go exponentially but as you walk away just kind of think about it. You are executing extremely well at healthy growth. Digitization would be ten times I think, we will say five to ten, to keeping solid. The impact of Internet of Everything really affects every country, every citizen in the world and every company. Our product portfolio across the board you saw all but one area increases nice when I get beat up on just 6% growth, I mean that is a pleasant position to be in Kelly probably one we won\u2019t always experience as nicely as that. The balance geographically and even our headwind areas while we\u2019ve signaled there will be a couple of more quarters to work through, showed a lot of progress and that means we are positioned as they eventually turn an emerging markets which they will and there will always be challenges in a group like China and Russia and Brazil but the rest of them feel heading the right direction pretty well and if you watch where we are doing in terms of our product leadership in each category and then integrating them together with architectures feels good, so I get bumped up. It hasn\u2019t changed and I hope that came across the pace of change and the new competitors and new challenges is something that will change will drop exponentially, I believe we are going to become the number one IT company and our goal was to show you that and get the reward our shareholders, our customers, employees deserve. Mel, back to you. Melissa Selcher : Great, thanks.

At the request of Cisco Systems, today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I would like to introduce Melissa Selcher, Vice President of Corporate Communication and Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Thanks, Kim. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our 101th quarterly conference call. This is Melissa Selcher, and I'm joined by John Chambers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Kelly Kramer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rob Lloyd, President of Development and Sales; Gary Moore, President and Chief Operating Officer; and our future CEO, Chuck Robbins. I would like to remind you that we have a corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information that will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheet, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found on the Investor Relations website. Click on the Financial Reporting section of the website to access these documents. Throughout this call we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements and as such are subject to risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Form 10-K and Forms 10-Q and any applicable amendments which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements. Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise. As we have in the past, we will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer segment results in terms of product orders unless specifically stated otherwise. I'll now turn it over to John for his commentary on the quarter. John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Mel, thank you very much. I am pleased resort another very solid quarter for Cisco. We delivered revenues of $12.1 billion, up 5%, and grew non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.54, up 6%. We maintained strong non-GAAP gross margins of 62.5%, generated $3.0 billion in operating cash flow this quarter, and returned $2.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Last week was a great week for us as we announced the CEO who will lead Cisco in its next chapter. I am extremely excited to be joined today by Cisco's newly named CEO, Chuck Robbins. Chuck, welcome very much. Charles H. Robbins - CEO Designate, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Field Operations & Director: Thanks, John. John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I am confident you will come to understand why the Cisco Board of Directors and I are so convinced he is the right leader for Cisco right now. As I reflect back, I'm extremely honored and proud to have led Cisco for the last 20-plus years. We set out to change the way the world works, lives, learns, and plays. And while many thought this was a very ambitious and not unobtainable goal, we absolutely have achieved that goal. We have delivered incredible innovation and have disrupted markets and at times ourselves. We have seen many competitors come and go. We've had our setbacks but always come back even stronger, something almost no other technology company has done. We have remained incredibly focused on delivering for our shareholders. We are a cash and profit machine and have maintained our margins over time by delivering sustainable differentiation through integrated architectures based on intelligent networks. What I am most proud of, however, is how well positioned we are to repeat the success of this last 20 years. Across every market and every industry, we are moving from the information age to the digital age, and the pace of change is only accelerating. Cisco is a very strong leadership position. Our vision and strategy are working as every company, city, and country becomes digital. They are realizing Cisco is best positioned to help them as they become digital organizations. What our customers recognize is Cisco's unique track record and ability to anticipate transitions and deliver the innovation to help our customers adapt and accelerate in this new environment. Cisco's sustainable differentiation over time, as reflected in our strong gross margins, profitability, and cash generation, is the result of our ability to deliver integrated architectures and solutions with scale, speed, and security no one else can. We've moved from selling boxes, cloud, mobility, or any other solution to partner with customers on their outcomes; 44,000 jobs in Barcelona, education and healthcare accessible to virtually every home in Israel, entirely new cloud-based revenue streams for service providers, and General Motors' smart factory of the future. Competitors selling low-cost technology building blocks can't compete with our total cost advantage, operational efficiency, security, and speed to results that Cisco provides. And when there is an issue, we have all seen the nightmare of trying to identify where and who to call translate in billions in lost business and reputational damages. When companies and countries go digital, IT becomes a board-level concern; and reliability, security, trust matter more than ever. The Cisco brand behind every one of our architectures matters more now than ever. We are seeing our moves from selling boxes to selling outcomes translate into strong execution in a tough global market. We are seeing many areas of strength, including global enterprise with order growth of 7%, global commercial orders up 6%, and global public sector orders up 7%. The U.S. excluding service provider was particularly strong, with Brian Marlier's U.S. enterprise order growth of 21%, U.S. commercial order growth of 11%, and U.S. public sector order growth of 10%. We saw good revenue growth across almost all of our technologies. The volatility in service provider and emerging markets we have discussed in prior quarters continues. Our service provider business remains challenged both globally and in the U.S. Service provider orders globally decreased 7% and U.S. service provider orders declined 17%. Emerging market orders were flat, with the BRICs plus Mexico down 6%, while the remaining emerging markets grew 6%. I believe we have organized well to capture more than our share in these markets and positioned ourselves for their inevitable upturns. Like every other company, we're also managing the impact of currency fluctuations globally. Kelly and I are both very pleased with the focus of the whole company on maintaining stable gross margins in this environment. We were especially pleased with how the sales teams have held gross margins in a very tough foreign exchange environment. Repeating the common theme, those critics that felt new software or business models would have a major negative impact on our business and our margins were just wrong. Clearly there are more positives than headwinds, and I am very pleased with our solid execution. At a time when many of our peers are seeing revenues decline, we delivered profitable growth, as we said we would, and over-delivered almost on every metric we set. Now I will move on to guidance. I continue to be pleased with our execution in a tough environment, the strength of our financial model, and the return we continue to drive for our shareholders. For Q4, we expect to see revenue growth in the range of 1% to 3% and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.55 to $0.57. Let me now provide some additional details on the business momentum we see in our geographies, customer segments, and product and services business within our portfolio. As a reminder, geographies are the primary way we run our business. For geographies and customer segments, I will speak in terms of product orders year over year unless otherwise noted. We finished the quarter with product orders up 2% and product book-to-bill of greater than one. Moving first to the Americas, the Americas grew in total 2%. I discussed up front the U.S. public sector growth of 10%, with the U.S. federal growth of 24% and state and local up 1%. We also discussed the very strong U.S. enterprise growth of 21% and U.S. commercial growth of 11%. And the U.S. service provider was down 17%. Latin America had another strong double-digit growth quarter. Moving on to Europe, Middle East, and Africa, we saw Europe, Middle East, and Africa growth of 2%. Europe first turned up for us five quarters ago, and since then has averaged mid-single-digit growth, including this quarter. If you take out Russia, we saw solid growth across all of Europe, Middle East, and Africa of 4%. We were pleased to see Asia-Pacific, Japan, and China return to growth, growing 1%; and just to give you an idea of what sometimes the emerging markets have an impact on in terms of our business, with Asia-Pacific, Japan, and China minus China growing at 8%. And finally, emerging countries; emerging markets in total were flat. The emerging markets excluding BRICs plus Mexico grew 6%. As discussed, we continue to see the BRICs plus Mexico challenged, down 6% in total, with Russia down 41%, Brazil down 10%, and China down 20%. We did see strong growth in Mexico, up 53%, and India up 6%. We are modeling the volatility in emerging markets to continue for several more quarters. Now moving on to customer segments, we discussed the strong growth of total global enterprise, up 7%, with total global commercial up 6% and global public sector up 7%. The new models we have implemented globally in each of these segments are working. In enterprise, the shift to selling outcomes, not products, is resulting in larger opportunities and dramatic increases in pipeline. In U.S. enterprise, for example, the value of our pipeline of deals over $1 million increased approximately 60% year over year, with the average deal size up over 30%. We are managing continued challenges in our service provider business, which declined 7%, as global service provider CapEx remained under pressure and industry consolidation continues. We believe the organizational changes we have made in our global service provider organization are working, and we are very focused on growing our share of wallet. At Mobile World Congress earlier this year, we issued announcements with over 10 global service providers, including the launch of Cloud VP and service with Deutsche Telekom, Connected Car service with AT&T, and a small sales solution for large enterprise deployments with Vodafone. Now moving on the products and service, I will discuss products and service business in terms of revenue year over year unless otherwise stated. Starting with switching, we saw another solid quarter in switching, with growth of 6%. The strong momentum of our application-centric infrastructure portfolio continues. The Nexus 3000 plus Nexus 9000 grew 144%. We added over 970 new Nexus 9000 customers and ACI customers this quarter, to reach a total over 2,650 customers. The 8-bit controller customers grew from over 300 last quarter to 580 this quarter. Nexus 9000 orders plus ASIC grew sequentially 27%, and we expect that sequential growth to accelerate in Q4. We also saw good momentum in our campus portfolio, especially in fixed. We did see some pressure in our modular switching as we managed the transition in the high end of our switching portfolio. As we've discussed, we expect this transition to continue for a few more quarters. I am particularly pleased that we have kept gross margins extremely stable in switching, even as we are driving our product transition in the data center. Moving on to the data center, UCS momentum continues with over $3 billion in revenue run rate, with over 43,800 UCS customers. The number of repeat UCS customers grew 34% year over year. The innovation UCS brought to the market, an architecture that converges networking servers and storage, has disrupted the market, and Cisco went from nowhere to the market share leader in x86 blades in the U.S. and the number two player worldwide, with more than 85% of the Fortune 500 companies now investing in UCS. We continue to see significant growth with our converged offerings, including VCE and FlexPod, in addition to the positive initial ramp with our IBM VersaStack solution. We had a solid quarter in NGN routing, which grew 4%. We saw solid performance in high-end routing again this quarter, up 5%, supported by strong momentum in our new product introductions, including the CRS-X and NCS, which were both up over 200%. This growth is a direct result of the transition we drove in our core routing over the last several years. During the quarter, Verizon announced it is moving to a next-generation 100-gig Metro network in the U.S. and that it will test and deploy Cisco networking convergence systems, the NCS. No one thought we were even in this game. Our ability to win the deal was entirely driven by our new generation in terms of engineering organization, our ability to deliver integrated architectures, our agility with engineering to realign resources quickly, the speed of our innovation, and our unique ability to partner with our customer to shape their future and the future of the industry. Moving on to wireless, we saw solid growth of 9%. Meraki continued with just very strong momentum, up 92% year over year, and it drove most of our growth this quarter in the wireless category, as they add new customers to their cloud-managed wireless platform. We did see some softness in the public sector wireless spending, driven primarily by E-Rate funding timing. Security growth rebounded to a strong 14%, with orders growing even faster. We saw a number of strong trends and data points that support our strategy to drive to an integrated security architecture across our customers' organizations. Customers are realizing that dozens of security vendors hinder business by not solving their challenges. As everything in the world becomes digital, they want a player who can step up and be their trusted partner across the board. No one is better positioned than Cisco. We believe we are the only player capable of providing an integrated architecture across intelligent networks and are confident in our strategy to be the number one security company for our customers. A few examples of our momentum include in this quarter we signed a record number of security enterprise license agreements. Our FirePOWER series, which integrates our Sourcefire software, are continuing to show very strong momentum, far exceeding our initial forecasts. And we saw continued strong traction and growth in our advanced threat solutions, including Advanced Malware Protection Everywhere and Cyber Threat Defense. Moving on to collaboration, our collaboration momentum continues, with revenue growth of 7%. This quarter was a strong quarter for TelePresence end points, with revenue up 19% and unit orders up a record 66%. The team is on a mission to put collaboration into every office and every room. Our strategy is to deliver a new generation of product experiences at significantly lower prices, and it is working. We also saw strong performance of our cloud-based offerings, with conferencing growth of 11%. More people than ever are using WebEx, with the number of billable users growing over 28% to over 15 million users. In the quarter, we launched Spark for Teams, which is proving to be a strong play in the very hot business messaging market. SP video declined 5%. We continue to focus on improving profitability in this business as we develop next-generation end-to-end video solutions combining hardware, software, and services. Services revenue grew 3%, with orders growing faster than revenue. We saw growth in both technical and advanced services. And our portfolio of cloud, security, consulting, and analytics grew in double digits again this quarter. Our gross margins continue to lead the industry by a significant amount and remain very stable in terms of services gross margin, in the 65% range plus or minus a point or two. We continue to believe our strategy to provide higher value to our customers by delivering business outcomes is working. The opportunities that are ahead of us as we move into the Internet of Everything [IOE] are very real. We look at the increased security requirements and the demand for security consultancy services. We also focused on the need to manage and capture insights for data distribution across the enterprise and network. We are moving rapidly to build the capabilities across our portfolio to differentiate Cisco's leadership in the Internet of Everything. Now let me provide an update on Cisco's momentum in cloud. We continue to lead in the hybrid cloud market and increase our intercloud momentum. This quarter we launched Phase 2 of our intercloud strategy, linking different clouds together using interoperable and app-centric software to create hybrid clouds. Rob, thank you so much for your leadership here; your team is doing a great job. Robert W. Lloyd - President-Development & Sales: You're welcome. John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : During the quarter we announced Cisco and Microsoft will integrate Cisco cloud innovations with Microsoft Azure to help service providers more quickly and cost efficiently launch new applications. We will also extend the enterprise-class security and services and customer private clouds to Microsoft Azure with Cisco Cloud Services Router, the 1000V. Within our strategy to work across hypervisors and stacks, we continue our investment in OpenStack with the launch at our Worldwide Partners Conference of Cisco OpenStack Private Cloud Solutions, aimed at on-premise cloud capabilities for application developers. To summarize my comments, our customer conversations today are not about standalone products. They are simply about digitization, growth, new revenue streams for them, innovation, and business outcomes. We believe we are pulling away from our competition using the same formula that we've always used, integrating our industry-leading products in every category into architectures and solutions that deliver real outcomes. We've created this opportunity and it is ours to execute. I will now turn the call over to Kelly for her comments in the quarter and guidance for next quarter; to you, Kelly. Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, John. Overall, we had a very solid quarter and executed well. From a top line perspective, total revenue was $12.1 billion, increasing 5%. And we expanded our non-GAAP operating margin to 28.6%, with both non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS growing 6% to $2.8 billion and $0.54 respectively. Our GAAP net income was $2.4 billion, and GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.47. Product revenue increased 6% and service revenue increased 3%, with product book-to-bill greater than one. For Q3, our total non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP product gross margin came in at 62.5% and 61.8% respectively. The increase in our non-GAAP product gross margin as compared to Q2 was driven by improved productivity, partially offset by product mix and pricing. Non-GAAP service gross margin was 65.0%. Looking at our geographic segment results in terms of total revenue, our Americas segment was up 8%. EMEA was up 2%, and APJC was down 1%. Total gross margin for the Americas was 62.9%. EMEA was 62.5%, while APJC was 61.2%. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.1 billion, up 3% or 33.9% as a percentage of revenue as compared to 34.6% in Q3 of fiscal year 2014. Our head count increased by approximately 800 to 70,951, reflecting investments in key growth areas such as security, cloud, and software. The non-GAAP tax provision rate of 22% for the quarter was consistent with our expectations. Our GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share included a benefit $164 million or approximately $0.03 per share related to the charge we recorded in Q2 of 2014 for a supplier component matter. The adjustment is a reduction of a liability reflecting lower than expected costs to remediate the impacted products with our customers. This amount is excluded from our non-GAAP results. From a balance sheet and cash flow perspective, total cash, cash equivalents, and investments were $54.4 billion, including $2.6 billion available in the U.S. at the end of the quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $3.0 billion during the quarter. Deferred revenue was $14.2 billion, up 8%. Product deferred revenue grew in the double digits again this quarter at 12%, driven largely by subscription-based offerings, while services deferred revenue also grew, up 6%, reflecting an increase in multiyear service arrangements. We continue to build a greater mix of recurring revenue, as reflected in our deferred revenue. Our DSO was 37 days as compared to 35 days in Q3 of 2014. In Q3 we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders. That included $1.0 billion through share repurchases and $1.1 billion through our quarterly dividend, which we increased 11% last quarter. So far in fiscal year 2015, we have returned approximately $6.2 billion or 83% of free cash flow to our shareholders, comprised of $3.2 billion of share repurchases $3.0 billion of dividends. Now let me provide a few comments on our guidance for the fourth quarter. Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors. And understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements, and actual results could be above or below guidance. The guidance we're providing is on a non-GAAP basis with reconciliation to GAAP. As John mentioned, we expect total revenue to be in the range of 1% to 3% growth on a year-over-year basis. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 62%. As we have said in the past, forecasting non-GAAP gross margin has always been challenging due to various factors such as volume, product mix, cost savings, and pricing. As a reminder, non-GAAP gross margin may vary quarter to quarter by a point in either direction of our guidance range. Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 is expected to be in the range of 27.5% to 28.5%. Our non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be approximately 22% in the fourth quarter. Our Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.55 to $0.57. We anticipate our GAAP earnings to be lower than our non-GAAP EPS by $0.10 to $0.13 per share in Q4 of 2015. The range includes a pre-tax charge of approximately $100 million as a result of the restructuring actions that we announced in the first quarter. During Q3, we recognized pre-tax charges to our GAAP financials statements of $24 million related to that announcement, and we expect total charges not to exceed $600 million during fiscal year 2015. Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for more detail. Other than those quantified items noted previously, there no other significant differences between GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructurings, and tax or other events which may or may not be significant. We believe we are executing well in a rapidly transforming market, and we'll continue to provide our guidance with all the appropriate caveats one quarter at a time. We encourage our shareholders to have similar considerations. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now hand it back to John for his summary comments. John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Kelly, thank you very much and nice job. I believe Cisco is at a very positive inflection point. In our 1997 Annual Report, when it was not obvious that the Internet would take off, we boldly declared that an Internet revolution would alter the fortune of companies, countries, and people, and we saw it come to life. A number of years ago we started talking about the next phase of the Internet, the Internet of Everything. That will be much bigger than the last, and it will require everything to become digital. At the time, almost no one understood what we saw. Today, it's everyone's idea. The conversations we are having today with our customers are so similar in many ways to those that we had 20 years ago. We have always been the example and saw the transitions early. And when others start noticing them, they are well underway. As we help companies, cities, countries digitize, the outcomes are exciting, job creation, quality of life, efficient use of resources. Our customers feel the pace of change accelerating, and they see this disruption in every industry and market. They know their success depends on fast innovation, digitizing their business, entirely new IT organization structures and business organization structures. Whether they are the disruptor or the incumbent, they are coming to Cisco as their strategic partner in the digital transformation. As they build their businesses around mobile, cloud, social, data, and analytics, they recognize that integrated architectures with the intelligent networks at the core will accelerate or, if they don't take advantage of it, inhibit their ability to move with the speed, scale, and security required. In simple terms, they know they will either disrupt or be disrupted. I am spending more and more of my time with CEOs, boards of directors, and government leaders to explain the combination of technological, organizational, and process transformation to meet these goals of our customers. And, as in the 1990s, in order to be a true partner to our customers, we have to lead by example. This goes to the reference point for how you reinvent yourself to embrace the opportunities of digitalization and the speed of innovation required for the future. We are three years ahead in making our own transitions. And with the pace of change in our market, three years makes a huge difference. What does this mean for Cisco and our shareholders? First, we spent the last 20 years moving everything to IP and taking advantage of convergence. The intelligent network is at the center of every market transition, and no one comes close to Cisco when it comes to the network. As 50 billion more devices come online, we have a strong hand to play, and we are playing it. Second, we are driving outcomes for our customers through architectures. This is how we differentiate against white label and single-product companies, and you can see this in our financial results, our margin stability, operating leverage, market share, and growth. Third, in a digital world, security becomes even more important. Cisco is the logical choice as we combine a security architecture across the intelligent network. Understanding the direction of the market and challenging ourselves to reinvent is how we address this opportunity and drive long-term value for our shareholders. There could not be a better time to begin Cisco's next chapter, and there is no one more excited than I am to have Chuck Robbins as the next CEO for Cisco. I want to thank the Cisco employees who are leading our change and driving our innovation, and your patience and energy is making Cisco's future possible. Chuck, I know you will leverage the things that have made us great to date. I also know you will make changes when needed and drive innovation and new capabilities at a faster pace. Cisco's momentum is strong, and we are extremely well positioned for the opportunities created by digitization. Every business and government leader is learning the benefits of becoming digital, growth, leadership, efficiency, productivity, conservation, safety, quality of life, and education, these outcomes that are at the core of what Cisco has enabled for the last 20 years. We wanted to use the Internet to change the way we work, live, learn, and play, and that's exactly what we've done in the past and what we will do even more in the future. With that, Mel, we will move to the session that I enjoy most, which is the Q&A. I'm going to turn it over to you. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Great, thanks. All right, Kim, we're ready to open for questions. I'd like to remind anyone asking a question, please ask just one question. First question? Operator : Thank you. The first question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Simona. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, John, and congratulations on all that you have accomplished in the last 20 years. And I also want to wish Chuck all the best of luck going forward. In terms of my question, so, John, you spent quite a lot of time on this call talking about a very positive inflection point, and I just wanted to understand if that is something that you expect us to see externally in terms of accelerating revenue growth. Or do you think that because you're also transitioning to more software in a recurring revenue model, that's going to really mask it because we're going to have the business mix? And then in terms of timing, if it is something that you think will accelerate the business, are you looking at the next couple of quarters or more the next couple of years? I just wanted to get a sense of the timing of the inflection. John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Got you. And it's always fun. Mel, I'm probably going to break a couple of my golden rules of 20 years with some of my comments today. And, Chuck, you can do the same thing after 10 years on the job. But I'm answering them in sequence. First of all, the opportunity is absolutely in revenue growth and profit growth. And as you sell solutions moving to outcomes, and you can do that much faster because of your architectures in the intelligent network, you get margin stability and premiums to go with it. Let me use maybe just a couple quick examples of how I'd illustrate that. In the U.S. enterprise, if we would have told you that the top U.S. enterprise accounts under Brian's [Marlier] team were to be able to grow at 21% year over year, you would say I doubt that. But it took us a while and there were a couple bumps in the transition, but when you now grow at that rate and have the number of large opportunities increase at the pace that we saw, you can see an inflection point which will absolutely translate not just to growth in U.S. enterprise but globally. And let me give you an idea how that pipeline is expanding. We now sell business transformations, what Brian and Sandy [Hogan] do there together. In the present time, we have 1,200 projects going on business transformation and outcomes. That is a pipeline of $3.7 billion in opportunity over the next 18 months. Now we won't get all of that, but it gives you an idea of how rapidly that project has changed. They sell to the business community with support of the CIO as opposed to respond to RFPs. In the last quarter alone, you had 540 new projects in the quarter put into this pipeline, and they had a potential of $950 million. What Chuck has done so well, whether it's in the enterprise business and you take it globally, Chuck, and taking that model and rebuilding it to our vision and strategy make it together, it's exactly one of the reasons he got this job. The commercial marketplace in the U.S. has grown for six quarters in a row at approximately 10% to 11%. No one else in the world is doing those numbers. Again, Simona, it is purely business-based outcomes and selling architectures. And what Chuck has done there is he's taken what Alison Gleeson did and taken it on a global basis, and so you see the same opportunity from that perspective. In terms of our two headwinds, the emerging markets is hard to call, and I think it's awful easy to take out a couple pieces and say this is what our growth would have been otherwise. But think about it. Our problem in emerging markets is now down to three major countries. It's China. Asia-Pacific without China, instead of growing at 1%, would have grown at 8%. Chuck, you and I are going over there every quarter, which is mainly you going and me occasionally following. But we'll eventually get that one turned around assuming our governments get along. Russia in Europe, 41%, and it took down the numbers there a fair amount. But service provider, which was our biggest hit this quarter versus last quarter, instead of being down 1% was down 7%. And, Mel, we said last quarter it's going to take us time to get this fixed. We didn't expect a positive upturn. Here I'm going to break one of my rules. I feel very comfortable that you'll see in the next several quarters \u2013 Kelly is cringing, but that's all right, Kelly, you'll get used to it. Chuck, this is one of my bad habits I want you to keep. But if you look at service provider, we'll turn that back positive. The organization changes that Chuck made in the field that Pankaj [Patel] turned the engineering organization sideways to focus on outcomes, knocking down literally silos over 60 business units that now are integrated toward outcomes together. That will turn back positive. And we aren't modeling it because CapEx is going to increase. We do not think it will in the second half of the year. We think actually our share of wallet is going to change. Now let me put these pieces together. When you win a Verizon deal, people didn't get what that was. That was optical in an area that we've traditionally not been strong in. Because we organized our sales engine different, our service engines different, and our R&D engine different, we understood what the customer wanted. We understood on the fly how we'd realign resources. We understood how you're going to have a win rate that is much higher than ever before in markets that we haven't traditionally been as strong. So all those, Simona, translate into revenue growth and profit growth. So am I pumped? Oh, yes. And could I be more excited than ever to turn it over to Chuck and watch what's going to happen? I feel real good about our future, a lot of growth in revenues and a lot of growth in profits. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Great. Thanks, Simona. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS Securities. John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Amitabh. Amitabh Passi - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. How are you, John? Congratulations again from my end; and, Chuck, congrats to you as well. I guess, John, the one area I wanted to maybe get your thoughts on, you've been talking about Intercloud. It's a key pinnacle to your cloud strategy over the last couple of quarters. Yet I think outside of some of the larger metrics you've shared in terms of the traction with data centers and customers, is there any help you can give us in terms of how we think about the monetization potential with Intercloud and how that's tracking for you? John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Rob has been the sponsor of this and the father, but let me start with a very positive area. Our service provider position is changing all for the positive. They look at us in terms of mobility leadership. They look at us in terms of video leadership. They look at us in terms of data center leadership. They look at us in terms of security leadership. And with our NFV and SDN capabilities, we are leading in software. And the pieces that were missing was how do you go into this new environment where each of these \"public clouds in clouds\" are separate and you have to be on different vendors or different companies' ability to go into it. And so what we're looking at, it first is an architecture and it cements our relationships in service providers. And then it really comes through to how you monetize it over time. This will just take time to monetize, but the effect we see indirectly is already huge when you talk about a Deutsche Telekom or a Telstra and our relationships with those. So, Rob, a little bit in terms of how you measure success but prior to when we get into the monetization stage. Robert W. Lloyd - President-Development & Sales: Okay. So, John, I think the metrics that we study, and we actually get together once a week, one year into the announcement of intercloud, we have three key areas that we focus on. The first is the impact we're having in accelerating Cisco's success in private cloud. You just mentioned the 21% growth of UCS. You mentioned the increase in the number of customers, up from 300 to 580 with APIC. We've seen success with converged infrastructure. So maintaining that leadership position in private cloud, and now starting to track our success with the Cisco ONE Cloud Suite, which will bundle up our capabilities in UCS, UCS Director, the intercloud fabric, and all the client service catalogs. So if you look at all the metrics, we really do think on the scorecard of private cloud we're doing extremely well. The second thing we're looking at through intercloud is driving innovation through open source development. And you mentioned in Montreal that we had announced a private cloud version of OpenStack, OpenStack Private Cloud for developers inside the firewall. I will be tracking very closely how well we do in that environment with OpenStack. And clearly, with 65 partners embracing OpenStack in the public cloud, something you just mentioned, we're really tracking how well we do in delivering OpenStack in the public cloud. The monetization model is infrastructure, and we should measure how well we do in building the infrastructure that will sit in private and public cloud underneath this OpenStack innovation. And the final thing, and this is just emerging but you've seen some recent examples, is the richness of the software catalog that Cisco brings to the intercloud marketplace. We've seen very good momentum recently with hosted collaboration solution, delivered by over 60 partners. You mentioned Rowan's [Trollope] announcement of Spark for Teams, and that's a pure SaaS offer. And something a lot of people might have missed was the Cisco Collaboration Knowledge SaaS offers. So in the area of collaboration, you see a very rich set of offers. We're looking at that marketplace, which will be a combination of Cisco and our partners' offers, and we measure those going forward. So those three areas I'd say lots of work left to do, but the scorecard is looking pretty good. John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Rob. Amitabh, thank you. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Great. Thanks, Amitabh. Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank. John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Brian. Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, John, and congratulations as well on your new role. It's been nice working with you over the last 20 years. And, Chuck, good luck in your new role as well. Charles H. Robbins - CEO Designate, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Field Operations & Director: Thank you. Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So my question, John, is by fiscal 2016 you could see the Web 2.0 CapEx higher than what you're seeing out of the carriers, the AT&Ts and Verizons. So how is Cisco positioned to sell into the web cloud customer base as trend setters in the spending market? And then how is Cisco preparing for the CapEx to OpEx transition you're seeing as cloud services shift from buying boxes to buying services? Can you talk a little bit about how you're seeing that play out and what you think that growth will be for Cisco over the next few years? Thanks. John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. If you look at where we are, and let's call it the massively scalable data centers, the top 10, our role in that is evolving, and candidly we're starting to move much faster. If you watch our ability to bring new products to market, you're going to see us have all 10 of the major players as key customers shortly. And up to recently, as you know, we were missing largely in one of those. Secondly is Pankaj has turned this engineering organization sideways and began to really focus on speed of small agile teams. And I can walk through a number of examples from mobility to security, but let's just talk about now how we'll develop our high-end products. We used to think about developing a high-end product with maybe 3,000 people, at least three to five years to do it. Watch how we develop our next generation of router products for these major players, and we'll do it in less than 12 months with probably 225 people. And so you're talking, and what these players would say, Cisco, you're finally getting it. You're getting your speed of change with that. You understand how to make the transition. So I look at this as a very good opportunity for us to play in those with an increasing share of their spend. And different than our peers, we will do it with software independent where appropriate or a combination of software, hardware, and ASICs. And I really like our momentum we're starting to get in these accounts, and it ranges from the Microsofts of the world to the Googles of the world to the Facebooks, to the Amazons. Chuck, any thoughts on that one? Charles H. Robbins - CEO Designate, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Field Operations & Director: Yes, John. So one of the key tenets that I've talked about over the last couple weeks is our need in the future to rapidly realign and adjust our portfolio based on what we're seeing with our customer base. And I think that the moves that Pankaj has made are really going to allow us to do that more effectively. And I think that will allow us to deal with, Brian, the shift that you highlighted from CapEx spend to some of the Web 2.0 players, and we're working that portfolio now. We're working closely with many of them, and I think you'll see us evolve that as necessary over the next couple quarters. I think when you think about the SP space, I think the biggest thing we've done over the last year, year and a half is that we've really achieved architectural alignment with our SP customers, understanding where they want to go, and aligning our portfolio. And I think that our speed with which we've moved into the virtual managed services space and some of the wins that we announced that John referenced at Mobile World Congress and some of the wins with Verizon and others are indicative of our alignment with where they want to go, and I think you'll see more of that from us in the future. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Great. Operator, our next question? Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley Investments. John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, James. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, congratulations to John and Chuck from me as well. I just wanted as quickly on security, and it's an area that obviously saw good growth. But I'm wondering how security and security concerns may be impacting demand in some of your other product segments firstly. And secondly, also related to security, how should we think about your efforts in security in areas where you may see some room for improvement in the product portfolio, et cetera? Thank you. John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Got you. So security is the ideal market for us. It basically is made up of hundreds of fragmented players. We're the largest volume player at only 7.5% of the market. And you know our view, we don't enter markets where we don't have a good chance of getting to 40% market share with sustainable differentiation. We believe it's going to be set up for an architectural play, and it's going to require integration with intelligence throughout the cloud, throughout the data centers, the WAN down to the access, combining mobile with the Internet of Everything and digitization, et cetera. We're on a journey here. We love the momentum, 14% growth with orders growing faster, which I think was 20% growth, and I expect us to do a lot better than that over time. The pull-through on it is very interesting because now this goes back to when we sell, we don't sell a product or just an architecture. When you go in and you talk about digitizing your company, we talk about how all of our product architectures come together. And then when we talk about security together with IOE, digitizing your company, mobile, et cetera, you suddenly see how security ties across all those. So we're starting to get upgrades and we're learning how to sell this better. And probably again, Brian and Sandy's group have done the best job. We get whole \u2013 getting $10 million to $50 million upgrades of the whole network because of the security implications, how it ties together. It also gives us a seat at the boardroom where on the one hand, we can say you either disrupt or you die. And on the other hand, your major fear of a CEO or a board is what happens if we have a problem? How do I minimize it? How do I know I've done everything possible? And don't save me a couple hundred thousand dollars on a white label box that causes me a problem. So our win rate goes way up and our relevance goes way up. And you will continue to see us move in terms of additional moves as we go in the future. Chuck, I'm going ask you maybe just to comment about his indirect question, which is acquisitions. Don't tie down to a specific industry, but your overall view of innovation, how we defined it before, and your thoughts about are we going to continue with the model if that includes acquisitions in that model. Charles H. Robbins - CEO Designate, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Field Operations & Director: Yes, John. So as I think about M&A activity going forward, I think if you look back at our strategy for innovation, it has always combined a combination of internal R&D partnerships and acquisitions. If you just look at the landscape today that we see in the consolidation of many of our peers and competitors, and, John, you've been talking about brutal consolidations for a few quarters now. Many of those that we see out there now are really around cost synergies, candidly that are between players that perhaps aren't as strategically well positioned. And when we see that happen, that usually creates opportunity for Cisco, and that's when we usually take advantage of those situations. The others that you see out there are more driven based on real strategic alignment and strategic acceleration, and those are typically done I believe by companies who are strategically better positioned in the marketplace relative to what's going on, which is where I would argue we are right now. So when I think about it, you'll see us take advantage of the latter. We'll leverage our go-to-market, our scale, our channel to accelerate time to market. And what I would \u2013 the example I would give you is Meraki. We paid $1.2 billion for Meraki when it had $100 million in bookings, and now we're on a $600 million bookings run rate by bringing that inside and leveraging what we're able to do. And that's what you'll see from us in the future, which is really I think M&A that fits within our innovation strategy with a great deal of accountability. John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Now Mel always kicks me underneath the table. And since it's my last one, we won't comment on rumors about acquisitions or not, but I wouldn't bet on the one that you heard today. Sorry, Mel. I know I'm going to break all kinds of rules today. Chuck, they're yours to rebuild. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Operator, next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with Sanford Bernstein. Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, thank you for taking my question. I'd like to discuss a bit the transition, the CEO transition, Chuck and John. Could you tell us about, John, how you see your role going forward as an Executive Chairman? How are you going to keep yourself busy? Are you going to have a day-to-day role with clients, and maybe if you can make a difference between maybe like a transition period and on a more like run rate basis to the back of that, how you're going to continue to be involved, if any? John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So let me first say it very crisply. Chuck is the CEO, period. He will make the decisions. I will be an advisor to him and I'll be very involved where he wants me to be. The things I love most are vision and strategy. I love time with customers, strategic partnerships, acquisitions, and whatever else Chuck wants me to do. I will be his wing man, period, in terms of how we do this. We were beginning to graph out our time. I think, Chuck, both your and my calendar is full, full time for about four months, and I'm trying to in this job be working about half-time. So, Chuck, the one assignment I give on this transition is to get me to half-time sometime in the fall because the hunting season is coming up. Charles H. Robbins - CEO Designate, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Field Operations & Director: You realize your wife is paying me to keep you busy. John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. My wife got Chuck's number so she could text him when it was time for me to go on the road again. But it's a nice way of saying that as we look forward, the transition will be very smooth. I will be an advisor and a coach for Chuck. We will not talk about that publicly. And I will do work where we can add value. I think a model that's similar is what Intel's done with Andy [Bryant] and BK [Brian Krzanich], where BK uses Andy very effectively with the board in key projects areas. And candidly, I think, Chuck, you went down to talk to BK \u2013 Brian about what that role might be. But it's Chuck's decision on this. And, Chuck, maybe your comments and you could also share what you plan to do over the next 90 days, if you want. Charles H. Robbins - CEO Designate, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Field Operations & Director: I think, Pierre, I would say that the one thing John has been very clear with me is exactly what he just said to you, and he's been unwavering in our discussions on that. What I would say is that everyone's been asking me what our priorities are, what we're going to be focused on. And as I've said to everyone, we went through the process with the board and we prepared a great deal of our thoughts around strategy and what we would do. And now I want to just test that with our team. I want spend the next 90 days just talking to our leadership team, our employees, our customers, our partners, our shareholders, analysts to really just make sure that the theories and the things that I think we should be doing are in alignment. And I'm going to focus \u2013 beyond that, we're going to focus on aligning our resources against the best priorities for the company. I really want to focus secondly on clarity and simplification of our messages, and that's internal and external. We'll take what Gary's done and built with a lot of the operational capabilities and the processes that he's built, and we'll double down on that and continue to work. And that includes across revenue opportunities, expense areas, as well as gross margins. And then finally, we'll double down on our culture, because I think one of the things that has just made Cisco fantastic are our people. So that's a big focus area for me as well. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Operator, next question? Operator : Yes, thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets. John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Mark. Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you, John. Hi, thank you, John, and welcome, Chuck. So Cisco is steadily growing its SaaS business and the recurring revenue. So with this uptick in the pace of software growth as we transition from boxes to solutions, should we start thinking of and planning for a long-term lift to margins? And with more software comes higher cash flow. Should we start to also think about more cash ultimately coming back to shareholders? John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So a series of questions. Let me take part of them, and then Kelly can kick me or not. You are going to see us move more and more into recurring revenue and deferred revenue. The art is to do both at the same time, Chuck, and I believe in 'and'. We want to grow our revenue in the short term and long term and our profits in the short term and long term faster than revenue. But we clearly are moving rapidly through that transition. Probably the best example to give you on what's been successful would be the example in terms of what we're doing in the security space in terms of Meraki where you begin to probably split it two dollars for one dollar. Two dollars for current, one dollar is for later. And as Chuck said, you start with a $100 million pace and you go all the way to a $600 million pace fairly quickly. The second would be collaboration. The numbers were great on collaboration at 7% growth in TelePresence units and 66% year-over-year growth, and the new products being developed in I think was 12 months with the deferred pipe and 18 months to market with only 200 people. But what I loved about this quarter with collaboration is their deferred revenue went up 20% to $1.1 billion on the quarter, so you're beginning to build recurring revenue and deferred revenue pipeline that feels very good. In terms of our capital allocation, you're going to see us remain committed to delivering our capital allocation, as Kelly has outlined, and we'll continue to be aggressive with a minimum of our free cash flow going to our shareholders. And you'll see us \u2013 we wouldn't have started the dividend if we didn't anticipate regularly raising it. And you're going to see us be active in the share repurchase as well in terms of the capital allocation. So no major change there, Mark. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Tal Liani - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Yes. Hi, guys. I'm adding my own congrats to John and Chuck. I wanted to ask about switching. You're into a major cycle of switching, new products that brings you into new markets or develop new markets, et cetera, and creates a replacement cycle. But still, the numbers are not that impressive, at least on a sequential basis. Revenues were down 6% in January and down 1.5% this quarter. I know on a year-over-year it looks good, but that's because last year was so bad. So I'm trying to look at the sequentials to see what the growth is looking like. And the question is why don't we see higher numbers with switching? What prevents the numbers from going up? And maybe you can relate here to units versus prices. I'm trying to see if it's a pricing issue rather than a units issue. Thanks. John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Tal, we've known each other for a long time, but I'm going to be very direct. When you have switching revenues up 11% last quarter, up 6% this quarter, it's off the charts. And if I would have told anybody on this call two years ago that I'd be getting questions about switching revenues only growing 6% in the quarter, you would have said you've got to be kidding me because everybody was modeling zero and they were modeling margins to go down. Kelly, our margins on the switching actually were at the higher end of our range. They've been remarkably consistent for the last eight quarters. So all this garbage about new players coming in and software coming in and white label killing our approach was entirely wrong. And the feeder system looks really good. If you watch at the campus level, you have all of the drivers of low-end switching, from IOE to digitization to security to mobility all driving this upgrade in wireless. And then at the high end, we're in the middle of a transition, which we executed remarkably well and we took the pain. We announced the products early. We knew there would be a transition from the Nexus 9000 to the Nexus 7000. The Nexus 9000 growth is off the charts. I want to be careful with my word selection. We are beating our competitors that you all were worried about. We moved past them in less than one year of shipment. We're growing sequentially 27% where our competitors are modeling to the market flat sequential growth. That is market share gains at tremendous speed. Now it will take us a couple more quarters to work through the Nexus 7000 decline and get it balanced out and you'll see us move a lot of the capabilities of the Nexus 9000 to the Nexus 7000 over the next couple of quarters. I know, Chuck, you've got that with one with Pankaj and the balance. So the bottom line on switching, we're taking share, we feel really good, we're going to kick the other competitors, and it's a very good growth market, and I will never apologize for growth in mid-single-digits on switching. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Thanks, Tal. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Bracelin with Pacific Crest Securities. Brent A. Bracelin - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you for taking my questions here. John, you started out breaking a cardinal rule. I have a follow-up on that one. Hopefully, you'll be willing to share more color. As you think about, as you look at digital transformation projects, the 1,200 projects, $3.7 billion pipeline certainly is, and a proven proof point, shows you at least why you're seeing some of the strength in the enterprise and commercial side. My question and the question I get from investors a lot is, how is Cisco doing relative to expanding the footprint beyond the core switching and routing business? It's still 45% your revenue today. So as you look at that pipeline around digital transformation, what's the attach rate on servers, software, services? Can you give us some color that, some leading indicator that will let us understand how you well you're doing relative to expanding the overall footprint as you help enterprises transform their businesses? John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It's interesting, and I want to think about how to answer that or maybe have Chuck answer it on the next conference call in more detail on it. But almost all of these sales are no longer about switching and routing. They are purely outcome-based, and it is GDP growth, it's inclusion of minorities, it's job creation, it's healthcare, it's education, it's the citizens experience, and the businesses it goes across all industries, and what you do is you pull through everything at one time. And so when we think about the total value of digitizing a company or a country, you suddenly see where we do these programs, those accounts grow at 10% \u2013 15% faster than what they did during our prior model in terms of the opportunity on it. And in terms of routing and switching, you can see the numbers. I would expect that other segments of the market, as SP and emerging come back to life, and they will. I think SP we will see in a couple of quarters, not because of CapEx spend but our positioning. In emerging, eventually these three countries will level back out. You will see the architecture sales where that segment outside switching and routing grow well. Now the point the Tal just asked, every time we sell these others, it bolsters switching and routing. And this is where intelligence in the network and our speed of architectures get outcomes that those do not. And that will drive the services, Gary. That will drive the margins, Kelly, across the board that we get. We might think about a way of defining it a little bit more, but the bottom line is most of our customers that are with us on the digitization don't even think about us as routing and switching anymore. And the fast-growing areas of collaboration, business messaging is one of the hottest areas growing period across the board in terms of the approach. Collaboration, if we can get 3% to 5% productivity in a company, and I think what we're doing around the Spark capability and the TelePresence and this all came together, we can do it. So it's nice way of saying I think you're going to see our areas outside of switching and routing grow rapidly. The cool thing is it pulls through switching and routing. And the best of all, architectures beat white label and free software. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Great. Great question, Brent. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer & Company. John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Ittai. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi, John, and again, congrats to you; and, Chuck, good luck to you in your new role. Charles H. Robbins - CEO Designate, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Field Operations & Director: Thanks, Ittai. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): John, I had a couple of questions. First, going back to the service provider comment, you talked about it being sit down 7% globally. Your routing business was actually up on a year-over-year basis, and yes, your service provider video was down 5%. But can you give us a little bit and make up the difference? What are the other product categories in which you're seeing issues or challenges on the service provider side? And then second, regarding the transformation point, which is very evident in your U.S. results, which are quite impressive, what is it in that pitch that doesn't resonate or takes a long time to resonate everywhere else? Why is that not something that drives Europe up as well 10% \u2013 15%? John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Got you, so several things. First of all, on the service provider video piece, the orders were down about 20% in SP video, so I don't want to mislead anybody with the 5% revenue number. But the exciting part is we're picking up momentum in the cloud segment of this and the software in the cloud, which is clearly where we want the revenue to go. The architectural play wins here. Set-top boxes are tactical, but cloud winning on video like [Khaled] is doing there is strategic to us. Go to the U.S. If you take out one of the large service providers, you're all of a sudden instead of talking down 17%, you're talking down 6%, and the cable players had the other part. So we're starting to grow in many of these players globally, and it's just a few of them that have a major impact. Through the third part of the question, it takes a while. When Chuck announced and did the commercial operation here, Chuck then put Alison in charge of this on a global basis. But it takes literally a year to go through this transformation. Some countries pick it up quicker than others, and sometimes you have to give some of these countries and nudge after the fact. Brian's total business transformation that he and Sandy are leading, that takes longer to roll out and more time. So even if you've watched with them, there was a disruption as they moved rapidly. That's where you saw the business actually slow for a couple quarters before it took up. And then there's the whole coordination with engineering. And one of the key reasons that Chuck got this job, among others, is his ability to coordinate these resources together in division and strategy to determine the outcomes in terms of the direction. It's a nice way of saying it's a multiyear journey. The cool thing is using U.S. enterprise as an example. Once they got it going the pipeline is accelerating, and you'll see that around the world. And that's why we feel comfortable with the long-term growth, Simona, not just looking out a year or two. But we will get more than our fair share. Now let me put this in proper perspective. If you watch where we are, all of our major IT players almost without exception are going down year over year. It's a disaster in the market. If we had our midpoint of the numbers we just gave you, we will be at a record earnings per share and a record quarter in terms of revenue. So we're taking share, spend, and position the market extremely well as we go forward. So I feel very good about where we're positioned, Mel, and you're nicely saying that's going to be my last question. John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Let me move to close a little. It's been an honor. First, I want to thank all of you around this table. This leadership team is amazing. Our virtual table of the operating committee and leaders, it really has been an honor. It has been fun. It's been challenging, and I'm just very humbled by having this chance for 20 years. Chuck, you're going to love this job. When I look about where we are today, what excites me the most is what we've done on culture and how we've built an engine platform innovation. And if you watch the innovation we're talking about in many of these areas, what used to take thousands of people, Pankaj does with 20. We do the new mobility capability with data combining Wi-Fi with 3G and 4G in a way with 18 people in eight months. You make moves in security the same way. You bring Spark to life with business messaging with 200 people. We can now rival the best startups there are in the world and out execute them because they can build off of that capability. What gets me very comfortable about our future, I said nicely, our competitors come and go. Chuck, I'm thinking about playing golf lately. But the exciting part about where we are is that you and I are on the 18th hole and we're already ahead by five strokes in team play. And all of our competitors have hit their golf balls off into the woods they're looking for it. And we're going to finish off this game, and by the time we're through, they're still going to be looking for the golf balls. If you really look at the market and you think innovation is breaking a company in half and having to roll the dice of combining two companies that are really five companies into one, and you begin to think about having to cut expenses dramatically and then double-down that you can move to a software play only. And when we said this year at the sales meeting, and people forget that's just eight months ago, that if you look at key competitors like HP and Alcatel-Lucent and Arista and VMware and Avaya and we name several more, we said half of those won't exist in a meaningful way as competitors to us in a year. And everybody said, yeah right, look where we are already in eight months. It's a nice way of saying we're going to become the number one IT company. It's been a tremendous honor to lead this organization. It's one that will do better after me than during my time, and that's a way of saying like your kids, this team has built tremendous strength. They're going to do even better in the future. So it's really been fun for me. It's also going to be fun being your wing man, Chuck, but I'll just spend my time where you want me to spend it and enjoy this moment. And it's much like when I ran today. Mel, you judge. She said go out and run a lot this morning. I did and I was determined to set my new course record when I ran. I got stopped in the first half mile. I'd never seen this before in my life, but the biggest buck I've never seen. It was probably a 12 point, maybe 14 point. It was right in my path 10 feet from me. And I looked it right in the eyes and at first I was annoyed because I was trying to set my timing. And then I realized you want to enjoy the moment and how special that was. But I lost, I missed my timing, Mel. I didn't make it by 10 seconds. But it's a nice way of saying that we're a competitive organization, one that is far from perfect, and I've been a far from perfect leader, but one that I'm very honored to have lead and it's really nice, like a family that I want this to do even better as I move on to the next stage of my career, which is more one of a coach. So, Chuck, enjoy the moment. You're going to be a fantastic new CEO, and you're going to great things here at Cisco. And this team is literally unbeatable. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : So to close the call, Cisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our FY 2015 fourth quarter and annual results will be on Wednesday, August 12, 2015, at 1 :30 PM Pacific, 4:30 PM Eastern.

(Broker) Operator : Welcome to Cisco Systems' fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 financial results conference call. At the request of Cisco Systems, today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I would like to introduce Melissa Selcher, Vice President of Corporate Communication and Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Thanks, Kim. Welcome, everyone, Cisco's fourth quarterly FY 2015 quarterly conference call. This is Melissa Selcher, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO, and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now you should have seen our earnings release with expanded financial information. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found on the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. And we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue, and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise. The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we'll be providing for the first quarter. They're subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and any applicable amendments which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during this quarter unless it's done through a specific public disclosure. I'll now turn the call over to Chuck. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Mel. It's an honor today to lead this call as the CEO of Cisco. While this is only my third week officially in the CEO role, we've really hit the ground running since my appointment was announced on May 4. I believe that I'm stepping into this role at an incredible time for the company. John's vision and leadership have set Cisco up for the future that I believe will be even better than our past. John is an industry icon, a global community leader, a friend. And as Executive Chairman, I'm excited that our customers, partners, employees, and shareholders will continue to benefit from his contribution to key priority areas, and I look forward to his partnership going forward. Over the last 90 days, we've seen an infectious energy emerge at Cisco, and we've made strong moves around the four focus areas that I laid out : accelerating what's working and changing what's not; simplifying our business; driving operational rigor; and investing in our talent and our culture. We will continue to move quickly. And going forward it is my intention to be transparent on what we were doing, what we are doing, and more importantly, why we are doing it. As we closed our fiscal year, we delivered record revenues and record non-GAAP EPS for both Q4 and fiscal year 2015. We're growing our business and earnings while driving the evolution of our portfolio and how we bring increasing value to our customers. We demonstrated our continued commitment to driving shareholder value, and in FY 2015 returned $8.3 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, which represented 73% of our free cash flow. Cisco is in a very strong position. Our results reflect the work we've done over the last several years transforming Cisco in today's rapidly changing market. When I think about our strategy, I look at the huge market opportunity that exists as businesses and governments use technology to drive their growth and operational efficiency. This is why our customers are moving to digital, and it is their number one priority. In the digital world, data is the most strategic asset, and is increasingly distributed across every organization and ecosystem, on premise, at the edge, and in the cloud. The network plays an increasingly important role enabling our customers to aggregate, automate, and draw insights from this highly distributed data with security and speed. This is driving them to adopt entirely new IT architectures and organizational structures. We understand how technology can deliver the outcomes our customers want to achieve, and it is how we will continue to drive our differentiated strategy and prioritization in our business. This is something our customers and our partners appreciate. And starting today and over the coming months, it is my goal to simplify and bridge for you how Cisco's unique position in this significant market translates into growth and profits for our shareholders, both today and over the long term. With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Kelly to run through our execution on our financial strategy. Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Chuck. I am pleased with our execution on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments, and delivering shareholder value. Starting with profitable growth, we saw good top line growth in Q4 with a record $12.8 billion in revenue, up 4%, bringing our full-year fiscal year 2015 revenue to $49.2 billion, also growing 4%. Successful portfolio refreshes across almost every product area and effective resource reallocations to growth areas fueled revenue growth in Q4 in every product area except for SP [Service Provider] video. Specifically in Q4, the continued traction of the new core platforms in high-end routing drove routing revenue growth of 3%. Switching grew 2%, with very strong 200%-plus growth of ACI, both the Nexus 9000 and ASIC, and strong performance in the Catalyst business. And a refresh of the entire collaboration product line accelerated our collaboration growth to 14%. Data center grew 14%, with continued market leadership of UCS. Wireless grew 7%, driven by continued Meraki momentum, and security grew 4%. In security this quarter, we saw the acceleration in the shift from hardware to software. Our customers are rapidly adopting our subscription-based and software offerings, which is helping us build a greater mix of recurring revenue. This transition is accelerating and will remain a focus for us going forward. Security and collaboration both had deferred revenue growth of over 20% at the end of the quarter, and we saw total deferred product revenue grow double digit again this quarter, up 21%. Product orders in Q4 grew 4% year over year, with a book-to-bill comfortably above one. Looking at the geographies, which is the primary way we run our business, the Americas grew 7%, EMEA declined 1%, and APJC declined by 1%. Total emerging markets declined 2%, with the BRICs plus Mexico down 7%. Looking at customer segments, we were pleased to see a return to positive growth of 2% in service provider. Commercial grew 11%. Enterprise globally declined 1%, and public sector grew 4%. From a profitability perspective, in Q4 we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.59, up 7%. GAAP EPS was $0.45. For the full year, we grew non-GAAP EPS 7% to $2.21, with GAAP EPS of $1.75. Q4 non-GAAP net income was a record $3 billion, up 6%. GAAP net income was $2.3 billion. The focus the teams have placed on gross margin stability through technology innovation, sustainable differentiation, and cost savings continues to pay off in Q4, resulting in a non-GAAP gross margin of 62.1%, with non-GAAP product gross margin of 61.0% and non-GAAP service gross margin of 65.9%. Strong operational rigor resulted in non-GAAP operating expenses in Q4 at 32.8% of revenue and a non-GAAP operating margin that expanded to 29.3%. As I stated at Cisco Live, we are making the right bets and driving discipline in where we invest, helping to ensure we get the best return on our investments. We believe continued operational discipline combined with portfolio optimization can drive our operating margins even higher from where we are now over the long term. Moving on to the second pillar of our financial strategy, which is the way \u2013 the work we are doing to manage our portfolio and strategic investments to fuel our key long-term growth in areas such as cloud, data center, software, and security. In Q4, we announced an agreement to sell the Client Premises Equipment portion of our SP Video Connected Devices unit to French-based Technicolor for approximately $600 million in cash and stock, subject to certain adjustments. We will continue to refocus our investments in service provider video towards cloud and software-based services. We expect the transaction to close at the end of Q2 of fiscal year 2016, and expect to see an approximate one point benefit to our non-GAAP gross margin rate and negligible net income impact after close. We also announced our intent to acquire the cloud-based security company OpenDNS. The OpenDNS acquisition aligns with our strategy to deliver more cloud-based subscription services and drive the value of analytics and our security offerings. In Q4 we also closed two acquisitions to further complement our software, collaboration, and cloud offerings. These moves are consistent with our strategy of increasing the allocation of our innovation and R&D efforts to our growth areas. Services revenues grew 4% in Q4. Double-digit growth in our advanced services portfolio of cloud, security, consulting, and analytics reflects our strategy of selling customer outcomes. Further extending our renewal capabilities, which is highly profitable for us, last week we completed the acquisition of MaintenanceNet, a cloud-based software platform that uses data analytics and automation to manage renewals of recurring customer contracts. Moving on to our third pillar, delivering shareholder value, in Q4 we increased operating cash flow 15% to a record $4.1 billion. Total cash, cash equivalents, and investments at the end of Q4 were $60.4 billion, with $7 billion available in the U.S. And in Q4 we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders, including $1 billion through share repurchases and $1.1 billion through our quarterly dividend. For the full year, we generated strong operating cash flows of $12.6 billion and free cash flow of $11.3 billion. We returned $8.3 billion to our shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, which represented 73% of our free cash flow. We are firmly committed to continuing our capital allocation strategy of returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders annually. We are also committed to looking at the right acquisitions at the right price to drive our growth strategy. To summarize, in Q4 and for the full year 2015, we executed well against our business and financial strategy and saw that execution reflected in our profitable growth, cash generation, and operating leverage. We have also demonstrated our firm commitment to delivering shareholder value. Let me now go through the guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, which includes the type of forward-looking information that Mel referred to earlier. In terms of total revenue, we expect it to be in the range of 2% to 4% growth year over year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in a range of 61% to 62%, and the non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 28% to 29%. And the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 23%, up 1% from the prior fiscal year. This represents approximately $0.01 of impact to EPS. If the U.S. R&D tax credit is reinstated, we would reflect that benefit in our effective tax rate. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in to range of $0.55 to $0.57. We anticipate our GAAP EPS to be lower than the non-GAAP EPS by $0.11 to $0.15. Further details related to this range are included in the slides and press release that accompany this call. I'll now turn it back to Chuck to summarize the call. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Kelly. So let me quickly summarize. I believe our strategy and execution have enabled our performance to be quite differentiated from our peers. We delivered record revenue and non-GAAP EPS and drove positive growth in new orders while increasing our deferred revenue on the product side by 21%. We are delivering these strong results all as we transition our business. Let me give you some clear examples. First, as we look at our collaboration business, two years ago we said we would overhaul our portfolio and shift it towards more recurring revenue. We delivered revenue growth of 14% and saw deferred revenue growth over 20% on the strength of our subscription and SaaS businesses. As we look at security, in a highly distributed digital world, security is the top concern for our customers. We are pushing threat-centric security everywhere across the extended network, driving our FirePOWER security services across hundreds of thousands of ASA firewall platforms and ISR routers. In Q4 we added customers more than 15 times faster than Sourcefire at the time of the acquisition. We're quickly building a substantial software subscription business in our security portfolio, and you see that in the 26% growth of deferred revenue in Q4 for security. Assuming we continue to execute, I'm confident we'll see high double-digit growth in the back half of this year. In switching, we are driving the transition to the Nexus 3000, Nexus 9000, and ACI, and in the quarter we grew revenue across those product families to $438 million, growing more than 100% year over year and more than 50% sequentially. We added 1,400 new Nexus 9000 customers, bringing us to over 4,100 total. And 26 of our 28 largest enterprise customers are now Nexus 9000 customers, with 30% of them new in Q4. In high-end routing, we continued to drive the transition in the core and saw both of our new platforms grow in triple digits. We've solidified our lead in this market. And with Meraki, customers are rapidly adopting this new cloud-based consumption model. Three years ago we bought Meraki for $1.2 billion, with $100 million of annual orders. We closed this year with almost a $1 billion order run rate, scaling the business through our global commercial channels. These are just a few examples of what we are capable of when we focus, and this is what I intend to accelerate. We've only begun to scratch the surface on how we can take advantage of our scale and relevance in this digital transition and how we deliver our technology to our customers. The strategic role Cisco is playing is at the center of the digital transition today and in the future, and it's why I strongly believe Cisco's best years are ahead of us. Mel, let's open it up for questions. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Thanks. Kim, let's open for questions. I'd like to remind analysts to please ask just one question. Thanks, Kim. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot. I just wanted to ask a question related to security. That was an area in an otherwise strong quarter that was a little bit below at least where we had modeled. I'm just wondering if you can give a little view on maybe what transpired and how you think about security and what needs to happen there to drive that growth. And I guess as part of that, are you comfortable with your current portfolio in security, or should we expect you to look to make additions there to make it \u2013 increase even further the competitiveness? Thank you. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, James. Thanks for the question. Number one, I am very bullish about where we are with our security portfolio. I think the team has done a tremendous job. They've actually driven the transition that we have begun from hardware to software and subscription business. As we stated, the deferred revenue was up over 20%, I think 26% in the quarter. Software is now 47% of our security portfolio. On the FirePOWER services, which is where we have our malware capabilities, we added almost 3,000 new customers, which before the quarter I think we had 3,000 customers, so we doubled the number during the quarter. And what we plan to do now is take that across all of our 275,000 ASA firewall customers. And I do feel comfortable that in the next couple quarters we'll get the revenue back in the high double digits. So I think it's a transition that we're pushing. I think the team is doing a great job of accelerating that transition. I think it will be good for us in the long run. As it relates to our portfolio, when we think about this, we clearly are going to have to continue to expand our offerings for the customers. And we'll do that through a combination of internal R&D, acquisitions where needed, partnerships where they make sense, co-innovation where it makes sense, so we'll be looking at all alternatives. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Great, thanks, James. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, thanks very much. I just wanted to ask a question on the backlog. It was down year over year even though book-to-bill was strong, as was deferred. I'm just curious if you can help us reconcile that. And just related to that, enterprise I think you said was down 1% year over year, even though you had very strong bookings there last quarter. So I just wanted to understand the dynamics there as well. Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Simona. I'll take the backlog one here. So looking at our backlog, it was down marginally from a year ago. And as you know, that's just a point in time. I think the big difference when you compare that to the great strength you're seeing in our product deferred revenue being up is as soon as we invoice it out of our \u2013 invoice whatever it is, the hardware or the software, we remove it from backlog. And then obviously, then as we get our cash for our things or we defer it for a deal, it goes into deferred. So there's a bit of a disconnect between the two of when it's actually invoiced out. But from a backlog weeks, it's right in the same line as what we'd expect at the end of the year. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And, Simona, on the enterprise portion of the question, so the number that we put out there was a bookings number, order number, new orders. And candidly, I'm not concerned. We see the enterprise business, because of the finite number of customers that exist in that segment, we see those varying quarter by quarter. The commercial and public sector, we sell the same solutions. And I think that if you look at the performance there, we're very optimistic. So I'm not concerned at all about the enterprise business. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Thanks, Simona. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS. Amitabh Passi - UBS Securities LLC : Hi, Chuck. Welcome on your first call. I wanted to piggyback on the last question. I had a similar question on switching. Last quarter, I think there was some concern about switching sales having peaked two quarters ago. I think you saw a sequential uptick in switching. How should we be thinking about the cadence in your overall switching business? Is this a business that you feel comfortable growing kind of this 1%, 2%, 3%, low single-digit percent range? Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Amitabh, thanks for the question. I'm pleased with where we are. If you look at our performance in the campus and in the access piece of our business, we had solid performance. We continue see strength based on, frankly, customers connecting everything, IoE, collaboration. As we continue to drive our collaboration portfolio, all of those video end units require switching ports. Security is driving an element of that, as is the transition we see in wireless. In the data center, we're continuing to work through the transition that we have talked about. I think that you can tell from the numbers that we put up on the Nexus 3000/Nexus 9000 revenue at $438 million, up 53% sequentially, we feel really good about where we are. We're accelerating there, and I think that we are very optimistic and pleased with where we are in our switching business. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Great, thanks, Amitabh. Operator, next question? Operator : And our next question comes from Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank. Brian, your line is open. You may want to check the mute feature on your phone. Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes, good idea. Hi, guys. If you could add up your services revenue including Meraki, including some of the enterprise area (20:09) products, what's the revenue based on that? What's the overall growth rate and trend in that business? Thanks. Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Just to make sure, Brian, what pieces are you trying to quantify in there? Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Meraki, your recurring revenue streams, your services plus your recurring revenue streams. Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : I see. Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: What do you have in revenue and what's the growth rate and what's the trend in that? Thanks. Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Okay, great question. So if I start with \u2013 let's see here, let me just get to that data. I'd say if I go to the actual balance, if I start with the deferred balance and then I'll get to the actual revenue piece of that, like I've talked about before, on the product side, we've been increasing the amount of our deferred revenue that is recurring. So that amount year over year of my total product deferred revenue is now over 46%, up from 40% a year ago, so we continue to increase that. Obviously, there are different ranges of the term on that. But on average for product, it's slightly north of $500 million-plus quarter on quarter that we're weighting down, amortizing every quarter on the product side. On the services side, it is obviously a much more accurate run rate. I'll pull it up here as we go through. Just give me a couple seconds here and let me pull it up for you. Or actually, let me follow up with you on the call back because I have to dig it up a little bit. Okay, Brian? Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Brian. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Great, thanks, Brian. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America Securities Merrill Lynch. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Tal, you may be muted as well. Operator : Please check the mute feature of your phone. Tal, your line is open. Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes, sorry, now you can hear me. Thanks very much for taking my call. I want to go back to the question on switching because I'm trying to understand. This is a major upgrade, and still we don't see the numbers picking up materially. The sequential growth we're seeing is below what we've seen the last two years, and I'm wondering. Can you go over what's offsetting the growth in Nexus 3000 and Nexus 9000? Why are the numbers not showing much greater increase given the magnitude of the cycle? Thanks. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Tal, this is Chuck. It's a great question. So as we look at our data center switching, again, we are very pleased with the campus and the access switching. We've got a refresh that's being driven there, and that's moving along well. We're very happy with the transition going on in the data center switching space. As we look at customers that are migrating to 10-gig, 40-gig, 100 gig, which is really represented by the data that I gave you earlier, and it's just being offset by the transition from the Nexus 7000 to these new platforms. And we think in the next few quarters we'll see that inflection point. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Great, thanks, Tal. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with Bernstein. Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. On the service provider side, so you are now getting back to some good revenue momentum. I was wondering. How much of that comes from a change in the landscape in how operators are looking at spending and how much is much more related to your own dynamics and your own product cycle? And then when we look at the second half of the year, of the calendar year, could you give us a sense of how you see the market evolving, especially your largest clients in the U.S.? Thank you. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Pierre. So on the service provider business, clearly we're pleased that we got back to growth this quarter. Our teams have done a great job. We're proud of what they've done. We made some changes over the last 18 months internally in engineering and services and in sales to better position us, and I think that had a lot to do with it. I also think that we have really gotten to a point of what I'd say architectural vision alignment with most of our customers. We saw balance throughout the quarter in SP. We saw good performance from data center, collaboration, high-end routing, even SP mobility. And so while we're pleased with the 2%, we're still cautiously optimistic about where we go. I think that in the second half of the year right now, relative to when you think about SP CapEx, there's a lot of movement right now around the expectations for that in the second half. And candidly, we have not modeled any significant increase in the second half of CapEx spend from SP. And if it does occur, then we'll certainly benefit from that. So again, we're cautiously optimistic in this space. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Great, thanks, Pierre. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets. Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you, maybe a question on how we should think about Cisco's long-term growth on an adjusted basis, considering Cisco has and will continue to make acquisitions, and increasingly you're taking a fresh look at divesting businesses. So can we return to your 3% to 6% long-term growth rate post the SFA divestiture? And concurrently, how should we start modeling the revenue impact as we transition to subscription and as Cisco moves faster to software? Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Mark. So obviously, when I did Cisco Live, we had assumed the SP video set-top business was still in our portfolio. I think, though, to offset that, as you know, we're very acquisitive, and we will continue to be very acquisitive going forward as we continue to build out our portfolio, especially in areas like software and security. So in terms of your second part of your question, we will clearly break out to you \u2013 we expect to close the deal officially in the December \u2013 January timeframe. And when we give guidance for Q3, we'll make sure it's very transparent so you can adjust your models for what is coming out based on what we were modeling before. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Great, thanks, Mark. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great, thank you very much for taking my question. I wanted to come back to the routing segment. The results this quarter certainly were a bit better than what we were modeling. But when we compare your results to some of your closest competitors, it does appear that at least in their June-ending quarters, they grew a bit faster. So maybe you could help us understand what might be going on in the routing market overall as well as your competitive position and market share. Thank you. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Simon, thanks for the question. So as we think about the SPs right now, I mentioned earlier that we had great success in our high-end platforms that we talked about last year as we began the transition, both of them growing over 100%. As we look at the marketplace today, we did really well in the core. We need to probably improve our performance in our edge routing platforms as we look ahead. But I do think that as we look at where the service providers are going, what they want to do with virtual managed services, how we're aligned now around the deployment of NFV and how we move forward with that, we think that we're well positioned with routing as we look ahead. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Great, thanks, Simon. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo. Jess I. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, guys. I was hoping you could share with us how much of your business is now coming from the Web 2.0 vertical, the trends you're seeing there, how material the opportunity with these customers may be for your prospects in fiscal 2016. And then the service business saw a nice improvement, so any insight as to what drove the improvement there and if there's any reason to believe service growth could accelerate as customers move forward with more complex network architectures. Thanks. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Jess, thanks. So on the MSDC and web players, what I will tell you is that we've spent a great deal of time over the last couple years really understanding what the requirements are, where they're headed, and how we can provide the technology that they need. And I'll tell you, this quarter the top 10 web-scale players, our order growth exceeded 20%, so we're very pleased with where we're going. We actually embarked on some co-development with one of the cloud titans in the last 12 months, and we delivered last quarter a new high-end platform to them as a result of that co-development. So we're pleased with our progress there. We continue to work with them around their unique needs, and we think with our ability to build out scalable solutions with consideration to their unique needs, I think that we're reasonably well positioned. On the services side, we had good performance this quarter at 4%. I think as we look at our customers and they continue to move to the Internet of Everything and connecting devices, they're going to continue to need more and more services. So we're pleased with where we are, and we feel good about our position in the services business going forward. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Great. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from George Notter with Jefferies. George Charles Notter - Jefferies LLC : Hi, thanks very much, guys. I'm somewhat impressed with the growth rates you guys are putting up in the commercial segment, I guess, on year-on-year product orders. You've had a string of fairly attractive year-on-year growth rates. But can you talk about what's going on there? Obviously, Meraki is a part of the story. I know you guys are trying to push that cloud management system onto other products in the portfolio. Can you just talk generally about the initiatives you have going on in commercial and how you keep driving that growth going forward? Thanks. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, George. We always appreciate that question. This is why when we look at our enterprise segment this quarter, it doesn't concern me. When you look at our commercial business, our selling motions, our solutions and everything we do are the same. There's just a much broader base of customers to balance it across. So we grew the global business in commercial 11%. Just a couple other data points for you, our U.S. commercial business this past quarter grew 19%. That's 23 consecutive quarters of positive growth, and 16 of those have been double digits, so we've had very consistent performance. I think the key is that we have really shifted both our solutions and our technology as well as our selling motion and our services capability to be much more tightly aligned with how the technology aligns to our customers' business issues. And I think we're doing that very well in the enterprise, and I think the teams have done a really good job of that in commercial. And those commercial customers, those midrange customers, we see it time and time again. They tend to be the early adopters of our new technology because they view it as a way to accelerate their business, to drive their competitiveness, and they just always seem to adopt early. Meraki has clearly been a big success for us, as I said earlier, relative to exiting Q4 almost on a $1 billion run rate from an order perspective. And we continue to see it being a very relevant portion of particularly the lower end of our commercial market, our K-through-12 market in not only wireless, but also we're seeing an expansion into managed cloud switching as well as security. So we're very pleased with where that is going, and we would expect to continue to add more and more functionality to that platform. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Great. Thanks, George. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks. I appreciate you taking the question. Just very straightforward, if you could, talk about pricing across regions and in general. And, Kelly, can you remind us what cloud times (32:09) are as a percentage of revenue? Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : The cloud, we don't actually share that with you. But if I get back to your pricing question, I'd say what you're going to see this quarter is very similar to what you've seen all year. Our pricing has remained very \u2013 in a tight range. You're going see that our impact on year-over-year points is basically the same as where it was last quarter, so we're not seeing any incremental discounting going on. And again, that's looking across the board. I think our teams have been executing very, very well, especially outside the U.S. where they're facing the FX headwinds, where they're being very disciplined and managing through the currency effect. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Great. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Tim Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. I just wanted to talk a little bit about the emerging markets. It sounds like the U.S. performance has been outstanding, just some of the countries were highlighted as a problem. Could you give us just a little view on how long do you think before we can start to see a more broad-based recovery in the emerging markets, and what pieces of your business do you think are most likely to drive that? Thank you. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Tim, good to hear from you. Thanks for the question. So if you look at the emerging markets, I would tell you that story in Q4 was quite similar to the story in Q3. If we go through the five BRICM countries, Brazil actually was negative 45%. Russia was negative 38%. China was negative 3%, which actually was the best performance we've had in eight quarters. And we had some bright spots. India was plus 5%. Mexico was plus 26%, and Mexico had just a tremendous year in general. And all the emerging countries outside of those five actually grew 3%. So overall it was negative 2%, as we stated. So it's very much the same as it was last quarter. I think that largely they're largely macro and geopolitical issues. We have adjusted our cost structure where needed and we've invested in areas where we've seen growth, as you would expect. And we believe that as the macro and the geopolitical issues resolve themselves, we think we'll be a big beneficiary of that. The other comment I'll just make on emerging is if you just look at the EMEA numbers and you remove Russia, EMEA was actually positive. So it was up plus 1% without Russia. So overall, the emerging continued to be a little bit of a strain. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Great, thanks, Tim. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert W. Baird & Company. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes, thank you, and I guess a follow-up to Europe. How much of that is macro and how much of that is U.S. dollar strength? And then, Chuck, if you can, comment on any head count reductions to start the fiscal year. Cisco has made some cuts the last couple years. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So as we look at Europe, I think that again, there's an emerging markets element associated with it the way we measure EMEA. And also, I think we stated on the last call that we believe that the currency issue may have as much as one to three points, even though we sell primarily in U.S. dollars in most countries. So I will say that I believe our teams have proven over the last several quarters in Europe that they out-execute our peers and our competitors, and that they \u2013 I think if there are macro issues, we'll deal with them. But based on the things that we can control, I think our teams are doing a very good job. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'd like to thank everybody for joining the call today. I want to just quickly summarize. I do believe that we are in a very strong position. I think that was reflected in our results. I think they were differentiated from what you've seen from many of our peers. Again, record revenue and record earnings per share as well as the 21% growth in deferred product revenue as we continue to transition our business to a more predictable while growing revenue and earnings at the same time. I really believe that the transition that our customers are going through in the move to digital and the Internet of Everything will only be successful with the network at the center of that transition, and I really do believe that the best years for Cisco are ahead. So thank you very much for joining the call. Mel? Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Thanks, Chuck. Cisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our FY 2016 first quarter results, will be on Thursday, November 12, 2015, a day later than normal because of Veterans Day, at 1 :30 Pacific Time, 4:30 Eastern Time. Again, I'd like to remind you that in light of Regulation SP, Cisco's policy is to not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it's been through an explicit public disclosure. Thank you for joining our call. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's conference call. If you like to listen to the call in its entirety, you may call 1-866-465-1308.

LLC George Charles Notter - Jefferies LLC Operator : Welcome to Cisco Systems' first quarter and fiscal year 2016 financial results conference call. At the request of Cisco Systems, today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I would like to introduce Melissa Selcher, Vice President of Corporate Communication and Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Thanks, Kim. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's first quarter FY 2016 quarterly conference call. This is Melissa Selcher, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO, and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now you should have seen our earnings release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found on the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. And we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise. The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance that will be provided for the second quarter. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Form 10-K, which identifies important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it's done through an explicit public disclosure. I'll now turn it over to Chuck. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Mel. So Q1 was a very strong quarter across the board. We grew our revenue 4% and delivered non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 9%. We delivered very strong non-GAAP gross margins, and our non-GAAP operating margin was best we've seen in over nine years. I recognize that our Q2 guidance that we just provided is below what the market had expected. In Q1 we saw lower than expected order growth, driven largely by uncertainty from macro and currency impacts, primarily outside the U.S. Despite these headwinds, I believe we are executing incredibly well in a challenging environment. Let me tell you simply how I see it. We had a great quarter, guided to solid growth in Q2, and feel good about our momentum and how we are positioned for the second half of the year. As I look at the big picture, I'm extremely pleased with the speed with which our teams are executing. We have a clear strategy and are confident that we are making the right transitions in our business, investing where we need to for future growth, profitability, and market leadership. Specifically, we are accelerating our ability to deliver on the growth opportunities in front of us. We are driving internal innovation at a record pace. So far in FY 2016 we're seeing a 25% increase in major new product introductions. And three of our internal startups brought solutions to market this quarter working with our key customers. These startups are bringing incredible technology from concept to delivery in under 12 months. Stay tuned next week for announcements around an additional project that we co-developed with one of the world's largest web-scale players. In this quarter alone we closed three acquisitions, recently announced four new acquisitions, and formed three new strategic partnerships. Partners like Apple, Inspur, and Ericsson see Cisco as the market leader they want to work with to move faster and drive greater value to customers and the market. I believe we will see several points of growth from these partnerships over the next few years. We are also aggressively driving our cloud businesses. We've always had a hybrid cloud strategy, and it is increasingly clear that every one of our customers want both public and private cloud capabilities in a hybrid cloud. On the public cloud side, Cisco is a leading provider of infrastructure to web-scale and SP customers as they build out their public cloud infrastructure. As just one data point, our business with the largest web-scale players grew over 20% again this quarter. Within the enterprise, we are winning in private cloud and are focused on automating and driving public cloud economics across our customers' entire infrastructure. We saw this opportunity drive 24% growth in UCS. And our next-generation data center switching portfolio, which is our Nexus 3000, Nexus 9000, and ACI, is now at a $2 billion run rate, with over $500 million in revenue this quarter, growing over 140% year over year with sequential growth of 26%. This performance is much stronger than that of our competitors, who claim they are outpacing and outperforming us. And our own cloud services continue to grow well. WebEx, one of the largest enterprise SaaS applications in the world, grew revenue over 23% this quarter, and we continue to move more of our portfolio to cloud-based delivery models. As we deliver more of our portfolio in software and cloud models, we are driving consistent double-digit growth in deferred revenue. We saw software and subscription product deferred revenue up 36%. Security deferred revenue grew 31%, as we sell next-generation firewall and threat defense software to our over 200,000 firewall customers. Our collaboration deferred revenue grew 18%. And our Meraki cloud networking business, where we deliver networking-as-a-service, grew revenue over 60%. While we still have work to do across our portfolio, I'm incredibly pleased with our continued focus and speed of execution. We will continue to make the necessary strategic moves to drive our success. Over the last quarter, I've spent hundreds of hours with our customers and partners around the world, and they have reaffirmed my confidence in our ability to execute against the opportunity in front of us. While the market continues to move at an accelerated pace, our customers know they must move with speed as they embark on their digital transitions. It's clear to me that they also understand the central and critical role that the network plays in that transition, and they are looking to us be a strategic partner to drive their growth and build their digital organizations, cities, and countries. We are doing the right things to capitalize on this opportunity. And, as I told our teams this past week, I have never been more optimistic. Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more details on our financials. Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Chuck. I am pleased with our execution on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments, and delivering shareholder value. Starting with our first pillar of delivering profitable growth, we saw good top line growth in Q1 with $12.7 billion in total revenue, up 4%. Product revenue grew 4%, with solid growth in switching, data center, wireless, security, and collaboration. More specifically in Q1, switching grew 5%. In addition to the Nexus 3000, Nexus 9000, and ACI momentum of over 140%, we continue to see strength in the Catalyst business. Data center grew 24%, demonstrating our continued market leadership. Wireless grew 7%, driven by the Meraki business. Security was up 7%, with deferred revenue growth of 31%. And collaboration grew 17%, with deferred revenue up 18%. In total, deferred revenue had solid double-digit growth of 10%, with product deferred revenue up 16% and services up 7%. Product deferred revenue, driven by our subscription and software businesses, grew 36%. We do see the transition to subscription revenue accelerating, as I mentioned in the last earnings call. We did see routing decline 8%. We do expect routing revenue to return to growth due to timing of large deals we saw in Q1. Services revenue grew 1%, largely driven by weakness in service provider. Product orders grew 3%, with a book-to-bill below one, which is in line with our typical Q1 but slightly lighter than we had expected. Looking at our geographies, which is the primary way we run our business, Americas grew 1%, EMEA grew 3%, and APJC was up 9%. Total emerging markets grew a very solid 11%, with the BRICs plus Mexico accelerating to 21% growth. In terms of customer segments, service provider grew 6%. Enterprise declined 3% based on the uncertainty from macro challenges, consistent with what others are seeing. Commercial grew 7%, which signals to us the broad strength of our portfolio. Public sector was flat. From a profitability perspective, we delivered record non-GAAP EPS of $0.59, up 9%. GAAP EPS was $0.48. Q1 non-GAAP net income was a record $3 billion, up 8%. GAAP net income was $2.4 billion. We drove the strong profitability with discipline and rigor on gross margins and operating expense. Non-GAAP gross margin was 63.2%, with non-GAAP product gross margin of 62.3% and non-GAAP service gross margin of 66.2%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were well controlled at 32.7% of revenue, and non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 30.5%. We are ensuring we make the right investment and divestment decisions through disciplined portfolio management. Moving on to the second pillar of our financial strategy, which is the work we are doing to manage our portfolio and strategic investments to fuel our key long-term growth areas such as cloud, data center, software, services, and security, we've been very active from an M&A perspective, aligning our investments to key growth areas. We closed three acquisitions in Q1 with OpenDNS and Pawaa in software and security and MaintenanceNet in services. We also announced the acquisitions of Portcullis and Lancope in security, ParStream in data analytics, and 1 Mainstream in cloud-based video. These moves are consistent with our strategy of increasing the investments of our innovation and R&D efforts to our growth areas. Moving on to our third pillar, delivering shareholder value, in Q1 we increased operating cash flow 11% to $2.8 billion. Total cash, cash equivalents, and investments at the end of Q1 were $59.1 billion, with $5 billion available in the U.S. And we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders, comprised of $1.2 billion of share repurchases and $1.1 billion of dividends. The total return to shareholders represents a return of 91% of our free cash flow, more than consistent with our commitment to shareholders of returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually. Overall, Q1 was a strong quarter. As you review the financials, you see good top line growth, record profitability and operating leverage, a very strong balance sheet with growth in deferred revenue, and strong cash generation. We executed well, consistent with our business and financial strategies. Now let me reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Mel referred to earlier. As a reminder, in Q4 we announced an agreement to sell the Client Premises Equipment portion of our SP Video Connected Devices business to Technicolor. The transaction is currently going through regulatory approval, and we are working to close it during the second quarter. In order to provide a clearer view of our continuing expected financial performance, we have normalized our second quarter guidance to exclude the CPE business for both Q2 fiscal year 2016 and Q2 fiscal year 2015. We have provided historical financial information for the CPE business in the slides that accompany this call. So now on to our Q2 guidance, we are executing very well in a challenging global environment, but did see the macro challenges driving uncertainty that impacted our Q1 order growth. As a result, the guidance for Q2, excluding the CPE businesses, is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of zero to 2% year over year. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 62% to 63%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 28.5% to 29.5%. And the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 23%. The tax rate does not include any impact of the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit. If the R&D tax credit is reinstated, we would reflect that benefit in our effective tax rate. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.53 to $0.55. We anticipate our GAAP EPS to be lower than non-GAAP EPS by $0.10 to $0.14. Further details related to this range are included in the slides and press that accompany this call. I'll now turn it back to Chuck to summarize the call. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Kelly. So, as I look back at the last 90 days and my first quarter, I am more optimistic than ever about Cisco's future. Yes, the guidance we just gave for Q2 is lower than what the market had expected, and I don't take that lightly. But for me, nothing has changed in how I feel about the business. We are moving incredibly fast and doing all the right things to drive our growth and strategic relevance. We expect the results of these moves will start showing up in the coming quarters. Every one of our customers, established industry leaders, and disruptive challengers is focused on how they manage, automate, and secure the explosion of connections and data across their digital organization. Our portfolio has never been stronger, more relevant, and more strategic, and we're hearing this directly from our customers and our partners. The opportunity is ours to capitalize on. We have a clear vision and strategy and are executing very well. We are driving internal innovation at a record pace, acquiring strategic assets, co-developing with our customers, and building a new set of strategic partnerships. I believe our speed and execution are truly differentiating us in the market, and we've just begun to scratch the surface of what's possible. Mel, I'll turn it back to you for questions. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Great, thanks. Kim, let's open the line for questions. I'd like to remind all analysts to please ask one question. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank Securities. Your line is open. Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Hi, Chuck. I took over the practice from Brian Modoff. So I'm looking forward to working with you and your team. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Great. Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Can you guys hear me okay? Yes, hi. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, thank you, Vijay. We can hear you. Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Perfect. So, Chuck, my question is around we had done independent checks and had noted near-term weakness in U.S. enterprise. I'd like to get your qualitative color. And I know you work very closely with the sales teams and also with some of your bigger customers. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Vijay, we are having a hard time hearing you. Could you speak a little louder? Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes, can you hear me okay? Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Yes. Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, perfect. I think my question was around we did independent checks with the channel, who had noted near-term order weakness, U.S. enterprise in particular. Could you give us qualitative color from your end? Is it just endemic weakness, customers just pushing out because their own near-term fundamentals are weak like the U.S. industrials, or is it relating to any indecision around migration to public clouds? I'd like to get your commentary on the weakness you noted in enterprise. Thanks. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Vijay, and tell Brian hello when you see him. So relative to the enterprise, we actually are very comfortable with the situation in the U.S. We did see weakness particularly outside the United States and particularly in Asia-Pacific. We saw weakness in Canada as well as Latin America. And we didn't see any impact that was different this quarter from public cloud. We think our customers are moving to a hybrid cloud environment, which I think is indicative of the $0.5 billion that we did in our next-generation data center switching portfolio this quarter. And so we're actually very comfortable with our portfolio. If you think about our U.S. commercial business and then our global commercial business, our U.S. commercial business was up 12%, and it is a good proxy of how our portfolio is playing in that space. And we firmly believe that if there was a significant difference in the transition of workloads to public cloud, we would see it there first. So we're very comfortable with our enterprise strategy right now. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Great. Thanks, Vijay. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes, hi. Can you hear me? Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: We can, Simona. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I wanted to ask you a couple questions on margins. So first, they came in pretty strong in the quarter even though routing was weaker, and that tends to be a higher margin product line. So I was just curious what drove that upside. And a bit of a question related to that, Chuck, is that you've had margins exceeding expectations for a few quarters now, and in the meantime your growth is decelerating quite a bit here. Some of that is driven by FX and international issues. Do you feel like you're dialing that equation sufficiently in the direction of revenue growth versus margin preservation? Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Simona, it's a very good question. Thank you. I'm going to give a couple comments, and then I'm going to ask Kelly to chime in. First of all, I think that we talked about and I think it's well documented that there are some currency issues around the world, and I think our teams have done an incredible job of managing that. And we did see our gross margins, non-GAAP gross margins very strong this quarter. So we constantly look at the balance of investments in areas, and we're actively investing in those areas that are providing growth for us like security and in certain countries and in our Meraki portfolio. But it's something that we'll continue to look at. Kelly, comments on gross margins? Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yes, I'd say just to add to that, Simona, this is a big focus for us and all of our business units. But if you look at when you'll see in our 10-Q, we have our typical range. Our pricing has been holding in our typical range, which is a good sign. Where we saw the upside from a year-over-year perspective here is we just had really, really strong productivity this quarter in gross margins on the product side. That drove a lot of the benefit. Again, it's what the engineering teams are working on. It's what supply chain is driving. So it's part of what we're driving to offset the competitive pressures that we have naturally in the tech space. So I'd say it's definitely good execution by the team. The way that we make sure also that we're not doing a tradeoff like you mentioned because we are driving for growth and profits is we look at things like win rates. We look at things like obviously market share. So we're making sure we're making the right tradeoffs to get the wins that we want, and balancing that because it is all about growth as well as profits. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Great. Thanks, Simona. Operator, next question. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Hey, Mark. Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Mark. Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Looking at it at a high level \u2013 hi. How are you? If I look at it at a high level, the company has gone through many rounds of layoffs and reorgs, and we've seen this impact other tech companies such as IBM and HP. So having said that, do you feel that we should see some accelerated innovation coming out of Cisco over the next \u2013 as we look towards the back half? Product Catalyst, for example, pipeline of innovation, if you could, give us those positive things to look for in the second half. Thank you. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Mark, that's a great question, and I actually thank you very much for asking it. As I said in my opening comments, we have in our engineering organization, we've really focused on smaller agile teams that are moving more quickly. You're going to see some innovation, as I said, that's going to come out next week. You're going to see a nice steady stream of new products in the market. In fact, one of the comments I made was that I feel like we are very well positioned for the second half, and that's one of the key reasons, is that we have a good new product pipeline. So I think you will be very pleased with the innovation that comes out over the next few months. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Thanks, Mark. Kim, next question. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup Global Markets. James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you very much and congratulations to you and your team. My question is that I believe, unless my memory is wrong, that you had a long-term organic sales growth rate of about 3% to 6%. I think that might have been the case. And the outlook now is zero to 2%. Can you help us understand or quantify it? Is some of this due to FX, and how much? And it looks like probably service provider is also driving that down. So maybe Ericsson new partnership you have can help out at some point. Just help us bridge the gap of the zero to 2% outlook for the next quarter versus your long-term goal of 3% to 6%. Thank you. Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : So I'll start addressing that question, and I'll hand it over to Chuck on the Ericsson question. So from an FX perspective, us like every other multinational are feeling the impact of the strength of the U.S. dollar. For us it's a little more difficult to quantify because we sell 90% of our products in U.S. dollars. But I can tell you when I look at the countries that we do sell in local currency, which for us is Australia, Canada, and parts of Japan, for those countries alone where I can quantify it, it was almost two points of just pure translation on our top line growth. So for the rest of our business that's sold outside the U.S., there is certainly an impact. It's just hard for us to quantify it directly. So again, we try to see if we're getting less \u2013 if the demand is under pressure by the number of deals that we have in the pipeline or things along those lines, as well as if we see pressure from our sales teams to discount heavily. So what I'd say is yes, us like every other multinational is feeling the impact of the strength of the U.S. dollar, but I think our sales teams are executing extremely well through that and being able to sell the value of our solutions despite that. So for sure, identified two points on just the few countries that we have, and there's I'm sure more \u2013 three to four points or more even besides that that we can't put our finger on. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And, Jim, just a couple comments. You mentioned the zero to 2%. That's our guidance for Q2, and I think the 3% to 6% you mentioned is what Kelly presented as a long-term model at the last financial analyst conference. On the SP side, I'll just make a couple of comments that we're very pleased with our performance there. We've had the second quarter in a row of growth. The teams are executing very well. And you're right, the partnership that we announced with Ericsson really leverages their strength in radio, in OSS, BSS, and network management inside ESP as well as their real scale from a services perspective around the world. And when you combine that with our strength in IP and data center and networking and security, we think that it's a good combination. Our customers believe that they're actually quite pleased with the partnership that we put together. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Great. Kim, next question. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America Securities. Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes, hi. I have two questions and I'll ask them. Hopefully, you can answer at least a part of the second one. Switching was very weak the past few quarters on a sequential basis. It was sub-seasonal last quarter also, but this quarter was very strong. And I'm wondering if you can give a little bit of color on what's going right and what's going wrong and how sustainable is the strength in switching. And the second question which is related but not related, your service growth is below your product growth if I sum up the last four quarters. And you mentioned it a little bit at the beginning of your opening comments. So if you can just clarify, why is it happening? Thanks. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, Tal, let me take the first one and then I'll let Kelly go into some of the numbers. The switching, I think the biggest thing that I've talked about over the last few months is that we've been going through this transition in the next-generation data center. If you think about what happens in the data center is you've got the traditional data center switching architecture, and then you've got our compute platforms that we sell, and then we have the next-generation data center switching architecture. And the historical architecture we know has been declining as customers transition. Our UCS business was up 24% this quarter, so we're very pleased with those results. And then if you look at the next-generation data center, that's the business that we said eclipsed $0.5 billion this quarter, growing at 140%. So what I've said about our switching business is that in the second half of the year, we expect the inflection point between the next-generation volume and the historical generation to hit \u2013 we expect to hit that inflection point. So I think you're seeing that next-generation switching in the data center continued to contribute to some of the improvement that you saw. And frankly, we've also had some reasonable performance in the campus. On the services \u2013 or any other comments on switching and then the services, Kelly? Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : I think you hit it right on, on switching. And on services, yes, it was up 1%, which is obviously on the lower end of what we were looking for. And it's driven by a couple things, and we've talked about this before. It is isolated largely within service revenue, the service provider segment within there. So the service providers have been a headwind for us up until the last quarter or so. So the model typically it takes longer for services to feel the impact when the product side goes down, the same way it takes a little bit longer, a few quarters, before they start to see it when the section, the product side comes up. So we're seeing some of that as well as just the service provider segment in general. They're going through a lot of transition as well. So that's a tough segment for us. But it's largely isolated to that. The only other piece I'll add to that is we are feeling very good about the outlook in services. If you look at our services deferred revenue, that went up 7% year over year this quarter, which is $600 million-plus, almost $700 million, and that's the strongest growth we've seen on that metric for a while. So we feel good about more multiyear deals coming in and future revenue coming from that. But, clearly, this quarter at 1%, it's on the low end and isolated to the service provider section. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Great. Thanks, Tal. Kim, next question. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Pierre. Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, Chuck. Thank you for taking my question. I'd like to come back on your gross margin. So you're up more than one point sequentially, one point above what you had guided for. And at the same time, so you have subscription and licensing deferred revenue up very significantly, I think 36%. So my first question would be could you give us a bit of a break-up of what are the important drivers of the positive surprise in gross margin? And then my second question is, when I look at your guidance for next quarter, so you guide 63%, 62% to 63%. I guess you are going to be exiting the set-top box business. So from like you said, 63% level this quarter, it almost feels like not very challenging guidance. So am I missing maybe some kind of sequential headwinds on that number? Thank you. Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Right, okay. Thanks, Pierre. That's a great question. So, first, to your last point, we definitely have seasonality in our gross margins, if you look back. Typically, Q2s and Q4s have lower gross margins, driven by our mix. Those are very, very big quarters for us on the UCS side, on our data center business. So that's a big part of what's driving it. And conversely, Q2s and Q4s (sic) [Q1s and Q3s] are typically higher. Now I would say again, we had very, very good execution across the board on gross margins, and again, driven by the performance by the teams on the productivity side. So, again, that will continue to help. When I go to Q2 guidance, you picked right up on it. Q1 still had the set-top box business in it. In my guidance for Q2, I completely removed the set-top box business, which is why it's up a full point of our typical guidance of 61% to 62%. We're now up to 62% to 63% for that benefit. So just to remind you, when we get rid of that business, which we are working to close this quarter, we'll see a benefit of approximately a point on gross margin, about 0.5 point on operating margin rate, and very negligible at the EPS level of things flowing through. So we're baking that in the guidance since my guidance excludes that altogether. But overall, again I just attribute it to the disciplined work on VCP on the productivity side as well as the sales teams being very disciplined on pricing. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Great. Thanks, Pierre. Kim, next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley Investment Research. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much, just a couple of questions. First, Chuck, I'm just wondering if you can give a little more color on routing. If I'm understanding you correctly, it sounds like there may just be some timing issues that made the first quarter, the October quarter look a little bit weaker, but you expect that to bounce back strongly. And maybe you can give a little color on outlook how we should think about routing developing as we go through calendar 2016. And then my second question is somewhat related. I'm just trying to get a sense for how we should think about security. I know that's been a sector or segment that's been growing slower than the market. It's clearly a point of emphasis for Cisco. I was just wondering how we should think about that and your efforts there starting to manifest themselves. Thank you. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: All right, James, thanks. I hope you all noticed that we're actually accepting two questions now. I think that \u2013 so good questions. On the routing side, James, you nailed it. It's a timing issue. We had good order growth. Our new routing platforms, the new platforms that we've introduced were up in triple-digits again from an orders' perspective. So we do expect that that will bounce back. And we also have some \u2013 as I said in the earlier comments, we also have some new introductions that will be coming out in the next week or so, so you'll see that. So we feel pretty reasonably well about our routing performance over the coming quarters. From a security perspective, I think that the team has done a great job. They've integrated the Sourcefire malware capabilities into it, into our firewalls and into some of our routing platforms. So they've done the hard integration work. Last quarter, we added over 2,000 new AMP customers, which is the advanced malware solution. We now have over 8,000 customers there. The revenue grew 7% but our deferred grew 31% as they continue to transition the business to more of a software and subscription. And the team is pretty confident that in the second half of the year we can be back in the mid to high teens from a revenue growth in security. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Great, thanks. Operator, next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Brent Bracelin with Pacific Crest. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Brent. Brent Bracelin - Pacific Crest : Hey, how are you? I'll squeeze in two and we'll go from there. Chuck, for you real quickly, APAC growth 3%, that's the best growth rate you've seen in two years. So what's driving the reversal on APAC relative to orders this quarter? And then, Kelly, if you could talk a little bit more about this shift to software subscriptions accelerating. Obviously, what does that mean from a revenue growth standpoint per your guide? And obviously, your op margins at the highest in what, nine years, what does that mean from an op margin perspective? Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: You take it, Kelly, on the numbers, and then I'll give some color around Asia. Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Absolutely. So, yes, I'll hit the software subscription one. So this is a big focus of us both from the acquisitions that we're doing. As you see, most of those have been SaaS businesses or software businesses, as well as internal development. So we've really been focused on driving our software and enterprise agreements across the board, and I think you're seeing that translate onto our balance sheet that we will benefit from. When I look at the amount of our revenue coming off the balance sheet on the product side, it continues to increase, and that's how we're driving all our business units to continue to find those and build those solutions. I'd say Meraki is a good example in our Cloud Networking group, where basically a third of their business gets deferred the way they sell their solution. So we're going to see more and more of that as we go forward, and we'll see the benefit of that not only on more predictable revenue but also strong margins. I'd say on the operating margin, to address that, again we had \u2013 it was a great quarter for operating margin. I would say again where we talked about the benefit we're seeing on gross margins, we are being disciplined to make the right tradeoffs. We're going to fluctuate always between quarters, but we are again driving for that profitable growth. And we are looking relentlessly for efficiencies so we can fund the investment into the internal R&D and go to market. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Brent, you indirectly asked, so I'm going to give a little color on what we see going on in Asia. It's really a mixed story from just a performance perspective. China, we have been working and investing in for years, and we've been very focused there over the last few years. And we actually had a very strong quarter in China from an orders perspective, growing over 40% this quarter. Likewise in India, where we've been focused on a lot of country digitization efforts there with the Prime Minister and many of the ministries, and they really see the value of technology and what it can do for their country, it too was up over 40%. Then when you look at the rest of Asia, it was a real challenge. I believe it was negative 8% for the rest. And we did see some uncertainty creep in relative to those countries, particularly who had trading relationships with China, and also we saw the ripple-through effect of the China currency devaluation. And predominantly \u2013 or let me say, we saw it in some of the Asia countries in particular because they have such trading relationships. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Great. Thanks, Brent. Kim, next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Kvaal with Nomura Securities International. Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Yes, thanks very much. I wanted to throw my two in as well. Chuck, maybe this is less of a question than giving you an opportunity to talk about the second half. It sounds like you have a few irons in the fire that you're excited about. I'm cognizant that new product introductions usually take two-plus quarters to get going, so I imagine there's something else up your sleeve there a little bit. And then Kelly, I was wondering. Could you help us perhaps understand a little bit in more detail the impact of the mix shift to subscription billing, how much that is costing you in terms of revenue growth, and when you think that it may normalize so that the revenue growth matches the deferred revenue growth? Thanks. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Jeff. So on the second half, my position right now is that I feel like we're incredibly well positioned, particularly relative to the things we control in our portfolio. I've stated that I think that that inflection point in our data center switching, which has been a challenge for us for many quarters, we believe that will happen in the second half of the year. We've got new product introductions coming out across security, data center, as well as routing and others, so there's probably more innovation pipeline than we've seen in quite a while. I mentioned earlier that our team is pretty confident that our security business from a revenue perspective will get back into the mid-teens in the second half of the year. And frankly, we believe that some of the acquisition activity as well as the strategic partnerships could show up and begin to contribute positively perhaps sometime in the second half of the year. So I am cautiously optimistic, and I think I just feel like we're well positioned relative to our portfolio and what we control. Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : And to the second part there on how to think about the subscription and software part of the business, I would say you're going to see it a couple ways. I think the amount that we see translate onto our income statement or amortize off on the product side is just going to continue to accelerate. It's been growing in the 15% to 20% every quarter, and that's just going to continue as we look forward because we are growing our SaaS businesses. We are adding to our SaaS businesses with acquisitions. And I'd say on the other parts of our business that haven't traditionally been monetizing through software or licenses, we're coming up with all kinds of different offers that our customers are interested in. So I'd say we're going to see both the balance sheet deferred side grow. It will continue to be a larger part of our product revenue, growing double digits, but it's still in the 5% to 6% range as of right now on our product revenue. But that will grow in double digits going forward for many quarters. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Great, thanks. Kim, next question. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James & Associates. Victor W. Chiu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi, this is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. I'd like to ask about trends in public cloud migrations. Some of the networking names that we follow have recently begun to flag the migration of applications from enterprise data centers to the public cloud as a secular headwind for their core business. So can you speak to the trends that you've observed and how that's impacting Cisco or how you envision that impacts your results going forward? Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Victor. Thank you. That's a great question. So the way we see it is that our customers we believe are really committed to a hybrid cloud model. They see workloads that make tremendous sense to be in the public cloud, and then their mission-critical high-performance applications that they will continue to run in a private cloud. And we believe that we can provide the bridge for those customers. And I think if you look at our UCS growth and you look at our next-gen data center growth, that would suggest that customers are still building out data centers and still building out private cloud to take advantage of the requirements they have in high-performance applications, security, mission-critical nature. So we think it's going be both, and we have a strategy that not only is focused on providing the best infrastructure that we can to those public and service providers who are providing web and cloud services as well as a private cloud as well as the elements of our portfolio where it makes sense to be delivered as a cloud service, we'll continue to make those moves like we have with Meraki as well as security as well as collaboration. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Great. Thanks, Simon. Kim, next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. Just to head back to switching for a minute, a two-parter. On the campus side, it sounds like that was pretty strong in the quarter as well. What are you seeing? Is it Wi-Fi? What are you seeing drive that, and how sustainable do you think it is? Then on the data center side, it sounds like regaining some market share there. What do you think is helping with the greater than industry growth rate that you're seeing currently from the likes of the Nexus 3000, the Nexus 9000, and the ACI? Is it platform? Is it performance? What do you think is driving that? Thank you. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Tim. Thanks for the questions. So in the campus environment, we've seen several drivers over the last few quarters. This whole move to the Internet of Things and the connectivity of more and more devices, some of which are connected hard-wired, others which are just increasing the wireless spectrum and the bandwidth required, the transition into wireless access to higher speeds like 802.11ac, as well as the strength we've seen in our video endpoint business also translates through to, in many cases, refreshes of the networking infrastructure. And then finally, I think we see customers who are trying to beef up their security and are looking at some of the features that we can build into our campus platforms to increase their security. So those are some of the drivers that we see there. Looking at data center, I think frankly, the teams have just built an incredible architecture. And it is built to really lower the operating costs and increase our customers' ability to implement policy in the data center in an automated way. I think they've also built incredible high-performance platforms and have given the customer the choice of both merchant as well as high-performance ASICs, and I think that the customers are seeing it. In the Nexus 9000 we added another 900 customers in the quarter. And we're now over 5,000 customers with our Nexus 9000, and it's the fastest ramping data center product that we've ever had. So I think it's a testament to what the teams have built. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Great. Kim, next question. Operator : The next question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert W. Baird. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. Thank you. Chuck, I wanted to ask you to comment on the storage market given the acquisition of EMC or planned acquisition of EMC. Do you need to own storage IP? Or maybe the better question is does it make sense for Cisco to own some storage IP given the pace of innovation in storage and your success with UCS, or is status quo the best plan forward from here? Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Jayson, thanks for the question. So as we look at the future and we look across our entire portfolio candidly, we are assessing what our customers need from us and what solutions they'd like to see from us. And then we will leverage R&D. We'll leverage M&A. We'll leverage co-development. We'll leverage strategic partnerships, and we'll move on any one of those fronts across any area that we need to fulfill the solutions that our customers are looking for. Specifically, the area you asked about, to date, a partnering strategy has been sufficient for what we need. But you can assume that we are constantly looking at that and other areas and what we need to add to our portfolio. And then we determine whether we're going to do it via acquisition or partnership. But our partnerships so far with IBM, Hitachi, EMC, NetApp, et cetera, have been very positive for us, as you can see through our UCS ramp over the years. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Great. Thanks, Jayson. Kim, next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen & Company. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks. Chuck, you mentioned that your largest web-scale customers were up by over 20% again this quarter. It implies that's been the historical trend, but that's the question. What has been the historical trend? Is that the right number? If you can give us insight on that. And then I've got a question about OpEx as a percentage of revenue going forward for Kelly. What we should expect? Is there more you could do in terms of further improvement? And finally, just quickly employee turnover, both desirable and not desirable, can you update us on that? Thank you. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: All right, Paul. Now you're getting carried away. I'm just kidding. So let me take the first one on the web-scale side. I think I've talked about it in various forums that we really in the last 12 to 15 months I think really began to embark on building products and working with the web-scale players in a very unique way to make sure that our products really reflected the things that were important to them. So we've only talked about our growth there for the last couple of quarters. We haven't really focused on it for a while, but I'll tell you that it's really in last year and a half when we really got I think serious with them about building the solutions that they really are looking for. And I think that the growth that we're seeing right now as well as some of the co-development that you're going to see coming out is reflective of that focus. Kelly, on the OpEx? Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : On the OpEx, so on the OpEx, Paul, we are obviously driving that hard and managing it well. I will say though and just in full disclosure, as you would expect, much of the FX headwinds we're feeling on the top line, we are benefiting from on the OpEx side as well. So we're balancing both of those things. And for this quarter it was a couple hundred million dollars. So I'd say that we will make the tradeoff on OpEx to balance what the business is facing on margins and top line and everything else because we are being very focused on where we're putting those investment dollars to make sure we are putting the R&D dollars in where the innovation is. So I think what you can take away is that OpEx as a percentage might change as currency changes, but we will manage within there very tightly and disciplined in terms of balancing it with the rest of the business. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Great, thanks. Kim, next question. Operator : Your next question comes from George Notter with Jefferies. George Charles Notter - Jefferies LLC : Hi, thanks very much, guys. Earlier you gave a customer count number on the Nexus 9000. I guess I was just curious about the ACI version of that product. It's a number I think you've given in the past. And then also, I wanted to dig down into currency a little bit more. Kelly, I think you gave a nice comment on the translation impact on currency, and I think there were some comments about Asia and some of the transactional impacts as well. But I guess just digging into your numbers historically, particularly on the BRIC countries, I get the sense that the BRIC countries, some of them like Brazil, Russia, where you've had a real severe impact, you've seen big down comparisons for a period of time now. I guess I'm wondering. Have you hit a bottom in some of those areas of the world and the foreign exchange currency impacts starts to come off over time. So how big is the impact and when does it come off is the question. Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : So what I was referencing \u2013 again, I think for sure the impact that we can see in the countries where we sell in local currency, which is only a few countries, is about two points. So for all the other countries, including the emerging markets and Europe, it's hard for us because we sell in dollars to really quantify the impact, but there's certainly impact on demand. You're right about Brazil and Russia. They have been challenged for some time. I think the growth in our emerging being up 11% is largely driven by the strength of India and Mexico, which have been very strong for the last five quarters, and now adding onto that China with having broad-based strength is really driving that back up. If I back out the BRICM countries, the rest of the emerging markets are I would say not really growing. They're flattish to up to 3% when I exclude the BRICM countries because they are feeling that impact I would say of currency. And I think there's still the uncertainty if the U.S. raises interest rates what that will further do to U.S. dollar strength. So it's tough to have the full-view quantification of it, but we do think if the rates stayed where they are today, it might get a little easier of a headwind as we move forward through the year. And now it's just I think the uncertainty enterprises are feeling as well as interest rate uncertainty going forward. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And, George, let me circle back to the first question you asked on the ACI. I think you asked the ACI version of the Nexus 9000. I think where we're focused right now is actually looking at customers who are deploying ACI in general, so let me give you that data point. We added 200 more APIC customers, which are those customers that are deploying the policy engine that takes advantage of ACI, and we're over 1,100 customers now that have the APIC. So that's the number that I think you were looking for. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : All right, Chuck, I think that was our last question. Do you want to close? Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, first of all, I want to thank everyone for spending time with us today. And I would close by highlighting three things. The first, I really believe that we are executing incredibly well in a somewhat challenging market. The second is we had very strong execution in our results in Q1. We have solid growth for Q2, and we feel like we're very well positioned again for the second half of the year. The third is we will continue to move very fast in positioning ourselves for future growth opportunities, and I feel very good about how we're positioned in general. So thank you for spending time with us today and I look forward to talking to many of you soon. Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer : Great, thanks.

Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Operator : Welcome to Cisco Systems' second quarter and fiscal year 2016 financial results conference call. At the request of Cisco Systems, today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Marilyn Mora - Director-Global Investor Relations, Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Kim. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's second quarter fiscal 2016 quarterly conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. And I am joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO, and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found on the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we will discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. Please note that during Q2, on November 20 we completed the sale of the Customer Premises Equipment [CPE] portion of our SP Video Connected Devices [VCD] business to Technicolor. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP, and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from both the Q2, fiscal 2016, and historical results. We are providing Q2, fiscal 2016, and historical financial information for the SP Video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help to understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q1 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way. With that, I'd like to go ahead and turn it over to Chuck. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Marilyn. We delivered a strong Q2 in a challenging macro environment. Recently, we've experienced one of the most volatile times in the global markets. This volatility led to a slowdown in spending impacting our business, especially during the last few weeks of January as we closed our quarter. Despite this slowdown, we executed very well, with total revenue growth of 2% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 8%, strong margins, and operating cash flow up 36%. Our ability to deliver strong profitability in a challenging environment reflects the operating leverage we've created in our business over the last several years. Our portfolio is more strategic than ever to companies and countries that are digitizing everything. As billions of things become connected, creating massive amounts of data, Cisco is playing an increasingly critical role, enabling our customers to drive their priorities with industry-leading security. Cisco is unique in our ability to connect everything for our customers, from the sensor to the data center, with security and analytics. As a result, our conversations are no longer just in IT. They have become prevalent in the C-suite and the boardroom. When I took this role two quarters ago, I discussed my focus on accelerating our innovation engine and portfolio transformation to execute on the opportunity ahead of us. I believe we are executing well, and I would like to highlight our momentum in four key areas. First, we are defining the next generation of networking, beginning with the data center with our ACI platform providing the automation and programmability for our customers' most critical business applications, with the scale, speed, and security they require. In just two years, we have built ACI to a $2 billion run rate business that grew once again last quarter over 100%. We are aggressively focused on winning in the 10-gig, 40-gig, and 100-gig transition, and firmly establishing our leadership in the next-generation data center. Second, security remains the most critical priority for our customers. And as everything connects, it makes the network even more relevant. As the largest security provider, we have been focused on driving the growth of this business, while at the same time migrating our model from a primarily hardware business to a software and services business. In Q2, not only did our security business grow 11%, but our security deferred revenue grew 26%. Third, we saw double-digit growth in our cloud-based SaaS businesses, specifically WebEx, Meraki Cloud Networking, and security. You are seeing us move more of our portfolio to be delivered in both on-premise and cloud-based models, and we are aggressively driving this transition. And fourth, we are using M&A to augment our internal innovation in key growth areas. In the last 12 months, we have added critical capabilities and talent in the growth areas of cloud, security, SaaS, IoT, and analytics. Our recently announced acquisition of Jasper combined with our other capabilities is a strong example of how we will play unique and strategic role in unlocking the value of IoT. We will enable our customers to monetize the data from the billions of sensors and connections with the security, speed, and reliability they have come to expect from Cisco. Our momentum reflects the uniqueness of our business model and our ability to weather volatility while accelerating innovation in key markets to drive our long-term growth. Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more detail on our financials. Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Chuck. I am pleased with our continued execution on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments, and delivering shareholder value. Starting with delivering profitable growth, total revenue was $11.8 billion, up 2%, with product revenue growth of 2%, led by growth in security, routing, and collaboration. In switching, as Chuck mentioned, we are driving the next-generation data center architectures and are very pleased with our ACI momentum. The 4% decline in switching was largely driven by macro weakness in our campus business, something that we've observed in the past during volatile times as customers pause spending decisions. We saw our routing business grow 5%, driven by double-digit growth in our CRS platforms, with particular strength in mobility and web-scale service provider. Collaboration grew 3%, driven by 17% growth in WebEx, partially offset by some slowdown in our Unified Communications business. Deferred revenues showed continued strength, growing 15%. Our data center decline of 3% was also driven by a slowdown in spend. In addition, we had tough comparisons from Q2 2015 when revenue grew 40%. UCS continues to be a strong franchise for us and is a foundational piece of our next-generation data center stack. Wireless was flat as a result of declines in our access point controller business, offset by strong growth in our cloud-based Meraki platform. SP Video grew 37%, largely driven by strength in China. Security grew 11%, with deferred revenue growth of 26%. We had strong growth in our advanced threat security and Web security solutions, which grew over 180% and 40% respectively. We added over 2,000 customers on our AMP advanced malware solution, bringing the total customer base to over 10,000. Services revenue grew 3%, and we continued to show very good progress against our goal of driving more recurring revenue. Deferred revenue had solid growth of 8% in total, with product up 11% and service up 7%. The portion of our product deferred revenue which is related to our recurring software and subscription businesses grew 34%. In total, product orders grew 2%. Our book-to-bill was approximately one. Looking at our geographies, which is the primary way we run our business, Americas was flat, EMEA declined 1%, and APJC grew 17%. Total emerging markets grew 7%, with the BRICs plus Mexico [BRICM] showing strength at up 17%, with China up 64% and India up 23%. Total emerging minus the BRICM countries was down 3%. In terms of customer segments, enterprise declined 2% and commercial grew 4%, both of which were impacted by macro uncertainty. Public sector was flat and service provider grew 5%. We drove strong profitability, with discipline and rigor on gross margins and operating expense. Non-GAAP gross margin was 64.2%, with non-GAAP product gross margin of 63.3% and non-GAAP service gross margin of 66.7%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 33% of revenue, and non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 31.2%. We will remain disciplined with our operating expenses and portfolio management. From a profitability perspective, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.57, up 8%, with $0.015 attributable to a lower non-GAAP tax rate resulting from the permanent reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit. From a GAAP perspective, EPS was $0.62. In addition to the typical reconciling items between GAAP and non-GAAP EPS, there were three material items to call out which we excluded from our non- GAAP results : the gain on the sale of the SP Video CPE business; the impact of the settlement of federal tax audit; and prior-year fiscal year impact of the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit. The total impact of these and other immaterial items was a benefit to GAAP EPS of $0.13. Q2 non-GAAP net income was $2.9 billion, up 8%. GAAP net income was $3.1 billion. So moving on to shareholder value, in Q2 we delivered operating cash flow of $3.9 billion, up 36%. Total cash, cash equivalents, and investments at the end of Q2 were $60.4 billion, with $3.9 billion available in the U.S. In the first half of fiscal year 2016, we returned $4.6 billion or 75% of our free cash flow to our shareholders, comprised of $2.5 billion of share repurchases and $2.1 billion of dividends. Today we announced a 24% or a $0.05 increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.26 per share. This represents a yield of approximately 4.6% based on today's closing price. We also announced a $15 billion increase to the authorization of the share repurchase program, raising the remaining share repurchase authorization to approximately $16.9 billion. This significant dividend increase and additional share repurchase authorization reinforces our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. Overall, Q2 was a solid quarter in a volatile macro environment. We saw good top line growth, strong profitability, and operating leverage. We continue to shift our business model to more software and subscription recurring revenue. Let me now reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. Q3 does include an extra week, which occurs every five to six years for us. We have factored this extra week into our guidance for both revenue and expenses. Although it is difficult to forecast the impact of the extra week, we have assumed roughly a 2% year-over-year impact on total revenue growth along with approximately $40 million of incremental cost of sales and $110 million of operating expenses. The guidance for Q3 is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 1% to 4% year over year, normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from Q3 fiscal year 2015. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 62.5% to 63.5%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 28.5% to 29.5%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.54 to $0.56. We anticipate our GAAP EPS to be lower than the non-GAAP EPS by $0.08 to $0.12. Further details to this range are included in the slides and press release that accompany this call. I'll now turn it back over to Chuck to summarize the call. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Kelly. Let me quickly summarize. While macro growth has clearly slowed, the speed with which technology is changing every industry and every country has not slowed, and we are moving full speed ahead. This speed coupled with our innovation, strategic partnerships, and our M&A capabilities will allow us to meet the expectations of our customers and lead into the future. On this front, I feel very confident, and that conviction about our future business is what led us to increase our dividend by 24%. My confidence in our future is confirmed every day by CEOs, boards, and country leaders as we preview our strategy and roadmaps. They see the next-generation data center and cloud architectures we're building on UCS and ACI. They see our extensive security portfolio that protects them before, during, and after an attack. They see the IoT and analytics platforms that will enable them to act on and monetize data and connections, and they want us to be their strategic partner as they drive their digital agendas. They trust us. They value our innovation, and they believe our portfolio is critical to their ability to execute on their vision. Our customers and countries around the world know this move to digital is real, and it's happening now. As we help them through this transition, you will see us operate on two fronts. In the near term, you will continue to see us to be a well-run company that executes even in challenging markets. Longer term, we will continue to make the right investments that will accelerate our growth as our customers embrace and adopt this next wave of technology. Marilyn, I'll turn it back to you for questions. Marilyn Mora - Director-Global Investor Relations, Cisco Systems, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Chuck. Kim, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. And while Kim is doing that, I'd like to remind the audience that, all analysts, we ask you to please ask one question. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from Pierre Ferragu with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, thank you for taking my question. Chuck, really what I'd like to understand is your perspective on the macro environment. So first of all, so you of course see Bloomberg TV and read the Financial Times, as we all do. But what do you see \u2013 what can you see through Cisco as you get feedback from your channels, from your salesforce, or country managers? What do they really tell you about and what color can you bring us that we don't necessarily see from where we are? And also on the same front, on the macro environment, your guide for next quarter, what kind of macro scenario have you baked in? Would you qualify that as prudent, very prudent? And if you can take us through the thought process of how you came up with that guidance, that would be very helpful. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, Pierre. Hey, thanks for the question, good to hear from you. So on the macro front, I think the thing that I can tell you is that as we began last quarter, we certainly have a set of expectations as we have run our business for a long time and really know what to expect. And our expectations were obviously based on the discussions we had with all of you at the end of our first quarter. And I would tell you that through the first 10 weeks of the quarter, that was very much in line with what we expected. We were executing very much in line with how we would have expected the quarter to go. And our week 10, just so you have the data point, was the end of the calendar year. So while a number of companies have reported earlier this year, not many have actually had their quarter end in January, so we ended at the end of the third week of January, which we all know those first three weeks were reflective of the uncertainty that occurred in a lot of the financial markets. And so what I will tell you is that after week 10 through those three weeks, we saw customers as they were trying to just digest what was going on, they just paused a bit. And you see customers say I want to just wait and see what's going on. Let me take a look at this, we want to understand this a little better. And I think to Kelly's point when she talked about the switching business, the campus refresh opportunities that have been actually pretty consistent for us over the last few quarters, we saw customers say hey, our infrastructure is working, so we're going to just hold on that for some period of time and let's see where things go. So that's probably the extent that I can add to what we all know from what we're seeing every day. What I would tell you, and I'll ask Kelly to comment on our guidance, is I would say that we took that sort of feeling of those first three weeks into consideration as we built our guidance, and that's what we based it on is what the last three weeks of last quarter led us to relative to this level of uncertainty. Kelly, any comments? Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : I think to your question, Pierre, I think Chuck summarized it well. When we do our guidance, we look at everything we know at the time, which is our funnel, the momentum we see and everything else. So I'd say to put it in the words you used, I'd say that our guidance is prudent. I think you see that we expanded our range to three points of range versus our normal two points just because I think it is more volatile than normal. And so I'd go with prudent based on what we see right now. Marilyn Mora - Director-Global Investor Relations, Cisco Systems, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Pierre. Operator, we'll go ahead and take our next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, Kelly. Hi, Chuck. Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Vijay. Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: My question is around Cisco is a tale of two cities here. We're seeing enterprise products trending light versus consensus, while your service provider products, routing, video, et cetera, are beating expectations. I'd like to get your view on this enterprise versus service provider dichotomy, if any. And then you have a bigger picture strategy around software and you're cutting services, fully believing that strategy and model. So my question is really around, do you see IT spending skewing quickly towards OpEx versus the traditional CapEx model of spending? And how would Cisco be levered to this higher than usual OpEx IT spending moving forward? Thanks. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thanks, Vijay. I would say the initial question you asked relative to the difference between the enterprise and service provider space, I think what we saw was that our customers were spending in areas that are incredibly mission-critical for them even in these times where there's uncertainty. So you see them continuing to spend in security. You see them continuing to spend in the next-generation data center evolution, which was indicative of the 100% growth we saw in that portion of our portfolio. And I think we saw customers where they had the option to wait, they chose to wait a bit. So I don't view it as any \u2013 I don't see any fundamental issues relative to the enterprise portfolio or things like that. I think that it was largely just a prioritization effort that we saw within our customer base on the enterprise side. On the service provider side, I think if you go back a couple of quarters, what I said was that our teams have been working hard to really get to alignment with our customers around the future of the industry, the future of their architectures, how they were going to evolve to position them for the opportunities ahead, and I think that we did that. And then I would say that our teams have really executed well over the last couple of quarters as they align with our service providers on those priorities across the portfolio. And so we're pleased with where we are. I don't think that if you really unpack those numbers over two or three quarters that you're going to see you'd be able to delineate a whole lot between what went on with the exception of the enterprise customers just prioritizing where they spent their money. As it relates to the OpEx versus CapEx move, I'll ask Kelly, and maybe she can comment on the software part of the question. But I didn't see any fundamental change this quarter in how our customers look at that versus what they've been doing for the last three, four, five, six quarters. So it's something that we deal with as it relates to, as an example, our collaboration portfolio. We made announcements last quarter that all of that portfolio, the entire portfolio is now available, or we announced that it will be available to our customers from both an on-premise and a cloud-based perspective, and in many cases it will be a hybrid model. So to the extent that our customers would like to procure our solutions in that way, then we'll make that available to them. Kelly? Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : I think you summarized it well. On the software shift, Vijay, we are making great progress. Whether it's \u2013 internally we talk about how we're driving that in our software and SaaS businesses within collaboration and security. But also in other parts of our portfolio, we are really developing new offers, that there are ways to monetize our services and software along that way. So we'll continue to disclose more, especially as we look as our business and it becomes a bigger part of that. So I'd say it's progressing well. And we're adding to our models with acquisitions like OpenDNS and Jasper, which are both SaaS models. We'll continue to build that out as it becomes a bigger part of our portfolio. On the IT to OpEx, just to add to what Chuck said, I'd say one thing that we have tremendous flexibility on is leveraging our great balance sheet to help provide solutions for whatever it is. So whether it's our Cisco capital offers or the ability of us to build managed service-as-a-service, those kind of offers, we're very active working with our customers that want different ways to consume our products and services differently; that we're coming up with all kinds of new solutions for different ways of consumption. And we have that flexibility because of our strong balance sheet. So I'd say we're making a lot of progress on both of those accounts. Marilyn Mora - Director-Global Investor Relations, Cisco Systems, Inc.: All right, thanks, Vijay. Operator, our next question, please. Operator : Okay, your next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, thank you very much. I just wanted to clarify first, Kelly, in terms of the two percentage point bump that you've embedded in the guidance for the extra week, that compares to four to five points that you guys saw last time you had this kind of pattern back in 2010. So I just wanted to understand if there's anything different this time, or if that's just an extra measure of conservatism. and just more for the substantive question, Chuck, I heard your comments on the pause on the campus switching side of the business. I just wanted to also ask. What is happening on the data center side of your switching business? Is that returning to growth in the first half of this calendar year as you had expected it to? Any update there would be helpful. Thanks. Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : All right. So, Simona, on the 2%, yes, great question. Let me give a little context there. So the last time we had this was in Q3 of fiscal year 2010, and it was about a 4% to 5% increase. I'd say what I baked into my 2%, so it's roughly about $250 million \u2013 $275 million. What I baked in the guidance is the incremental revenue I know that we will get from things like our services subscription businesses, our SaaS businesses, as well as some products around the distribution that we are seeing. So that's what I baked in the guidance. I am not assuming there's going to be a lot more because of the current macro environment. The sales guys are out there, the teams driving to a monthly number and a quarterly number. And given the spending constraints that we're seeing right now, I'm not being over-bullish in my guidance on that. So that's how I'd build that up. Just to remind you, back in Q3 of 2010, our growth that quarter was 27%, so it was a much different macro environment. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, Simona, just the second part of your question, I think the word that we would use relative to how Kelly modeled in that would be the same that we talked about with Vijay, which would be prudent. On the switching front, from a revenue perspective, it was negative this quarter. We're trying not to give you lots of random pieces of information every quarter so that we can build some consistency in how you guys look at how we're performing. But I will tell you that on the new order side on the data center switching business this quarter, we did see slightly positive growth on orders. And I would say in the context of that last three weeks that we felt in enterprise that we're cautiously optimistic. Marilyn Mora - Director-Global Investor Relations, Cisco Systems, Inc.: Okay. Next question, please, operator? Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great, thank you and congratulations to you and your team at Cisco. My question is now that it's been a few months with the new partnership and Ericsson, can you let us know if you have actually had any concrete wins or anything (27:22) showing up in the NGN segment of reporting, or is it too early to see or any anecdotes about that new partnership? Thank you and congratulations. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Jim. First of all, thanks for your favorable comments. I appreciate that. On the Ericsson front, we've seen \u2013 I will tell you that we've never seen \u2013 outside of Apple, we've never seen a partnership that has gotten so much energy and excitement inside the company. And as you know, on the Apple front, we are actually doing the development. I think Tim [Cook] alluded to it on his conference call that both companies are doing the development that we need to do to actually deliver that joint innovation to our customers. But the Ericsson partnership has immediate opportunity with it, and we have begun to close transactions together. I would not translate that to a significant impact to any of the numbers that we put out there today because we're literally in the handful stage right now, but we do see that accelerating. We have a lot of focus on it with our teams. Hans [Vestberg], their CEO, and I are going to be together quite a bit in Mobile World Congress in a couple weeks, and we're also going to have a lot of the next-generation joint solutions that we are putting together for our customers that will be on display in both of our booths there. And Hans and I actually are on a panel together at Mobile World. So that partnership is going probably as well as we thought it would be at this point, and I think you'll really see the acceleration over the next 12 months. Marilyn Mora - Director-Global Investor Relations, Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Jim, for the question. Operator, next question, please? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Just want to see if you can give us a little more context about how we should think about the routing glide path going forward the next few quarters given the nice growth you generated this past quarter. How much of it is related to the CRS-X cycle continuing? Does it have to do with more vertical penetration or service provider penetration? Just any color you can give us because what I'm trying to understand, can you still be in the 3% to 4% or 5% bogey for that business for the next couple quarters from a growth perspective? Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll speak to some of the areas of strength, and I'll let Kelly talk about the numbers and how we think about it going forward. But we did see strength in our core routing and we saw strength in enterprise access routing this past quarter. And we have some new products in our portfolio that are very early. And one of them was the co-development effort that I had talked about over the last couple of calls that we would expect to see some positive momentum out of over the next few quarters. And we've got some virtualized routing capabilities that our teams are working on. So I think the portfolio looks good. The pipeline looks good from an innovation perspective. And then, Kelly, any comments on how we think about the numbers going forward? Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : I think you summarized it well, Chuck. Really, I think we feel fantastic about the portfolio and we feel good about what it looks like. But I don't really give guidance by business unit just because there's a lot of volatility. But I would say we feel really good about how the portfolio is sitting and the new products that we've launched on that platform. Marilyn Mora - Director-Global Investor Relations, Cisco Systems, Inc.: Okay. Operator, next question, please? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Bracelin with the Pacific Crest Securities. Brent Bracelin - Pacific Crest Securities : Thank you, one clarification and one question, if I could. Chuck, just could you clarify? Was the pause you saw with customers the last couple weeks, was that global or was that concentrated in the Americas? And then my question is really around APJC, the recovery you're seeing there, the recovery you're seeing in China. What's driving that? Is that sustainable? Is that easy compares? Walk us through what you're seeing in APJC that drove the rebound this quarter. I guess, A, is it sustainable? Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, thanks, Brent. On the pause that we saw, this is typical. When there's uncertainty in the market, we see enterprise customers, and they just basically say hey, look, let's just \u2013 let's wait. Let's see what's going to happen. They may say let's wait a week. They may say let's wait a couple weeks. And when you're in the last three weeks of your quarter, those kinds of decisions have an impact. So I just want to clarify. And your specific question, we saw it pretty holistically I'd say around the globe. And then the other thing that we haven't really talked about is obviously outside the United States, we saw currency. We talked about it on the last call in Europe and Asia. That clearly continued and maybe even got a little worse in some places. On the APJC recovery, the team there has done a great job. We've talked a lot about what we've seen happening in India. We've seen tremendous success there. We have \u2013 that's one of the key countries that we have a country digitization effort that John [Chambers] has been leading for us, and our business there continues to grow very well. In China, which is the crux of your question, I would tell you that as we've navigated our way through the last three years, and I think, Brent, you and I have talked about the amount of time that I spent over there during that window, the team did a great job. And what they really did is they diversified our business strategy across customer segments, so not only being aligned to state-owned enterprises, but moving out and creating a commercial market strategy, moving out into second and third tier cities, so geographic diversification. And they really focused on their teams being able to sell our entire portfolio. So the good news is what I'll tell you is that the growth that we saw in China was very well balanced across our portfolio. We saw routing up. Kelly, keep me honest, but routing in double digits, switching in double digits. Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Wireless. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Wireless in double digits, as well as SP Video in double digits. So it was a very balanced performance for the second quarter in a row. So there's clearly a lot of uncertainty out there, so we're going to take things a quarter at a time, but we're pleased with where they are. Marilyn Mora - Director-Global Investor Relations, Cisco Systems, Inc.: Kim, we'll go ahead and take the next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much, just a couple of quick questions. First on acquisitions, you guys have been fairly active in the last few quarters. Should we expect this type of pace to persist both in terms of tuck-in acquisitions and maybe more detailed acquisitions? And then the second question I had was security, it seemed like there was some acceleration in that business this quarter. Is that just the result of the SaaS model starting to accrue to the P&L, or was there underlying improvement in the billings and activity in that business? Thank you very much. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, James. So let me comment on the M&A activity that you've seen. We have built a strategic framework that is guiding us for what we believe we need to have in our portfolio and the architectures that we need to be able to build relative to cloud, security, analytics, SaaS, IoT. We have built that framework with our team in the first two or three months that I was in the role. We then stepped back and looked at where do we have R&D activities that are going to build some of these opportunities, and where are there opportunities like what we saw with Jasper where we can move and actually fill a substantive portion of our portfolio. And so that's what's driving us. It's very much connected to our broader strategy and connected to what I believe that our customers care about in the future. And I would say that you should expect us to continue the pace. And obviously valuations in today's market, that's one piece of good news, is that they're more attractive. As it relates to \u2013 I'm blanking on the second part of your question. Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Security. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sorry, security, thank you. On the security front, I would say that it is primarily, and Kelly can just again keep me honest on the deferred piece of this if it's flowing through. But what we talked about was the integration of the Sourcefire assets as well as the Cisco assets as well as other acquisitions we made along the way, plus the other innovation that our teams internally have done. And that has \u2013 we put all that together about two quarters ago, and we told you that we thought that this would continue to improve, and our teams have driven that. And when you look at that advanced malware portfolio, and we added yet another 2,000 customers this quarter, so we're up to 10,000, which is they've really done a great job of executing on that strategy. And then during the quarter, we also launched our next-generation firewall product that we need to get out in the marketplace for obvious reasons, and so we're hoping for similar success. But I think primarily it's because of continued improvement in the portfolio and the work our team has done. I wouldn't suggest that there's a significant revenue impact coming back in from the deferred yet, although we are seeing... Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : That's what we expected, what we said a couple quarters ago. So that ramp that we talked about a few quarters ago is happening in addition to the growth that you're highlighting in just the core businesses. Marilyn Mora - Director-Global Investor Relations, Cisco Systems, Inc.: Kim, let's go ahead and take our next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities. Jess I. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, guys. I also have two quick ones. First for Chuck, I was hoping you could provide some additional details regarding the weakness in the data center business, what changed there, how you expect that to progress moving forward. And then for Kelly with respect to capital allocation, it seems like you have a little bit less than $4 billion in U.S. cash, yet you materially raised the dividend and the buyback. So I was hoping to understand if we should be expecting a debt raise, and to what degree this means any acquisitions we may see are likely to be on the smaller side. Thanks. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Jess. So I'm surprised we got this far in the questions before someone asked about data center, so I was beginning to worry. We track that business very closely obviously. And largely what we believe is that it is connected to the broader macro issue. That data center business has a strong buying season that actually runs into the end of December. And while it is a fantastic franchise for us that has contributed and will contribute to not only our success in the data center in the past, but also our success in the next-gen data center as we build next-generation data center stacks going forward, but we also believe that in the December quarter that we actually still gained share with that performance. We had a tough comp from a year ago, 40%. But I'll tell you the other thing we looked at is that even with the lower performance, it still remained the same percentage of our business this quarter that it was last quarter, that it was a quarter a year ago, which says that just in my mind, it says it suffered at the same rate that the rest of the business did from the macro. Kelly, the second part of the question? Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : So on capital allocation, so overall, our strategy around capital allocation hasn't changed. We want to give a minimum of 50% back to our shareholders. We've been listening to our shareholders, and the bottom line is we feel very, very good about our business model and our ongoing cash flows. You saw our operating cash up 36% this quarter that we thought we'd increase the amount of our dividend sustainably going forward. So it's a blend. We also increased our authorization just as we would normally would increase our authorization, the $15 billion. In terms of flexibility, yes, we will be accessing debt in the near future. Again, that's one of the benefits of our balance sheet, and our access to capital is very, very good. So we will continue to do that until anything changes with our overseas cash. But it does not change our flexibility in any way in terms of acquisitions. When we think through these capital allocation decisions, we're playing out what we're thinking about acquisition-wise, how we're building that out, as well as our future cash flow. So I think no change to our acquisition strategy. It does not hamper us in any way. We have easy access to capital. And again, we wanted to share some of that cash back with our shareholders. Marilyn Mora - Director-Global Investor Relations, Cisco Systems, Inc.: Okay, let's move on to the next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Kvaal with Nomura Securities International, Inc. Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Yes, thanks very much. I have a few margin questions, Kelly, for you, perhaps. Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Okay. Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Can you talk a little bit about the drivers inside of the gross margin structure? It was a little bit ahead of plan this quarter. It seems to be going back to normal next quarter. And what are the moving parts there? The second part of that is on the operating margins. I know 30% is the target. When should we be thinking about that, and how much progress are you making in that regard? Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. So on gross margins, we continue to be very focused on margins, and we look at it as all the different levers in there. So as you know, we continually have some price erosion, and we use price as a lever to drive selling. Our price erosion has remained very, very disciplined. You'll see that it's been in the normal ranges that we have been in the last quarter and actually slightly better than a year ago, so that continues. We're getting real traction, continued traction from our engineers and supply chain on the productivity side. So for the price erosion we have, we're more than offsetting it with productivity, and we're continuing to drive those projects to continue to do that so we can have that flexibility to make sure we're taking advantage of all opportunities for growth out there. So that's continuing. On the operating margin side, again, we're going to be smart about managing the overall equation. We want to make sure we're taking advantage and investing in the right areas to be able to take advantage of future growth and balancing that equation. There is a bit of goodness coming through at the OM line because of FX favorability that you guys are aware of that falls to the bottom line. But in general, I'd say that we're being very disciplined in terms of how we make these trade-offs and balance the bottom line with the investments we're trying to make to accelerate growth. Marilyn Mora - Director-Global Investor Relations, Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Kelly. Let's go ahead and take our next question, please? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks and congrats, guys, on strong execution. I wanted think a little bit ahead, Kelly, just given this extra week that you had in the guidance. Historically, as you move into your fourth quarter, you typically post a solid sequential increase quarter over quarter. As we lose this week, should we assume a little bit more of a flattish performance then into July versus April? And then regarding the software and SaaS, clearly you're making very good progress over there. Is there a way to quantify, from your standpoint, how much of growth are you giving up right now as you transition businesses, more and more of your products, into those type of purchasing model, how much of a growth headwind this transition is impacting you near term? Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. So on the extra week, this is, I think, how you can think about it. So I tried to be pretty transparent of what we're assuming in there. So literally, the $250 million or so, the $275 million that we're assuming literally is just the businesses where it's just going to \u2013 because we have weekly billing is going to amortize off our balance sheet. That is basically a guarantee, and just marginally a little bit more for some of the distribution and flow business. So I would say as you are modeling for Q4, I think you should assume the normal ranges. Take that out, that $250 million to $275 million, and assume the normal ranges of growth in Q4. On software and SaaS, I know you and others ask me this question a lot. It's tough to quantify. Certainly it's a point or two easy to say off the top. Some of the businesses we're growing are businesses that we've had that are great, like collab and security. We are adding more to this profile with some of these different offers, like these big enterprise ELAs we have. It's just hard to quantify it for any one quarter of when it's going to fall in. But there's certainly something on the top line, but we'll see that come back through as we continue to build that out and amortize it. Marilyn Mora - Director-Global Investor Relations, Cisco Systems, Inc.: Okay, Kim. Let's go ahead and take our next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great, thank you very much. A quick clarification. Strength in Service Provider Video, I think you highlighted China. If you could, just talk to what you think the duration is. And then in terms of market verticals, I was interested if you could talk a little bit more about your exposure to what we've often called Web 2.0 or Web-scale operators. Certainly there's the idea that they buy white box, but we know you sell to them. So I'd like to get a sense of your exposure and the trends from that group of customers, if we might. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Simon. Thanks. This is Chuck. So on the SP Video front, I think that the team has done a great job of evolving that portfolio and really building some great solutions. They're engaged with lots of customers. Our strategy when we divested of the Video CPE business was to really focus on a cloud-based delivery model, and that is occurring. And we're having obviously good success with that platform in China. And that tends to be an ongoing \u2013 a longer-term solution that the customers deploy, so we'll see. Again, we're taking things quarter by quarter, but we feel good about where they are there. On the second part of your question relative to the Web-scale guys, we've talked the last couple of quarters about how we had been having success with them. And I talked about us really changing our strategy about 18 months ago and moving more into a collaborative co-development mode with them thinking about what their very unique needs are. And I'll tell you that our business with them last quarter grew 17%, so we continue to see relatively good strength with those customers. Marilyn Mora - Director-Global Investor Relations, Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Chuck. We'll go ahead and take our next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. Hey, Chuck, maybe just to go back to the data center, if we could, I get the macro and the tough compares there. Just looking more broadly at that market, I think the share gains are starting to normalize a little bit, at least in the server market. So when you think about the continued growth on the hardware side of the data center, do you think we need to broaden the server offering, maybe get more involved in storage or ADC or some other products that are important to the data center that Cisco might not fully be participating in? Thank you. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Tim. It's good to hear from you, and that is a very good question. And what I would tell you is that we are currently \u2013 we have a lot of work going on around the future next-generation data center and what the future stacks look like in that data center, which will be a combination of infrastructure hardware with a heavy dose of software and orchestration. And you can assume that we're looking at our role up and down that stack going forward. I would tell you that there was a recent article I think late last week, last week in InfoWorld where Biri Singh actually outlined how we're thinking about this market. So you're spot-on, and we are spending a lot of time thinking through what role we play there and what the opportunity is, but we believe it's going to be significant. So I appreciate the question. Tim, thanks. Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director: That was apparently the last question we have, so I'm going to close with just some short comments. I am incredibly pleased with how we executed this quarter. And as I said, in a very uncertain macro environment, our teams did a great job. And as we look forward, I think about how we're operating the company on these two fronts. The first front is that we will continue to execute and run this company in a well-managed way, even in challenging environments. But at the same time, we're going to move full speed ahead. And the second front is we are going to make the long-term investments and build our strategy and the architectures and the solutions that our customers need. And I believe that our growth will accelerate as our customers embrace and move towards this next wave of technology that's going to fundamentally change every company and every country around the world. I believe we can do both, and I think that will allow us to take advantage of the incredible opportunity ahead of us, and I have a great deal of confidence in our ability to execute against that. So thank you for spending time with us today, and we look forward to talking to you soon. Marilyn Mora - Director-Global Investor Relations, Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Chuck. Cisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our fiscal 2016 third quarter results, will be on Wednesday, May 18, 2016, at 1 :30 PM Pacific Time, 4:30 PM Eastern Time.

They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we will discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. As a reminder in Q2, on November 20 we completed the sale of the Customer Premises Equipment portion of our SP Video Connected Devices business and accordingly had no revenue or expense from that business in Q3 fiscal 2016. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP, and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SP Video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help to understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q2 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way. With that, I'd like to go ahead and turn it over to Chuck. Charles Robbins : Thank you Marilyn, we delivered strong Q3 results against the backdrop of the Macro environment that continues to be uncertain. Despite this uncertainty we executed very well, with revenue growth of 3% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 6%. We continued to generate strong operating cash flow of over $3 billion in the quarter returning nearly $2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  Our commitment to operating discipline continues to yield solid results in spite of the challenging environment. The operational changes we continued to make will further enable our customers to leverage strategic role to network as they transform their businesses to become digital. As I did last quarter I would like to highlight our momentum in four key areas.  First in Security, we saw continued acceleration in the third quarter with revenue growth of 17% while deferred revenue grew 31% driven by our ongoing shift from hardware to more software and subscription services. Our security business is tracking as we indicated it would earlier in the year.  As one of the largest IT security vendors, we believe our portfolio is the most comprehensive and effective and enabling our customers to protect their businesses. Security is and will remain one of our absolute highest priorities.  Second, collaboration. Revenue accelerated by 10% and deferred revenue here grew 16%. This is yet another example of a successful transition to a cloud based platform increasing our market leadership which we expect will give us sustainable long term differentiation.  Third, our next generation data center portfolio is extremely well positioned to meet our customers need regardless of where they place their workloads enabling public, private or hybrid cloud deployments. At our partner summit, we received a very strong response to innovations as customers adopt our next generation data center solution.  Our strong position is evident in our installed base of 52,000 UCS customers and the continued success of our ACI portfolio. In March, we announced a dramatic improvement in price performance and by this I mean 100 gig performances for 40 gig pricing driven by new A6 which provide us a time to market advantage of 18 to 24 months while maintaining the same margin profile. In Q3 our ACI platform grew revenue approximately 100% while it exceeded a $2 billion annualized run-rate far outpacing our next closest competitor in both size of business and growth rate. Our entry into the hyper converged market with HyperFlex, as well as our acquisition of CliQr, an innovation in multi-cloud orchestration extends our leadership position in the data center.  Finally, we continue to make great progress in transitioning more of our revenue to recurring with increased emphasis on software and subscription offers. Our software subscription deferred revenue balance continues to exhibit accelerated growth this quarter up 36%. We have a number of strong proof points of how we have executed successfully against our objective and the potential to apply the same model to the rest of our portfolio. In addition to the success I have highlighted in our security and collaboration businesses, we had double-digit revenue growth again this quarter in Meraki which stands out as an excellent example of how we begun to scale our enterprise networking into a subscription mode. As I look to the future, you will see us expand the approach we have taken with the success of Meraki, collaboration and security and apply it to our data center and core networking for both enterprise and service providers.  Our $180 billion of installed base with by far the most widely adopted operating systems for networking, makes us uniquely positioned to lead this migration. While the overall macro environment remains uncertain, we are nicely positioned to benefit from any rebound in the global economy. At the same time, we will continue to manage our business to capitalize on the key growth areas in front of us. I am very pleased with our demonstrated ability to execute operationally and strategically in virtually any environment. Now I will turn it over to Kelly to walk through more details on our financials. Kelly Kramer : Thanks, Chuck. I am pleased with our continued execution on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value. Starting with delivering profitable growth. Total revenue was $12 billion up 3% with growth in product revenue of 1% and services of 11%.  We did have an extra week in Q3 consistent with our guidance of the quarter the benefit to revenue was approximately $265 million, $200 million of which was from our services, subscription businesses and $65 million from our SaaS businesses like WebEx as well as from our product distribution. In switching as Chuck mentioned, we continued to see good momentum with ACI and the next generation data center.  The 3% decline in switching was mostly driven by macro related weakness in our campus business offset by positive growth in our data center switching. Routing experience 5% decline mostly driven by the high-end. We are seeing continued strength with our web scale customers where our core development continued and our sales to the top 10 web scale customers was up 31%. Collaboration grew 10% by strength across the entire portfolio and deferred revenue grew 16%. WebEx continued its double digit growth with solid performance in Telepresence and Unified Communications driven by our new offerings in those areas. Data center grew 1% with the slower growth largely driven by continued macro challenges impacting customer spend. We expect that our HyperFlex offering will further expand our growth opportunities in the data center. Wireless grew 1% led by strong double digit growth in our cloud based Meraki platform partially offset by declines in our controller and access point businesses. Security grew 17% along with continued strong deferred revenue growth of 31%. We had great performance in our advanced threat security and web security solution which grew over a 100% and 50% respectively.  SP Video grew 18% with ongoing strength in China. Services revenue grew a very solid 11% which includes the $200 million for the extra week I mentioned. Normalized for the extra week the growth was 4%. We again saw very good progress against our goals of driving more recurring revenue. Deferred revenue had solid growth of 8% with product deferred revenue of 9% and service of 7%.  The portion of our product deferred revenue relating to our recurring software and subscription business grew 36%. From an orders perspective, product order grew 3% with a book-to-bill comfortably above 1. Looking at our geographies which is the primary we run our business, Americas grew 4%, EMEA was up 2% and APJC grew 1%.  Total emerging markets grew 4% with the BRICs plus Mexico showing strength at up 4%, with China up 22% and India up 18%. Brazil and Russia continue to be challenging now combine representing less than 2% of our total product booking. In terms of customer segment enterprise declined 2% and commercial grew 8%. Public sector grew 6% and service provider was 4% flat. Similar to Q2 we are seeing pressure in the enterprise segment driven by the macro uncertainty.  We drove strong profitability this quarter especially with gross margins. From a non-GAAP perspective, gross margins was 65.2% with product gross margins of 64.5% and service gross margin of 67.1%. Operating expenses were 35.2% of revenue and operating margin was 30%. The total impact of the extra week on our non-GAAP cost of sales and operating expenses was $150 million. We are being very disciplined in this tough macro and pricing environment focused on making the right investments while driving operational efficiencies and productivity. From a bottom line perspective we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.57 up 6% while GAAP EPS was $0.46. Q3 non-GAAP income was $2.9 billion up 4% while GAAP net income was $2.3 billion.  We have been very active from and M&A perspective closing five acquisition in Q3. Jasper Technologies making Cisco the largest cloud based IOT service platform helping enterprises and service providers launch, manage and monetize IOT services on a global scale. Acano which provides on premise and cloud based video infrastructure and collaboration software.  Synata which enables us to deliver search capabilities for collaboration cloud applications, Leaba a fabless semiconductor company and CliQr which defines an application defined cloud orchestration platform which is expected to help Cisco customers simplify and accelerate their private, public and hybrid cloud deployment.  These acquisitions are clearly focused on our key growth areas including IOT, software cloud and collaboration as well as continuing to strengthen our core. We have also seen solid momentum with our Ericsson partnership closing 17 deals this quarter. Moving on to shareholder value, in Q3 we delivered operating cash flow of $3.1 billion. Total cash, cash equivalent and investment at the end of Q3 were $63.5 billion with $6.3 billion available in the US.  We returned $2 billion to shareholders during the quarter that included $649 million of share repurchases and $1.3 billion for our quarterly dividend which we increased by 24% in Q3. Overall Q3 was a very solid quarter and a difficult macro environment. We focused on strong operational executions resulting in top line growth, stronger gross margins and continued operating leverage consistent with our expectations.  We are making the right investments in the growth areas of the business, balancing our decisions with sound portfolio management. Let me now reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release of fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. This guidance includes the type of forward looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier.  The guidance for Q4 is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 0% to 3% year-over-year normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from Q4 2015. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29% to 30% and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%.  Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.59 to $0.61. We anticipate our GAAP EPS to be lower than the non-GAAP EPS by $0.08 to $0.11. Further details to this range are included in the slide and the press release that accompany this call. I will now turn it back over to Chuck. Charles Robbins : Thanks, Kelly. So let me quickly summarize before we move to question. First I think the number one key takeaway is that we continue to execute well even in an obviously very tough environment. Secondly, we have proven our ability to transition certain elements of our portfolio like we have done with Meraki security in collaboration and we believe we can accelerate long-term growth by bringing the same approach to our core and this process has begun.  And finally, everything we do will be done through the lens enabling our customer's success while driving value for our shareholders. Marilyn I will turn it over to you for questions. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Chuck. Kim, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. And while Kim is doing that I would like to remind the audience that we ask you to please ask one question. Operator : Thank you. Your first question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Simona Jankowski : Hi, thank you very much. I just wanted to clarify your guidance for the July quarter. How much of the revenue comes embedded from acquisitions that closed in the last year just so we can get a sense for the organic sense in the business? And then when we think about the 3% growth in bookings in the quarter how much of that was benefit by the extra week in the quarter? Kelly Kramer : Yes, I will answer the second part first Simona. In terms of how much benefit we got from the extra week, we don't think there's much. What we saw this quarter was the forecast was pretty straight forward. The team saw deal closure and conversion rates drag on because of the especially in enterprise segment and quite frankly the deal that we closed were more in line.  So we don't think we had any upside from the extra week in bookings sitting there. In terms of your first questions on your acquisitions, we will start to see; in the current run-rate we have the bulk of open DNS and everything else. For the new acquisitions you don't have the full quarter in a run-rate, we will get a bit of benefit from Jasper and Acano but it's not terribly material in the overall growth rate. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Simona. Kim we will go ahead and take the next question. Operator : Thank you, next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer & Co. Ittai Kidron : Thanks and congrats on great execution. First question is regards to the data center. I hear your comments with regards to the macro impact on it but it's five quarters in a row now we are dead business is stuck in between the $800 million to $850 million revenue and this business has the account for about a third of your growth in the past few years so if you give us a little bit more color as to why isn't this moving that will be great and the second question is regards to the gross margins.  I had to go back all the way to 2010 to find product gross margins that are equal to those you just reported. Can you just give us a little bit more maybe of a framework to think about? What is really changing in the portfolio whether it be the mix or changing the competitive environment, anything that can justify the increase in gross margins and how sustainable do you think that is? Charles Robbins : Hey, this is Chuck and I will answer the first one and I will give Kelly the gross margin question. So as we look at the data center business, we see a few things going on. First of all we think that there is an impact coming from the overall macro environment that is relatively undeniable. We also saw as our peers, some caution in the CapEx spend and the SP space and that was one of the segments we saw weakness this quarter even with our data center portfolio. We take data center in this context; we are talking about UCS in particular. The other thing that is going on is there is a transition going on in the data center relative to workloads. I talked a little bit about it on the last call. We see workload specific used cases being deployed on high performance blade. Systems like our classic UCS then we see also this move to hyper converged systems which led us to the launch of the HyperFlex platform last quarter.  We also see a transition to rack based systems which also results in stacks that are driven by container based architectures and so in the last quarter 30% of our business was from the rack portfolio which we do have for the appropriate used cases. And you will see us continue to expand our offering so we have UCS as a blade system, we have a rack conversion of UCS, we have HyperFlex in the market and you will see us continue to expand in our portfolio to meet the evolving used cases in the data center. I think that's what's going on right now. Kelly, on the gross margin question? Kelly Kramer : Yes, on the gross margins, I will say Ittai a couple things. You are absolutely right when you go back and look historically. If you go back and normalize the biggest thing we did was obviously when we got out of the set top box business, that helped us quite a bit and normalized if you go back to just Q1 of this year we were at a $64.9 million and we had even last year, we had a $65.1 million.  So I would say it's kind of but the new normal in that $63 million to $64 million range, I would say the only other thing when you go back and you update your models for the extra week because a lot of the top one that I talked about comes of the balance sheet and there's not incremental cost. I did get a half point benefit just from the extra week in my gross margins. So I'd say a normalized view on the gross margins would have been closer to $64.5 million. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Kelly. Kim we will go ahead and take the next question. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Vijay Bhagavath : Yes, thanks. Clearly better than results, congratulations to you and your team. My question is as follows which is Chuck, heading into the back half what gets you most excited in terms of new product refreshed opportunities and then now that your security business is starting to turn the corner, especially versus the pure place would you double down on security investments both organically and M&A? Thanks. Charles Robbins : Yes, Vijay I think the number one thing I am feeling very positive about right now again we have shown that we can drive the transition in our collaboration portfolio which is as you see that business of last two years the team's done a great job of transitioning it to a portfolio is available to our customers as cloud based services in seeing it growing double digits and also growing our deferred revenue balance of 16%.  I think that's one example and security 46% of our business now comes from software and subscription services which is clearly the direction that we had indicated we were going to take it at the same time growing 17%. Our Meraki business which really shows the evolution of networking to cloud based management and policy is over a billion dollars now and growing double digits and I think the thing I am most excited about longer term is we see a path to deploy that model across the rest of our portfolio and again that work has begun. I think in the near term we see obviously a mix of pretty cautious environment still because we do see customers spending where they need to spend but don't misunderstand there's still a fair amount of caution in the market but I think we have executed well this quarter we had five of our seven product categories that were in positive growth with three of them in double digits.  We had all the GOs in positive growth from order perspective and we saw pretty good strength across our segments. So that's the first question. The second one relative to security the answer is yes, yes and yes. We will continue investing both organically and any other way we see appropriate to drive that architecture. The team's done a phenomenal job. Marilyn Mora : Kim, we will go ahead and take the next question. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. Steve Milunovich : Thank you. Your switching and routing business, so businesses were both down. I guess how concerned are you about that? Do you think your product portfolio is yet to impact that? Do you believe your share or it's the market finally? What's the impact on your services business in other words how much of that is maintenance that could be impacted by declining hardware? Charles Robbins : So let me take the first one and then Kelly you can maybe make the connection to the hardware. So on the switching business I will point out a couple of things. Last quarter we indicated that our campus switching business, the growth there is largely driven by refresh which in an uncertain time enterprises that have infrastructure that's functioning for them, they are not going to make the move to upgrade.  So we see a pause in that refresh cycle which we talked about last quarter and nothing really changed there. What we did see is we saw our data center switching revenue growth increase and the other thing I will point out is we had indicated that we believe our data center switching growth would, the new product portfolio would surpass the declines of the traditional products that we had and our order growth rate which we haven't put any of the documentation but our order growth rate this past quarter on that $4 billion portfolio was double digits.  So we are pleased with the progress that we have made in the data center switching space and again that's $4 billion and it grew double digit in order so we will okay about that. On the routing front its combination of things. I think there are certainly $1 billion in the quarter; $4 billion annualized run-rate on the annualized data center switching. Kelly's making sure we are clear. On the routing business we have seen a few things. Clearly there is a macro issue that we are dealing with. We also saw again as you heard from some of our peers we saw some increased caution in the service provider space. We saw slow movement in the core of those networks. Kind of flat-ish activity at the edge. And we do have a number of new platforms that are in certification with several of the key players that at some point in the coming quarters we would expect those two to begin to show up favorably but that's what we see right now. Kelly Kramer : And in terms of Steve, your question on impact of the services business, typically for new sockets there would be a little lag for that but I would say that our service business has been laser focused on driving renewals. So even if enterprises are holding on to their switches and routers longer, our services team and sales team have been very focused on getting the contracts renewed. And we have seen that pay dividends with the acceleration of growth and if you normalize our service revenue for this quarter for the extra week, they still grew 4% which is up from 3% year-over-year growth in Q2 and it was 1% in Q1 so we are really starting to get traction there. Charles Robbins : Yes, and Steve, if I can just pile on to what Kelly just said that the team has been building out. Trying to strengthen our capability around the entire software and subscription model which requires a lot of focus on adoption and renewals and we have also taken the same approach to just sharpen our focus on our services renewal business and we did see improvement in that in the last quarter so I am happy that the team is making progress there as well. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Steve, Kim let's go ahead and take the next question. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from James Suva from Citigroup. James Suva : Thank you and congratulations Chuck and Kelly to your team here at Cisco. One thing that stood out was the very impressive gross margins this quarter if I calculated correctly looks like there is around $65.2 million and that was meaningfully above I think your guidance was $62.5 million to $63.5 million. Can you help us understand what were the factors to drive it higher because I know the driving's all included in the extra week and for the outlook are there any types of swing factors we should be aware of and the causes of why would be lower than reported gross margins from this quarter? And again congratulations to your team. Kelly Kramer : Yes, sure. Thanks for the question Jim. Thing to keep in mind, true we did guide with the extra week which came in line but just again couple of things. When we guide we tend to have a little conservatism in the gross margin rate but take off that half point and we are still parked at the $64.5 million range. We do have normal seasonality quarter in and quarter out. So always, Q1 and Q3 are our strongest quarters and Q2 and Q4 are weaker and its typically driven by our mix, especially our mix of drivers in those two quarter so that's also a driver and I think operationally speaking again the teams are doing a very good job from the productivity perspective in terms of driving cost out of the product. We had lots of efficiencies out of this supply chain in terms of managing our freight and our inventory management.  So I would say we had a very strong quarter from an operational excellence. If I look at pricing this quarter we are being very disciplined on pricing. We are starting to see a tiny bit of a tick up and you will see that in our queue where the impact to our gross margin rate year-to-date 2.2% and Q3 was 2.4% so still strong but you know we are still seeing price arisen but the strength we are seeing this quarter mostly came from just improvements in productivity. Marilyn Mora : Great, thanks Kelly. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Pierre Ferragu from Bernstein. Pierre Ferragu : Hi, good evening. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to come back on what you said about your hyper scale and web scale clients so if I get that correctly, you had revenues of 31% there? Could you give us a sense of what made most of this revenue and most of this growth, was it mostly switching, routing, anything else and then if we experienced that very strong performance on that segment, what did the rest of the enterprise look like in terms of growth so you were down 2% overall I assume it's higher what scale is probably 31%, the rest of the enterprise was down quite significantly.  And lastly, could you help us quantify any kind of the macro impact you mentioned with enterprise in this quarter and in your guide for next quarter so right on the points of revenue or whatever, do you have a sense of how much you have lost because of the uncertain macro environment? Thanks for that. Kelly Kramer : Okay. So I will start and make sure I don't forget the rest of the pieces here, Chuck you got me covered there? Okay. So of our massively scale of debts and our customers, of that amount more than half of it is certainly switching and the next biggest follower is routing so it's more than 50% significantly more than 50% is our switching products. To your point on what you inferred, what would mean if switching overall was down three, I just want to reiterate what doing? Charles Robbins : Let me just clarify the question. He believes that we will roll the we scale into our enterprise business so he was saying we were negative two on enterprise so our service provider segment so now you can answer that question. Kelly Kramer : Yes, sorry about that Pierre. These web scale customers are definitely in our service provider segment which was flat overall from the quarter of our bookings perspective. On the rest of the portfolio to your question of the service provider we are seeing the slowdown from just the overall there's a lot of CapEx spend and you are seeing it reflected certainly on our routing portfolio. Charles Robbins : Yes, couple of comments. I don't think we have exposed over half that business is coming from switching so clearly there is value in our switching portfolio the web scale players are seeing. I also think that there is still a small percentage of the overall SP business as it relates which is why you will see flat when this segment goes up 31% given the size of that business but obviously you could have done the math. And -- but I do think that our teams have done a good job here. Kelly, the third portion of the question was that relative to any revenue impact in Q4 that we have built into the guidance, relative to the macro environment, just generically, we are not modelling any improvements I think is the safest way to say it. We do see a continued amount of uncertainty out there and we are not modelling any improvement into Q4. Marilyn Mora : Great, thanks Chuck. Next question please, Kim. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Brent Bracelin from Pacific Crest Securities. Brent Bracelin : Thank you for taking the question. Chuck, I wanted a follow-up on services revenue. I get there was a clear benefit of an extra week but this down marks I think the second quarter in a row of upside coming from the services segment. I imagine most of the return is double digit growth was the extra week. I guess my question is are you seeing a broader increase in services driven by solution selling trends and if so do you expect the services kind of recovery to potentially be a leading indicator for a future product recovery? Charles Robbins : Thanks for the question, Brent. Let me say that over the last few quarters Joe Cozzolino and his team have been incredibly focused on driving the operational excellence around the P&L element of that which is what you are seeing with the gross margins and I think some of the discussion I had earlier around the focus on the renewal capability. I think we are seeing general improvement in the execution there. We see advanced services obviously doing reasonably well. Security services doing reasonably well and as I mentioned earlier the renewal activity our teams did a better job this past quarter so I think a lot of what you are seeing is operational discipline and execution to be honest.  However, I think there is an opportunity and more of our customers are asking us to help them as they look at their strategies to take advantage of this digital transition that's occurring. I am not sure I am in a position where I will give you any sort of tangible connection between it and future part of the growth but we definitely see that as a required service we are going to provide to our customers because they are looking to us as one of the few large capable financially viable partners that really understand this transition. Marilyn Mora : Great, thanks Chuck. Next question please, Kim. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Mark Moskowitz from Barclays. Mark Moskowitz : Yes, thanks good afternoon. Just want to see if we can talk a little bit more about the cloud, ACI momentum. How should we think about the mix of this cloud revenue for Cisco, in terms of how much is going into public cloud vs private cloud as the run-rate improves? And then is there any change in the public cloud versus private cloud related to a margin either from a gross margin or operating margin perspective, we should be aware of? Thank you. Charles Robbins : Thanks Mark. So I will let Kelly tackle the second question. If you look at where we declared when we stated our strategy as around cloud, it really is focused on enabling what we believe to be the long term desire of customers to operate in a hybrid cloud model and we said that we were going to do three primary things. We were going to make sure that we provide the infrastructure to the cloud providers and we have done that SPs and we have done that obviously with the top ten web scale providers given the business was up 31%. We also said that we were going to transition our portfolio to be cloud delivered and as a service delivered we are going to make sense over time across the entire portfolio and you have seen us do that with our continued growth in Meraki in collaboration and security and now the plans are actually underway on the project to deploy that across the rest of our portfolio although its early days but I think when you look at that deferred revenue of 36% on the balance sheet, that says we are being successful in the second pillar.  And then the third pillar was to help our customers with the infrastructure needed to actually take advantage of both private and public clouds or enabling hybrid and when you look at the data center switching portfolio on annualized $4 billion business with new orders growing in double digits I think that customers are driving both and the three pillars of that strategy are working. As far as gross margins when we sell to private cloud versus public cloud providers, Kelly any comment there? Kelly Kramer : Yes, I would say we obviously have different margin profiles within both but I will say whether its campus versus data center or whether it's to the service providers versus enterprises both margin profiles are well above the Cisco average gross margin rate and between campus and data center side. We are within 5 to 6 points of gross margin so the differentiations not much there. We can have variations within that. We can have some public cloud customers on some deals that might have better or worse margins but overall the portfolio is within those ranges and again way accretive to the overall system of the margin. Marilyn Mora : Kim, next question please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : Great, thank you very much. I just had a clarification, you talked about ACI hitting about $2 billion annualized run-rate and I think our notes have suggested it was at a similar level last couple of quarters at least you gave us similar level. I just wanted to make sure our notes were right there. And then really my question is around acquisitions. You guys have clearly been quite active doing acquisitions and doing a lot of what looked to be pretty promising technology relates acquisitions. Should we expect the current pace to persist or are we going through an accelerated period that you expect we will be going down from? Thanks. Kelly Kramer : I will take the first one. So on the first one, yes, we are being rounding. It's actually closer to $2.2 billion run-rate and sequentially I am certainly up than what I was last quarter. Charles Robbins : Yes, I think when we hit it last quarter it was probably roughly $2 billion, now it's closer to $2.2 billion or $2.5 billion on the ACI portfolio and then on the acquisition front what I would say is that given the valuations and the movement in the tech industry there will be continue to be opportunistic and we are in a good position as a strategic buyer with some of the challenges in the public market and some other valuations becoming a little more realistic. What I would suggest to you is over the next 12 months we will be quite as active as we have been in the, wouldn't expect it to be quite as fast paced as it has been but we will continue to be opportunistic around the areas of growth important to our future. Marilyn Mora : Kim, next question please. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Paul Silverstein from Cowen & Company. Paul Silverstein : Thanks very much. Going back to the question about the top ten webs, I don't think you have ever broken it out or at least my memory. Routing's 15% of your total revenue and service providers if I typically remember the numbers correctly were 80% routing, that would suggest that the web guys were somewhere in the range of 15% total revenue if looking at the current numbers correctly. Is that the ball park? Charles Robbins : 15% of our overall total revenue or 15% of our service provider revenue? Paul Silverstein : Basically routing is 15% of the total and service provider is 80% of routing and again that would suggest that traditional service providers bring the bulk of your routing revenue or somewhere in the order of 12% total revenue. I recognized it more than just routing. And if I saw this service provider category correctly in terms of 30% of total bookings, we may have misread the number. That would suggest what, I am trying to get back at, let me just ask the question directly. Can you give us any sense for how large the Web 2.0 category is? Kelly Kramer : Yes, Paul we haven't been disclosing that so we just don't disclose that. Paul Silverstein : Isn't that 15% range? Kelly Kramer : Again Paul, it's not something we give out. I apologize but it's not\u2026 Paul Silverstein : No worries, all right, let me ask you a simple question and I think you mentioned it before but, can you give us any insight of the linearity of the quarter? Kelly Kramer : Yes, I'd say it wasn't that crazy, I mean obviously our extra week went actually feel in from a calendar perspective was in February. But again, because the way the teams were forecasting, I'd say the linearity in terms of the -- what we see usually coming through was in the normal ranges. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Paul. Hey Kim, we'll go ahead and take the next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America. Tal Liani : Hi, hopefully you can hear me. I have just one clarification, it's the -- tone of the previous conference call was very different, it was about a very weak environment and we didn't speak about the growth trends, the tone of this conference call is so much more positive in a very similar business environment. So what happened in the last three months that makes you so much more positive about everything you've done, basically also before, very little is new now. What makes you so much more positive now versus three months ago in a similar environment or unless maybe the environment gotten better? Charles Robbins : It's a good question Tal. I'm just having a better week this week. No, I'm kidding. I think the difference is, if you go back to when we ended our last quarter, it was towards the end of January and if you recall, the last few weeks of that quarter were the weeks when the stock markets were having those incredibly wild swings and our customers actually put the brakes on pretty significantly and so coming into that earnings call we had seen very tough close to the quarter from an orders perspective. We saw our enterprise customers in particular really put the brakes on because they were just completely unsure of what was going to transpire and I think that led us to a very cautious tone and so that would the number one reason why we were more cautious then. I'd just want to make sure that we are balanced here that while we're optimistic and we're pleased with our execution, we still are operating in a relatively uncertain environment. We've got the Brexit coming up, the vote coming up in June, we've got the news out of the Fed today, we've got all the election dynamics, we've got issues in Brazil, we've got geopolitical dynamics. So there is still a relatively broad set of unknown issues out there. So we're still operating in an uncertain environment but I think that would -- the stock market issue and the timing at the end of our last quarter would probably be the biggest difference. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Chuck, I think that was really helpful. Operator, we'll take another question please. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : Great, thank you. I wanted to go back to the web-scale vertical a bit. I know that's beating the dead horse a little on this call but I wanted to see if you could talk about the bigger trend around the white box competitive threat because it seems apparent that there is not the dramatic shift to white box that many had feared but maybe it's yet to happen. So if you could talk how you're countering the threat or the substitution effect of those web-scale customers building or buying unbranded switches rather than your products? Thank you. Charles Robbins : Yes, Simon, it's a good question and I think that there is a misconception about what's driving this belief that the -- all the customers want to buy white box switching and I think this is sort in the same vein of -- it's all about cloud, it's like -- or all about STN or all about white box. None of these customers are fundamentally chasing a technology trend; there are underlying business drivers that are leading them to the solutions. And so what we've been doing is focusing on attacking the business driver and not so much the technology trend that everybody writes about. So in the case of the web-scale players, what they are looking at is, they are looking for significant automation, they are looking for the ability to run massive datacenters at very -- at huge scale, very low cost with a ton of automation which overtime will become the norm I think for all customers. There is this massive focus on operational expense reduction which is all around automation program ability which is where we're headed with our core platforms and the enterprises as well. So what we do it is we've built some really aggressive products, our teams, again the A6 improvements that have been built that give us the advantage on the price performance and then enabling our portfolio to fit within the operational environments, so these customers I think has been the key. And that's what they're looking for, they are not singularly focused on white box, they are looking at how do they solve that problem and we're just spending more time with them to really understand what they need and how we can fit their requirements and you're going to see us continue to evolve our portfolio in whatever way we need to to make sure that we remain relevant there. Marilyn Mora : Kim, next question please. Operator : Thank you. It comes from Brian White with Drexel Hamilton. Brian White : Chuck, I'm wondering if you could walk us through what you've seen so far with the Inspur relationship in China. I see China revenue decelerated but it still grew very strongly at 22%. And also the Erickson relationship, it sounds like you got some big deals from the quarter or few deals in the quarter, maybe just highlight if you feel like that relationship is still on-track for this $1 billion by 2018. The reason I ask, obviously Erickson had a very soft March quarter. Thank you. Charles Robbins : Brian, it's a great question. I actually didn't expect anyone to highlight the fact that our China revenue was decelerating as our third quarter of really solid growth in China. Now we'll point out that that is across the board, it's across the portfolio, the team has done an amazing job there and I've spent a fair amount of time over there and I think that we're really pleased with where we are in China right now in the midst of the uncertainty that's been discussed in the marketplace. On the Inspur partnership, in September we signed the MOU which was basically a letter of intent to formulate the venture, and I was over three weeks ago where we formalized the term sheet basically and we're in the final stages of getting that one put together. I would expect it will be in market sometime in the fall with some of the early products and solutions with them. We're spending a lot of time with them right now. So I think sort of late this year is when we'll begin to see some early results from that. I think on the Erickson front, anytime you do these really large partnerships, they always take a little longer probably than we would all hope but we're very optimistic, we just spend a ton of time together, I think on the last call we talked about the number of joint solutions within the first 100 days that we actually had on display together at MobileWorld Congress which was pretty amazing. And then this past quarter we saw 17 transactions close between our teams which in the midst of a time where HANS was doing a pretty significant organizational restructuring and our teams are getting to know each other. So we think that we'd all wanted to go faster but we're pretty pleased with where that partnership is right now. Marilyn Mora : All right, Chuck, I think that was our last question. Now I want to go ahead and turn it over to you to close it up. Kelly Kramer : All right, thanks Marilyn. First of all, I want to thank everybody for spending time with us today and I want to thank you for your questions. I would just go back to the three things that I stated earlier. I'm really proud of what we've done, I'm proud of the way the teams have executed. It is a challenging environment out there and I think that our teams have proven that we continue to execute regardless of the environment we face. As I said last call, we're running the company on two fronts, we're focused on the execution and the operational excellence and at the same time we're focused on transitioning our business and investing in the future which I think was displayed by our progress in the different areas that I highlighted during the call today. I think that again, if you look at our success and security and collaboration, next-gen data center, the Meraki cloud networking platform and overall on our transition to software and subscription, I think we're on that journey. We've proven that we can transition elements of our portfolio and we're going to apply that same approach again to the rest of our business. We're in the early days in the front end of a long journey but I'm pleased with where we are. So I want to thank all of you for spending time with us today. And I will look forward to talking about to you soon. Marilyn? Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Chuck.

At the request of Cisco Systems, today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect. Now I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Sam. Welcome everyone to Cisco's fourth quarter fiscal 2016 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides including supplemental information will be available on our Web site in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheet, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the financial information section of our Investor Relations Web site. Throughout this conference call we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements including the guidance we will be providing for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. As a reminder in Q2, on November 20th, we completed the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of our SP Video connected devices business and accordingly had no revenue or expense from that business in Q4 fiscal 2016. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP, product orders and backlog information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP Video, CPE business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SP Video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our Web site to help to understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q3 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way. So with that, I'll go ahead and turn it over to Chuck. Chuck Robbins : Thank you, Marilyn. We executed extremely well in Q4 with revenue growth of 2% and record non-GAAP EPS which grew 9%. This was another strong quarter wrapping up a great year. We closed out our fiscal year with $48.7 billion in revenue, up 3%, and non-GAAP EPS which grew 8% to a record $2.36. Gross margins and operating margins were consistently strong throughout the year. We continue to manage our business well and these results underscore our ability to execute against our strategic priorities and our rigorous discipline on profitability. Over this past fiscal year, we experienced a challenging environment with significant volatility. Our fourth quarter was no exception. After three consecutive quarters of growth, both service provider and emerging markets turned negative. Service provider orders declined 5% reflecting the many challenges in that customer segment that you've heard from our peers. In addition, emerging markets orders were down 6%. The remainder of the business remained healthy, with orders growing 5%. While the overall macro environment remains uncertain, we are well positioned to capture the benefits of any tailwinds. At the same time, we're aggressively investing in priority areas to drive growth over the long-term, regardless of the environment. We had strong performance in security; data center switching, collaboration and services as well as continued success in the transition of our business model to software and subscriptions. We remained focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio and we've made great progress over the past year in these priority areas where we continue to see momentum. First, security; Security is the number one priority for every customer. As the global leader in networking, Cisco is uniquely positioned to deliver security at scale with leading edge innovation as we lead the transition to cloud delivered security. Our team has done a phenomenal job of capitalizing on this distinct advantage that Cisco has in the most critical area for our customers. For example, we've been rapidly shifting our model from a primarily hardware business to a software and services business. This past quarter we delivered our third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth with revenue up 16% and deferred revenue growing 29% as a result of this shift. We continue to add significant features and functionality to our security portfolio, both through internal innovation and M&A to meet our customers' most pressing needs, such as cloud defense orchestrator which provides cloud-based security policy management, stealth watch learning networks, which leverages a network infrastructure, analytics and distributed machine learning to provide visibility and security intelligence across the enterprise. We have also extended our cloud-based security platform through our acquisition of CloudLock, an as a service offering enabling the ability to secure cloud applications. Over the past year, we've demonstrated tremendous success and rapidly deploying Cisco's advanced threat solutions to our global customer base with our amp solution now deployed at over 17,000 customers around the world. As we have done in the advanced threat market, we are now deeply focused on winning in the next generation firewall market. We launched our full featured next generation firewall in March and we added over 6,000 customers this past quarter. Second, next generation data center. Over the past year we have continued to invest heavily in our data center portfolio, building upon our core networking foundation as customers look to Cisco for an open programmable and automated infrastructure that accelerates application deployments and provides network services in an agile way. We are delivering technologies across physical, virtual and cloud-based deployments. In Q4, we launched our Tetration Analytics platform, providing complete visibility across the data center. Combining Tetration with Cisco cloud center, we can automate and orchestrate data center application workloads real-time between hybrid and private clouds while enabling policy management with ACI. Our ACI family of products continued to see strong revenue growth in Q4, growing 36% at over a $2.3 billion annualized run rate. In addition, this past quarter marked our first full quarter with HyperFlex, our hyper converged solution and we already have approximately 500 customers and over a quarter of these are net new to UCS. We're off to a great start with a solid pipeline and strong customer feedback. Third, collaboration. This continues to be a consistent growth driver for us. Our strategy and highly differentiated portfolio delivered both on-premise and from the cloud enabled us in FY 2016 to grow revenue 9% to $4.4 billion. In Q4, we delivered another consecutive quarter of solid growth with revenue growing 6% and deferred revenue growing at 13%. Lastly, we continue to see great progress in our transition to software and subscription based models. I've mentioned the success we've had in this area in both security and collaboration and overall our product deferred revenue related to our recurring software and subscription businesses grew 33% in Q4. Our momentum here is strong and we'll continue to accelerate this transition. Today's market requires Cisco and our customers to be decisive, move with greater speed and drive more innovation than we've seen in our history. Today we announced a restructuring enabling us to optimize our cost base and lower growth areas of our portfolio and further invest in key priority areas, such as security, IoT, collaboration, next generation data center and cloud. We expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from these actions back into the businesses and we'll continue to aggressively invest to focus on our areas of future growth. Now, I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more detail on our financials. Kelly Kramer : Thanks, Chuck. We executed well on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value. First, on delivering profitable growth. We had another good quarter with revenue growing 2% and non-GAAP EPS growing 9%. For the full fiscal year, we grew revenue 3% and non-GAAP EPS 8%. For the quarter and the full year we expanded both our gross and operating margins. For the full fiscal year total revenue was $48.7 billion with product up 2% and services up 5%. Let me now walk through the details for Q4. Total revenue was $12.6 billion, up 2% with growth in product revenue of 1% and services of 5%. Switching grew 2% driven by strength in data center switching with continued momentum in ACI and the next generation data center. Routing declined 6%, largely driven by the weakness we saw in service provider. Collaboration grew 6%, driven by continued strength of our TelePresence portfolio which grew in the double digits and continued solid performance of WebEx. Deferred revenue grew 13%. Data center declined 1%. Our hyper converged offering, HyperFlex, is experiencing solid early up tick by our customers led by its highly differentiated architecture. Wireless grew 5% led by growth in cloud-based Meraki partially offset by a decline in controllers. Security grew 16% with deferred revenue growth of 29%. We had strong performance in our advanced threat security and web security solutions, which grew over 80% and 50% respectively. SP Video declined 12% driven by the weakness we saw in China this quarter. Services grew 5% driven by our focus on renewals and attach. So we continue to make solid progress in our goal of driving more recurring revenue, total deferred revenue grew 8% with product up 8% and services up 9%. And as Chuck mentioned, the portion of our deferred product revenue related to our recurring software and subscription businesses grew 33%. From an orders perspective, total product orders grew 1% with our book-to-bill comfortably above 1. Looking at our geographies, which is a primary way we run the business, Americas grew 3%, EMEA was down 3% and APJC grew 4%. Total emerging markets declined 6% with the BRICs plus Mexico down 2%. India was up 20%, while we saw declines in China of 12%. In terms of customer segments, it was good to see a return to growth in enterprise of 3% as well as a solid performance in commercial of 5%. Public sector grew 1% and service provider was down 5%. Our product backlog as we ended Q4 was approximately $4.6 billion, up 1%. We drove strong profitability with expanding leverage in Q4. From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margin was 64.6%, growing 0.7 points with product gross margin of 63.9%, up 0.7 points and service gross margin of 67.0%, up 1.1 points. We increased our non-GAAP operating margin to 31.4%, up 1.3 points. We also saw good momentum and improvements in the profitability for the full fiscal year. On a non-GAAP basis, our total gross margin for the year was 64.7%, an increase of 50 basis points with increases in both product gross margin and service gross margin, up 0.3 points and 1.4 points respectively. Our non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 31.0%, up 1.4 points. We remain disciplined and focused on continuing to drive operational efficiencies and productivity. In terms of our bottom line, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.63, up 9%, GAAP EPS was $0.56. For the full year, we had record non-GAAP EPS of $2.36, up 8%, while GAAP EPS was $2.11. Moving to our portfolio and strategic investments. In Q4, we announced our intent to acquire CloudLock, which has since closed early Q1. The CloudLock acquisition will further enhance Cisco's security portfolio and build on our security everywhere strategy, designed to provide protection from the cloud to the network to the end point and also aligns with our strategy to deliver more cloud-based subscription services. We continued our strategy of investing in key growth areas including security, but also cloud collaboration and IoT and we are committed to looking at the right acquisitions at the right price to drive our growth strategy. Moving on to shareholder value. In Q4 we delivered operating cash flows of $3.8 billion. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of Q4 were $65.8 billion, with $5.9 billion available in the U.S. We returned $2.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter that included $800 million of share repurchases and $1.3 billion for our quarterly dividend. For the full fiscal year, operating cash flow grew 8% to a record $13.6 billion, with free cash flow of $12.4 billion. We returned $8.7 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends which represented 70% of our total free cash flow. We are firmly committed to continuing our capital allocation strategy of returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders annually. To summarize, in Q4 and for the full fiscal year we executed well despite a volatile environment. We focused on consistent, solid execution driving profitable growth, cash generation and operating leverage. We're making the tough decisions and key investments to drive strong financial performance over the long-term and continuing our firm commitment to delivering shareholder value. Let me now reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. The guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 is as follows. We expect our revenue growth to be in the range of minus 1% to plus 1% year-over-year normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from Q1 fiscal year 2016. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29% to 30%. And the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.58 to $0.60. The restructuring action Chuck discussed earlier will impact up to 5500 employees, representing approximately 7% of our global workforce. We will take these actions starting in Q1 of fiscal 2017 and estimate that we will recognize pretax charges to our GAAP financial results up to $700 million. We expect that approximately $325 million to $400 million of these charges will be recognized during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, with the remaining amount recognized during the rest of the fiscal year. I'll now turn it back to Chuck to summarize the call. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Kelly. To wrap up, I want to summarize our priorities as we head into the year ahead and why I'm confident about our opportunities. First, we expect to continue to execute against our strategic priorities and drive profitability regardless of the market conditions. We are committed to making the necessary decisions to drive our future growth and that of our customers and our partners. Second, we believe we will transition more of our revenues to a software and subscription based model and accelerate our shift across our portfolio. Third, we remain committed to increasing our pace of innovation that will help our customers succeed. Lastly, we will continue to execute on our long-term strategy to create even greater value for our customers and shareholders while positioning Cisco for long-term success. Marilyn, I'll turn it back over to you for questions. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Chuck. Sam, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. And while Sam is doing that I would like to remind the audience that we ask you to please ask one question. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank Securities. Your line is now open. Vijay Bhagavath : Thanks, Chuck, Kelly, Marilyn. My question is around demand trends, a lot of clients are asking me this since the press release came out. Help us with any color you can in terms of end markets, product categories, product cycles, anything and everything on demand trends looking into the rest of the year. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Vijay. So I'll provide some comments and ask Kelly for anything else that she'd like to add. So when you look at in Q4 what we obviously saw was after three quarters of growth in the service provider and emerging countries, we saw those turn negative, as I said. And the rest of the business was up 5% from an orders perspective. We also highlighted the fact that enterprise was up 3, a little more color on that is that every geography around the world experienced positive enterprise growth. Commercial was up 5. Every geography around the world experienced positive growth in commercial. And then in public sector it was up 1% and I believe all except perhaps Europe were positive as well in public sector. So outside of SP and emerging, we saw fairly consistent demand and I think that pretty much summarized it. Kelly, what other comments do you have? Kelly Kramer : No. I think you summarized it well. Marilyn Mora : Okay, Sam. Let's go ahead and tee up for the next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Ittai Kidron : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Couple things from me. And Chuck, this is the same question I asked last quarter. Your UCS, your data center business has now been stuck in range for seven quarters in a row and I understand that HyperFlex is seeing some traction, but how do we get that business back to growth again? What is the time line by which you think that could happen? And will you consider going after parts of the market that are maybe more margin sensitive? And then just another small question there, Tetration solution you introduced. Can you just remind us in what product category in the future that will be included and maybe some color on first comments from customers? Chuck Robbins : Absolutely, Ittai. Thank you very much. So on the UCS front, we talked about a couple of things. There's an overall sort of macro demand issue in that space. I think the overall blade market has been somewhat benign. But we've also had -- we've also experienced, as we talked about, a transition to rack and our teams have been working on subsequent innovation across both the blade and the rack business, as well as the introduction of the HyperFlex system. So we have -- I believe the team has a real clear plan. They've got innovation priorities outlined across all of those platforms. And we'll be executing that over the next few quarters. So, Kelly and I actually reviewed this just a couple of days ago. So I feel good about the leadership there. I feel good about their plan and now it's about execution. Kelly, any -- on the Tetration front, let me give you a little color and then Kelly you can talk about how we're going to report it. So, Tetration is -- we announced it in Q4. We're generally beginning order ability I think sometime around now. It is a combination of premise based hardware with subscription software. And so we're just very much in the early days. We have taken a couple of orders from customers. I will tell you that the general feedback from our customers is that it solves a problem that they've had for a very long time that nothing else has solved. So again, we've got that offer ready to go in a combination of premise based and subscription based solution and it is just being turned off from order ability perspective. Kelly Kramer : Right now since it is in the data center solution, it will be in data center switching. We expand that portfolio across we can be really able to give. Chuck Robbins : We'll call it out. Kelly Kramer : Yes. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Chuck and Kelly. Sam, we'll go ahead and take the next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our neck question is from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs & Company. Your line is now open. Simona Jankowski : Hi. Thank you. I just had a clarification first which is, what percent of the business right now is recurring software and subscription revenue? And then as far as my question, gross margins and operating margins were ahead of your target ranges and that's in a quarter when gross margins are typically seasonally down. So just curious, Kelly and Chuck, are you thinking about raising your target margin ranges over time? And just more broadly, how are you thinking about the tradeoff between margins and revenue growth? Kelly Kramer : Yes. So I'll start and Chuck you can jump in. But, to your first question, the portion of our business that is recurring revenue is up to 28%. And that compares to a 25% in Q4 of 2015. So we made really solid progress this year. In terms of the margins, this has been a huge focus for us all quarter long and it is really great to see that we actually had our margins -- gross margins and operating margins up year-over-year for us this year. Its part of what we're driving with our shift to software. Those businesses have great margins and its part of the overall transition. In terms of when do we change our model or our guidance, I think that will come over time as we make bigger shifts at the company level. But that is our goal as we shift to more software that have those nice, great margins. Chuck Robbins : The only other comment I'd make is that when we look at our success relative to subscription and software businesses, we have the product deferred revenue that's associated with software and subscriptions that we said was up 33%. We also have another category of total contract value that we have not recognized revenue on yet that we will be billing customers on, on a monthly basis going forward that we track both those numbers. The second one doesn't show up on our balance sheet yet. If you look at those two combined, which is really reflective of our progress here, that number was actually up 43% over the same period a year ago, just to share one more data point there. Marilyn Mora : Next question, please. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open. Tal Liani : Hi, guys. My questions are about the restructuring program. Two things. First is, are you -- you said that you're doing it in order to increase investments in growth areas versus areas that are not growing. Are you anticipating further decline in growth rates or any issues beyond what we're seeing now in the legacy areas that prompt this kind of program? And second, when we talk about lower growth areas, these are your largest areas, so switches and routers and the question is how do you deal with -- how do you balance between the need to compete and the need to invest and maybe you can give us some colors on the restructuring and what you plan on doing. Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Yes. I'll make some initial comments and again pass it to Kelly. So, Tal, good questions. Primarily we are looking at the areas of growth that we believe will grow faster than others. So it's more of a relative statement than it is an absolute statement. At the same time, we actually are working very diligently on bringing innovation to our core. We're focused on a tighter coupling of security into the core. We're focused on policy and orchestration and cloud-based management across the entire portfolio. So there is a significant amount of innovation the teams are working on there over the next several quarters as well. So it's not that we're ignoring one in favor of another. We just want to make sure that our investments are commensurate with the growth opportunity from a relative perspective. Kelly? Kelly Kramer : No. I think you said it well. We are investing in basically every business unit we have, right. So we're investing in the core in key areas. We're looking for those pockets of where the growth is, whether it's in core routing and switching or security and collaboration. So we're being very smart about where we're putting our money and that's how we're looking at this. Marilyn Mora : We'll go ahead and take our next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Milunovich with UBS Securities. Your line is now open. Steve Milunovich : Thank you very much. Could you talk a bit more about the factors behind your first quarter guidance, revenue being flat is clearly below the recent growth rate and the gross margin is also down a fair amount sequentially. So what do you attribute that to? ChuckRobbins: Yes. I'll give a couple of macro comments here. So we obviously are calling out the weakness we saw from a demand perspective in Q4 relative to SP and emerging countries. We also -- obviously as we look forward, we just -- we're uncertain how to model any improvement in those two in particular going forward. And the other issue is that there is some impact from the transition in our business model. I'll give you a quick example. We restructured and drove new value and how we put together certain Cisco One software packages for our customers. And in Q4 as an example, there was about $139 million that would have been recognized as revenue that because of the way we have now structured those offers and the value the customers see in those, those are going to transition to ratable revenue recognition. So there is slight impact from that as we look forward as well. And those are the key things that led us to our guide. Chuck Robbins : Yes. And just on the only thing to add to that, again, we base it on what we see and again, we did see the additional slowdown in SP and emerging. That makes us a bit cautious. On the margins, Steve, we're going to be driving as much as we can in those margins and we'll be working that. But as of right now, this is what we see. Marilyn Mora : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. James Faucette : Thank you very much. I just wanted a quick question, I think this ties into service provider. Routing was surprising to us that it wasn't a little bit better and I think that's probably attributable to service provider. I want to make sure that's the case. And I guess I'd like kind of your view, seems like with new products in that category that maybe that that category at some point becomes pretty spring-loaded as at least we would expect the valuation units to be shipped in and pent-up demand to develop. But I want to know if we're thinking about that correctly and kind of how we should think about the router segment going forward. Thanks. Kelly Kramer : Yes, James. You're correct in that. Over 50% of our routing business comes from service providers. So there's a direct correlation there. And I think if you look at the discussions that have taken place with our peers, you look at some of the analyst reports on SP CapEx, we actually saw exactly what the analysts have talked about. I saw one report that discussed double-digit declines outside of the United States and maybe flat to slightly up inside the U.S., which is effectively what we saw from a demand perspective. So it was very much in line with that. As far as what we see going forward, look, we certainly don't expect that these networks over time, that the traffic will decline. So I think it's a matter of timing. The video loads on the networks continue to increase. So we would think about it the same way you do, but we also know that in uncertain times that customers' tend to sweat assets as long as they possibly can. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Chuck. Sam, we'll go ahead and take our next question, please. Operator : Yes. Our next question is from James Suva with Citigroup Global Markets. Your line is now open. James Suva : Thanks very much. And I appreciate the opportunity. Congratulations, Chuck and Kelly to your good results. My question is just one part and pretty simple is, regarding Brexit, you're one of the first major tech companies to report that have a full month post the Brexit event happening. Can you talk about, did that influence your visibility, your spending patterns or demand orders or book-to-bill or anything like that, any push-outs, any hesitations? Chuck, you talked many times about uncertainty in economic times we're in. I was wondering has it been compounded by Brexit or was that kind of built in and actually you didn't see much of an impact. Thank you very much. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Jim. I'll tell you after the first year in this job, I know for a fact that every month there are you new things that we face and the good news is we tend to execute well and we deal with those. As it relates to -- first off, let me just say, in the EMEA business the decline there was largely attributed to service providers. So I just want to make that clear. We would not suggest that the broad-based shift in the EMEA results was solely dependent upon Brexit. What we saw from a Brexit perspective is exactly what you would expect. In the U.K. proper, we saw customers pause. We saw them just kind of slow a bit because they're uncertain. And we also saw the impact of the currency devaluation which you would expect. But we remain very committed there. We think we'll work through this. But those are the real impacts. Marilyn Mora : Great. Thanks, Chuck. Sam, let's go ahead and take the next question, please. Operator : Yes. Our next question is from Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Your line is now open. Mark Moskowitz : Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask a follow-up around the restructuring. Can you give us any sense, Chuck or Kelly, is there any benefit here from the early stages of the Ericsson relationship allowing you to leverage that JV so you can actually drive some of this restructuring, does that imply there could be incremental restructuring down the road? And then my question is around the cloud. We keep getting a lot of questions around what is Cisco's exposure to the cloud in terms of can you give us any sense around the percentage of revenue at least to private cloud or public cloud deployments that you're serving from an infrastructure perspective. Thank you. Chuck Robbins : So, on the Ericsson front, I'll tell you that the partnership continues to move forward and there was really no correlation or discussion of the Ericsson partnership as it related to the decision on restructuring. We think that, again, the original benefits that we saw with that partnership with their global scale for services, their OSS capabilities, their radio expertise combined with our IP expertise and data center and security and other capabilities as well as the enterprise and IoT were really the drivers there. So, we see that continuing. As it relates to the cloud impact, I think when we look at sort of next generation data center build out in the private cloud, we look at our ACI portfolio and we saw a $2.3 billion annualized business that grew 36%. So we feel like customers continue to move towards a hybrid cloud environment. The orchestration capability that we talked about with cloud center, which is from the CliQr acquisition, combined with the knowledge that we're going to be able to provide the customers through Tetration. So think about Tetration providing analytics about what's going on, CliQr and ACI then being able to deploy policy and move workloads between public and private cloud and that's what we think customers are going to look for and we think we're in a pretty good spot there. Marilyn Mora : Sam, let's go ahead and take the next question, please. Operator : Yes. Our next question is from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Mitch Steves : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So my first part is kind of on the product gross margin. So looks like it was actually down sequentially in July. And I think that's primarily due to selling more switching and routing. So does that mean in October quarter you think that the mix is going to shift more to legacy kind of routing and switching versus the remaining I guess call it advanced portfolio? And then just one small one. What was the total acquisition revenue you guys got from all the acquisitions this quarter? Kelly Kramer : Yes. So I'll take that. So on the gross margins, we do have seasonality of when different mix of our products are bigger. For example, data center and services are bigger in Q2 and Q4. So, you can see that normal seasonality in there. As I said to the earlier question, I think from an overall perspective we feel great about our gross margins. We are being smart about the tradeoff on top line and bottom line. And the teams continue to do great work in terms of driving productivity and costs out of the products that allow us to do that. From a pricing perspective, our price -- ASP price erosion that we saw in Q4 was basically in line with what we saw in Q3. Actually, 20 basis points better. So we're still in that same range. We're not seeing any change there. In terms of acquisition revenue, we don't typically disclose that but I can tell you it was roughly less than a point. Marilyn Mora : Next question, please. Mitch Steves : Thank you very much. Kelly Kramer : Yes. Operator : And our next question is from Jeff Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Jeff Lubert : Hi, guys. I was hoping you could touch upon the activity you saw from some of your top cloud customers, to what degree you're continuing to see strength in that vertical. And then on the switching business, which saw a return to growth following several soft quarters, I was hoping you can help us understand to what extent ASI revenues are now greater than some of the legacy data center offerings and presuming the mix of legacy and the data center is now smaller than ASI. Would you expect the switching business overall to grow moving power or their offsets that could cause that bad going forward? Chuck Robbins : Thanks Jeff. So, on the WebSkill players, what we reported in the last couple of quarters was our -- our top ten WebSkill customers and that business was up 2% this quarter. But, it is a -- when you have 10 customers in sort of a reporting segment like that, it's highly dependent upon ordering cycle. So, I'm not concerned about our relevance or anything relative to that. On the switching business, I think it's important to understand a couple of things, number one, your question relative to the ASI portfolio and has it exceeded the traditional portfolio, I think we -- the answer to that is, yes. And our orders there were, I think grew in the data center switching business where up mid-single digits. Kelly Kramer : Yes. In the revenue side. Chuck Robbins : On the revenue side. And so, that transition continues to go well and we see customers that are investing in new cloud-ready architectures are choosing the ASI platforms which is shown in the results. When you look at our overall switching portfolio, it's just important to understand the math on what percentage of what business is still attributed to our campus portfolio and as we said, anytime we have these macro -- these environments where customers have any level of uncertainty that tends to an area that they will continue to sweat, if they can. And our job over the next several quarters is to drive innovation in that portfolio, integrate security more tightly. And again, focus on orchestration policy and helping our customers lower their costs and that's what we are trying to do. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Chuck. Next question please. Operator : Yes. Our next question is from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird. Your line is now open. Jayson Noland : Okay, great. I wanted to ask about long-term revenue growth. I think Kelly 3 to 6 has been -- 3% to 6% has been discussed in the past. But, with shift to software and subscription and service provider uncertainty that seems like a stretch, I'm not asking for specific guidance. But, is there some direction that you would suggest for a long-term models? Kelly Kramer : Yes. I think that's a great question Jayson. If you back to -- I think that was back in June of 2015 with our last financial analyst conference. They have changed quite a bit. Our transition has accelerated with -- that we have been accelerating. And I would say the other major change from that long-term guidance was certainly our expectation the data center business in that market has changed. So, I would say, there is no long-term model change per se right now. But, we are in the process of planning an analyst conference hopefully at the end of the calendar year here. And we will update that. But, I would say those are the two major assumption changes since we did that. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Kelly. We have one more question. Time for one more question. Operator : Yes. And our last question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Simon Leopold : Great. Thank you very much. I wanted to see if we can talk a little bit about the longer term on the routing business specifically. What you laid out sounds like very much the cyclical challenges facing your peers as well as weaker CapEx. But, if you could help us understand some of the longer term themes around what's going on in routing and how that sector may grow and your business may grow. I'm pondering the implications around sort of FDN as well as some of the architectural shifts of pretty more over the burden into the optical space. Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Yes. Simon, thanks for the question. So, when I think about routing, I actually think about it in several different ways. Number one, you got SP traditional portfolio with edge access and core, which we discussed earlier which is largely just a consumption driven cycle that we go through. In the enterprise space, we have this transition to software defined wide area networking, which we are very well positioning right now with our IWAN portfolio and we are actually working on -- a key differentiator for us which I think is -- as our teams have built out the ability to really drive the next generation secure edge with our cloud security capabilities, the combination of dynamically provisioning those branch solutions with the ability to have robust cloud security and edge security is going to be a real differentiator for us. So we see that being another opportunity for us going forward in the routing space. And then, finally, when we talk about the security and the security driven refresh of our core, in Q4, we actually had a couple of customers, I talked earlier in the opening comments about stealth watch learning networks, which is effectively a machine learning algorithm that runs at the edge of the network in the branch. And it actually does machine learning and a little of AI to determine normalcy for customers, and then, flag for them, when they see abnormal behavior going on. And we saw a couple of customers that actually made the decision to do a branch router refresh based on that capability, which we just launched in July. So we believe that there is innovation that we can bring that will lead us to a refresh opportunity in the core and we think that's largely going to be driven around security. And we are seeing some real early examples. We need to see how it plays out. But, we are seeing some early examples there. Chuck Robbins : All right, Marilyn. Thank you very much. In wrapping up, I just want to summarize our priorities again as we think about the year ahead. First off, we're committed to executing against the financial model and against our priorities, regardless of the conditions of the market and we're committed to making the decisions that are necessary to drive our growth and also to fulfill the commitments and obligations that we made to our customers, partners and shareholders. We also are pleased with where we are on the transition to software and subscription models and you can assume that we'll continue to accelerate that over the next year. We also, I believe will drive a greater pace of innovation than you've seen in the last several years from Cisco. Our teams are very excited. There's a lot of things going on. So we're very committed to driving innovation. And then finally, just to reiterate, our long-term strategy to create greater value for our customers and our shareholders while ensuring that we're also making the decision for Cisco's long-term success will remain at the forefront. So I want to thank everyone for spending time with us today. And we'll look forward to talking to all of you soon. Marilyn? Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Chuck. Cisco's next quarterly call which will reflect our fiscal year 2017 first quarter results will be on Wednesday, November 16, 2016, at 1 :30 PM Pacific time, 4:30 PM Eastern time.

At the request of Cisco Systems, today\u2019s call is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect. Now I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, you may begin. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Sam. Welcome everyone to Cisco\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2017 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I\u2019m joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides including supplemental information will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheet, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the financial information section of our Investor Relations website. As is customary in Q1, we would need certain reclassification to acquire period announced to conform to the current periods presentation. The reclassified amounts have been posted on our website. Click on the financial reporting section of the website to access these documents. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and we will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements including the guidance we will be providing for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent annual reports on Forms 10-K which identifies important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. As a reminder in Q2, fiscal 2016 on November 20th, 2015 we completed the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of our SP Video connected devices business and accordingly had no revenue or expense from that business in Q1 fiscal 2017. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP Video, CPE business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SP Video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help to understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q4 earnings call and today\u2019s call has been normalized in the same way. So with that, I\u2019ll go ahead and turn it over to you Chuck. Chuck Robbins : Thank you, Marilyn. So we delivered a strong Q1 in an environment that continues to be challenging. We executed very well in the quarter with revenue growing 1% and non-GAAP earnings per share growing 3% along with continued strength in non-GAAP gross and operating margins. This quarter totaled product orders declined 2% largely due to service provider orders declining 12% which was worse than our expectations heading into the quarter. We continue to show great progress in how we are aligning our business model to the way our customers want to consume Cisco technology. There are many strong indicators that we are driving this change including the 48% growth in our product deferred revenue related to our recurring software and subscriptions. At the same time we are delivering more innovation with simple intelligent automated solutions with industry leading security across our portfolio. Let me review a few areas of our business where our innovation is driving momentum. First security; our security revenue grew 11% marking the 4th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. We\u2019re driving more subscription based recurring business resulting in deferred revenue growth of 39%. Our competitive position in security is growing stronger as our integrated architecture approach and best-of-breed portfolio resonates with our customers. In fact, we\u2019re the only company with security product revenue exceeding $2 billion annualized run rate with double-digit growth. I\u2019m incredibly pleased with how the team has transformed this business from where we were just a few years ago establishing Cisco as the market leader in the most critical priority area for our customers. This past quarter, we again drove rapid adoption of our advanced threat solutions with amp revenue growing over 70% and now deployed at over 22,000 customers globally. We also see ongoing traction with our next generation firewall revenue growing over 35%, as we added 5,300 customers in Q1 bringing our total next gen firewall customer base to approximately 62,000. Going forward we\u2019re driving innovation as we extend our security architecture from the network to the endpoint to the cloud. Over two weeks ago at our partner summit, we launched our enhanced AMP for endpoints a SaaS based cloud managed security solution combining prevention, detection and response capabilities delivering simplified and affective endpoint security through our threat-centric architecture. Second, our next generation data center. Our goal is to build the best private and hybrid cloud solutions for our customers. We\u2019re investing heavily in our data center portfolio to extend our market leadership. To do this, we\u2019re delivering software, hardware and systems at all levels of the data center stack and across delivery models. Our customers widespread adoption of Cisco ASI family of data center networking products continued in Q1 with revenue growth of 33% to an annualized revenue run rate now of $3 billion. The automation of data center networks that ACI delivers is the first step in enabling our customers to move workloads in and out of public cloud environments while maintaining enterprise security and policy. We are building on the foundation of ACI by extending our capabilities with analytics through Tetration, agnostic cloud management with CloudCenter from our CliQr acquisition and our hyper converged offering, HyperFlex. This will give our customers flexibility, agility and savings by delivering the benefits of both private and public clouds. We have a unique set of capabilities to lean in this market and address our customers\u2019 needs for delivering business applications quickly, cost effectively and at scale. In collaboration, we\u2019re adding new capabilities to our collaboration and IoT offerings through organic investments acquisitions and partnerships. As a global market leader, Cisco\u2019s collaboration business has a solid foundation to drive our roadmap of products and services that will increasingly be delivered from the cloud such as Spark our end-to-end business collaboration suite. Over the last few months we\u2019ve added two significant partners to our collaboration ecosystem. We announced a global strategic alliance with sales force to natively integrate Cisco\u2019s cloud collaboration platform with Salesforce\u2019s Lightning platform. This will deliver expanded reach and relevance as part of our cloud strategy. We also formed an alliance with IBM to further enhance the collaboration experience for our customers by combining our collaboration and analytics technologies. We are integrating our Cisco\u2019s Spark and WebEx offerings with IBM\u2019s cloud collaboration solutions along with cognitive computing capabilities enabled by the IBM Watson platform. While the dynamics in service provider and emerging markets continue to present headwinds to overall growth. I\u2019m pleased with our success in accelerating our momentum in our key investment areas and our commitment to operational discipline. Now let me hand it over to Kelly to walk through our Q1 results and outlook in more detail. Kelly Kramer : Thanks Chuck. We executed well on our financial strategy of driving profitable growth, managing our portfolio in strategic investments and delivering shareholder value. On driving profitable growth total revenue grew 1% while our non-GAAP EPS was up 3%. We expanded our profitability year-over-year with increases in both non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margin. Let me provide some details on revenue. Total products revenue was down 1%, we saw switching decline 7% driven by weakness in campus partially offset by continued strong momentum in ACI, which was up 33% as Chuck mentioned. In campus, we still see a pause in enterprise spend largely driven by uncertainty in the macro environment. Routing grew 6% driven by growth in both SPCORE and Edge. Collaboration was down 3% although we did have solid order growth. The revenue decrease was driven by TelePresence and unified communications endpoint partially offset by strong growth of 10% in conferencing as we see more customers each quarter committing to WebEx. We saw good momentum again in the transition to subscriptions and SaaS offers with deferred revenue up 14%. Data center declined 3% impacted by the market shift we\u2019ve seen from Blade to Rack. While not significant in terms of revenue at this point, we did see our new hyper converged offering, HyperFlex has solid early uptake by our customers. Wireless declined 2% led by a decline in controllers and soft E-rate funding partially offset by strong growth in Meraki with our cloud managed product line. Security grew 11% with deferred revenue growth of 39% as we transition to more software and recurring revenue, we had strong performance in our advanced threat security up 100% as well as web security solutions which was up 60%. Services grew 7% with our ongoing focus on renewals and attach rates. Overall we\u2019re making progress each quarter on our goal of driving more recurring revenue. Total deferred revenue grew 12% with product up 19% and services up 8%. The portfolio of our product deferred revenue related to our recurring software and subscription businesses grew 48% to $3.8 billion. From an orders perspective total product orders declined 2% with book to bill below one. Looking at our geographies which is the primary way we run our business, Americas was down 4%, EMEA grew 1% and APJC grew 4%. Total emerging markets declined 2% with the BRICs plus Mexico up 2%. In terms of customer segments enterprise grew 5%, commercial grew 1%, public sector was flat and service provider declined 12%. We are driving consistent profitability from a non-GAAP perspective total gross margin was 65.2% growing 0.3 points with product gross margin of 64.8%, up 0.3 points and service gross margin flat at 66.2%. We increased our non-GAAP operating margin to 31.6% improving 0.2 points. We remained disciplined and focus on increasing operational efficiencies and productivity. In terms of our bottom line, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.61 up 3%, GAAP EPS with $0.46. Moving to our portfolio and strategic investments, we completed three acquisitions in Q1 increasing our investments in key priority and growth areas including CloudLock which specializes in cloud access security broker technology which is part of our security business. ContainerX that develops enterprise class container management technology and Worklife which develops meeting software that is complementary to our collaboration business. Moving onto shareholder value, in Q2 we delivered operating cash flow of $2.7 billion total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of Q1 were $71 billion with $10.4 billion available in US. We returned $2.3 billion to shareholders during the quarter that included $1 billion of share repurchases and $1.3 billion for our quarterly dividend. To summarize, we executed well and Q1 delivering strong profitable growth. The ultimate solid progress in our transition to more software and subscription based models. We\u2019re committed to making the key strategic moves in disciplined investments to drive long-term financial performance and deliver shareholder value. So now let me reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. The guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 is as follows; we expect revenue to decline in the range of minus 2% to minus 4% year-over-year normalized to exclude the SP Video\u2019s CPE business for Q2, fiscal year 2016. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64% and the non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29% to 30%. The non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.57. So I\u2019ll now turn it back over to Chuck to summarize the call. Chuck Robbins : Thanks Kelly. I\u2019m very pleased with the success of the investments we\u2019ve made in priority growth areas such as security, collaboration in our ACI platform. These areas are key building blocks along with our strong franchise in switching and routing that place Cisco in a unique position with our customers as they become increasingly digital. As you\u2019ve seen with our Meraki platform, we\u2019ve achieved rapid adoption of cloud managed networking with enterprise security and policy delivered as a service. Over the next several years, we will bring this automation, management and security at scale to the balance of our switching and routing portfolio as we continue to offer new consumption models aligned to our customer\u2019s needs. While this is no small task, it\u2019s an incredible opportunity for Cisco as we bring the successful model to the largest part of our business. As we make these investments, we also remain firmly committed to operational discipline and driving long-term value for our customers and shareholders and I\u2019m very optimistic about our future. Marilyn, now I\u2019ll turn it back to you for questions. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Chuck. Sam let\u2019s go ahead and open the line for questions and while Sam is doing that, I would like to remind the audience that we ask you to please ask one question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Ittai Kidron : Chuck, I want to talk a little bit about the product that makes between the division of the, I mean the switching results are very disappointing clearly, the wireless is now declining, data center and I\u2019ve been asking you about data centers for three quarters in a row and it\u2019s still not delivering and you\u2019ve had some changes in leadership over there as well, so just [ph] still not where it needs to be. I guess I\u2019m trying to gage how much of the challenges that you\u2019re seeing here right now in your opinion are macro driven versus perhaps portfolio driven because it seems like a lot of competitors in some of these areas are actually doing very well in switching for example Aruba in wireless, HP and then the data center is doing well, [indiscernible] clearly doing well. these are key major areas for you and we\u2019re seeing revenue decline so help us understand kind of little bit what\u2019s going on under the surface here and what is it, that makes you feel comfortable that there is no big problem. You\u2019re on the flipside is there anything on the portfolio side that you think kind of turned the tide here. Chuck Robbins : Ittai, thanks for the question. So let me hit a few of those areas and let me first just acknowledge there are always areas that we can execute more effectively. So we\u2019re working right now. The team\u2019s been working over the last year on innovation and many of the areas that you mentioned and again I\u2019m optimistic about the pipeline of innovation that we have right now. I think when you look at the switching portfolio for us, back in January when we saw the real market declines at that time and we called out the first pause we saw in the enterprise campus refresh, it\u2019s just basically maintained, it stayed the same way throughout the year. So I\u2019m pretty comfortable with our position there and as we continue to work on bringing automation and security and cloud based management to the rest of the portfolio. I think that will help our customers see the opportunity to refresh. For me it\u2019s really about as we look at the key driver refresh over the longer term in the campus I think it\u2019s going to be really around automation which can substantially reduce the operating expenses for our customers as well as security into the network and analytics out of the network. In a couple of other areas, you mentioned I think. In UCS there\u2019s been a fundamental shift in the data center too again we\u2019ve talked about the Rack technology and in hyper converged we have some early success with HyperFlex and we have some new capabilities that will be coming out after the first of the calendar year that I think will help us in that space and on the wireless front, I think there are really, I think there are two key drivers there. First of all is, the market is transitioning to a controller-less architecture so in large part our access points were actually positive, but the controller side of that business was down. Meraki was positive and then also we are pretty substantial recipient of E-rate business so as that has moved out much more slowly than expected I think, that has also impacted that business. So hopefully that gives you some color around those areas. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Chuck. Sam will go ahead and take our next question please. Operator : Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Marilyn Mora : Vijay, are you there? Vijay Bhagavath : Yes, I\u2019m here. I\u2019m sorry I was talking to myself on mute. So once again, replay. Chuck, Kelly. In some sense the January quarter guide is a snapshot in time and it lags what CEO, CIOs could be thinking latest in terms of their spending intentions for the New Year. So my question for both of you is, in your latest calls with business leaders post-elections in particular has CEO, CIO sentiments here in the US in particular improved in your view and where do you think would be focus areas of spending in the context of your portfolio and then Kelly internally in the company where would invest the most in terms of the product roadmap. Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Vijay. I think if you just look at our guidance let me be clear. It\u2019s predominantly the SP weakness and the overall CapEx challenges that we\u2019ve seen in SP and that business is large account driven. You can assume that we have done an account, by account, by account analysis in that space and understand what\u2019s going on there. Right now I think there are unique set of characteristics particularly in SP space you have the overarching macro uncertainty in the economy which I think has led to the SP CapEx weakness has been reported all year by the analyst as well as you have the political and regulatory environments. They are somewhat uncertain both in the US and around the world. Some of those could turn more favorable, some of those could remain negative we\u2019re just not going to model any improvement there and that\u2019s the real reason for the guide, just to be clear on that. Post-election I think that, most CEOs that I talk to we are pragmatic about the result and now we are all focused on the policy issues that matter to each of our companies and we are I think that President-elect Trump appears to be very business oriented and is very focused on driving the US economy and anytime the US economy improves, that\u2019s certainly good for us. Kelly any comments. Kelly Kramer : No, I agree and then to address where we\u2019re investing the most because no matter what the economy, we\u2019re going to be investing for the future. I\u2019d say it\u2019s in the same areas we have been, right. We are continuing to invest heavily in security we think there is a lot of room to run there. And I think we\u2019re benefiting and you\u2019re seeing us benefit from having not only a best-of-breed portfolio but an integrated solution that ultimately, we do think once CIOs, start spending again we\u2019ll see also drive some of the campus hopefully. So for sure security, data center is a focus for us and Chuck mentioned some of the innovation we have with the data center but also with the analytics around that. And then even in the core we\u2019re investing, right. Chuck talked about how we\u2019re driving automation and things along those lines and so we\u2019re putting heavily our investment there as we drive innovation that you\u2019ll see today as well as going forward in the next few quarters. Marilyn Mora : Great thanks, Kelly. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Pierre Ferragu with Bernstein. Your line is open. Pierre Ferragu : I just wait to dig a bit into your deferred product revenues this quarter that when increased I think by a bit more than a $1 billion year-on-year and actually $700 million or so, almost $700 million sequentially. So it\u2019s a very impressive performance and the question I have is, how do I take that into account when I look at your overall product performance. So you have product revenues slightly down in the quarter, but I would assume that a lot of that is related to the transition towards your subscription business model. So do you have any estimate of how much this transition has impacted your number this quarter and then of course I have the same question for next quarter, your guide is very conservative. How much of this transition is actually impacting your guide for Q2 as well? Kelly Kramer : Thanks, Pierre, appreciate the question. So yes, we\u2019re very happy with the progress we\u2019re making on it and you can see it on the balance sheet to your point. We\u2019re up sequentially as well as over $1 billion or $1.2 billion year-over-year. I\u2019d say it\u2019s a couple of points for sure intact on our growth and it\u2019s a combination of, it\u2019s largely - been historically collaboration and security in Meraki but we\u2019re continuing to add on our core platform with our Cisco 1 suite like I mentioned last quarter which - that is now being recognized ratably where a year ago, we would have recognized that as a perpetual license sale. So for example just using Cisco 1 as an example in this quarter it would have been point and half just on that just on that if we had recognized it, perpetually like we had a year ago. So it\u2019s for sure about at least two points and clearly that continues to grow and accelerate. So you can assume we\u2019re assuming that in my guidance. And my guidance for the next quarter is as Chuck mentioned right, we definitely saw the same thing we saw last quarter with the slowdown in SP but it actually accelerated and I wouldn\u2019t call my guidance conservative, I\u2019d say it\u2019s absolutely what we see right now based on all of the factors we take into account. Marilyn Mora : All right, Sam will go ahead and take our next question. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Simona Jankowski : I just wanted to confirm Chuck that and the reason for the guidance being a little weaker is entirely to do with the softness you described in service provider orders and just to dig into that and understand that a little better, it looks like your routing business was I think you said up 7% in the prepared remarks, although I see it as up 17% in the numbers posted online, but regardless it looks like routing was quite strong. So what other products within that service provider vertical accounted for the weakness and when we look at the CapEx trends they definitely have been weak year-to-date, but they\u2019re implied to improve quite a bit into year end. So just curious if you\u2019re not seeing that. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Simona. So I\u2019ll let Kelly keep me honest on this, but I think our routing revenue that we reported in Q1 was 6% positive. So if that\u2019s incorrect, we need to fix that. Kelly Kramer : Yes Chuck Robbins : And then on the guide, what I believe is that the predominant reason for the guide down is the service provider space. It\u2019s 25% of our business roughly and it was down 12% in new orders and you guys know the content of our revenue that is from current quarter booking, so the forecast this past quarter and the performance was negative 12 and we\u2019re not just not modeling right now any improvement. Simona, you\u2019ve written some great stuff around the SP CapEx environment and so I think you know as well as anyone and while there is some forward-looking optimism many of those cases there is money being spent on density in mobile network scenarios that we may not be a direct recipient as well as we also know there is a lot of variability in how the actual actually play out vis-\u00e0-vis the forecast. So we\u2019re just making sure that we really see that, I think there is also [indiscernible] around the world relative to what\u2019s going to happen in the political environment and just a little bit of wait and see and I think that\u2019s going to have an impact. Could be positive, could be tough. Based on the SP CapEx, but most of the guide challenge that we have is related to SP. Kelly anything to add? Kelly Kramer : No, I think you summarized it well and I think just to add to your question, Simona. I\u2019m not going into currency [ph] detail what else is in there besides us peak quarter routing, but obviously our enterprise routing business is in there, mobile packet core those kind of areas that we saw, that are included in the revenue and to Chuck\u2019s point, the routing business is certainly got a lot of big deals driven and the pressure we see from the orders, you can expect to see coming in the future as Chuck mentioned. Chuck Robbins : Yes, one other comment or two. When I talked about customers that we saw just fundamentally freeze CapEx some of those did it for their own earnings requirements, some of them did it, we have examples that occurred based on currency challenges FX issues. We saw some that were connected to consolidation that\u2019s going on in the industry. So we saw different flavors but we did see a fair number of customers around the world that just put the brakes on. Marilyn Mora : All right, thanks Chuck. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. James Faucette : I wanted to ask just around the security business obviously that\u2019s been pointed out, that it\u2019s developing pretty well. But I\u2019m wondering few things, first the pace of acquisitions and specifically what looked to be tuck-in acquisitions seemed to have slowed a little bit this quarter versus what it had been running. So I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re feeling like you\u2019ve got the portfolio and the technology where you needed or should we expect to see acquisitions continue to run pretty high and perhaps those reaccelerate and my second is, on security and I think Kelly you kind of alluded to this, but at what point do we start to see incremental benefit on some of the other businesses from security footprint, it seems like a lot of the value of security can be tied to new hardware and switch to your networking etc. so should we expect to see some incremental pull through or benefit to little more traditional hardware businesses and if so, when should we expect that? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : James, thanks. This is Chuck. So as it relates to the first part of your question, on the acquisition capabilities. I think what you\u2019ll find with this team is that, there is a ton of internal innovation that\u2019s occurring. We again at the partner summit launched AMP or Endpoints which is to bring the endpoints into the consolidated architecture. You can assume that we\u2019re actively continuing to scan the landscape relative to acquisitions that fit within the architecture to bring new capabilities. I think that when I took the role I would probably suggest that there was a little bit of pent up demand around some companies that seems wanted to move on and we moved relatively quickly in the first year or so, but I wouldn\u2019t assume that suggest that there is no more activity that we will see there, I think we will. As I relates to the core networking platforms and at what point we will see security pulling through, I think we have had some examples over the last few years where we\u2019ve seen particularly security portfolios integrated into routing platforms as the teams have done, that we have seen as we sell those as licenses that run on top of routers assuming the routers have the right horsepower they\u2019re fine if they don\u2019t and [indiscernible] refresh, there\u2019s some capabilities that teams are working on that actually provide security at the packet level inside the network, our intent over the next several quarters is to bring some of that technology to market and give our customers greater visibility and give them another yet another source of contributing to the threat landscape out of the network itself, so we\u2019ll have to wait and see, how successful we are, that\u2019s our plan. Marilyn Mora : All right, thanks James for the question. Next question please. Sam. Operator : Next question is from James Suva with Citigroup Global Markets. Your line is open. James Suva : Great thanks very much. Chuck and Kelly when you mentioned the putting the brakes on, for some of the demand. Can you clarify a little bit, was that mostly due to like the uncertainty around the election or just more uncertainty global demand. And now that the election is over, does the political uncertainty about how the tax and policy changes, what happens because those breaks to last in your opinion like how long or how - when did the breaks come off? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Well Jim thanks. I think there is not one answer to that question honestly, as I said earlier there are some customers that are looking at consolidation that lead them to take a pause. There are some that are focused on density of their mobile networks as opposed to their core routing platforms or their edge routing platforms. There are some that outside the United States who faced incredible currency headwinds and just decided to stop their CapEx spend until they had better clarity around the currency situation and then there are some providers around the world not necessarily in the US even that have that are dealing with political dynamics and potential regulatory issues that just aren\u2019t clear. And so I think it\u2019s a little bit of all of that, my assessment of when those issues are resolved is dependent upon the issues themselves and we\u2019re going to have to wait and see, how they play out. I have not heard a lot say US based service providers who have directly related to the election, but I do believe that the regulatory environment in the US is obviously in flux now around the telecom environment and that could have implications for the service providers and some of the may wait and see how that plays out. Marilyn Mora : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Jeff Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Jeff Lubert : I was hoping you could update on what you saw on the cloud vertical last quarter, you saw some weakness there. Saw straight or that bounce back what products you\u2019re seeing success with, with this customer sad and where you are in your process to drive share with these operators? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Yes, Jeff so what we talked about last couple quarters is just the top 10 that we have and they were roughly flat this quarter, but I\u2019ll tell you we had some performances that were incredibly strong within that at an account level and some that were pausing some various reasons. I think that each account is different and I think over the last couple of years what we\u2019ve been talking about is a deep engagement at the individual customer level and where we\u2019ve done that we have begun to see success and you can assume that we are having discussions with each of them individually and we also are, I think uniquely positioned where in many cases these companies or markets have won and we have the ability to assign dedicated engineering teams to really line up our offerings against their specific requirements and those are the discussions, we\u2019re having right now. Marilyn Mora : All right. Thanks Jeff for the question. Sam, go ahead and take the next question please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Silverstein with Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Paul Silverstein : Kelly a clarification and a question. The question is, what\u2019s the pricing environment look like has there been any change? And I was hoping I don\u2019t know if you gave the number earlier but not, what was software as a percentage of total revenue. And can you remind us, I think it was 29% last quarter, but if you could remind us what it was, what it was this quarter? Thank you. Kelly Kramer : Sure. So I\u2019ll answer that one first. So the recurring revenue number I think it\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about which is a combination of our product recurring revenue from the software and SaaS businesses plus the recovering revenue from service. So this quarter that was 29% and we continue to make progress of product that has grown to be 9% up from 6% of our product revenue in Q1, 2016 so we continue to make progress there, so that\u2019s up to 29% versus it was 28% in Q4 and 25.5% in Q1. So making a progress there. On the pricing question Paul, we\u2019re definitely in the same ranges that we normally have been. It\u2019s actually year-over-year slightly better than we were last quarter which is largely driven by the mix of what we saw. So I would say it\u2019s a normal ranges but how we\u2019re driving that internally is of course we\u2019re very disciplined around pricing that we\u2019ve talked about but we empower ourselves sales leaders and country leaders to, we measure them on three things, we measure on revenue growth, we measure them on operating margin growth and we measure on them on driving market share and they\u2019re empowered to make tradeoffs between those and if they need to give more price to win the franchises want to win, they will do. So good news is, they\u2019re again continuing to be very disciplined, making those tradeoffs and the pricing is staying in the normal ranges. Marilyn Mora : Okay, thanks Kelly. Sam will take the next question. Operator : Our next question is from Steve Milunovich with UBS. Your line is open. Steve Milunovich : Chuck, we just wrapped up our tech conference and we had a panel on folks who helped companies moved to the cloud and the general consensus was that private cloud implementations generally are not working and many companies that begin on a private cloud path end up going down a public cloud path. So obviously there is still a lot of legacy and so forth, but if in fact private cloud is not going to do very well, you and others are very focused on that business and the risk is at on-prem pie is declining. Are you seeing something different and do you believe that the on-prem businesses is going to grow for Cisco? Chuck Robbins : Thanks Steve. So I think that over the next year to two years that a lot of the complexity in building out private infrastructure and private clouds for our customers will be alleviated. All right, I think the entire industry is going to focus on much like we talked about even in the networking systems of how we bring automation and operational relief to our customers and give them the ability to automate policy and security and manage all of these devices from their private cloud or from the cloud. I think that level of simplicity and those capabilities will improve. I think what we see is, best represented by our ACI portfolio when you look at our customers who are building out modern data center infrastructure I think those are representative of the customers who believe that they\u2019re going to have a hybrid environment and that piece of business grew 33% is up to $3 billion run rate. So I think your observations are probably valid particularly if you look at like the lot of OpenStack, early OpenStack implementations. But I do think that customers are going to want to have that capability and I think we as an industry will continue to work on simplifying how that operational capability shows up within our customer base. Marilyn Mora : Great, thanks Chuck. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Your line is open. Mark Moskowitz : Chuck and Kelly, I want to get a sense of your, if there\u2019s going to be change [indiscernible] related to how the teams are incentivized around margin, just given the company continues to outpace the guidance on the gross margin line, is there something wrong [indiscernible] or it\u2019s just all just because mix due to the broader macro weaknesses. Thank you. Kelly Kramer : Sure, I mean I think this has been a multi-year thing that we have been driving. I\u2019d say that we in sense like I mentioned the leadership at the higher levels at a margin level and then they have also controls at certain discount level so they can also manage that within their region. So it is definitely part of the focus, we have tools that are set up that when a sales person puts a deal in, it\u2019s easy to see how that deal falls in from a margin perspective to help them, make good deals if you will. So the incentives haven\u2019t changed at all this year. I think it\u2019s just the sales teams are incredibly disciplined around it and I\u2019d say the whole company understands the trade-off of that, right I mean we are all focused on making the tradeoffs so we can optimize and drive as much growth as possibly can and go after every point of market share that we can, but they also understand the power of the margins and that helps drive it. I\u2019d say, only the other thing to think about is, with the acquisitions that we have been doing that have been largely software related whether it\u2019s in security or cloud, those SaaS businesses certainly have very high margins that just help add to the mix and again as we continue to do that, you\u2019ll continue to see a positive buyers in our margin. Chuck Robbins : Just one comment, Mark. Kelly and I have worked with the teams and from a leadership team perspective we have three measurements that they\u2019re held accountable for revenue, margins and market share and that\u2019s how we just try to keep people focused on a healthy balance. Kelly Kramer : And this is not just, this is at all levels of the organization. And our Head of Sales and our Head of Partner Sales they are all part of this pricing council that we have that, we try to be very agile when we make pricing either new product pricing or changes to product pricing to take advantage of where any elasticity is. Marilyn Mora : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Tal Liani with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open. Tal Liani : I have a macro question and I want to ask you in the context of switching. There is a very big gap between the next quarter guidance year-over-year growth rate and your long-term growth. And the question that I have is, what part of the difference is macro, so if the macro slightly improves can you get there or is there anything that you can do on the product side that we\u2019ll get too closer and I want to ask it in a context of switching given that you had a major overhaul or major upgrade to your switching in the last few years, but we haven\u2019t seen the growth rates improving that dramatically, so what can you do and what is macro? Kelly Kramer : Yes, I know I think Tal that\u2019s a great question. I\u2019d say let\u2019s just talk about switching. I\u2019d say for campus switching which is two-thirds roughly of our entire switching business which is our biggest business unit. I\u2019d say most of that is macro, right. I mean it is the one area and I think we\u2019ve talked about this before, it\u2019s one area that people can put off doing a refresh, if there is any macro concerns and that\u2019s what we typically see anytime you see any economic pause or macro event. So I do truly feel that if the optimism we\u2019ve seen this week in the stock market continues giving that feeling of optimism in the economy I would expect that to raise all boats in our campus switching side. I\u2019d say in the data center side you understand the dynamic there, right for - to your point, we launched a fantastic product couple years ago but we had to manage through the transition of a very sizable legacy business data center portfolio declining is that, accelerated and so we managed through that and again that business we know has continued to grow as we go through that intersection and cross through now as legacy piece we\u2019ve worked largely through. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s why I say it\u2019s largely macro especially on the campus side. Marilyn Mora : All right, thanks Kelly. We\u2019ll take our next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Kvaal with Nomura. Your line is open. Jeff Kvaal : I wanted to shift gears little bit and talk about the balance sheet, if I could. Obviously you and many other companies in tech space have been advocating the repatriation - decade, a very long time. Could you help us understand or remind us what, where you would like to take that money should you bring it back to the US? And then the second part of that question is, look there is some sentiment that interest rates will start heading north again, do you take that into account when considering your dividend policy. Thank you. Kelly Kramer : All right, Jeff. So great question I love balance sheet questions, actually. So yes, I mean again we have talked about tax reform for a very long time and I can say that what\u2019s encouraging is with the incoming administration, this is one of their top priorities that they said they\u2019re going to prioritize in their first 100 days, so we\u2019re encouraged that something will happen now, it\u2019s very early and we don\u2019t really know the details besides what his platform was during his campaign. So we\u2019re going to watch it very closely and look forward to as the details flush out there. But just high level, as you could imagine we have many, many scenarios of what we would do when repatriation comes, which is a combination of obviously we would ring sense in our debt and then we would have a blend of actions we can certainly take with our dividend as well as our share buyback, as well as within flexibility for us to be able to do M&A and strategic investment. So it would be a combination of all those things, obviously we\u2019re looking very closely to our shareholders and how we want to do that and we recognize it will certainly give us a lot more flexibility. I\u2019m sorry, I apologize. On the interest rates, yes. On the interest rates would affect our dividend policy again we\u2019ve been committed to growing our dividend with our earnings and again driving that to great yield as our EPS grow. So interest rates go up, they go down we\u2019re committed to growing as our earnings grow. A - Marilyn Mora : Great thanks Kelly. I believe that is our last question. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Chuck to wrap it up. Chuck Robbins : Thanks Marilyn. So just in summary once again we delivered a strong quarter in an environment that obviously continues to be challenging. I\u2019m very pleased with the success that we\u2019ve seen in security, [indiscernible], ACI, our deferred product revenue from software and subscription and we remained focused on executing against the things that we control and to that extent I think the teams have done a very good job. We\u2019re obviously focused now on continuing to execute in those areas as well as I talked about earlier bringing automation management and security at scale to the balance of our switching and routing portfolio and aligning with our customer\u2019s desires and how they consume our technology. And finally, we will obviously remain very committed to operational discipline and long-term value for our customers and our shareholders and we thank you all for spending time with us today and Marilyn and kick it back to you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Chuck.

At the request of Cisco Systems, today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect. Now I'd like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Sam. Welcome everyone to Cisco's second quarter fiscal 2017 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO, and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on form 10-K and 10-Q which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. As a reminder, in Q2 fiscal 2016, on November 20, 2015, we completed the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of our SP video connected devices business and accordingly had no revenue or expense from that business in Q2 fiscal 2017. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP video CPE business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SP video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website, to help understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q1 earnings call also has been normalized in the same way. With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thank you, Marilyn, and good afternoon everyone. We performed well this quarter, delivering total revenue of $11.6 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.57. We drove strong profitability, healthy cash flow and growth in deferred revenue, continuing our shift toward software and recurring revenue. We also drove 51% growth in our product deferred revenue related to our recurring software and subscriptions which now stands at $4 billion. We're also pleased that the board approved a 12% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.29. We are delivering against our strategic priorities, offering unparalleled value to our customers and we're executing and managing the business to deliver greater shareholder return. Through a disciplined investment approach, we are focused on expanding our growth opportunities and strengthening our customer value proposition. We were very pleased to announce our intent to acquire AppDynamics as a continuation of our strategy to provide customers with deep analytics across the data center, the network as well as their applications. Increasingly, customers are seeing significant business value being delivered through applications and access through intelligent networks. Combining Cisco's infrastructure, networking and security analytics with the application analytics from AppDynamics, we will provide customers with unprecedented insights to improve business performance. The conversations I have every day with business and government leaders around the world reinforce the importance of our strategy. They look to Cisco to connect everything and everyone by building highly secure, software defined, automated and intelligent infrastructure platforms. We offer these solutions through a variety of consumption options, giving our customers choice and flexibility. I'd now like to cover some key business highlights, starting with our security business. We had another great quarter in security, which continued its strong momentum and growth. Revenue grew 14% and deferred revenue grew 45%, reflecting the strength of our best-of-breed offerings and architectural approach to security from the network to the endpoint to the cloud. Two weeks ago, we released the 10th Annual Cisco Cybersecurity Report, which highlights the increasing risk customers are facing around the world. Of the organizations we surveyed, over one-third of those who experienced a breach in 2016 reported substantial losses to their business. Customers are relying on Cisco's comprehensive portfolio of best-of-breed security products and services, brought together in an integrated architectural approach to prevent and reduce the risk of business loss. As a proof point, deployments of our advanced threat solutions continue to be strong, as we added over 6,000 new customers, bringing the total to approximately 29,000 now using AMP, which led to revenue growth of 65% in the quarter. Similar to our success in the advanced threat market, we added over 5,500 next-generation firewall customers, bringing our total customer base to 67,500. In addition to our leadership in network and advanced security, Cisco is leading the market in delivering innovative cloud-based security solutions. Last week, we announced Cisco Umbrella, the industry's first secure Internet gateway to address new enterprise security challenges in today's mobile and cloud world. Cisco Umbrella is designed to help users gain secure access to the Internet anywhere they go, even when they are off the enterprise network. Now let's turn to collaboration. This quarter, we saw strong customer growth across our collaboration portfolio, with revenue growing 4% and deferred revenue growing 14%. Further expanding our portfolio of subscription-based offerings, we introduced Cisco Spark Board, the first all-in-one cloud-based collaboration and meeting room solution. Cisco Spark Board enables screen sharing, interactive white-boarding and videoconferencing and is complemented by a new version of our Cisco Spark application, a messaging and meeting platform for mobile and desktop endpoints. In the few weeks since launch, we have already had several hundred Cisco Spark Board customers who will be receiving ongoing innovation as part of the Cisco Spark subscription that they purchased together with the device. We are seeing good customer momentum in our data center business, with customers choosing Cisco for the breadth of our private and hybrid cloud solutions. Across our next-generation data center portfolio, we saw healthy customer traction, including our ACI data center switching portfolio grew revenue by 28%. This includes 1,300 new Nexus 9000 customers and 450 new ACI customers in Q2, bringing the total installed base to 10,800 and 3,100 respectively. We are the only company to offer end-to-end visibility and security for 100-gig network build-outs. In our core business, the network has never been more relevant in a world of increasing connectivity driven by cloud, social, IoT and digitization. Over the last year, we have been working hard on driving innovation in our core business and we are starting to see some of the benefits, such as our wireless portfolio this quarter. We believe we are in the early stages of a product innovation cycle driven by security, automation and analytics across the portfolio. To further strengthen our cloud, software and IoT portfolio, as I mentioned earlier, we announced our intent to acquire AppDynamics, a market leader in application intelligence whose solutions are helping the world's largest companies improve their application and business performance. Customers will now have unprecedented insight into their data center, security infrastructure and networking performance through real-time application analytics in the cloud and on premise. Approximately 75% of AppDynamics' product revenue is subscription-based, which aligns well with the way customers increasingly want to consume technology and with Cisco's strategic objective of moving towards more recurring revenue. The growing customer demand for real-time data is enabled by the increasing number of connected devices. We continue to build on the Jasper cloud IoT platform with new solutions. Today Jasper connects more than 40 million devices including over 12 million connected vehicles, and we're adding more than 1.5 million new devices per month. The number of enterprise customers utilizing data from the Jasper platform has grown from 4,000 a year ago to more than 9,000 this quarter. In summary, we are confident in our strategy. We are delivering accelerated innovation across our portfolio and we are pleased with the momentum across our businesses and in our strategic shift towards recurring software and subscription-based revenue. Now let me hand it over to Kelly to walk through our Q2 results and outlook in more detail. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks, Chuck. So I'll start with an overview of our financial results for the quarter, followed by some comments about our capital allocation and the Q3 outlook. Overall, Q2 was a solid quarter with revenue of $11.6 billion, down 2%, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.57, flat year-over-year. We continued to make progress on our strategic growth priorities while maintaining rigorous discipline on profitability and cash generation. As part of our strategy to drive long-term profitable growth, we're prioritizing key investments, both organically and inorganically, such as the intended acquisition of AppDynamics. Today our board approved an increase of $0.03 to the quarterly dividend, bringing it to $0.29 per share, a 12% increase, representing a yield of approximately 3.5% on today's closing price. We remain firmly committed to our capital allocation strategy and returning value to our shareholders. Let me provide some more details on our revenue breakdown. Total product revenue was down 4% and let me walk through each of the product areas. Switching declined 5%, driven by weakness in Campus partially offset by strength in the ACI portfolio, which was up 28%. Routing was down 10%, although we did see growth in orders. Collaboration grew 4% driven by ongoing solid performance of WebEx, unified communications and TelePresence. We saw good momentum again in the transition to subscriptions and SaaS offers with deferred revenue growing 14%. Data center declined 4%, impacted by the continued market shift from blade to rack, though last week we announced expansion of our UCS portfolio by offering the Microsoft Azure stack on UCS via an integrated validated system that enabled organizations to deliver Microsoft Azure services from their on-premise data centers. The joint Cisco and Microsoft solution provides the tools for enterprises to grow and modernize their applications in a highly flexible and scalable hybrid cloud environment. Wireless grew 3%, with ongoing strength in Meraki and the continued ramp of our 11ac Wave 2 portfolio. Security grew 14% with deferred revenue growth of 45%, as we offer more solutions to customers with increasing software content that result in greater recurring revenue. We had very strong performance in our advanced threat security of 65% as well as strength in unified threat management and web security solutions. Our focus continues to be developing a best-of-breed portfolio while offering customers the benefit of deep architectural integration spanning the network cloud at endpoint which we believe is outpacing our competitors. Services continues to execute well, growing 5% with a strong focus on renewals and attach rates. Overall, we drove 13% growth in total deferred revenue with product up 19% and services up 9%. We continued to build our product deferred revenue related to recurring software and subscription businesses to $4 billion, up 51%. We made good progress on increasing our recurring revenue, with 31% of our total Q2 revenue generated from recurring offers, up from 28% a year ago. In terms of orders, total product orders growth was flat with book-to-bill greater than 1. Let's take a look at our geographies, which is a primary way we run the business. We're seeing continued strength in the Americas which grew 4%. EMEA was down 4% and APJC was down 5%. Total emerging markets declined 7% with the BRICs plus Mexico down 5%. In terms of customer segments, enterprise grew 1%, commercial grew 3%, public was down 6%, public sector was down 6% and service provider declined 1%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total gross margin was 64.1%, down slightly by 0.1 points. Our product gross margin was 62.4%, down 0.9 points and service gross margin was 68.8%, growing 2.1 points. Operating margin was solid at 31%. We're maintaining our discipline and driving productivity with an ongoing focus of cost improvements and operational efficiencies, making the necessary trade-offs to drive operating margin. At the bottom line, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.57 and GAAP EPS of $0.47. We delivered operating cash flow of $3.8 billion and ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $71.8 billion with $9.6 billion available in the U.S. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders during the quarter that included $1 billion for share repurchases and $1.3 billion for a quarterly dividend. To summarize, we had solid performance in Q2 and managed the business well. We're making the investments we need to deliver shareholder value over the long term, and we are being very disciplined in driving continuous cost efficiencies. Let me now reiterate our guidance for the third quarter. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. As a reminder, the third quarter of last year included an extra week, which resulted in higher revenue of $265 million and higher non-GAAP cost of sales and operating expenses of $150 million, netting into $115 million of non-GAAP operating income. The guidance for the third quarter is as follows. We expect revenue in the range of minus 2% to 0% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be the range of 29% to 30%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.57 to $0.59. My guidance does not reflect any impact from AppDynamics. I will now turn it back to Chuck for some closing comments. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Kelly. Once again we had a solid quarter and I'm pleased with how we're executing against our strategy. Let me summarize why I'm confident in our ability to bring even greater value to our customers, partners and shareholders. First, we delivered strong innovation in key areas such as security, collaboration, and next-generation data center as we continue to also drive innovation in our core. Second, we have strong momentum in our transition as seen with 51% growth in our product-deferred revenue related to our recurring software and subscriptions as we continue to add more software offers like you see with Cisco Spark Board. Third, profitable growth. We continue to stay focused on driving productivity and operational efficiencies. And lastly, we remain committed to increasing shareholder return as you've seen with our dividend increase of 12%. Our customers have never cared more about what technology can do for their business. They're looking for speed, agility, visibility and security in everything that they do. Cisco is uniquely qualified to meet these demands with our ability to drive automation, analytics with intelligence and security, all the way from the network to the application, and that's why I'm confident in our future. Marilyn, now I'll turn it back to you for questions. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Chuck. Sam, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. And I just wanted to remind folks while Sam is doing that, I'd like to remind the audience that we ask you to ask one question. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu with Bernstein. Your line is now open. Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi everybody. Thank you for taking my question. I was trying to understand where we stand in the weakness you saw when you talked about three months ago. If I look at your guide, so it's fairly encouraging. It shows that we're getting back to a sequential growth that is better than slightly above what you've done on average in recent years. And then if I hear your current, so Campus was very weak in the quarter, routing as well. And you see all this coming back in routing, and my question would be whether you see something similar in Campus. Can we expect that part of the business to improve in coming months and coming quarters? And then maybe just more broadly, what's you're feeling about the macro today? The uncertainty and the weakness in orders you could see three months ago, is this something that is improving now already or not. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Pierre. Let me just start and then Kelly, you can add whatever you like here. I think as it relates to our core portfolio, we have seen obviously some macro dynamics. Europe is clearly stressed with all the geopolitical dynamics that are occurring in Europe right now across several countries. And we also have begun to invest pretty significantly over the last year, and you will see it over the coming year, in ensuring we had the appropriate investments in innovation in our core. But you also see what we did with AppDynamics. And what I would tell you is, that when you combine the analytics that we can deliver out of the data center with the analytics that we'll deliver out of the core networking space with our security threat information and analytics out of our security portfolio, combined with the application analytics that they have, we believe that we can create a differentiated architecture for our customers going forward. And that's the purpose in the acquisition and what we intend to do going forward. So, Kelly, any other comments on the macro and the sequentials? Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: No, I think just to add to that, I think we do feel good about what we're seeing from macro in the U.S. certainly, and in commercial and enterprise. And I'd say to your point, Pierre, when you do adjust for that extra week last year, our guide, we always call it like we see it. And it does show a bit of improvement there on both the top line and bottom line. So I think \u2013 like Chuck said, I think the U.S. is solid, and again we're still cautious on outside the U.S. and Europe and Asia. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Kelly. Sam, we'll go ahead and take our next question. Operator : Certainly. Our next question is from Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is now open. Justin Wainwright - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. This is Justin on for Jim Suva. Thanks, Chuck and Kelly, for taking the question. I was just wondering if you could comment a little bit on your partnership with Ericsson. I know recently you've had a couple different rollouts and then some good press releases in terms of what you're doing. I was just wondering if you could maybe provide any sort of updates or any sort of milestones now that it's been about a year since you've had the partnership going? Thanks Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yeah, I think it was Justin, right? Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yep. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: That correct? Justin, thanks for the question. It's pretty timely, in fact. Obviously there's been a lot of uncertainty on the Ericsson side and we believe that all the original business drivers that led us to establish the partnership with Ericsson are still very valid. I think we have had some 300 customer engagements together. And their new CEO came onboard just about five weeks ago, I believe, and we have been in a great deal of discussion since then on ways in which we could accelerate the partnership. He is committed to continuing and trying to make this as successful as we possibly can. We're going to meet again in Barcelona at Mobile World Congress and I'd say we're focused right now on, how do we accelerate from here. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Justin. Sam, we'll go ahead and take the next question please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Silverstein with Cowen & Company. The line is open. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: If I could ask for a quick clarification and then a question. Kelly, I think last quarter you quantified the impact of the shift in the business model as over 2 percentage points in terms of the hit to growth as you increase your future visibility on the shift. Can you update? I don't think I heard you give an update this quarter. Then the question.... Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: No, yeah, I think what I say is between 1% and 2%, right. So we're in that 1.5% to 2% range. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And would that be your expectation on an ongoing basis? Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Well again, as we continue to accelerate the growth, as we're continuing to grow it like we have been growing it, I referred it may get even more until it evens out, but in the last few quarters it has been in that range. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Paul. Sam , we'll take the next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I kind of want to circle back in the security piece. You guys had given out advanced threat numbers in the past and the breakdown there. So how does the margin structure change as you guys grow the advanced threat and the web security piece versus the legacy security portfolio you've had? Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yeah, we don't share gross margins by business unit, but I can tell you, the margins are growing in our security portfolio overall between the mix of the growth in these areas and the acquisitions and the SaaS businesses we've been adding. So it's very accretive to the Cisco average. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, got it. And then just one quick small follow up. Just on the repatriation potential, are you guys leaning more towards essentially M&A or buybacks or a dividend? Because you guys have raised it by 12% now, so I was just wondering how you guys think about that. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: I think, Mitch, first priority will be strategic investments that we'll make and then obviously followed with a focus on continued capital allocation and our commitment to returning capital to shareholders. So it would be a combination. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Chuck. Sam, let's go ahead and tee up for the next question. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Kvaal with Nomura. Your line is open. Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities : Yes. Thank you very much for taking the question. One of the big themes with some of the other folks across the comm landscape of course, is web-scale. That wasn't a major theme of the opening script. I'm hoping that you could help us understand your positioning in web-scale, certainly in switching where the competition is heightened and also in routing and even DCI. Thank you. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yeah thanks, Jeff. So as we look at MSDC, what we've given you guys over the last few quarters is sort of a very fixed list of 10 customers that we have given. And I've said over and over that we have been spending a lot of time with these customers, really focused on understanding what their unique needs are. Frankly, some of them are so big, they're a market of one and to themselves. And I'm very pleased with the progress we're making. If you look at those 10, just to give you the numbers this time, overall those 10 would be down. But if you normalize out one of those providers and you take the combination of the other nine \u2013 and that one has some pretty tough year-over-year comps \u2013 the other nine were up double digits. And we have one of the largest that was up triple digits for the second quarter in a row. So I feel like we're making good progress, but we still have a long way to go. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Jeff. We'll go ahead and take the next question, Sam. Operator : Our next question is from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Chuck, appreciate the opportunity. I guess I'm going to sound like a broken record and ask the same question I ask every four or five quarters now, which is your data center revenue. Your server business, which is again, continued to stay in range, not showing much progress. How do you feel about the progress that you're making over there with hyperconverge? It just doesn't seem to be moving the dial yet. How do you resolve the issues in this business going forward? Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yeah thanks, Ittai. We can always count on you for that question. So first of all, I think in our next-gen data center switching portfolio, you can see continued performance and continued good adoption of those solutions from our customer base. I think on the hyperconverged, we certainly would like to see it moving more quickly. We have recently had a release of software that has helped with some of the capabilities, and I think that there are a couple more coming that should continue to give us more capabilities in that space. And I think that we're also looking, as you would expect, at our broad strategy in the data center and where we need to go to ensure that we best position ourselves going forward. So that work is going on as well right now, Ittai. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Chuck. Sam, let's go ahead and tee up the next question. Operator : Yes, next question is from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank Securities. Your line is open. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Yeah hi, Chuck, Kelly. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Hi, Vijay. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, hi. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Hey, Vijay. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, hi. I'd like to get your bigger picture thoughts, Chuck and Kelly, on how you plan to broaden your senior management team. Any new areas or skill sets you'll be looking for in the management team to drive top line growth through the rest of this year and over the next few years? And is the strategy focused primarily on doubling down on security, analytics, AI, automation? Or are there any new areas? Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Hey, Vijay, don't mean to interrupt. Can you speak up just a little bit? Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: We're having trouble hearing you. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Can you guys hear me now? Can you guys hear me now? Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Not really. Try a little louder. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Is this better? Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Better. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: That's better. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Yeah, I mean, Chuck, my question was more around on the senior management team. Any new skill sets, any new areas or avenues you'll be looking for to round out the management team to drive top line growth? Or will you primarily be doubling down on security, analytics, AI? Thank you. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: No, you know what, it's a great question. I think that when you look at the improvement we've been making around our transition to software and subscription business, you can assume that we'll continue to look for people who have those kinds of capabilities. And if you look at even the AppDynamics acquisition, David Wadhwadi, who is their CEO, was one of the key drivers behind the software transition that occurred at Adobe. So he very much understands how this transition will occur. You can assume that we're adding talent in the areas of artificial intelligence, machine learning, analytics, software skills around simplicity and automation. As you know, if you look at our core, one of the biggest things our customers are looking for is to take out the cost of operating this infrastructure. And so as we build out automation capabilities that allow them to very dynamically change their environments as opposed to the manual way it's been done in the past, those skill sets as well. So it's a combination of all of those in addition to security and all the other areas you mentioned, so it's broad based. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Vijay. We'll go ahead and take the next question. Operator : Thank you, next question is from Steve Milunovich with UBS Securities. Please go ahead with your question. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Kelly, you mentioned the percentage of recurring revenue is 31%. If you exclude services, are we still around 9% to 10% of product revenue being recurring? Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : And is there any way to turn that core routing switching business into something more recurring? I mean, we've never seen a hardware company do that, if you will, but through ELAs or something else, is there any way to turn that into a little more of a subscription consistent basis? Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yeah, that's a great question, Steve. Yeah. So actually product as a percentage of my total product revenue, it's up to 10% now this quarter for the first time, so we're happy about that. And we are trying to make that shift in the core part of the business. Cisco ONE is an example of where we are taking our ELAs and our big cross enterprise ELAs that really are a core networking business to do that. So we're trying to find ways to find other offers. I'll just point to another example though like the Spark Board that Chuck mentioned. It's a great new innovation and extension of TelePresence, but it's a great example of where we're selling that. We used to sell it always as a system. Now we're selling the equipment, but we're selling it with a subscription. So that's an example of how we've been able to kind of to drive new offers that had been traditionally just pure system or hardware. And again, the teams are driving hard to find more ways to accelerate new offers that way. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yeah, Steve, just I want to just make a couple of comments on this. One, if you look six quarters ago when I came into the job, our overall revenue, our recurring revenue was 26% in the first four quarters. We spent time taking our teams and helping our teams understand the transition that we were going to make. So in the first four quarters, we gained 2 points. We took it up to 28%, and in the last two quarters we've added 3% so we've accelerated it. So it's going to 31 in the last two quarters. And on the product side, that went from 6% to 7% in the first year and then in the last two quarters, it's gone from 7% to 10%. So I think we're finding ways to move that forward. As it relates to the core, I think you'll see us come out with services around automation and analytics and other things that will be sold as subscriptions on top of the platforms. And the last thing I'll tell you is that we pulled one of the key leaders from the security portfolio, who had really driven the whole product management portion of that transition to the heavy content of software and subscription that you see today, and he is now leading that force in our core networking space in the enterprise networking. So it's clearly a focus that he's trying to drive for us. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: We'll take the next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Please go ahead. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. Just following up on the cash repatriation M&A question, Chuck. I just want to get a sense going forward, should we think about a continuation of more the string of pearls approach to more to AppDynamics, or you make more sizable acquisitions? And then, Kelly, I wanted to get a sense if you could help us understand how we should think about deferred revenue? Clearly growing nicely. What is the feedback loop a year or a year and a half out from now in terms of does the gross margin start to trend higher because of the deferred revenue mix has become a recurring configuration? Thank you. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Hey, Mark. First off, I'll take the repatriation and the M&A question and, Kelly, you can take the next one. So and you're free to make comments on mine as well, so. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thank you. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: I think our M&A strategy is going to remain intact. Repatriation doesn't fundamentally change how we think about what we're going to do going forward. You can assume that we'll continue to look for opportunities that drive the business value and the relevance to our customers like we did with AppD. I mean, they have a tremendous platform that really translates application analytics to real business performance information for our customers. And just to comment on AppDynamics, they have a very robust enterprise solution that is delivered either from the cloud or on premise and can be delivered to the customer on premise or in the cloud. So it's very flexible. And they basically have 275 of the Fortune 2000 and they really have never had a substantial partner model. So those are the reasons we think that makes a lot of sense. So strategic alignment and the ability for us to take it through our ecosystem are always positive. So, Kelly, comments on the deferred and the margins. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yeah, on the deferred, Mark, I mean that is part of why we're trying to make this shift to software. It's our customers want those offers and to have easier way to run their IT departments. But it clearly enables us to get higher margins, for sure. And it's not only just the gross margin coming out of deferred revenue, but we're looking at our whole end-to-end operations, and how we go to market, how we drive operations in the back end here. And there's real opportunities to drive both gross margins and operating margins. So that's why we're so focused on it. That's why we're looking at acquisitions to add to it, and it will continue to help improve our mix on the margins line. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Chuck and Kelly. Sam, let's go ahead and take the next question. Operator : Yes, our next question is from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. I just wanted to ask about product gross margins. They were a bit weaker than we had at least modeled, and I think in the 8-K there is some indication there was some pricing, but would like some more color there. I guess particularly, one thing that we noticed that the A-Pac margins were \u2013 looked particularly weak. Is this related to customer geography? Just a little help on understanding kind of where the pressures are on product gross margins. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yeah, sure. I'll take that one, and a great question. Gross margins, we've been \u2013 again continue to operate well. I'll say there were two specific kind of headwinds that we faced this quarter. And to your point on APJC, I'll refer back to a year ago, we were benefiting from a national program in China where they were rolling out set-top boxes to tier 2 and tier 3 cities. Not our set-top boxes, but we were providing the smartcards to go with that, which they're basically for secure access and it was very, very high margin. So we had, if you go back a year ago, SP video in Asia was extremely strong because of that. That program has dramatically slowed down. And again, that pure margin just isn't there anymore, and you're seeing that flow through both the margins and the year-over-year revenues for both SP video and APJC. The other item that's a headwind for us this quarter is we are facing a significant cost increase to our memory costs, our DRAM memory costs that we're paying. It's a very tight supply right now and we're seeing dramatic increases there. So that's hurting us quite a bit as well. But other than that, I'd say the color's in the same line. Our pricing is in \u2013 it's in the ranges that we've been the last six to eight quarters. I'd say a little on the higher end, but in line with where we were Q3, Q4. A little worse in (37:06) last quarter, but we were very low last quarter. So in the normal ranges. But really it's those two specific things. And I will say that I do anticipate those two headwinds to remain there next quarter as well as we had very strong SP video, that China program, in Q3 as well. Okay? Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: All right. Let's go ahead and take the next question, Sam. Operator : Yes. Our next question is from Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a nice quarter. First, just had a clarification. There are a number of articles regarding a faulty clocking component over the last few weeks. Just wanted to see if you could comment to what degree that is or isn't impacting customer activity. And then the question, I was hoping you might be able to update us in a little greater detail regarding the trends you are seeing in the service provider vertical. You mentioned some encouraging order development. So was hoping you can help us understand what you're seeing across geographies, what you're seeing from a product perspective, and to what degree that improvement is coming from routing, optical, security or some other part of the service provider business. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Sure. I'll start on the supplier component issue. So yeah, those articles are out there. We have had an issue from a supplier come out, and we did book a reserve for $125 million, you can see in our GAAP results and in the press release, to cover that. We always, and continue to stand by our customers through any situations like this. This is very proactive. This is a failure rate that will happen over time, but we're working with our customers to work through that. So we're not anticipating any impact from that from a top line perspective. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yeah, I'll take the SP question, Kelly. So, Jess, on the service provider space, it's really similar to last time. We talked about SP CapEx. Different service providers are looking at different areas of investment depending on what's going on in their network. So you have some who are looking at macro radio densification as an example and others are looking at building out capacity in the core. And it's a segment that is very dominated by large customers. So from a quarter-to-quarter basis, any number of customers that make any sort of shift in their buying behavior can have an impact either positively or negatively. So it's a space that I would just encourage you to look at longer term. But we did see, you know, we saw definite improvement. We saw, I would say from a regional perspective, what I would tell you is the Americas was very strong and we saw general weakness in Europe and in the China space you had a lot of this SP video implication that Kelly was talking about earlier. So overall, I think the teams did a great job. I think the teams are working incredibly well on sort of the next generation of capabilities in the platforms and in some of the software and automation, and some of the same themes that we've been talking about in the enterprise core networks, and I feel good about where they are right now. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Jess. We'll go ahead and take the next question, Sam. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you for taking my question here. I wanted a little bit of hand holding and help with interpreting this deferred revenue growth. So 51%, obviously a very big number. Looking at the balance sheet, it looks like it rose year-over-year by about $1.9 billion and you talked about the total of, I guess, software and recurring revenue at $4 billion. Could you help us get a better understanding of what are the components? And I'm presuming there's some elements that maybe are growing much slower, some growing faster. So help us understand what are the big drivers for that 51% growth. Thank you. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Sure, so yeah. So that 51% growth is year-over-year growth of over $1.3 billion and everything's growing in that space. I'd say from a pure size, collaboration and security and Meraki are the biggest pieces of that, because they have just continued to grow their businesses significantly. And they're all growing huge double digits. But I will also say my switching, my routing, as well as data center and we've done Cisco ONE bundles as well as big enterprise license agreements. They've also been growing huge double digits as well. So at the end of the day, the year-over-year increase is across the board. Everything is up massively to drive to that 51%. And again, just the biggest chunk of it between collaboration, security and wireless, they are two-thirds I'd say of the balance, but the other pieces are rapidly - Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Wireless being Meraki. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yeah, wireless being Meraki, yes. Hopefully that gives you the color you're looking for. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Kelly. Sam, let's go ahead and take that next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird. Your line is open. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. And, Kelly, just to clarify, there's no expectation of revenue or earnings impact from this clock issue in the current quarter? Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Not as of right now. Again, we're working very proactively with our customers and in terms of how quickly and where they want to do their replacement. So we're working very, very closely, but as of right now we have not seen and don't anticipate any massive revenue impact from this. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: All right. Well, thank you. And that was our last question for today. I'm going to turn it over to Chuck for some closing remarks. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yeah, just a couple of comments, and first of all, I want to just thank you all again for joining us today. We did deliver strong innovation I believe which was reflective in the performance that we've had in security, collaboration, next-gen data center, and we continue to drive innovation in our core enterprise and SP portfolio. The deferred revenue from our subscription and software businesses is indicative I think of the transition that you should continue to expect from us. We will continue to focus on driving profitable growth with productivity and operational efficiencies, and you also can count on the fact that we remain very committed to our shareholder return as was indicated in both our buybacks and our dividend and then the increase in the dividend this quarter. So I just want to thank all of you for being with us today. And then, Marilyn, I'll let you take it from here. Thank you. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thank you, Chuck. So Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal year 2017 third quarter results, will be on Wednesday, May 17, 2017, at 1 :30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that, I will now turn it over to Chuck. Charles Robbins : Thank you, Marilyn and good afternoon, everyone. Our results this quarter demonstrated that we're delivering against our strategic priorities and realizing the benefits of our investments to transform our business and drive long term shareholder value.  We delivered a solid quarter, with total revenue of $11.9 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.60. We had strong margins yet again and great operating cash flow, up 10%. We're managing the business well through a multiyear transformation of the company while remaining focused on delivering customers unparalleled value through highly secure, software-defined automated and intelligent infrastructure. We're on a journey which as we consistently stated, will take a number of years, but we're pleased with the progress we're making. As our customers add billions of new connections in the years ahead, the network will become more critical than ever. They will be looking for intelligent networks that deliver automation, security and analytics that help them derive meaningful business value from these connections. These will be delivered through a combination of new platforms as well as software and subscription-based services which we've been focused on accelerating over the last 18 months. My vision for this company is to be the most relevant and most important partner for our customers as they enable their digital businesses and we will deliver on that vision. I look forward to discussing this in a lot more detail at our Investor Day on June 28.  We continue to innovate across our networking portfolio with analytics being a key element of this innovation. This quarter, we completed the acquisition of AppDynamics, enabling us to provide customers with unprecedented visibility across networking, data center, security and applications. As I talk to our customers and partners, I'm getting great feedback about the value of the insights AppDynamics provides to help them make informed business decisions. We're in the early stages of scaling out the AppDynamics solutions through the Cisco Salesforce and partner ecosystem and I'm excited about the future of this space.  We were also pleased to announce our intent to acquire some new additions to our software and analytics portfolio. Software-defined WAN is a critical market transition and addresses the evolving customer demands and branch routing as a foundational block of executing in cloud networking. Viptela, combined with Cisco's IWAN technology, will provide an industry-leading cloud-first SD WAN platform that addresses the Edge networking needs of our most demanding customers. MindMeld provides an AI platform to build intelligent and humanlike conversational interfaces for any application or device and will complement our already strong collaboration portfolio. These acquisitions support our goal of offering customers extraordinary value through a combination of organic and inorganic innovation and they are aligned to our strategy of investing to drive longer term growth and helping us transition to more recurring software and subscription revenue. We will continue to deploy our capital resources to give us first-mover advantage as we extend our technology portfolio. In addition to our inorganic growth, we're seeing strong organic growth of our next-generation products and solutions in both networking and security.  Now let me share some business highlights, starting with our security business which has never been more relevant, as we've seen in recent days. Last week's WannaCry ransomware attack was another example of the devastating impact cybercrime can inflict on individuals, companies and countries around the world. Since Friday's attack, our Talos cyber threat intelligence team has been working around-the-clock to dissect the WannaCry ransomware, understand its attack patterns and keep our customers protected. It's important that the tech industry and customers work together to defend against these attacks from cyber criminals. We will continue to do everything we can to help our customers anticipate, prevent and protect themselves from any future attack by harnessing the intelligence of the network and the power of our security portfolio. Our security business delivered another solid quarter with 9% revenue growth and 39% deferred revenue growth, reflecting our combination of best-of-breed solutions, together with the industry's broadest security portfolio and a highly effective end-to-end security architecture. We continue to lead in network security. Our next-generation firewall portfolio grew 49% with 6,000 new customers in the quarter, bringing our total customer base to over 73,000.  We expanded our portfolio with the announcement of our Firepower 2100 Series which offers both performance and protection for mission-critical applications.  Our Advanced threat portfolio continues to deliver strong revenue growth of over 30% and we added 6,600 new customers, bringing the total number of AMP customers to over 35,000. Now let's turn to collaboration. In January, we introduced Cisco's Spark Board, the first all-in-one cloud-based collaboration and meeting room solution. We've seen good early traction with this SaaS-based service, with nearly 700 customers adopting this solution in the quarter. This is a great example of the transition I mentioned earlier focused on moving from standalone systems to best-of-breed products, combined with software subscriptions.  Our intended acquisition of MindMeld will help us simplify and enhance the collaboration experience even further through the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning. As chat and voice quickly become the interfaces of choice, MindMeld's AI technology will enable Cisco to deliver unique experiences throughout its portfolio. This acquisition will power new conversational interfaces for Cisco's collaboration products, revolutionizing how users will interact with our technology while increasing ease-of-use and enabling new capabilities. For example, users will be able to interact with Cisco Spark via Natural Language Commands, providing an experience that is highly customized to the user and their work.  In our data center switching business, we now have a combined install base of over 20,000 customers, who are using our portfolio to help them build, run and manage their private and hybrid cloud environments.  Our ACI portfolio grew 42%, as customers moved to 100-gig and look to automate the network and increase network performance, visibility and security. We added almost 1,200 new Nexus 9K customers in the quarter, bringing the total installed base to 12,000. Our APIC adoption continues to increase rapidly with over 380 new ACI customers in Q3, bringing our total to nearly 3,500.  Before I turn it over to Kelly, let me reiterate a few key points. I'm pleased with the progress we're making. As I've consistently stated, this transition will take time, but we're remaking this company to succeed in a dramatically changing marketplace. We're laser-focused on delivering innovation as well as aggressively managing the business to optimize profitability, cash flows and value for our shareholders. Kelly? Kelly Kramer : Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter followed by the Q4 outlook. Q3 was a solid quarter with financial results consistent with our expectations. We executed well, driving solid profitability, strong cash flow and we continued to deliver on our strategic growth priorities. Total revenue was $11.9 billion, down 1%. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.60, up 5% and operating cash flow grew 10% to $3.4 billion. We generated 31% of our total revenue from recurring offers, up from 29% a year ago. We continue to be extremely focused on driving margins and profitability, increasing our non-GAAP operating margin to 32.3%, up 2.3 points.  Before I go through Q3 in more detail, I want to remind you that Q3 last year included an extra week, it resulted in higher revenue in that quarter of $265 million, $200 million of which was in Services and $65 million from our SaaS businesses like WebEx and some from product distributions. We also had higher non-GAAP cost of sales and operating expenses of $150 million. This netted to $115 million of higher non-GAAP operating income last year. So onto this quarter. Total product revenue was flat year-over-year. I'll walk through each of the product areas. Switching grew 2%, with solid growth in data center switching, driven by ongoing strength in the ACI portfolio which was up 42%. We also saw a slight positive growth in our campus business.  Routing was down 2%, driven primarily by weakness in mobile packet core. Collaboration was down 4%, but adjusting for the extra week last year, it was down 2%. The drivers are primarily a decline in Unified Communications' endpoints, partially offset by continued growth in WebEx. Deferred revenue grew 10%. Data center declined 5% with the continued market shift from blade to rack. However, we're seeing solid traction with our hyperconverged offering, HyperFlex. This quarter, we also further extended our innovations in UCS with new converged solutions for IBM versus stack and with our strategic alliance with Docker to deliver containerized applications. Wireless grew 13% with strong Meraki performance as well as the ramp of our 11 AC Wave 2 portfolio. We continue to innovate with the launch in the quarter of new wireless networking solutions, including a new Wave 2 access point and a wireless controller. Security was up 9% with strong performance in unified threat management, with growth of approximately 50% as well as growth of over 30% in both advanced threat and web security. Deferred revenue grew 39%, demonstrating the value of our solutions and ongoing delivery of innovation.Services was down 2%. Normalized for the extra week, it grew 4%. We're continuing to focus on renewals and attach rates.  We drove good growth in deferred revenue which was 13% in total, with product up 26% and services up 7%. Deferred products revenue from our recurring software and subscription businesses was up 57% to $4.4 billion which includes the acquisition of AppDynamics during the Quarter. Excluding AppDynamics, the increase was 51%. In terms of orders, total product orders declined 4%.  Looking at our geographies which is a primary way we run the business, Americas was down 4%, EMEA was down 6% and APJC grew 2%. Total emerging markets declined 12%, with the BRICS plus Mexico down 10%. In our customer segments, Enterprise declined 2%, Commercial grew 1%, Public Sector was down 4% and Service Provider declined 10%.  From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total gross margin was 64.4%, down by 0.8 points. In Q3 '16, the extra week resulted in a 0.5 point benefit in that quarter. So adjusting for that, total gross margin decreased 0.3 points.In Q3 '17, our Product gross margin was 63.2%, down 1.3 points and Service gross margin was 67.8%, growing 0.7 points. We increased our operating margin by 2.3 points to 32.3% from a year ago. In terms of the bottom line, we grew non-GAAP EPS 5% to $0.60, while GAAP EPS was $0.50. We ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $68.0 billion, with $2.9 billion available in the U.S. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned approximately $2 billion to our shareholders during the quarter that included $0.5 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend, reflecting the 12% increase we announced last quarter. To summarize, Q3 was a solid quarter and we executed well. We're focused on driving operational efficiencies and profitability, enabling us to make the strategic investments to drive long term shareholder value. Let me reiterate our guidance for the fourth quarter. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue in the range of minus 4% to minus 6% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29.5% to 30.5% and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.60 to $0.62.  I'll now turn it back to Chuck for some closing comments. Charles Robbins : Thanks, Kelly and thanks again to all of you for joining us today. As I mentioned earlier, we delivered another solid quarter and we're executing well. We're confident in our strategy for long term growth and profitability. We believe that the network will become increasingly important in solving our customers' most complex business problems and helping them get secure and stay secure.  We also believe that we will continue to see strong momentum in our shift towards more software and subscription revenue. This reflects the success of the investments we're making in this area -- in these areas, together with the flexible consumption and buying models we're offering our customers.  Marilyn and I'll turn it back to you for questions. Marilyn Mora : Great. Thanks, Chuck. Shaun, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Operator : Q - Mark Moskowitz : I wanted to see if we could understand more of the guidance, Kelly and Chuck. The revenues are little lighter than we had anticipated. Is that a function of macro factors? Or is that a function more of the shift to the subscription model or maybe there's going to be some disturbance here and there. Clearly, the deferred revenue -- product revenue growth is quite nice, but I was just wondering if there's any sort of puts and takes you could walk us through there. I really appreciate it. A - Charles Robbins : Kelly, why don't you take him through the bridge and then I'll just make some comments? A - Kelly Kramer : Sure. So Mark, when we look at guidance, it's a combination of many factors, right? It starts with our backlog and then orders on them, the funnel. And then yes, definitely, we take into account our transition to more software and subscriptions and how that's impacting it. So when I look at the guidance we just gave, our orders were a little weaker in Q3 which does mean that I'm starting with the lower backlog than anticipated. And then when I'm assuming, when I look at the order strength, we're assuming what we saw in Q3 continues on in Q4. So just to give some color around that. Where we had -- we have been facing headwinds all quarter long with SP and emerging. We saw them get worse this quarter that you saw in the numbers there. I'm expecting that to continue. And then we saw some new kind of macro issues in the areas like Public Sector and the U.S. Fed space and things like that. So I'm assuming that orders in line that we saw in Q3 is going to continue on in Q4. And then finally, we're seeing an impact because you're seeing it go to the balance sheet of this transition that we're just accelerating through to the tune of 1.5 to 2 points. So the combination of those 3 things are driving the guidance into that minus-4 to minus-6 range. A - Charles Robbins : Yes, just -- Mark, a couple of comments on what Kelly just described. I mean, the Public Sector business, particularly in the United States, the federal business is, frankly, it's about 1 point of that guide. It's a pretty significant stall right now with the lack of budget visibility. And when you think about the strategy that we're deploying, the 57% growth in the software and subscription business, if you just go back 8 quarters ago, we had $2 billion on our balance sheet relative to software and subscription. And the first 2 or 3 quarters, we were convincing the teams that, that was the shift we were going to make. And now we have more than doubled that to $4.4 billion and the growth there is accelerating. So we're very pleased with that transition. And at the same time we deal with all of these challenges, we're also, -- we remain very committed to earnings. We remain very committed to our capital return strategy. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Q - Ittai Kidron : Chuck, I'm going to take a U-turn this time, actually not ask you about the data center business but rather focus a little bit more on the gross margins. Some of the commentary in your press release talked about some pricing pressures. If you could give us a little bit more color on the guidance and your gross margin assumption into the guidance, how much of that is mix-related and how much of that is pricing? And if -- any color you could give on the pricing, how much is competitive versus, I don't know, product shifts or something like that, that'll be great. A - Charles Robbins : Thanks, Ittai. So Kelly, let's have the same strategy. You want to go through the math on this and then... A - Kelly Kramer : So Ittai, when we look at the drivers of our growth margin, price in Q3 actually has been in the same range that it was pretty much last year as well as last quarter in terms of the price index that we're seeing. So that's in the same range. Again, it's high, but it's in the range. It's not increasing. I would say in terms of the guidance for Q4, we're assuming that. We're also making sure the teams are being very aggressive where they need to be aggressive in areas and then against competitors where we need to be. But overall, the pricing hasn't changed dramatically besides the normal erosion that we see in churned business lines. I'd say, in terms of mix, that hasn't dramatically changed as well, with switching being positive this quarter, that helped a lot. And again, well, the mix isn't changing. There's mix changes with MBEs in the guidance going forward but it's nothing dramatic. So I'd say we feel good about being able to continue driving the margins that we have. The only other piece I'll comment on, because we mentioned it before, we're still seeing some cost pressure from the increase in DRAM pricing that was got baked in both our Q3 as well as into Q4. But we've been doing a lot of work and our supply chain team has done working with our suppliers to make sure we can secure our forward supply at prices that we can plan on. So I think we've pretty much got that boxed in for the guidance. Operator : Next question is coming from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Q - James Faucette : Just a couple of quick follow-up questions to some of the comments that have already been made. Can you talk a little bit about the orders and you mentioned that fed was weak. But when you look at the other areas of weakness, can you talk about, like, what's driving those, et cetera? And I guess, more long term, it continues to be a good deferred revenue growth and you mentioned the security. What are the priorities that your customers are showing in the security space generally? And what are you able to address now versus where are the things that they're asking for that you think you need to improve on? A - Charles Robbins : Great. Thanks, James. And so we have some order color and then securities. So let me take the order stuff and then, Kelly, chime in as you'd like. So if we just go around -- sort of go around the globe, let me just highlight what we saw. And I'm just going to tell you what drove the weakness in these areas so you can assume the other pieces of the business were pretty much as expected. In the Americas, it was primarily the U.S. federal -- I mean, there's so much uncertainty around budgets. The U.S. federal business was a significant driver. Mexico, there has been a lot of uncertainty in Mexico and that was actually down 49% for us year-over-year. So it was -- there's a great deal of uncertainty around the investment landscape there. And then the third element would have been the Service Provider business in the Americas. So those were the things that really drove the orders in the U.S. In Europe, the U.K., the currency issue in the U.K. is real and was very impactful in that business. And then we continue to see pressure in the Middle East relative to oil prices. We also -- obviously, there's been a lot of uncertainty around the geopolitical dynamics, some of which have been clarified recently, obviously. And we did see some strength in some countries there, but the U.K. is a big country for us. And the Middle East, obviously, with the uncertainty around oil prices, continues to be a little bit of a pressure as well. In APJC, we saw Japan and Australia were reasonable. India was solid again. And China, we had tough comps from the SP Video business from a year ago that we talked about. So that's really what we saw from an orders perspective. I think if you look at customer segments, just to give you some color, Enterprise, the challenge was largely driven by Europe. Commercial, the lightness there was driven by Europe. Public Sector, as I said, was U.S. Federal and SP was fairly consistent. So Kelly, any other comments on that? A - Kelly Kramer : Yes. A - Charles Robbins : Just quickly on the securities, since you snuck that one in, too, James. The -- what our customers -- what we see happening in security right now is that as our customers prepare for the next few years and literally adding billions of new connections, we obviously believe that the network is going to become even more relevant than it ever has been. And our customers are going to need -- to deal with that scale, they're going to need significant automation. They're going to need greater insights coming out of their technology infrastructure like the network through analytics. They're going to need security embedded at the network layer because you're going to have to begin to secure the infrastructure the minute these packets hit the wire. So what they're looking for is -- they are looking for an end-to-end architecture now for dealing with security. They're looking for an open architecture that actually allows them to buy the best-of-breed technology which we have across many elements of what they're trying to do. But they are looking for an architecture and they're looking for -- to leverage as much of that from the cloud and which correspondingly turns into the subscription business, as you pointed out. So that's what we see happening there. There's obviously lots of other areas within that architecture that we don't play today where we could and we continue to assess all of those opportunities. Operator : The next question is coming from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. The next question on queue, coming from Simon Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Q - Simona Jankowski : It's Simona Jankowski. Just a couple of follow-ups. First, if you can clarify in terms of the weakness you saw incrementally in the Service Provider and emerging market theaters. How much of that was related to competition or pricing pressure such as from Huawei versus some of the macro factors you discussed? And then just a quick follow-up on how did your cloud business do this quarter. A - Charles Robbins : So let me comment on the first one and then, Kelly, maybe you can talk about the cloud business and how we -- I'll talk about both of them but then how we measure that specifically. So the weakness in emerging and SP, I would say, in emerging, I would say it's less. We clearly -- we've been -- we've had competition from several vendors. And clearly, Huawei is a very strong competitor. I don't feel like it has increased significantly in the emerging countries. It's been pretty consistent there and our teams know how to compete and we continue to evolve our strategy and bring different tools to help them compete. So I don't -- I wouldn't say that had much to do with it. I think on our overarching cloud business, Simona, we look at that in many, many different ways. So we look at, obviously, our private cloud business which is made up of the UCS business as well as our data center switching portfolio which we talked about earlier. Both of those, the UCS business was down 5, as you saw. And then the -- obviously, our next-generation switching portfolio continues to do well, the ACI elements up 42%. And if you're asking about the MSDC guys which are the web scale cloud guys, it's the same as we were last quarter. These -- we have -- we're engaging with them on an individual basis. We look at the big ones as, frankly, markets of one. We have made great progress with a few of them. Others we're in the early stages and we have codevelopment opportunities. But I would tell you, we're in very deep discussions with most all of them and we're looking at very strategic partnerships that scale beyond even just selling infrastructure to them in many cases. So I'm not sure where you're going with cloud. Hopefully one of those answers cover what you're looking for. Operator : Next question on queue is coming from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo. You may now begin. Your next on queue is coming from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse Securities. Your line is open, you may now begin. Q - Kulbinder Garcha : For Chuck maybe. On the revenue side, I take your points on the macro economy and the weakness in emerging markets. A - Charles Robbins : Kulbinder, could you just speak up just a hair, buddy? Q - Kulbinder Garcha : My question is on revenue growth, I think the drivers of the weak guidance you're talking about. I guess, the broader question is how important is getting this company back to growth? It looks like last year, you did grow. This year, you're probably not going to grow very much, i.e. especially organically. So is there something more transformative have to happen on the M&A front? Do you think this is temporary in nature? I know you're having this headwind of this business transformation, but just the importance of revenue growth to Cisco as a company, if you could comment on that for the long term. A - Charles Robbins : Yes, Kulbinder, I think that -- when we look to the future right now and you really think about the number of new connections that are going to be added, that our customers will be adding over the coming years and the need for automation, the need for analytics and security, what we have done and it'll be done -- our solutions that we'll bringing in the space with a combination, to your point, of inorganic capabilities, as we have shown our ability to do, as well as some organic innovation. I've talked to several of you over the last few quarters about the fact that we went in and reallocated a fair amount of our R&D expense last year and over last 18 months.  And many of those solutions are targeting these next-generation networks that our customers are going to need to build out to support this new infrastructure. And with a high degree of automation across the network, with a high degree of analytics, with distributed compute capabilities for processing the data at the Edge as well as the security piece. So we have future innovation that will come in that space. We'll also use a combination of inorganic options where we need it. And we believe that as we get into the next generation of the networks that the customers need to build out, that we will be very successful with our capabilities. Operator : The next question is from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo, you may now begin. Q - Jess Lubert : I was hoping you could provide a little more detail regarding the order weakness you're flagging in the North American service provider vertical. Last quarter, if I remember correctly, you suggested orders there were improving a little bit. So I just want to understand the change. To what degree it's a technology issue versus a macro issue, the duration, you think, that's likely to be weak for and if there's if any areas within the vertical that are better or worse, that would be helpful. A - Charles Robbins : Let me just give you a couple of comments and then Kelly can give us any specifics. As I said 2 quarters back, I think, when we had the negative 10% growth or 12% or whatever it was, 12%, I think. A - Kelly Kramer : Yes, [indiscernible]. A - Charles Robbins : This -- Our entire SP business around the world is driven by very large customers. And so when some number of them have an off quarter, it can affect the business. And I think the Americas would be probably an example of that this quarter as well. And the Mexico business that I discussed is heavily influenced by service providers. And so that's a bit of what we've seen. We had some customers in the U.S. that were performed very well this quarter for us and others that did not. Kelly, any comment on the numbers? A - Kelly Kramer : Yes. No, I'd say, I think you hit on it. I think with the Americas being down so much, it was a combination of Mexico. Again, these are big customers and that was down. Chuck already mentioned Mexico was down 49%. It was a huge chunk of that was in the SP. And then in the U.S., the service providers, that was modestly down, not dramatic at all. Again and that is, again, we had a lot of customers that were up and a lot that were down, so balanced overall. Operator : The next question is coming from Pierre Ferragu of Sanford C. Bernstein Company. Q - Pierre Ferragu : I was wondering, Kelly and Chuck, if how much we should read in the weak guide you gave us against at least expectations we had on The Street. Is there a change we should expect in your seasonality pattern as you're going to watch more subscription services like natural, like trends of the first quarter that we've seen in the past? Is that something that we should see or we should expect to see changing over time? A - Charles Robbins : Yes, I'll make a comment and let Kelly answer the seasonality portion of it. But clearly, the transition to the software and subscription business obviously impacts how to think about guidance going forward. And when you -- when we see particularly large quarters with high growth like we saw this quarter, I think it will have an impact. I'm not sure exactly how we look at what it means seasonally. Kelly? A - Kelly Kramer : Yes, I mean, I do think that the models that we've looked at, tried and true over the years, where we could look at normal sequential from Q3 and Q4, I think those models are changing because we're accelerating what is -- we're putting more on the balance sheet than what is amortizing off. While we're part of our revenue guide takes into account the growth of what's coming from our recurring offers, we're still adding so much more because we're adding more and more offers every day. So I do think it is changing a bit. I think we'll talk about this a bit more when we get to our Analyst conference in June as well. But we'll give you clarity of how we can continue to model that. We certainly saw the big chunk of our business that's driven by the core orders in the book and ship, because we still have a lot of our business that we haven't transitioned yet, but as we drive more and more of that, I do think it's going to have to change how we've modeled in the past as an analyst, right? And we'll give you the clarity to help that. Operator : Next question is coming from the line of Steve Milunovich of UBS Securities. Q - Steven Milunovich : Kelly, can you give us any guidance by product segment for next quarter? For example, Services, I assume, will be up again. So in terms of kind of the deceleration of the downside, where will we see that? Will Switching likely be down, Routing be down more kind of in terms of things getting a bit worse? Where do you think we'll see that? A - Kelly Kramer : Yes, I mean, again, Steve, that we -- because so much of our core business is still very much related to the orders that we have yet to book, our backlog accounts were less than 1/3. And so much of our quarter comes from the order yet to come. We don't give guidance by business unit. But directionally, I think you're thinking about it the right way, right? I mean, I think last quarter, we tried to guide, when we were talking about Routing. We knew we had strong orders a quarter ago in Routing which is why it wasn't as bad as it had been in the quarter before this quarter on revenue. So again, it takes into account all of that. I do think, as you know, our Switching business is very fluid, so I don't think you should assume that, that is going to continue to be -- that goes up and down, so I don't think you should draw a trend having that being positive this quarter. So I think it's very fluid within business units. Operator : Our next question is coming from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Q - Roderick Hall : I just wanted to see if you could comment a little bit on the 31% recurring revenue. Maybe help us understand how much of that is SMARTnet and maintenance-type services and how much is, let's call it, next-gen recurring revenue. And so that -- and I also would like it, if you could comment, I know the carrier situation in the U.S. is pretty weak and we've seen that across other companies as well. But could you comment on specific projects like the Metro Optical buildout? Is that still a bright spot? Do you still see that project moving ahead as expected? A - Kelly Kramer : Sure. I'll hit the first one. So yes, if I break out the 31%, so the way to think about it, Rod, is basically, 90% of my services revenue is recurring, okay? So of the 31%, 75% of that dollar amount, so the $3.6 billion -- over $3.6 billion, 75% of that comes from the Services business. On the product side, 10% of my product revenue is now coming from recurring, so that's over $900 million. So 25% of that over $3.6 billion. And so again, I think that Services has continued to be in that 90% range. And again, what we're really trying to drive is more and more of those offers on the product side. A - Charles Robbins : Yes and Rod, this is Chuck. Like 6 quarters ago, the product number, I think, was 6%, so we have made progress and we'll continue to, as we see the amount of business that we're putting on the balance sheet is accelerating. On your second question, we absolutely continue to see the projects like Metro Optical moving forward. We've actually continued to do well in some of the next-generation areas that we're working with many of the U.S. service providers. So we see that going well and we do believe that as they make some of these transitions, we're going to be right in the middle of them with them. Operator : The next question is coming from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Q - Vijay Bhagavath : I mean, Chuck, I'm just a research analyst. I've noticed you're using AI machine learning quite a bit more recently. So like to get your idea, Chuck and also, Kelly, if you could, in terms of which might be the product areas within Cisco where you're apply AI machine learning to the max initially, where you see kind of low-hanging fruit, immediate kind of business outcomes from AI machine learning. Would it be in which parts of the portfolio? A - Charles Robbins : Thanks, Vijay. Yes, it's -- your point is actually quite accurate that we look at how we use it -- both of those as tools across our entire portfolio. And I would tell you that there are initiatives underway and there are active solutions already in the marketplace that have elements of that. In our security portfolio, there are absolutely elements of the that, that are in our collaboration portfolio already. We see lots of opportunities when you start talking about automation and analytics and things like network assurance, capabilities or in service provider, self-healing networks. So we see the opportunity across everything we do and we have initiatives both already working with customers as well as a lot of work going on inside the business units to leverage AI machine learning and other technologies going forward. Operator : The next question is from Paul Silverstein of Cowen and Company. Q - Paul Silverstein : I'm hoping for a clarification on certain issues. One, going back to the earlier question on pricing. Kelly, did I hear you say that pricing was relatively stable? And can you give us some granularity in terms of what you're seeing in Europe Switching and Routing in terms of pricing? And just very quickly, 2 quarters ago, you quantified the impact of the shift to recurring revenue model. I think you'd cited 100- to 200-plus basis point adverse impact. Can you give us quantification of that impact this quarter? A - Kelly Kramer : Sure. So on the pricing, yes, just to give you the clarification of the pricing and I'll pull up actually between Europe here, so just give me a second. But so to clarify, so we do have normal price erosion every period for, mostly, in our switching and routing portfolio, those are the ones that are most sensitive to it. It's been in the same consistent percentage in terms of price reduction year-over-year that it has been both last quarter, a year ago and so in the last -- we had one favorable quarter where we had some favorability for some rebates, but overall, it's been in the same range. But it hasn't gotten worse. I'll pull up about -- I'll try to pull up here as I'm answering the second question, any difference between Europe and the Americas. But I think it's fairly consistent across the regions. The second clarification was on -- what was it, Marilyn? A - Charles Robbins : On the impact of the recurring business. A - Kelly Kramer : Yes. Yes, so I have been saying it's in the 1 to 2 range. It is definitely pushing closer to the 2% range at this point. I mean, I think, it's clearly driven. We share with you the balance and that's accelerating and I certainly look at the short term portion of that and try to quarterize that together with it. But it's definitely -- it's pointing to the 2% more than the 1%. And Paul, I'll get back to you on that -- if there's any difference between Americas and Europe on that. Operator : Next question is from Tal Liani of Bank of America. Q - Tal Liani : If my numbers are correct, your recurring revenues grew 6% year-over-year and it was 14% the previous quarters. And I'm trying to see what could cause reacceleration. The question I have is whether you focus the recurring part mostly on new types of businesses, such as security and others or you can find ways to go back to Switching and Routing and change either pricing scheme or add features or do something such that recurring revenues outside of maintenance, of course, recurring revenues grow and you can add software features on top will do that. The question is whether the customers will accept it or is this is going to be a traditional business model forever? A - Charles Robbins : Yes, Tal, thanks for the question. So even in our current deferred revenue from Software and Subscription, there are elements of our core portfolio that are included in that $4.4 billion that you saw primarily through our Cisco ONE offerings that we put together. Probably 18 months ago, we started that journey and we got those offers and they began to ramp. But we also are looking -- obviously, security is ramping. Collaboration has been the one probably the longest in this model. But we do believe that across the portfolio, with future offers, we have the opportunity to do that and you'll see that as we deliver on some of the new capabilities. Kelly, any commentary on the... A - Kelly Kramer : Yes, on the slowdown, so Tal, we're actually not slowing down. The reason it looks like it's slowing down is for the Services piece, we do have the extra week compare. So if you adjust for that, it's up double digits in total. And if I look at just product, the growth of product which I said is over $900 million, that's growing 34% year-over-year and it was 30% last quarter. So that continues to grow faster. A - Marilyn Mora : I believe that was our last question. Chuck, maybe I'll turn it to you for over for final words. End of Q&A: Charles Robbins : Yes, so first of all, I want to thank all of you for joining the call today. I wanted to just take a minute and reiterate that I believe that our strategy is working and I'm really -- I'm optimistic about where we're going to go over the next 3 to 5 years. We set out 18 months ago to transition the business to one of more software and subscription. At the time, 8 quarters ago, it was $2 billion on our balance sheet. Today, we've more than doubled that, up 57% this quarter to $4.4 billion and accelerating. So I believe that is working and we'll continue to shift more and more of our offers into that space. We also, obviously, wanted to be very clear about the areas that we needed to invest in and you've seen significant investments in security and collaboration over the years.  About 15 months ago, we made obvious reallocations of expenses more towards the core and you're going to see future innovation in that space as well. Our customers really are going to be adding billions of connections in the future and they are going to need a next-generation network with security automation and analytics. And so we're transitioning the business model. We're transitioning the network offers that we're going to deliver to our customers as they move into this next generation. And at the same time, we're leveraging our capability to do inorganic as well as organic innovation to make that happen. And in the midst of all this change, we remain very committed to our execution model and ensuring that we're focused on profitability as well as capital returns to our shareholders. So that's a summary of where I think we're right now and I wanted to thank all of you for spending time with us today. Thanks. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Chuck and I'll go ahead and close it up here. Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call which will reflect our fiscal 2017 fourth quarter and annual results, will be on Wednesday, August 16, 2017, at 1 :30 p.m. Pacific time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern time.

As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck. Charles Robbins : Thank you, Marilyn, and good afternoon everyone. As you know it's only been seven weeks since we last spoke at our Financial Analyst Day and our overall outlook remains consistent with what we outlined at that time. In fiscal 2017, we continue to execute well against our vision of delivering customers a highly secure intelligent platform for their digital business. We managed our business through a dynamic environment and at the same time delivered significant innovation to further accelerate the next phase of our transformation. In Q4, we generated revenue of $12.1 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.61. For the full fiscal year revenue was $48 billion and we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of$2.39. We drove strong margins and record operating cash flow for the year. Our results demonstrate solid execution against our strategic priorities. Accelerating our pace of innovation, increasing the value of the network and delivering technology in the way our customers want to consume it. In June, we announced a new era of networking with the launch of the Network Intuitive. This is an example of the industry leading innovation Cisco is providing to its customers. The Network Intuitive is a new intent-based network that creates a fully integrated intuitive system that is designed to anticipate actions, stop security threats in their tracks and continue to evolve and learn over time. We're applying the latest technologies such as machine learning and advanced analytics to operate and define the network. From a security standpoint, the new network enables our customers to detect threats in encrypted traffic with unprecedented accuracy using Cisco's encrypted traffic analytics and intelligence from Cisco's Talos cyber intelligence unit. We have created the only network that is designed for security while maintaining privacy solving a previously unsolvable problem. Our new Catalyst 9000 switches represent the foundation of our intent-based networking capabilities and provide highly differentiated advancements in security, programmability, performance, and lower operating cost by innovating at the hardware and software layer. This offering is also a great example of how we're moving our core business to a recurring revenue model. Customer reception to this new innovation has been incredibly positive. As we've always said transitions of this nature are multi-year, but during the first four weeks in the market our pipeline and product orders are strong. With over 200 customers having ordered the new Catalyst 9000, the heart of the Network Intuitive platform. Our software value proposition in this portfolio is also compelling as the large majority of our customers are adopting the most advanced subscription offer available. Building on this early success, we intend to further accelerate our leadership in intent-based networking through the combination of our expertise in network infrastructure AppDynamics visibility into applications and the Talos automation capabilities. I believe that over the next several years, we will see continued increasing relevance of technology as customers add billions of new connections to their enterprises. The network has never been more critical to business success and we're looking for helping our customers take advantage of the insights in intelligence that are only accessible through our highly differentiated platforms. If Q4, we also announced an extension of our strategic partnerships with Apple, IBM, and Microsoft. We plan to deliver the first enterprise security application on Apple iOS and we're integrating our comprehensive security portfolio with IBM's Cognitive Security operations platform. Additionally, we're collaborating with Microsoft in two important ways. First, we're implementing a software layer on our datacenter switches that gives Microsoft the flexibility to run their own operating system on our industry leading hardware platforms in their Azure infrastructure. Second, we're collaborating together to enable businesses to build and host they're IoT applications in Microsoft Azure while extending the power of those applications to the edge via Cisco's leading Fog computing solutions. Now let's review other key parts of our business starting with security. We believe we are well positioned as the number one enterprise security vendor. With growing cyber-attacks and the need for our customers to protect their business-critical data and applications, we are aggressively providing security everywhere. In the network, in the cloud, and at the end point. We don't believe any other company can match our capabilities given the criticality of the network in our customer's security architecture. Our best of breed products in Integrated Security architecture combining analytics and automation are winning in the market. Our security business delivered a solid quarter with double-digit orders and 49% deferred revenue growth. This caps off a year in which we delivered 9% revenue growth with more than $2 billion in revenue making us the only company growing at this scale. Our leadership position in network security continues to expand driven by our next generation firewall portfolio with over 6,000 new customers added in the quarter which is three times our nearest competitor. Bringing our total customer base to nearly 80,000. Customers continue to rapidly adopt our advanced threat portfolio. We delivered revenue growth of 9% and we added over 7,600 new customers bringing the total number of AMP customers to over 42,000. Building on our differentiated security innovations, we recently completed the acquisition of Observable Networks, which extends our Stealthwatch Solution into the cloud with highly scalable behavior analytics and comprehensive visibility. This platform expands our security, our cloud security capabilities by providing greater support and compliance for applications deployed in Amazon web services as well as Microsoft Azure environments. Additionally, to combat the 90% increase in cyber-attacks against IoT devices over the last year, we launched IoT threat defense solution an extensible, scalable, security architecture created to defend devices in connected healthcare, electric utilities, and manufacturing industries. In the datacenter, we're helping our customers take full advantage of a multi-cloud world that has become the norm in managing their applications and hybrid cloud solutions. Our goal is to deliver the best multi-cloud platform built on an intelligent Intuitive Network enabling faster automated and highly secured delivery of applications in the cloud. We believe Cisco is best positioned to do this as everything we do in the datacenter is in support of modern and traditional applications both on premise and in the cloud. Cisco has led the industry over the past four years with ACI combined with UCS to traditional cloud center and our security solutions. In Q4, we saw strong performance of our multi-cloud infrastructure portfolio combined with our cloud-based SaaS offerings including WebEx and Meraki cloud networking. For example, ACI, our fastest growing datacenter switching platform had a record quarter with growth of 38%. We continue to see strong customer adoption driven by our ability to accelerate datacenter application deployment across private to public clouds. HyperFlex our hyper converged offering combined with cloud center is gaining traction with customers benefiting from simplicity and scalability to support their hybrid cloud strategy. You'll see us continue to strengthen our partnerships with public cloud providers as they look to Cisco to help our joint customers manage workloads across their private and public clouds. Lastly, we're delivering the right consumption models to enable continuous value and innovation for our customers. Our strong momentum continued in Q4 with 50% growth to $5 billion in deferred product revenue related to software and subscriptions which has doubled from two years ago. For the first time, over $1 billion or 11% of our product revenue came from recurring offers which grew 40% year-over-year. Overall 31% of our total revenue was recurring and revenue from subscriptions now represents 51%of our software revenue. Going forward, you should expect to see our software business benefit from the transition of our campus networking portfolio to a subscription model. To summarize our Q4and full fiscal year results reflect a strong year of progress. We see tremendous opportunity in intent-based capabilities across our portfolio and we will continue to evolve our business to be the leading provider of highly secure software defined automated and intent-based infrastructure. Our innovation is as strong as ever, as we focus on accelerating our core networking, security, software, and cloud based businesses. While it will take time. I firmly believe our core business is better positioned for the long term as we realize the benefits from our next generation intent-based networking portfolio. Now, I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more detail on our financials. Kelly Kramer : Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter and full fiscal year followed by the Q1 outlook. This quarter played out generally as we expected and as we indicated in our guidance in our last call. We executed well, drove solid profitability, strong cash flow and we continued to deliver on our strategic growth priorities. Total revenue was $12.1 billion down 4%. We continued to focus on driving margins and profitability with strong non-GAAP operating margin of 31.5%. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.61 down 3% and operating cash flow was strong growing 5% to $4 billion. For the full fiscal year, we had revenue of $48 billion down 2% with product down 3%and services up 3%. Non-GAAP operating margin was a record $15.2 billion expanding to 31.6% of revenue up 0.6 points. Non-GAAP EPS also a record with $2.39 up 1% percent and we generated record operating cash flow of$13.9 billion up 2%. Let me provide some more details on our Q4 revenue breakdown. Total product revenue was down 5%. Switching declined 9%driven by weakness in Campus partially offset by growth in the ATI portfolio which was up 38%. We saw good initial traction of our new intent-based networking portfolio of the Catalyst 9000 family of switches. Routing was down 9% driven by weakness in enterprise access, we did see a spending cause related to our acquisition of Viptela that we will integrate into SD-WAN portfolio. Collaboration was down 3% due primarily to a decline in Unified Communications Endpoints partially offset by continued growth in conferencing. Deferred revenue grew 4%combined with the unbilled deferred the two were up 16%. Datacenter declined 4% with the continued market shift from Blade to Rack. However, we did he solid traction of our hyper converged offerings HyperFlex. During the quarter, we launched our UCSM5 servers bringing greater simplicity and performance for next generation data intensive workloads and application. Wireless grew 5% with strong Meraki performance as well as the ramp of our 11AC Wave 2 portfolio. Security was up 3% with strong performance in Unified Threat, Web Security and Advanced Threat offset by declines in our legacy Firewall products. We did see very strong order growth during the quarter. Deferred revenue grew 49%as we continued to drive more subscription based software offers. Service revenue was up 1% driven by growth in software and solutions services partially offset by decline in hardware maintenance. We drove good growth in deferred revenue which was up 12%in total with product up 23%and services up 6%. Deferred product revenue from our recurring software and subscription offers was up 50%to $5 billion. We continue to transform our business to delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions and recurring revenue. In Q4, we generated 31% of our total revenue from recurring offers an increase of almost four points from a year ago. Revenue from subscriptions increased 18% and now represents over 50% of our software revenue. In terms of orders in Q4, total product orders were flat. Looking at our geographies, Americas was down 2%, EMEA was up 3% an APJC grew 2%. Total emerging markets declined2% with the BRICS plus Mexico also down 2%. In our customer segments, enterprise declined 1%,commercial grew 4%, public sector was up 2%and service provider declined 7%. Our product backlog as we ended Q4 with $4.8 billion up 3% compared to the end of fiscal year 2016. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q4 gross margin was 53.7% down 0.9 points. Product gross margin was 61.9% down two points and service gross margin was 68.8% growing 1.8 points. While our total gross margin was solid, our product gross margin is continuing to be negatively impacted by memory pricing which we expect to continue in the near term. Our operating margin was strong at 31.5%. For the full fiscal year on a non-GAAP basis, our total gross margin was 64.3% a decrease of 0.4 points. But product gross margin down 0.9 points and service gross margin up 1.1 points. Our non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 31.6% up 0.6 points by our focus on driving cost improvement, operational efficiencies and productivity. In terms of the bottom line, our Q4 non-GAAP EPS was $0.61 down 3%, while GAAP EPS was $0.48. For the full year, we had non-GAAP EPS of $2.39 up 1% while GAAP EPS was $1.90. We ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $70.5 billion with $3 billion available in the US. Q4 operating cash flow increased a solid 5% to $4 billion with free cash flow of $3.8 billion up 7%. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned 2.6 points to shareholders during the quarter that included $1.2 billion of share repurchases and $1.4 billion for our quarterly dividend. For the full fiscal year operating cash flow grew 2% to a record $13.9 billion with free cash flow of $12.9 billion up 4%. We returned $9.2 billion to shareholders over the fiscal year through share buybacks and dividends which represented 71% of our free cash flow. We are firmly committed to continuing our capital allocation strategy of returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders annually. To summarize in Q4 and for the full fiscal year, we executed well and we're focused on driving operational efficiencies and profitability to drive strong cash flow enabling us to make the strategic investments to build long term shareholder value. Let me reiterate our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, this guidance includes the type of forward looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue in the range of minus 1% to minus 3% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29.5% to 30.5%and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.59 to $0.61. Consistent with how we talk about our business at our financial analyst conference, in fiscal 2018 we will be redefining and simplifying our product reporting categories to better align with our evolving business model. We will continue to primarily run operator business by the three geographic segments and so this change will only impact how we report on our products. Starting in Q1 fiscal year 2018, we will realign our reporting into five distinct categories infrastructure platform, applications, security, services, and other. I'll now turn it back to Chuck for some closing comments. Charles Robbins : Thanks Kelly. And thanks again to all of you for joining us today. As we've discussed many times in the past, we're working on a multi-year transition and while I'm confident with our progress it's clear there's more for us to do. In Q4, we made ongoing progress generating 31% of our total revenue from recurring offers and growing 50% in deferred product revenue related to software and subscriptions to $5 billion. I'm optimistic about our future, the direction we're headed, and how we're transforming Cisco for the future. We are well positioned to succeed in a cloud and digital ready world where the network is one of the most strategic assets for our customers. Looking forward to fiscal 2018, as I said earlier, you can expect us to do the following. Execute against our strategy and invest in priority areas to drive profitable growth and enhance shareholder value. Leverage to power the network to maximize our opportunities and differentiation in existing and new markets. Drive relentless focus on innovation, creating continuous customer value across every element of our portfolio and drive the right consumption models for our customers and accelerate our shift towards more software and subscription revenue. Marilyn, now I'll turn it back to you for questions. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Chuck. Mark, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. And while Mark is doing that, I'd like to go ahead and remind the audience that we ask you to ask one question, so that we have plenty of time for others in the audience to ask their questions today. Operator : Thank you. Our first question is from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Ittai Kidron : Thanks, and appreciate the color around the software and the current metrics, very helpful. I guess just a couple from me. Just an easy clarification. Kelly, you haven't mentioned the number of Cisco ONE customers, we'd love to get that? And -- the question itself Chuck, switching has had a little bit of a difficulty I think three out of the four quarters was down quite substantially actually on year-over-year basis. As we look into 18 how do you think about that business in the year, it that another year of transition to where the portfolio through for example your most recent announcements will go for a potential pause and update and learning curve where that business could still be prone to declines or we should finally see some better results in that category? Charles Robbins : Ittai, I am shocked you asked a switching question. Kelly Kramer : Let me answer the easy one first. Ittai Kidron : I've given up on the data center business. Kelly Kramer : Well, I have an easy answer. In Cisco ONE we have over 20,000 customers now at this moment. Ittai Kidron : Perfect. That's great. Charles Robbins : Okay. So Ittai, let me touch on the switching situation. First of all, the results we saw this quarter were not a surprise to us, if you think about our guide last quarter we anticipated this and we also knew at the time that we're going to be making the announcement in June about the new platform. And so, we anticipated these results. Now anytime we do a major platform announcement particularly in switching there is a period of time where our customers pause because they want to understand what this means. So, we did see a pause and we actually anticipated it. But we saw great traction with the new platform. As I said earlier, just in the four weeks where we closed the quarter we had 200 customers that embraced this new architecture and purchase a new Catalyst 9000 platform. And as I said in the opening comments, the great majority of them also opted for the advanced software subscription the goes on top of it and we've had a lot of conversations over the last two years as to whether we could really drive a subscription business on our core switching platforms. And what we see is that at least early indications are that we can do that. So, we talked about our data center business, the ACI portfolio again record quarter growing 38%. And then if you look at what we lost in the Campus, typically what we see is these are three-year cycles to transition these platforms. But this is also not a typical platform transition, this is not speeds and feeds only. We brought forward some incredible innovation in this platform and if you think about not only the actual product itself but the solutions that we announced around automation which really gets at the operating expenses that our customers are incurring to manage their infrastructure. You look at one of the key drivers of why customers move to the cloud, it was because of the complexity in the cost of their private infrastructure. So, the ability to go drive significant cost out for our customers while managing this stuff over the next few years we think is a huge difference from a normal transition. And the other is the fact that we launched encrypted traffic analytics which is our ability to determine when there's malware inside encrypted traffic without decrypting it. And that's an innovation that only Cisco can actually deliver and both of those pieces of technology or what are included in that advanced subscription which is what tells us that the customer see tremendous value in that subscription. So normally, we see three years, it's very early and we would like to believe that we can accelerate that based on the incremental innovation that's being delivered as part of the platform, but let's see how it goes over the next quarter or two. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Chuck. Mark next question please. Operator : Our next question is from James Suva with Citigroup Global Markets. James Suva : Hi, thanks so much on the opportunity to ask questions. It's Jim Suva here from Citi. Last quarter, I believe you gave a little bit of commentary or a bit of a pause in the federal government spending and also on Europe. It appears is that still continuing or has it taken a step up to improve or deteriorate a little bit and how should we think about that? And does the Europe have any impact on Brexit? Thank you very much. Charles Robbins : Hi Jim. Thanks for the questions. Since you outlined, I'll just quickly cover sort of all the headwinds that we talked about in Q3, I'll give you a quick update on all that's including and the two that you asked. First of all, we talked about Mexico last quarter which is generally in the same state it was last quarter. We didn't see any significant change and again that's largely driven by service provider weakness due to regulatory transitions as well as geopolitical dynamics and after renegotiation etcetera. Emerging countries were slightly better but there is still just tremendous uncertainty and disparity between performance in those countries and service provider is generally the same as it was last quarter. The two that you asked about in particular, we did see some shifts in US federal. I would say in Q3, we had of real lack of clarity around budgets. In early May, we began to see obviously the clarity with the continuing resolution and the way the dollars get released in federal were in like the fourth phase based on how they prioritize release in those budget funds. So, we saw some improvement not where we'd like there to be but we saw some improvement particularly late in the quarter and obviously in federal we're going to be facing the same issue again in 90 days at the end of September as we try to get another budget resolution passed. But you can see on a global public-sector perspective, you saw our orders last quarter were minus four, this quarter they were plus two and that was clearly a big part of that was the improvement we saw in the US federal business. On the UK, if you go back to Q3, we talked about it being significantly down and one of the primary drivers was the headwind created by currency. In Q4, what I'll tell you is that headwind from currency remained, it did not ease up. However, our teams did a really amazing job and we saw significant improvement in our enterprise and commercial business in the UK. And if you look at the overall performance in EMEAR, you can see that the strengthening in the UK for us actually helped achieve the result at the EMEAR level. I'll say one final thing and UK while enterprise and commercial we saw a good uptick. Service provider remained about the same. Marilyn Mora : Okay Mark, let's go ahead and take the next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with Sanford Bernstein & Co. Pierre Ferragu : Hi, thank you for taking my question. I'd like to get a sense for how you see like your near-term trend in the business. If I look at your revenue guide for next quarter, so we have seen slightly down year-on-year, but sequentially the kind of revenue change you are guiding for is actually probably better than the average seasonality for Q1 of the last year. So am I right, thinking the environment, you see the environment, the business environment slightly improving sequentially after this quarter, this weaker quarter you were anticipating. So that's on the revenue front. And then on the margin front, I think like from the top of my mind, you probably didn't beat in your gross margin guidance range for like eight or nine quarters in a row or something like that. And your gross margin came in slightly down sequentially, and you are guiding for slightly lower operating margin next quarter than what the consensus is anticipating so if you could give some perspective on what's happening at the gross margin level, relatively small movements that I am sure you can give us some visibility on where are the drivers there? Thank you. Charles Robbins : Yes, Pierre. Let me give you a little color on the revenue question and sort of the business conditions and then I'll let Kelly talk about the Q1guide as well as the margins. In general, I think if you just look at our order rates that we released today, we went from negative four last quarter to flat in Q4. I'm sorry from Q3 negative four to flat in Q4. So clear that we saw improvement there. I will tell you that across the customers segments, just so you have some visibility, I think we showed the high-level numbers, I'll give you a little bit of a double click. On the enterprise side, we didn't see a lot of variability around the world in the performance there. Commercial, every region around the world improved from Q3 to Q4, public sector every region improved from Q3 to Q4 and SP we had weakness everywhere. So that's just sort a little color on the orders that we saw in Q4. Kelly, you want to talk a little bit about the revenue guide and margins? Kelly Kramer : Yes, sure. On the revenue guide, as you know Pierre we call it like we see it and as Chuck mentioned the bookings being much better in Q4 than Q3 it certainly helped a lot. And I'll just mention that we are starting off with a strong backlog with our backlog being up 3%and we have good momentum as we go in the quarter. So, we feel good about the revenue call for Q1. As I talk about margins, yes, our margins for Q4 were in the range, but we definitely saw our product margins go down 2 points year-over-year and it really comes down quite simply that 3 points. The one and the biggest impact by far has been the increase of memory pricing and DRAM specifically for the overall business that accounts for more than half of the 2 points decline. The second point that's really impacting that is an overall productivity. Whenever you have large part of the portfolio, our largest business unit down 9% like switching which is also a very profitable business. It impacts your ability to get cost savings in that quarter so that was the second biggest driver and then we just had a third driver but to a much lesser extent was a slight uptick in pricing erosion. Marilyn Mora : All right. Next question please. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Milunovich with UBS Securities. Steven Milunovich : Great, thank you. On the security side, you said at the Analyst Day you expect low to mid-teens growth. You did talk about strong orders today, but the revenue growth was much less. I think you cited some legacy products, holding things back. Do you have confidence that the reported revenue is going to get back into the double digits consistently? Charles Robbins : Yes, Steve. So first, I'll say on the security. I have zero concerns about the business, this is a revenue timing issues. Our orders were, they were some of the strongest, we saw some of the strongest order growth in the quarter as we've seen in the last two years. So, it's simply a revenue timing issue, it funny if you go back to Q4 2015, the first call I did there was concern about our security revenue at 4% and at the time our deferred software was going 26 and this time we had 3% revenue but our deferred software was gone 49. So, the strength in the business, I'm still comfortable with. Kelly any comments on it? Kelly Kramer : I think you said it well and it's literally just timing. We and uptick to come back there in the next quarter. Marilyn Mora : Okay. Let's go ahead and jump to the next question please. Operator : Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Vijay Bhagavath : Yes, good afternoon. Hi Chuck, Kelly. Kelly Kramer : Hi Vijay. Vijay Bhagavath : Yes, hi. My question is on what feedback and commentary you are hearing from your sales team, your customers, channel partners in this new model to purchase products like the Catalyst 9000 the subscription being is - hopefully you get this with security feature attached. And then the next part of the question is the demand for the subscription model primarily coming from the US market customers or are you - Kelly Kramer : Hi Vijay. Can you speak up a little bit, it's a bit hard to hear you. Vijay Bhagavath : Okay. So, I think the question is what commentary you are hearing from your customers and channel partners of your sales team on purchasing the new product which is the Catalyst 9000, the software has security features with subscription model and\u2026 Kelly Kramer : Vijay, speak up just a tad bit higher there. We still have. Vijay Bhagavath : Can you guys hear me now? Charles Robbins : That's much better. Kelly Kramer : Yes, much better. Vijay Bhagavath : Yes. So, I think the first part of the question is the commentary from your customers on purchasing new products with subscriptions model. The second part of the question is the demand for the subscriptions model primarily coming from US customers or are you seeing overseas demand as well for subscriptions based purchasing? Thanks. Charles Robbins : Okay. So, I'll answer the first part. I think Kelly, I have an instinctive answer on the second part but she probably has a mathematical answer. So, what we are -- first or all I think that when you look back at what we announced probably I think back was seven weeks ago so must've been eight weeks ago or nine weeks ago we announced the actual Network Intuitive. It was probably one the most significant launches we've had in almost a decade. And what I would tell you is there's a lot of emotional momentum right now within the employee base with our customers with our partners with our sales organization about the innovation. And specifically, your question, I think that what we always knew was that when we attempted to introduce a subscription model on a switching product we knew that we had to bring innovation that was -- that had such a high return for our customers that they would not have a problem buying it in that model and that's what we've seen. When you look at the automation platform that we're going to -- that we're delivering to our customers we're going to continue to enhance over the next several years and you look at the security capability that frankly only Cisco with our understanding has a network and with our threat intelligence that we get from Talos and with our ability to build silicon they can actually make that happen. I think our customers are actually quite pleased with the innovation and so far, we've seen a high correlation with that to the advance subscription. So as far as the geographic issue, Kelly? Kelly Kramer : Yes, I mean as far as the geographic it's following very closely with our natural split. We definitely have more in the Americas, but we have a very healthy pipeline in Europe as well as a APJC. So, it's getting traction everywhere. Marilyn Mora : Thanks for the question Vijay. Mark, let's go ahead and take the next question. Operator : Our next question is from Timothy Long with BMO Capital Markets. Timothy Long : Thank you. Just wanted to check in on the web scale client base. How did that trend in the quarter and you can also address the kind of the switching and routing competitive environment there, it seems like white box really not taking off with some of your competitors having good traction? So, if you could just update us on progress with that large customer base? That's great, thank you. Charles Robbins : Yes, thanks Tim. So, we were together seven weeks ago, the story here hasn't changed significantly as I've said in the past. We have reengaged in a very big way. I will tell you that we've had some wins, we actually had the press release that I talked about in my earlier comments with Microsoft about running their OS on our cloud silicon switches and we continue to make traction with these customers. As I've said, we're looking at each of them very individually as to what it is they need and we're also looking at broad base partnerships with them not only for their own infrastructure but as they realize that the importance of having this multi-cloud capability and the ability to run not only applications in a central public cloud but be able to run portions of those applications out at the edge of the network is leading to a very complimentary partnership that we're talking about with all of them. So, I would say that not a lot has changed in last seven weeks but we're still continuing to make solid progress and I'm optimistic. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Chuck. Let's go ahead and take up the next question. Operator : Our next question is from Tal Liani with Bank of America Securities Merrill Lynch. Tal Liani : Hi guys, I have actually two questions but it's about margin and cash. You touched on this a little bit but you knew about memory pricing when you enter the quarter I think when you gave the guidance, still product gross margin was weak. What was the delta, what was weaker than expected during the question that drove gross margin down? The second question is cash repatriation, if it doesn't happen. You already now have $70 billion in cash, but only $3 billion in US. So, do you consider plan B for bringing the cash to US or any other use for the cash? Kelly Kramer : Alright. Hi, Tal. So, on the memory, we've talked about memory for the last three quarters and now we start to see this as a headwind initially in Q2 and it's just gotten progressively worse. I think it's very much public information that the prices continue to climb and in this scarce supply environment, our supply team has done a great job securing supply for us but those prices continue to be at market at that price that goes forward. So, it's continuing to be a moving target and again, as I will say to the guide our gross margin ended up in the range of our guide. So those are just some of the variables as we go forward. As I look forward I think, we expect the memory pressure to continue on in the near term and we're taking that into account as we give you guidance going forward for Q1. On the cash, yes. We have $3 billion of cash domestically. We've been able to - we've been accessing commercial paper, we increased that a little bit this past quarter and we've been able to access and get access to capital to take out debt if we need to as we go forward because again, we are continuing to ensure we have the flexibility we need, whether it's for strategic M&A or to continue with obviously our dividend and share repurchase. So, we don't see any issues with that going forward and we'll continue to be as efficient as possible as managing our cash and any debt we need to take out. Marilyn Mora : Thanks for the question Tal. Mark, let's go and take the next question. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Silverstein with Cowen & Co. Your line is open. Paul Silverstein : Thanks. Just two clarifications from Kelly and then a question. The clarifications being, Kelly you mentioned the tick up in price erosion. Does that mean below 3% and then the other on the switching commentary can you give us a datacenter switching growth all in beyond just the ACI portfolio and what the Campus switching was. And the real question is looking at the dragon growth from the shift to subscriptions what was\u2026 Marilyn Mora : Paul? Are you on mute. Yes, let's go ahead and take the next question. Operator : Okay. Our next question is from Rod Hall with J.P. Morgan Securities. Rod Hall : Yes. Hi, guys thanks for the question. I wanted Kelly maybe, get you to comment on the inventory movement. The inventory is up quite a bit this quarter. I am assuming that might be forward purchasing in memory and then I assume that might protect your margin looking forward. But I wonder could you confirm that and if it is the case, that it's memory how long are you protected, how long are you hedged? And then also Chuck maybe going back to that carrier order volume. Could you just maybe dig into where you're seeing weakness in orders in the network can you help us pinpoint that or is it more broad and related to product slowdown that's kind of generally from a part of the network where is that sluggishness materializing? Thanks. Kelly Kramer : Yes. So, Rod on the inventory, you're correct. A large majority of the inventory increase is driven by memory advanced purchases. So that protects us in for a large portion but we also have been as I mentioned in the lack -- we've also been securing and committing to our purchase commitments for even more access to supply that also will ensure that we have the supply albeit perhaps at higher prices if they continue to rise. But the bulk of the inventory going up, the $400 million is memory and then there is also a little bit of just inventory built up as we continue just to execute our revenue in Q1. Charles Robbins : Hi Rod on the second part. Thanks for asking about the service provider business. I think we have characterized it as, it's less about different portions of the network and it's really about the disparity across large customers. As I said in the last couple of calls, we literally had some very big customers that were growing double-digits and others that were on the opposite side of that. So, it really is more of a customer variability issue then it is a single place in the network infrastructure that is causing a problem. And that's what we've seen for several quarters and again some of it is based on regulatory issues and geopolitical dynamics others are based on consolidation going on in a certain part of the industry. So that's kind of the color as to how I see it. Hopefully, that's helpful. Marilyn Mora : Okay. Thanks Chuck. Next question please. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Silverstein with Cowen & Co. Paul Silverstein : Chuck, Kelly, Marilyn can you hear me? Charles Robbins : Yes, we can hear you now. Paul Silverstein : It is a good telephone, just in the interest of full disclosure. Charles Robbins : We thought your question was going to be hard and you came back. Kelly Kramer : No. Go ahead. Charles Robbins : I'm just kidding. Paul Silverstein : So, let me ask a question and two clarifications. The question being what was the drag on growth from the shift of subscriptions this quarter and can you talk about what your product segment growth will look like on a normalized basis i.e. adjusting for the shift in subscriptions. I am aware that wireless win and collaboration have been the two places where insecurity where it's been first implemented but can you talk to us about what the growth will look like on a product line basis correcting for that? And the clarification, Kelly you mentioned that took up in price erosion; was it still below 3% and can you tell us what the decline in campus switching was? What it was the all-in growth rate of data centers, not just ACI but taking account the 7,000 or whatever are the products in that? Thanks a lot. Kelly Kramer : Yes, sure. So on the shift, first, it's not much different than we told you, it's basically about 2% between the 1.5% and 2% and you hit the -- obviously, it's security impacts the most, collaboration has always been that way and that just could change robust if you retain the security be impacted, wireless would be impacted and now with fiscal one really ramping up and added hundreds of millions of dollars out of the balance sheet, that would have and impacted -- well, and that what is the piece that will accelerate even more as we get more attraction on the catalyst 9,000 switches platform. So it's kind of across the board, in terms of data center overall, so if I look at switching and switching being down 9%, the bulk of it was campus switching and that was over double-digit; so that was the biggest drag. Data center switching all in was basically flattish. Paul Silverstein : And price decline? Kelly Kramer : And price decline, yes, it is -- you're talking about a year-over-year rate impact? Paul Silverstein : Yes. Kelly Kramer : Yes, so it is below the 3% and you can see that in the K. Paul Silverstein : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Paul. Mark, let's go ahead and take the next question. Operator : Our next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James & Associates. Simon Leopold : Great, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to see if we could maybe double click down on the security business in light of the headlines we've heard in the security space over the last couple of months in terms of attack. I think of the case of nuance highlighted employing Cisco and I recall your discussions in the past about the need for security to be an architectural solution and not a point solution. So it sounds like the market is moving towards the pitch you've made and it's made sense for a long time, I'm just trying to see if you can help us quantify the outlook for your security business if you see an inflexion point of the business moving more towards the solution sales and point products versus what we've seen in the past. Thank you. Charles Robbins : Thanks for the question, Simon. The short answer is yes. And what's happened is, if you -- if you think about how our customers are building their IT infrastructure or how their IT assets are being deployed, they are in a massively distributed mode and they are trying to navigate and manage technology assets spanning from the public cloud to connected vehicles, connected mining operations, all the way back to their private data center over to SaaS applications, so the architecture of sort of hair pinning all that stuff back to a central point in the enterprise is not going to be sustainable. Therefore, we see our customers transitioning to a fundamentally new architecture that's enabled by the network and that's why they are moving to the security architecture because as I said, our teams have built this strategy where you have to deploy security everywhere which is at the endpoint in the network in the cloud. And I think as it relates to some of the attacks, I don't remember the number exactly last quarter or the quarter before relative to our threat -- new threat customers that we have, the Amp customers, but I believe the 7,600 discussed this quarter was a pretty significant increase over what we saw during a quarter over the last two quarters and I think that's probably related to not only the architectural buy-end that our customers have but also the fact that that solution was pretty resilient during the recent ransom ware attacks. Marilyn Mora : Okay Mark, let's go ahead and take the next question. Operator : Our next question is from Jeffery [ph] with Nomura Securities International. Unidentified Analyst : Yes, thank you very much. And I would like to dive into the service provider outlook a little bit if we could. It sounds as though we understand that things aren't perfect around the world for you. My question is how much of where we are in service rider, do you consider to be cyclical? And how much of this is structural? I mean do you think that we should see the service provider orders be in that 1% to 3% growth range that you've highlighted for the overall business? Thank you. Charles Robbins : Let me see if I can break this down into three sort of qualitative areas that I think we are focused on that can actually improve the service provider performance over the next three to seven quarters, over the next two years. I think first is, we have increased our presence or relevance in the web scale cloud providers that we've talked about, that's first and foremost. Second is, there are -- there is innovation that we are working on, that we talked a little bit about at the financial analyst conference, it will be coming out probably a few quarters from now that will give us some transition opportunities in some of our platforms. And then finally, I think the other is, there is -- but I would characterize as a combination of some of the macro issues as well as technology transitions, I think you're going to see customers and we're beginning to have discussions with customers, we're thinking about 5G and while we're not in the macro radio space, one of the key things that they are working on or thinking about is, as I add a significant number of new devices at higher speeds and lower latency out at the edge of the network, what is that going to mean for the performance I'm going to need in the core of the network. So I think as we see some of the geopolitical dynamics hopefully settle down but I wouldn't count on that right now but the overall, I think the 5G trend in that transition is the other one that could help us over the next couple of years. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Chuck. Let's go ahead and take the next question. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with Barclays Capital. Mark Moskowitz : Thanks and good afternoon. I just want to follow-up on the gross margin question, a lot of focus today on the call, how should investors anticipate potential margin volatility over the next one to two years related to the transition to the highly attracted subscription model? And then Kelly, can you weigh in on Rev ASC 606 [ph], like when could we see Cisco introduce some guidance around that as well? Thank you. Kelly Kramer : Sure. So on the gross margin, I think we need to -- we will have an impact on the memory for the next couple of quarters coming up here for sure. I think the public information out there on what's happening with the supply, there are people that think that maybe eased up but you know, it's too hard to call; so I think that's going to be a headwind for us. I think the other parts of gross margin are continuing to --we're executing and managing those well like we always have on the cost savings side and managing price as well. So I think it's really the big question mark and the big headwind is the memory. On the RevRac [ph] change of ASC 606, we will be giving more color on that in our 10-K and kind of give you a feel of what some of the implications will be, so you will get more color in that and we'll try to quantify for you the impact from revenue and bottom line perspective. I will also just reference you back to -- I did have a page in the analyst conference deck laying out what of our offers would be impacted and what wouldn't be, the kind of to give you a feel along those lines as well to help you think throughout that but we'll give you progressively more details starting with RK [ph] coming up during a few weeks. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Kelly and thanks Mark, for the questions. Chuck why don't I turn it over to you to wrap it up. Charles Robbins : All right, thanks Marilyn, and thanks everybody for participating with us today. I think there are four key messages that I would part leave you with; first is that, this launch that we announced back about 8 weeks ago was the first of what I believe you should expect from us and just an ongoing cycle of innovation, and very positively received by the press, analysts, customers, partners, employees and I said when I took this job we're going to increase the pace of innovation and this is the first wave which you're going to see coming from us. And when you look at the innovation that was introduced particularly around the automation, around the new platform and the innovation we drove in the security capabilities, that's what you're going to see from us going forward. Secondly, I think with the -- our customers in the environments in which they are operating now, the network's never been more relevant. I talked about how they are building out their infrastructure in very distributive ways, they are managing hundreds of thousands of devices today and they have to be ready to manage a million or more by 2020 and I think that that is why this automation and analytics capability and the security built into the network is so important. The third is, if we continue to have our customers looking for us to help them really build out this secured intelligent platform that spans across this multi-cloud environment for their digital business and I think that our security results on the number of new customers embracing the technology I think is indicative of other buying into this new architecture. And then fourth, I would say that the strategy we've laid out, we're executing very well against. We're managing the business through this transition and when you look at the year that we just completed having record EPS, record cash flow, at the same time that we -- this past quarter increased the software and subscription deferred business, 50% to $5 billion, and so I'm very pleased with where our teams are, what our teams are doing, how we're executing and how we've increased the innovation and the response from our customers. So we look forward to talking to you all again next quarter and thanks for joining us today. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Chuck. I'm going to go ahead and provide some last closing remarks here. Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call which will reflect our fiscal 2018 first quarter results will be on Wednesday, November 15, 2017, at 1 :30 P.M. Pacific time, 4:30 P.M. Eastern time.

Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Operator : Welcome to the Cisco Systems First Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Financial Results Conference Call. At the request of Cisco Systems, today's call is being recorded. Now, I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's First Quarter Fiscal 2018 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. As a reminder, effective in Q1, we began reporting our revenue in the following categories : Infrastructure Platforms, Applications, Security, Other Products and Services. As discussed in our Q4 earnings call and in our October 23 press release, this change better aligns our product categories with our evolving business model. Our segments will continue to be based on geographies which consists of the Americas, EMEA, and APJC. So, this change only impacts how we report revenue by product category. We've include quarterly reclassified revenue amounts for the last three fiscal years on our website. Click on the financial reporting section of the website to access these statements. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements including the guidance we will be providing for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Form 10-K, which identifies important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thank you, Marilyn, and, good afternoon, everyone. Our results this quarter demonstrate the continued progress we're make on our strategic priorities. In Q1 we delivered a solid quarter with revenue of $12.1 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.61. We are seeing great traction with our new intent-based networking solutions, delivering accelerated innovation across our portfolio and offering a broader range of new consumption options to our customers, resulting in strong increases in our software and subscription revenue. The progress we've made resulted in all three of our geographic regions returning to orders growth during Q1. Cisco has always been about connecting people, information and machines at scale. Today, the network is becoming more pervasive and critical to business success as billions of new connections are added. We expect these new connections will become increasingly automated, intelligent and secure, delivering unprecedented insights and intelligence to our customers. Cisco's vision is to deliver highly secure intuitive technology across our portfolio that is designed to constantly learn, adapt and protect to drive business outcomes with greater speed and agility. This extends to the network, next generation data center architectures, advanced IoT applications end-to-end analytics and our Collaboration technologies. Our vision is resonating with customers and partners around the world as we help them build more secure intelligent platforms for their digital businesses. Today, most of our customers are operating in complex, multi-cloud environments and Cisco is well positioned to provide them with networking capabilities, enterprise class security and support together with cloud scale, agility and economics. Our new partnership with Google is a good example of this. Over the last few months our engineering teams have been working closely together to jointly develop a new hybrid cloud solution that is designed to enable applications and services to be deployed, managed and secured across on-premise environments, as well as Google Cloud Platform, bringing the best of cloud to the enterprise. This partnership is an example of the work we are doing with all of the large web-scale providers. We're also investing to develop and acquire new technologies to extend our Multicloud Portfolio. This includes ACI anywhere, which we announced this quarter and acquisitions such as CliQr, OpenDNS, Cloudlock, AppDynamics and Viptela. Now I'd like to cover some key business highlights in our new product reporting categories. First, let's start with Infrastructure Platforms. Our launch of The Network. Intuitive. in June is an example of the investment and innovation we're driving in our core business. These new intent-based networking capabilities are providing customers' unparalleled insights and intelligence, together with highly-differentiated security and programmability. Our new subscription-based Catalyst 9000 switching platform has been adopted by more than 1,100 customers in just over three months. We expect continued momentum throughout fiscal 2018, and we're pleased that the vast majority of Catalyst 9000 customers are buying our most advanced software subscription offer. Additionally, we saw a good performance in our next-generation data center switching platforms as customers continue to shift to 10 gig, 40 gig and 100 gig architectures and embrace multi-cloud adoption. We continue to advance our intent-based networking for data center and private cloud environments with the latest software release of ACI. Over 4,000 ACI customers are benefiting from increased business agility with network automation, simplified management and improved security. Going forward, we see a tremendous opportunity to benefit from a shift in customer demand from stand-alone products to integrated platforms with our intent-based infrastructure portfolio providing unmatched benefits. Now turning to applications. Applications are absolutely central to every digital business strategy. To maximize their effectiveness, companies require a highly-secure network that closely monitors applications and workload performance across a complex multi-cloud environment. Our acquisition of AppDynamics is core to our capability of providing end-to-end analytics, from the network to the data center to the application. Within our Applications business, we are enabling new capabilities based on advanced AI and machine learning across our portfolio. An example of this is our acquisition of Perspica, providing deep machine learning driven analytics to further extend AppDynamics' leading capabilities in application intelligence. Additionally, we announced our latest innovation on the Cisco Spark platform, Spark Assistant, which is the world's first enterprise-ready, AI-powered voice assistant to further enhance our customers' meeting experience. Our intended acquisition of BroadSoft will enhance our subscription and cloud-based business. BroadSoft has 19 million subscribers in the growing cloud voice and contact center space and will enable Cisco to offer an even broader portfolio of collaboration solutions to our customers, on-premise and in the cloud. We expect this acquisition to accelerate the pace of innovation in our Collaboration business and we see many opportunities to extend the reach of the BroadSoft portfolio. Moving to Security. With an expanding threat landscape, cybersecurity is the number one priority for businesses worldwide and is at the heart of every company's digital strategy. In a multi-cloud world, as our customers' environments become increasingly distributed, security requirements only increase. At Cisco, security continues to be a strategic imperative and fundamental to everything we do. As customers adopt and advance intent-based networking, our end-to-end security is the foundation to keep our customers protected from advanced threats. This architecture, combined with the best-of-breed portfolio across the network, endpoint and cloud, enables our customers to reduce the time to detection, as well as complexity and cost. As a result, we believe Cisco is delivering the most effective and comprehensive security solutions in the market. This differentiated strategy drove the 8% revenue growth in our Security portfolio, and we also saw continued momentum in our Security deferred revenue, with 42% growth. To summarize, we delivered a solid quarter as we continue to execute well against our strategic priorities. I firmly believe that Cisco is well positioned to capture long-term growth opportunities ahead. We remain focused on providing our customers with the most innovative portfolio of offerings in the industry, powered by intent-based capabilities and delivered through a range of consumption models providing more flexibility than ever before. Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more detail on our financials. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by the Q2 outlook. Total revenue was $12.1 billion, down 2%. We continue to focus on driving margins and profitability, with non-GAAP operating margin of 30.4%. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.61 and operating cash flow was strong, growing 13% to $3.1 billion. The role of enterprise IT is dramatically changing with the move to an application-centric focus and adoption of hybrid cloud architectures, with customers increasingly seeing the value of integrated platforms over standalone products. Cisco's intent-driven architecture with a focus on simplicity, automation and security allows enterprises to manage and govern the interactions of users, devices and applications across the environment. Starting in Q1, to better reflect these shifts we've changed our product reporting categories which are now Infrastructure Platforms, Applications, Security, Other Products and Services. So let me give you a little bit more detail on our Q1 revenue. Total product revenue was down 3%, Infrastructure Platforms declined 4%, with the vast majority of the decline driven by routing products. This was driven by continued weakness in service provider and a slowdown in enterprise routing. Our switching revenue was down modestly but we saw good momentum on orders in campus switching with The Network. Intuitive. launch. Additionally, we did see continued strong wireless revenue performance and solid uptake of our HyperFlex data center offering. Let's move on to Applications. To remind you, Applications is made up of our Collaboration portfolio of Unified Communications, Conferencing and TelePresence as well as our IoT and application software businesses such as AppDynamics and Jasper. Applications increased 6% in total, with Collaboration up modestly and AppDynamics driving most of the increase. We did see strong growth in deferred revenue of 18%. There was also a strong increase in the unbilled deferred, which is not on the balance sheet, bringing the combined total of deferred revenue plus unbilled deferred up 32%. Security was up 8% with strong performance in unified threat, advanced threat and web security, and deferred revenue grew 42% as we continued to drive more subscription-based software offers. Service revenue was up 1% driven by growth in software and solutions services. During the quarter, we introduced a new portfolio of subscription offers called Business Critical and High Value Services powered by AI to predict future IT failures before they happen. We drove good growth in deferred revenue, which was up 10% in total, with product up 16% and services up 5%. Deferred product revenue from our recurring software and subscription offers was up 37% to $5.2 billion. We continue to transform our business delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions and recurring revenues. In Q1, we generated 32% of our total revenue from recurring offers, an increase of over 3 points from a year ago. Revenue from software subscriptions was 52% of our software revenue. In terms of orders in Q1, total products orders grew 1%. Looking at our geographies, Americas grew 1%, EMEA was up 2% and APJC grew 1%. Total emerging markets declined 6% with the BRICs less Mexico also down 9%. In our customer segment, enterprise declined 5%, commercial grew 12%, public sector was up 3% and service provider declined 6%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q1 gross margin was 63.7%, down 1.5 points. Product gross margin was 63.0%, down 1.8 points and service gross margin was 65.6%, down 0.6 points. We continue to be negatively impacted by higher memory pricing like we've discussed over the past several calls, which we expect to continue in the near term. Our operating margin was 30.4%, down 1.2 points. When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our results year-over-year, there's been a 60 basis point positive impact on revenue, no impact on gross margin, a 3 point increase on non-GAAP operating expenses, all resulting in a negative 70 basis point impact on our non-GAAP operating margin rate and a negative $0.01 year-over-year impact on our non-GAAP EPS. In terms of the bottom line, our Q1 non-GAAP EPS was $0.61 while GAAP EPS was $0.48. We ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $71.6 billion with $2.5 billion available in the U.S. Q1 operating cash flow had very strong growth of 13% at $3.1 billion and free cash flow was also very strong with growth of 19% to $2.9 billion. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $3.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter that included $1.6 billion of share repurchases and $1.4 billion for our quarterly dividend. To summarize, in Q1, we continued to make progress on our strategic growth priorities while maintaining rigorous discipline on profitability and cash generation. We continued to prioritize our key investments to drive long-term profitable growth. Let me reiterate our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier, and also as Chuck mentioned, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire BroadSoft. The acquisition is expected to close after completion of the customary regulatory reviews and therefore it is not included in the guidance. We expect revenue growth in the range of 1% to 3% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 62.5% to 63.5%. And the non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29.5% to 30.5% and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.58 to $0.60. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into Q&A. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Kelly. Mark, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. And of course while Mark is doing that, I'd like to go ahead and remind the audience that we ask you to ask one question so that we have plenty of time for others in the audience to address questions to Chuck and Kelly. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. Your line is open. Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you for taking my question. Kelly, I can't help asking you an update on gross margin movement. So, can you give us a bit of a sense of how big is memory prices in the 1.5 point gross margin decline that you've seen year on year? And then sequentially, your guide for gross margin for Q2 is slightly below what you've been guiding for Q1. Is there still like incremental headwind coming from component pricing hurting you from the Q1 to Q2? Thank you. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes. Thanks, Pierre. Great question. Yes, so the vast majority of the impact on our gross margin is driven by memory. It is basically 1.3 points of my product gross margin decline year over year. Everything else in our gross margin is basically in the normal ranges. So we expect that to continue. When you look at the guidance, we did bring it down 0.5 point to account for that because we are still seeing increases as we look forward \u2013 moving forward, but otherwise we kind of see everything else in the normal range of things. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Pierre. Let's go ahead and take the next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with Barclays Capital. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. Chuck, you talked about 1,100 customers have already adopted the intuitive network [The Network. Intuitive.]. I just want to get a sense in terms of how does that underpin longer term the steady state growth? You guys guided to about 1% to 3% growth for the current quarter but as more and more of those customers adopt and they move beyond the labs, move beyond the proof of concept, could we actually see your growth tick higher than 1% to 3% on a steady state? Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes, Mark. Thanks for the question. So clearly, we're pleased with where we're going right now with this product portfolio. We're pleased with the early feedback. I'll tell you that our sales teams, our partners and our customers are very excited about the architecture that we've announced. It's still one quarter. So we have to get a little more time under our belt but what I will tell you is that when we look back at a transition like the 3850 years and years ago, it's very much in line. And I think that as more customers have the opportunity to test the automation and programmability and all of the software features that they're testing right now, we would hope that the platform continues to accelerate. So one quarter down but we feel good about where we are. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Chuck. Let's go ahead and take the next question, Mark. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS Securities. Steven Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Yes. To continue along those lines, Chuck, you talked a little bit about the software attach rate. Could you elaborate on that? And particularly the Advantage premium, which I think has the encryption capability and so forth, exactly what sort of mix are you seeing? And do you think that customers are going be willing to pay up for the premium? Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Well, thanks, Steve. So what I said in the script is that a vast majority of our customers that are buying these platforms are opting for the advanced and I would say that it's a vast majority. We knew when we introduced a subscription on a switch that we needed to ensure that there was unique innovation that was available to our customers in order for them to see value in that. We couldn't just simply shift the capabilities that they had gotten before in a perpetual model. We needed to drive new innovation. So the anchors that are in that advanced subscription are the overall automation capability, which really gets at the OpEx of running these networks. And the second part is the encrypted traffic analytics where we can determine when there's malware inside encrypted traffic without decrypting it. And we think that those two are phenomenal incremental capabilities that our customers didn't have before and I think that's why we're seeing such a high attach rate. So we're very pleased with where we are on that as well. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Next question. Operator : Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank Securities. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. Hey. Good afternoon, Chuck, Kelly. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Hey, Vijay. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Hey, Vijay. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. Hi, Chuck. Yes, my question for you, Chuck, and Kelly please join in is has anything changed in your sales motion in terms of data center switching? And the reason I ask is we are starting to see this positive news flow Alibaba Cloud recently and perhaps you're in Microsoft as well. What has changed in your view, Chuck, in terms of the sales motion? Is it the clouds paying attention to things like software automation, tools, security, anything else? Or is it just a sales focus on cloud? Help us understand. Thanks. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: So, Vijay, thanks for the question. We've been talking about this for several calls now, about how we reengaged with the large web scale providers back right after I became CEO. And these are long processes as they made major architectural decisions and they have franchises that you're trying to reenter. But if you look at \u2013 whether it's the announcements we made with Microsoft a couple of quarters ago, the announcement we made with Google, you alluded to Alibaba, which there's a summary of that win on our website if you want to go see that. It's our first insertion there, and actually it was before the large sales day that they experienced I think last week. And so we continue to make progress and we're continuing to execute on what I told you that we're executing on over the last year and a half, which is trying to go deeper. I think the other thing that has become eminently clear is that these large web scale providers realize that it is going be a multi-cloud world and they definitely have come to the conclusion that the edge is going be mission critical for our customers going forward. And as they think about that, we are very natural \u2013 we're the very natural partner for them to partner with as the network is the only common denominator across all these cloud environments all the way out to the edge of our enterprise customer's network. So we're just continuing to execute against what we set out two years ago and we hope to continue to see success. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Chuck. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Silverstein with Cowen and Company. Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen and Company, LLC: Hey, Chuck and Kelly, I recognize you guys are no longer breaking it out but I'm hoping that you'll throw us a bone and put numbers on the data center switching revenue growth given how important it is and how strong a growth market that's been. And as part of that, Chuck, related to the previous question, can you give us any quantification of your progress with the web 2.0 hyperscale customer segment given the importance of that segment? Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes, so, Paul, yes, I mean, obviously we're trying to go to new groupings. But \u2013 and just to give you some color, I mean, we continue to see the double-digit growth that we've been talking about of our ACI portfolio continue in the strong double digits. And overall data center was certainly up from a revenue perspective. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: And I think, Paul, from a perspective of the web scale, it's really just what I described. We're in discussions with all of them. We have made announcements with several of them. And we continue to execute against our strategy and it's \u2013 \u2013 these are large franchises. There's two facets. And if you remember on a call back two or three calls back, I said that we're now expanding our discussions into 360-degree relationship discussions. The Google announcement was reflective of that comment, because not only are we working on their infrastructure but we're also working significantly on this multi-cloud enablement, hybrid cloud enablement and helping bridge our customers, their premises-based solutions, their edge-based solutions, their cloud applications, their SaaS applications. And so we're continuing to execute on that right now. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Paul, for the question. Next question, Mark? Operator : Our next question is from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer & Company. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. And hi and congrats on a good quarter and nice to see growth on the guide. I had a couple things, first of all for you Kelly, can you update us on the number of Cisco ONE customers, just as a housekeeping? And then for you, Chuck, getting a little bit deeper into the Infrastructure part of the business, great color there on the product lines but maybe you can help us fine tune a couple of things. One on the hyperconverged, I think Kelly actually mentioned that you were off to a good start there, but maybe you can help us understand where you stand on that product line, how good you feel about the platform, how stable it is. And then the weakness in the enterprise routing, I'm just trying to understand how much of it is a secular issue, meaning SD-WAN starting to make an impact there versus an execution or seasonal element. Is this going be another part of your business that's just going to be under pressure for a long time as routing has been? Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Kelly, do you want to...? Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes, I'll just hit the Cisco ONE. Cisco ONE continues to have great momentum. We're over 22,000 customers at this point with that so still great momentum. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes, Ittai, so thanks for your comments by the way. On the hyperconverged offer, our HyperFlex offer, I would tell you that it has continued to probably be at the high end of my expectations. I'd say couple of quarters ago it began to exceed what I was expecting so I changed my expectations and it's \u2013 but they're doing a great job. The teams are doing well. I think we know the use cases where it's very competitive and I think that it continues to \u2013 they continue to operate at the high end of what I expected from them. So we're very pleased with that. On the question relative to SD-WAN, I think you nailed it right. Our customers \u2013 and we've talked about this for a couple of calls \u2013 our customers have been trying to assess what this SD-WAN architectural transition looks like. And I think that after we acquired Viptela, we have now \u2013 at our sales meeting we provided tremendous clarity to our sales organization and our partner community at the Partner Summit about what our strategy is. We've now taken customers through the road maps of what they can expect and how to position the different alternatives that we have and how those portfolios are going to come together over the next 12 to 18 months. So I think that it is a by-product of the SD-WAN discussion. And I would expect that we'll start to see customers move somewhat this quarter and then in the second half of the year, I think our customers will continue to begin to deploy some of these solutions. So, again, happy with where we are relative to the positioning of the different platforms. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Next question, please. Operator : Our next question is from George Notter with Jefferies. George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC : Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I guess I was curious about the revenue headwind associated with the move to subscription models including Cisco ONE. Can you remind us what you wound up seeing in terms of a headwind in the October quarter? And then also what are you assuming for January? Thanks a lot. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes, hey, George. Thanks for the question. Yes, right now we're still seeing it around that 2% range. We expect the headwind to grow once we continue to grow the intuitive network [The Network. Intuitive.] that has a subscription. As that grows, that'll grow. But right now it's in that 2% range \u2013 1.5% to 2% range, and we expect that to be roughly in that range next quarter as well. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Mark, let's go ahead and tee up the next question. Operator : Our next question is from Tal Liani with Bank of America Securities Merrill Lynch. Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. My question is almost a follow up to the previous question. Can you elaborate? I know you started at the beginning of the year to do the subscription on switching. Can you elaborate on, first of all, the experience you've had so far, cases where customers took the subscription versus didn't take, what does it include? Just elaborate on the subscription and kind of the profile of it and also the take rate so far and whether you need to make any changes to it in order to improve take rates, et cetera. I'm just trying to understand the implications for future years. Thanks. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes. So, Tal, thanks for the question. Let me break it down. So the advanced subscription today is primarily being sold on the new Catalyst 9000, even though it's backwards compatible with a couple of years' worth of our \u2013 I don't know, two, three years' worth of products that we've shipped in wireless and in routing, et cetera. But what the customers are doing right now is they're basically becoming accustomed to the platform. They're testing the platform before they make an investment on any sort of backwards compatibility, is what I would tell you. I don't think we need to make any changes right now because the attach rate of the most advanced subscription offer is at the very high end of what I would have expected. So I think we're very pleased with where it is right now. And assuming we execute on the value and the innovation that our customers continue to gain from that, then I think that we'll begin to see them then buy the subscriptions on some of their install base as well. That would be our intent. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: And just to add to that and just to be clear, 100% of the switches we're selling come with a subscription. It's just the difference in what additional features and security are added between the Advantage and the Essentials. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: That's right. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: So 100% of the new switches are sold with a subscription and that's going well. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: All right. Let's go ahead and tee up the next question. Operator : Our next question is from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to focus on the Security angle. So despite having pretty difficult comparisons last year, you're still up 8%. So could you maybe provide some color what's going well there? And then secondly, any sort of growth rates or rough numbers for the advanced threat versus the web security growth rates? Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Mitch. So I think that the thing that is resonating with the customer is if you're looking at the environments that they're all beginning to operate in, they're operating in an environment where they have multiple SaaS providers, multiple cloud providers. They've got their private data centers with applications running. They've got their branch networks. They've got now edge connectivity with IoT coming in. And so, the robustness of an architecture that they have to have that protects across the network, across the endpoint, across the cloud is really what I think is differentiating it. And we've also \u2013 we've been on a multiyear journey of selling software and subscriptions against the threat intelligence and the malware intelligence that we have, and I think that's what's continuing to pay off. So I think it's resonating with our customers and it's an architecture that we continue to innovate on, we continue to expand on. And, Kelly, any comments on the...? Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes. I mean, I'd just say advanced threat and unified threat, as well as even web security, they're all up big double digits. I mean, just really strong growth. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Mitch. Mark, let's go ahead and take the next question. Operator : Next question is from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley Investment Research. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. I wanted to ask a question on capital structure. Can you give us an idea of what your preference is and priorities will be in capital structure in terms of buybacks and acquisitions, et cetera, if the proposed new tax changes pass versus if that change in tax law gets derailed? I mean, particularly curious as to how you're thinking about the pacing of acquisitions versus buybacks, et cetera? Thank you. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes. I'll take that one. What I'd say is in terms of acquisitions, the tax policy isn't impacting us either way, because we are lucky to have a great cash flow and access to capital. So it hasn't been stopping us from anything from an acquisition perspective. And it won't, so that will continue. I would say we're definitely encouraged by the progress that's going on on the tax reform. So like we said in the past, when that happens, and if we get a repatriation, which both plans currently have, we're going to continue like we have, growing our dividend with our earnings growth and where we have opportunity is really to get much more aggressive than we have been on the share buyback. And, of course, we want to make sure we continue to have enough fire power to continue to be able to do the right acquisitions to help us position Cisco right for the long term. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James & Associates. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you very much. I wanted to see if you could give us a little bit more insight into what you would attribute the outlook to in terms of this is the first quarter with year-over-year growth we've seen in quite some time. So I'm wondering if we attribute it to an easy comparison or lapping the buildup of deferred revenue, or some specific product cycle. If you could help us assess the key elements bringing you back to year-over-year growth. Thank you. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Kelly, do you want to take...? Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes. Sure. I mean, I'll give you some color. I'd say it's a combination of things, right? I mean, if I go to the amount of revenue coming off the balance sheet from the progress we've been steadily making on growing our software and subscriptions, it's now up to 12% of our product revenue. It's now coming from recurring offers and off the balance sheet, so that's helping. I would say also the launch that we had on The Intuitive. Network. and the excitement around the reinvention of the core is having an impact. So we're encouraged and you've heard me mention, we're seeing positive demand momentum in campus switching overall, which is great, and that has a big impact, because it's one of the biggest pieces of our portfolio. So that, combined with pretty good orders like we had in Q1, gives us a very good backlog position that allows us to have a good view into what the next quarter looks like. So I'd say, overall, the overall strategy, what we've been executing and talking about for the last couple of years here is we've been making progress and all of this is benefiting us in the outlook. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes. James, just to clarify one point or just add to actually, when Kelly says 12% of our product revenue is coming from recurring offers, just to put that in perspective, when I became CEO it was 6%, so we've effectively doubled that. And I think that's certainly helpful, and just we're seeing positive feedback on the launch. So, I'm sorry that was Simon. I apologize, Simon. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Simon. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question is from Jeffrey Kvaal with Nomura Securities International. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Jeff? Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Instinet : Oh. Yes. Sorry. I'm on mute. Pardon me. Yes. I was hoping to ask about competition in the enterprise switching space, and we've seen a little bit more out of Huawei perhaps, not in the U.S. of course but international. I'm wondering if you could put some of that color into context for us, both from them and also from some of your traditional rivals. Thank you. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: In the enterprise switching? Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes, enterprise. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: So, thanks for the question, Jeff. I think that if you look at some of the performance we saw around the world, to your point, in Europe and Asia we've talked about Huawei's activity over the last couple of quarters, I would say that our teams have been very focused on it. I think that the intuitive network [The Network. Intuitive.] launch that we did in June really changes the discussion. And where we compete with competitors who their value prop is up front cost of the hardware, I think we're changing the discussion, because if you look at the cost of operating this infrastructure over a five-year period, it's probably 10X the cost of the upfront hardware. So going and helping our customers really reduce that is a value proposition that helps us change the discussion relative to the competition. So they continue to be very tough but we think that competing on the price of the box upfront is something that we can shift over the next couple of years. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Chuck. We'll go ahead and take the next question. Operator : Our next question is from Erik Suppiger with JBM (sic) [JMP] Securities. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Yes. Thank you. And it was good to see Security picking up. What are your expectations for Security growth? In the past, you've talked about driving double-digit growth on the Security side. Is that still a goal? And where do you think you are in terms of getting there? Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes, Erik, thanks for that. So at our Financial Analyst Conference this summer, we articulated a long range guide in line with what you just described. We're going to have quarters that are going to vary from that but that's definitely our long-term objective. And I think our teams are focused now on what is it we need to do for the next wave of this architecture? Once we have this architecture built where we can actually defend and apply real-time defense against known threats, we can learn about a threat through malware and e-mail, and we can protect against it in the network, in the cloud, in the devices at the endpoint all at the same time. So the teams are working hard to continue to drive innovation there but also looking at what other elements can we fit into this architecture over time. And I think that's how we think about the long-term guide. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Thank you. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Next question. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Next question, please. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of James Suva with Citigroup Global Markets. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks, Chuck and Kelly. It's Jim Suva from Citi. On your guidance of up 1% to 3% as you talked about earlier, it's the first time you guys have seen year-over-year revenue growth for quite a long time. Kelly and Chuck, you mentioned strength in the orders and also the subscription model taking traction. Are we now at a point where shift to subscription is no longer dragging down year-over-year comps? Or is that still a bit of a challenge and the orders that Chuck mentioned are just so much stronger? And Chuck, any end market areas we should think about for that order strength? Thank you so much. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes, I'll take the first part. I'd say no. We're still, I'd say, growing the base of the offers faster and putting it on the balance sheet than it's coming off. But, again, both the year-over-year increase of the balance, the $5.2 billion was up 37% and my income statement was up 37% as well. But I'm still putting more and more offers and as we get scale through the core networking, not just on switching but the whole DNA Center, I think that'll continue to add. So it's still going be a headwind. And as I said before, this 1.5 to 2 points will move to more like a 2 to 3 points in the upcoming years as we get more scale there. So more to come but, again, we're again benefiting from \u2013 we're starting to see the benefit of just having more stability and being able to have a better line of sight and less massive fluctuations by having that. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: And, Jim, just the market segment perspective that is probably pretty clear. We saw service provider pretty much the same as it has been for some period of time. Our largest enterprise customers, which the way we define it is really just is an organizational segment that we have. We did see \u2013 we saw negative mid single digits there, which you saw in the slides. In our commercial business, we saw 12% growth on a global basis and it was double digits in every geography, which is always good to see. Our enterprise customers what I would tell you is that they're some of the biggest customers who take the longest amount of time to evaluate new platforms and new capabilities like The Network. Intuitive. as well as this whole SD-WAN discussion. So we're actively in those discussions with the enterprise customers. And our commercial customers tend to just move more quickly than others. And then finally, on the public sector side, which we didn't talk about a lot, I think the big call out there I would say is that two quarters ago we talked about the pressure in the federal business. Last quarter we said we saw it improving and what I would tell you is that in this quarter we saw the year-end it seemed fairly normal. While they still have a lot of leadership roles that haven't been filled and we still have the impending December debt ceiling issue overall for this quarter we saw the federal business pretty much back to what we expected as we closed the quarter. So that's probably the commentary I could provide on the market segments. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Okay. I think we are... Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Well, that's it, isn't it? Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes. We are going to wrap up. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Okay. I'll wrap it. Thanks, everyone again for joining us today. I just want to wrap with a few points. First off, we are committed to executing on this vision to deliver a highly secure intelligent platform for our customers' digital business. And we are laser focused on five key elements of that strategy to enable our customers' success and drive profitable growth for us and shareholder value as well. First, we are fundamentally reinventing networking with our intent-based networking platform. We intend to further accelerate our leadership here extending intuitive technologies across the broad portfolio that we have while increasing application, visibility and automation. Secondly, security is fundamental to everything we do. You can't build a next generation digital business without a comprehensive security strategy across endpoints, network and the cloud. Third, it is very clear that it's a multi-cloud world, and Cisco is in a unique position to help our customers navigate this by expanding our multi-cloud portfolio and extending our web scale partnerships with strategic cloud providers. Our Google partnership is an example of the work we are doing with all of the large web scale providers. Fourth, we're unlocking the power of the data with advanced analytics such as our solutions AppDynamics, encrypted traffic analytics and Talos threat intelligence. We're also embedding AI and machine learning technologies across the breadth of our portfolio. And lastly, we will continue to deliver a more enhanced customer and employee experience through our broad Collaboration portfolio including our intent to acquire BroadSoft. Marilyn, I'll turn it back over to you. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Chuck.

As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that I'll now turn it over to Chuck. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thank you, Marilyn, and good afternoon everyone. We had a great quarter. In Q2, we returned to revenue growth. We continued to drive momentum in our intent-based networking portfolio and saw strength across the business. We made continued progress in shifting more of our business towards software and subscriptions. This performance led to strong margins, solid cash flow, and double digit non-GAAP EPS growth. We are clearly seeing the results of the strategy we've articulated to you over the last ten quarters. We also increased the dividend and share repurchase authorization, reinforcing the confidence we have in our future. As we shared with you previously, customers are facing ever increasing complexity in their IT environments with the proliferation of devices in IoT, the adoption of multiple clouds, and the exponential growth of security threats. The network has never been more critical to business success because of its ability to simplify this complexity while enabling real-time informed business decisions. This is why Cisco is well position for the future as we help our customers move to highly secure and intelligent platforms for their digital businesses. Now let me take you through what I'm seeing across the business and how Cisco's innovation is driving momentum across the portfolio. First let's start with infrastructure platforms. We continue to be intensely focused on delivering differentiated innovation in our core which has resulted in our return to revenue growth this quarter. Last June, we launched The Network. Intuitive., a fundamental reinvention of networking and the industry's leading intent-based networking portfolio. Two weeks ago we announced the next phase of this intent-based network innovation with powerful assurance capability spanning across our data center, campus, and wireless portfolios. These will help our customers unlock the power of network data that will bring greater insights and visibility with rich predictive analytics. We saw strong adoption of our subscription-based Catalyst 9000 switching platform as we more than doubled our customer base from last quarter to over 3,100 customers. This is the fastest ramping new product introductions we have had in our history and a fantastic example of the innovation we've delivered over the past two years. When I became CEO, I challenged our team to increase the pace of innovation in this space and I could not be more proud of what they've accomplished. The network is also a key enabler for our customers as they increasingly adopt a multi-cloud strategy. They need a unified, automated and scalable environment across their data centers, private clouds, and public clouds. Cisco's cloud management analytics, automation and security combined with strategic partnerships such as Microsoft and Google position us very well to meet customer needs. Further extending our cloud-focused software offers, we recently introduced a Cisco Container Platform to simplify the deployment of cloud native applications and containers with Kubernetes. This marks an important milestone in our partnership with Google to deliver the future hybrid cloud architecture. In general, we are encouraged with the overall progress we are making with the web-scale community. Now turning to security. Cybersecurity continues to be a top concern for customers as they evolve their enterprise architectures to address the challenges of a pervasive threat environment. We are leading the security industry with an integrated architecture and a comprehensive best-of-breed portfolio across the network, endpoint, and cloud. This approach enables us to share context, intelligence, visibility and policy to reduce the time to detect and respond to threats. We expanded our endpoint protection capabilities with Cisco Security Connector, a unique security application designed to give enterprises the deepest visibility and control over network activity on iOS devices. Together with Apple, we are helping our joint customers become the most connected, collaborative and secure organizations in the world. Additionally, Cisco, Apple, Allianz and Aon are collaborating on an industry-first cyber risk management solution which integrates technology, services and enhanced cyber insurance to make businesses more resilient. Now moving to Applications. The future of applications will unlock the power of trillions of terabytes of data across connected users, things and devices. In today's digital world, we are executing on our strategy to transition more of our business to cloud-based subscriptions and driving increased relevance at the application layer of the stack to enable a better experience for our customers. We continue to see progress in scaling AppDynamics' analytics capabilities. Over 20% of our top 500 global enterprise accounts have already adopted this technology. This is another example of our ability to scale acquisitions through our unparalleled go-to-market model. We also closed the BroadSoft acquisition earlier this month, which provides us with access to its strong user base of 20 million and greatly strengthens our cloud-based collaboration subscription portfolio. To summarize, I'm very pleased with the traction we're seeing in our business, the progress we're making against our strategy, and I'm very optimistic about our future. I'd also just like to say how incredibly proud I am of Cisco's leadership in environmental, social and governance issues, including the work we're doing to help solve the global skills gap. Our recent recognition by Barron's as the number one most sustainable company in the United States underscores our deep commitment to enable a better world in which everyone has the opportunity to thrive. Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more details on our financials. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by a discussion of the impact of tax reform and then end with Q3 guidance. Q2 was a strong quarter with results exceeding our expectations. We executed well in a number of areas, including good orders momentum, solid revenue growth and strong margins and cash flow. Total revenue was $11.9 billion, up 3%. Non-GAAP net income was $3.1 billion, up 10% and non-GAAP EPS was $0.63, up 11%. Operating cash flow grew 8% to $4.1 billion with free cash flow up 10%. We continued to focus on driving margins and profitability, increasing our non-GAAP operating margin rate to 31.7%, up 0.7 points. Let me provide some more detail on our Q2 revenue. Total products revenue was up 3%. Infrastructure Platforms returned to growth, up 2% with broad strength across the businesses. Within switching, we had strong growth in data center switching and we're seeing great momentum with our new campus switch, the Cat 9000. We also had strong wireless growth driven by our Wave 2 offerings and Meraki. Data center was up double digits driven by server products as well as our HyperFlex offerings. These increases were partially offset by a modest decline in our routing products driven by continued weakness in service provider. Let's move on to Applications. Applications is made up of our collaboration portfolio of unified communications, conferencing and TelePresence as well as our IoT and application software businesses, Jasper and AppDynamics. Applications was up 6% in total with strength in TelePresence and conferencing as well as AppDynamics offset by some weakness in UC endpoints. There was also a strong increase in deferred revenue, up 18%. Security was up 6% with strong performance in unified threat and web security. Deferred revenue grew 38% as we continue to drive more subscription-based software offers. Service revenue was up 3% driven by growth in software and solutions support. We continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions and recurring revenues. In Q2, we generated 33% of our total revenue from recurring offers, an increase of 2 points from a year ago. Revenue from subscriptions was 52% of our software revenue. We drove good growth in deferred revenue, which was up 10% in total, with product up 19% and services up 4%. Deferred revenue, product revenue from our recurring software and subscription offers was $5.5 billion, up 36%. We saw strong momentum in Q2 product orders, growing 5% in total. Looking at our geographies, Americas grew 6%, EMEA was up 6% and APJC was flat. Total emerging markets was up 1% with the BRICs plus Mexico down 1%. In our customer segments, enterprise was up 3%, commercial grew 14%, public sector was up 8% and service provider declined 5%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q2 gross margin was 64.7%, up 0.6 points. Product gross margin was 63.3%, up 0.9 points and service gross margin was 68.5%, down 0.3 points. We continue to be negatively impacted by the higher memory pricing we have discussed over the past several calls which we expect to continue in the near term. Our operating margin was 31.7%, up 0.7 points. When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our results year-over-year, there's been an 80 basis point positive impact on revenue and a negative $0.01 year-over-year impact on our non-GAAP EPS. In terms of the bottom line, our Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $0.63, up 11%. GAAP EPS was a loss of $1.78 driven by the one-time charges related to U.S. tax reform. We're very pleased with the tax rate reduction related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Since our fiscal year ends in July, we won't realize the full benefit this year but we will start to realize that full years' worth in fiscal year 2019. For Q2, our non-GAAP tax rate was 20% to adjust to our full-year estimated non-GAAP tax rate of 21%. We are currently forecasting our estimated non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal year 2019 to be 20%. This quarter we incurred an $11.1 billion charge to our income tax provision that is comprised of $9 billion related to the U.S. transition tax, $1.2 billion of foreign withholding tax and $0.9 billion for the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets related with the lower tax rate. Our Q2 GAAP tax rate includes the impact of this charge while our non-GAAP rate excludes it. We ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $73.7 billion with $2.4 billion available in the U.S. We plan on repatriating $67 billion of our offshore funds to the U.S. in Q3 of fiscal year 2018. Q2 operating cash flow of $4.1 billion reflects strong growth of 8%. Free cash flow was also very strong with growth of 10% to $3.9 billion. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $5.4 billion to shareholders during the quarter that included $4 billion of share repurchases and $1.4 billion for our quarterly dividend. Today we announced a $0.04 increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.33 per share, up 14% year-over-year. This represents a yield of approximately 3.1% based on today's closing price. We also announced a $25 billion increase to the authorization of the share repurchase program. This raises the remaining share repurchase authorization to approximately $31 billion. We expect to utilize this over the next 18 to 24 months. This significant dividend increase and additional share repurchase authorization reinforces our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. To summarize, Q2 was a strong quarter with solid top-line growth, strong profitability, cash flows and order growth. We continue to make solid progress on our strategic priorities, making key investments to drive our long-term growth. Let me reiterate our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We closed the acquisition of BroadSoft in early Q3, and the impact of the acquisition is factored into our guidance. We expect revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29.5% to 30.5%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 21%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.64 to $0.66 cents. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Kelly. Kim, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. And while Kim is doing that, I'd like to go ahead and remind the audience that we ask that you ask one question so that we have plenty of time for others in the audience to address a question to both Chuck and Kelly. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank Securities. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. Good afternoon. Yes. Hi, Chuck, Kelly. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Hi, Vijay. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Hey, Vijay. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes, hi. So my question is around intent-based. Chuck and Kelly, please join in. It just seems like it's resonating with your customers. Is this mostly a U.S. phenomenon, Chuck? Or are your overseas customers also looking into intent-based? And then how do you see intent-based kind of catching across the portfolio? Why not extend intent-based across the broader portfolio? Thank you. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes, it's a great question, Vijay. First of all, we're incredibly pleased with the early acceptance of this intent-based portfolio. I called out in my opening comments that this Catalyst 9000 is the fastest ramping product in our history, which is pretty impressive. I'd say it's fairly balanced across the geographic regions, probably pretty much in line with what percentage of the business they represent. But Kelly can validate that in just a moment. What I would tell you is that we have 3,100 customers who have adopted this platform. We obviously have the opportunity and we will extend the capabilities across the rest of our portfolio so that our customers who are driving automation can drive it across not only campus switching, but also routing, bringing the Viptela SD-WAN capabilities to play. We are integrating it backwards with ACI in the data center as well as within our security portfolio. So our strategy is to continue to enhance our customers' ability to drive intent across all of their technology areas as well as to gain context through analytics out of all of their technologies. So 3,100 customers so far. I think our total customer population is well over 800,000, so we obviously have room to run. And we also have seen it, I'd say, from a segment perspective, the commercial marketplace has been a great adopter of the technology. And what I would tell you is that the enterprises have been evaluating it because it represents a different architectural approach with automation and analytics and security built into the network. So, Kelly, comments on those. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: No, just to add to that, you're correct. I mean the geography is split kind of in proportion, as you would expect. And across commercial, enterprise and public sector, it's fairly balanced as well. So it's just very broad-based adoption across the board. And again, we're very happy about the adoption of the more advanced software package on the Advantage. It's very heavily weighted towards that. So we're excited about that. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Kelly. We'll go ahead and take the next question. Operator : The next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. I wanted to follow up on Vijay's question, particularly as it relates to the 9000. Some of the people that we've talked to have indicated that availability of the 9000 may be a little bit limited. I'm just wondering how and over what timeframe you may be able to address that. And I guess as part of that, what are you seeing in terms of attach rates of additional services to the 9000? And are those changing at all as the product rolls out globally? Thank you. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yeah, let me just make a comment on the overall sort of strategy with the attach, and then Kelly can talk a bit about the supply. James, our original plan was to deliver a subscription model on the switch, and we've been very pleased with the attach rate and the percentage of customers and dollars in that subscription category that are actually being attached to the advanced subscription, which really contains the automation and it contains the encrypted traffic analytics, and we'll continue to add more and more of the Assurance stuff that we just launched two weeks ago. So we wanted to create real value in that subscription so that our customers would believe that it was worthwhile, and I think we're seeing exactly that. So, Kelly, comments on demand and (19:18). Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yeah, no. I mean, I think I saw a couple of reports on that. I can tell you from a demand perspective, we're very excited about how quickly this demand has been. And with any new product launch, we're going to get orders in faster than we recognize them in revenue. That's normal. And I'd say this ramp is normal as well. We did not have any significant supply chain issues of any sort or any shortages on this product line as well. So it's really more just we have tons of demand and we're very happy to see how quickly the take-up is going. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: And we'll go ahead and take the next question. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Rod Hall - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to start off by asking about the OpEx line. That line held relatively stable even though your revenues beat our expectations. And so I just wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about how you expect that to move in the future. Do you think it just should remain roughly flat on last year? Or where should we be going with OpEx? And then secondly, I want to come back to this Cat 9000 supply/demand question and just see if \u2013 is this kind of a situation \u2013 I feel like we usually ask this about smartphone launches, but has the take-up been so fast that you couldn't keep up with demand and now you're able to meet demand? Is that kind of what you're telling us with those comments? I just want to clarify that a little bit. Thanks. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Sure. So just to follow up quickly on the supply and demand, yeah, as I said, it's not a supply constraint issue at all from our supply chain or parts shortages in any way. I mean, it literally is \u2013 we operate to lead times on our products and if we get a lot of orders in the last week or two of a quarter, when again, as this thing is just ramping every week, we fulfill to our lead times. So there's nothing anything more than that than just we have a lot of demand for the product. So I wouldn't expect any issues as you look forward. In terms of OpEx, Rod, as you know, we are very focused on driving efficiencies. The only thing that will change in our OpEx is we are adding BroadSoft, so in our guidance we will have obviously the revenue and the margin and the OpEx that comes with BroadSoft. But other than that, we are basically being very disciplined about where we're investing our R&D and making sure we're investing our R&D dollars in the best return projects. So you're going to see it move around if we do acquisitions, but otherwise we're going to be disciplined around that and invest when we can. And when we see margins go up, we're going to be investing as well. But otherwise, we're going to be managing that tightly like we have been. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Kim, we'll go ahead and take the next question. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen and Company. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks, appreciate it. Kelly, I know we're going to see it when you publish the Q, but I was hoping you would tell us the rate of price erosion. And I'm assuming from the margin structure there wasn't a change, at least not for the worst, but let me ask the question. And I'm hoping you'll speak about \u2013 I know you haven't gotten there yet \u2013 Chuck, you've been very candid about saying that you were late with making progress with respect to the cloud. Can you give us any quantification of the growth, as well as as a percentage of revenue? Thank you. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Hi. Okay. So, Paul, yes, let me address the gross margin rate question first. So, yes, we're very happy with our product gross margin rate. And as you and I talk about every quarter, we look at it in terms of what we're getting from price, what headwinds we're getting from price offset by what productivity. I would say this quarter we had a very, very effective price. We still had a price headwind, but it's at the lowest that it's been in many quarters. So it is less than \u2013 it's 1.3 points the way that you'll see it in the Q, Paul, so we're very pleased with that. We haven't been in that level for quite some time. I think maybe Q1 of 2017 we were close to that. But again, it shows the discipline between both our product management teams, as well as the sales force is being very disciplined about discounting. So we're happy there. We also made some improvements on our productivity, where our productivity this quarter is offsetting the price erosion. So that helped a lot. And then, when we get our infrastructure platforms of business going like we did, seeing that return to growth, that helps from a mix perspective. So basically, all three of those were very helpful to our gross margin rate this quarter. In terms of the web-scale question, Paul, I mean, we don't disclose that. It's not a huge number as we break out the broader company, but I will say that we are making some traction. I don't know, Chuck, if you want to add some comments to that. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yeah, Paul, I appreciate the recognition we've been trying to be transparent about this. And we continue to make progress, and I put the comment in the opening comments for a reason, that we do continue to make progress. You see the announcements we've made with Google. I said a few quarters back that we were focused on 360 degree relationships with these, and we have more to bring and certainly we feel good about where we are. But we still have a lot of work to do. But I would say that every quarter, we're making progress. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Chuck. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes Tal Liani with Bank of America. Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Can you hear me? Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes, Tal. Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hello. I have a question. When Juniper discussed network trends, they discussed two things. migration from edge routers to what they call PTX or MPLS boxes in the core, which brings down prices. And second is the introduction of routing into switching and what Arista calls the 7500R. Could you please discuss the implications of these two trends on your switching and routing portfolios? Thanks. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yeah, thanks, Tal. So we talked about this before, and this is happening in some of the big web-scale providers. And the great news for us is that we have several different product platforms that meet whatever need the customer is looking for. Because we have so many customers that will be looking at this transition at different paces, so for those customers that want to go now, we have platforms that address those. The NCS 5500, as an example, has been very well received. We've had routing capabilities in our switching platforms. And we have our Nexus portfolio that continues to perform very well for customers who are building the data center architectures that we've been focused on for the last two or three years. So I think that what I would say in summary on this one is that we're probably best positioned to meet the customer's need regardless of which architecture they're choosing and where they are in that transition. And that would be what we would plan on doing going forward as well. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Tal, for the question. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jayson Noland with Baird. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. Congrats on the quarter. And I wanted to ask on the 9000 subscription model. Chuck, interested in customer and partner feedback and what the puts and takes are there from your customer base and partners. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: On the subscription model itself? Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Or the Cat 9000 overall, both. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Okay. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Both and how extendible that would be across the portfolio. Most of the time, we hear positive feedback from large partners, but sometimes there's a cash flow dynamic. And just wondering how that nets out. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes, okay. So, Kelly, keep me honest when we talk about how we price it. But, so from a technological perspective, this thing, it's one product in a portfolio of switches that we've gotten out the door. So you can assume there's an architectural play we're running longer term. And when you look at the overarching automation platform, the DNA Center, which is also where the analytics come back to for our customers to drive some of these services like Assurance, we're actually quite pleased. And I think that for our customers, what we wanted to do was we wanted the base subscription plus the product to be somewhere at or slightly below what they would have paid for a previous switch with a perpetual license on it. And then our plan was to create so much new innovation, not take stuff that they would have bought before, because the customers would have felt like that we were just changing our financial model at their expense. So what we wanted to put into the advanced subscription was fundamentally new technology that they have never gotten from us before so that they could warrant the incremental spend because they're getting incremental capabilities. So it's not us taking $1 they've been spending in the past and telling them now you got to spend $1.20 a different way. It was us saying, you spent $1.00 in the past. If you spend it the same way, you may only spend $0.95, but we think we're going to give you so much value that it's going to be $1.20 to $1.25. And that's been our plan. And I think that the switch itself and the upfront cost is still enough of the acquisition cost that I have not heard partners on this particular portion of our portfolio, I haven't heard a tremendous amount of pushback. In fact, I think our partners are thrilled that we've reignited innovation in our core portfolio and given them an opportunity to work these refreshes with our customers. Kelly? Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes, I mean the only anecdote I will add to this is I was at a customer, and I was actually at an investor meeting, and their CIO was talking about the new platform. And they were talking about DNA Center, which allows them to manage not just your switches but your newer versions of the enterprise routing and wireless. And the CIO had said I wish I had known that. I wouldn't have bought a competitor's wireless product. So again, I'm encouraged from the whole ecosystem, we're getting very positive feedback from our customers that way. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Kelly. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks and congrats and great execution. Great results. All right, just a couple things for me. Kelly, can you tell us how much of the product revenue was recurring and number of Cisco ONE customers? And then for you, Chuck, the commercial order is up 14%. I mean to me, that was the most interesting number. I mean, it's been a while since we've seen such strong strength in such an important big part of your business. Can you talk about the economic backdrop, what's driving this, what is changing, ability to maintain that momentum going forward? It's really quite an impressive number. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Kelly, you want to hit the stats? Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: I'll take mine first. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: I know them, but I'll let you go. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yeah, yeah. So on the recurring revenue, we talked about again, we're up to 33% recurring revenue in total. Of that, again of the products, of the product side, of my product revenue, we are up to 13% is recurring. So again, that just continues to grow. That 13% is up over 3 points from what it was a year ago, so we continue to make progress. But 13% of our total product revenue is now recurring of which all of our revenue, 33% is. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Just a couple of \u2013 and Cisco ONE customers? Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Oh sorry. Cisco ONE customers, we're over 24,000 now. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes. And just on the percentage of product revenue that is coming from recurring, that was 6% just 10 quarters ago. So, and I think the raw number was up 34% year-over-year. So we're pleased with that. And then I completely forgot the second part of the question. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: The commercial strength. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes. Commercial strength. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Commercial strength. Thank you. Yes, so we saw that was very consistent around the world. And you've heard us talk about, Ittai, in the past that our commercial customers tend to be the early adopters and the customers that actually adopt the technology sooner and actually roll it out into production sooner, because our large enterprise customers and large service providers, they spend a fair amount of time putting in the labs, evaluating it. As I said earlier, with the intent-based networking portfolio, they're looking at delivering the automation platforms and all those which are just a fundamental different way of running their infrastructure. So it takes them a little longer. So largely that was the big driver, but I think it was pretty consistent across the board in the portfolio. Kelly? Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yeah, it was double digit in every region, and we were up in every single product category, sub product category. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: So it was pretty comprehensive, which I think, look, if we're honest, we've got some good new innovation in our portfolio. Obviously the economy is providing a little bit of a tailwind as well. But I think our teams are executing really well. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Let's go ahead and take the next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Fish with Piper Jaffray & Company. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Hey, Jim. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Jim, are you there? Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Are you muted, Jim? Operator : One moment, please. I do apologize, be just one moment, sir. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Should we go to the next? Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Hey, Kim, let's go ahead and move to the next question. Operator : Okay. I do apologize. One second here. It looks like I've been kicked out of the location for the call. I do apologize. Just one moment, please. I do apologize. Give me just one moment, please. Jim Fish, your line is now open. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Okay. James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Can you guys hear me now? Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: We can, Jim. Sorry about that. James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. First call and already breaking the conference call. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes, wow. James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Anyway, thanks for the question, and congrats on the great quarter again. My question is actually more on the capital return. And so if my math is correct on sort of the repatriation amount of $67 billion, it looks like after tax-wise, it'll be about $57 billion and spending, it sounds as if you're going to spend $25 billion on the repo and then another $13 billion over the next two years on the dividend. That still leaves you by my math roughly about $20 billion. How should we think about sort of M&A versus either debt paydown over the next few years or other items? Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes, I mean, I think there is a couple pieces in there. Don't forget, I still have a very good dividend that I'm paying. I'm paying a $6 billion a year on the... Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: He included $13 billion over the next two years. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Did you have the $13 billion? Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: He said that. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: If I look at it, I'm at a $34 billion net cash position right now. We've got the $66 billion we're bringing back. We've got the share buyback and the $31 billion we plan to try to utilize over the next 18 to 24 months. I'll still be in a net cash positive position of $10 billion to $12 billion without assuming anything else for acquisitions. And as you guys know, acquisitions are a critical part of our, and always has been of our overall strategy. So I'd say the way to think about it longer term is we're going to be consistent with what we've said, right, from a capital allocation perspective. We're going to continue to be looking for the acquisitions that we can drive value and drive growth with. We are going to continue to support the dividend and drive that up with earnings, like you saw us do today. And we're going to, again, give back cash now that we have \u2013 all of our cash basically is repatriated all the time now. We're going to be giving back to the shareholders through a healthy buyback, and I think we've got $30 billion to work through to do that. But we'll keep you updated as we go through this every quarter. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Jim, for the question. Kim, we'll go ahead and take the next one. Operator : And your next one comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James & Associates. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you for taking my question. First, just a quick clarification. In the prepared remarks, you talked about campus getting better. Did you indicate that it's up year-over-year? Or could you confirm if campus switching is up year-over-year? Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yeah, no, so yeah, basically campus has been up. It's up in orders but from revenue, we're still slightly down, modestly down, from a revenue this quarter. And we saw strong growth on the data center side. But yes, the order side was very, very strong on campus. You'll see that flush through going forward. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Simon, for the question. Next, please. Kim? Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Are you there? Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Did we lose them? Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Kim? Kim, are you there? Operator : Okay. One moment. Aaron Rakers, your line is open. Please go ahead, sir. Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yes, thanks. Can you hear me? Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: We can now, Aaron. Thank you. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Apologies to everybody with our technical difficulties here. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yeah, sorry about that. Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : No problem. I wanted to ask a question about just your data center segment. You talked about double-digit growth. It sounds like UCS was strong, sounds like you're continuing to get some traction with your HyperFlex product. So kind of updates there on how many customers you have for HyperFlex and do you think we're at a point in time where you could see some sustainable growth in that data center segment going forward? Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes, I'll give you a little color on it, and then I think the number you \u2013 I think that's correct, Kelly. Yes, we had a good couple of quarters where the team has really focused on next generation innovation, lots of partnerships, integrated solutions with analytics, and then working on some of the new capabilities around some of the Kubernetes stuff that was announced and then HyperFlex is obviously still \u2013 it's not a significant portion of that business, but it's growing. And I think, Kelly, 2,400 customers now we're up to? Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: And so we're pleased with the progress that the teams have been driving. I think that we continue to see new customer adoption. We actually see a lot of the HyperFlex customers that don't overlap with UCS, so we have that opportunity to pull those together. So pleased with how the team is executing there for sure. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Next question please, Kim. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Kvaal with Nomura Securities. Your line is open. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet/Nomura: Yes, a clarification and a question first, I guess. And the clarification is, Kelly, would you mind helping us understand how much BroadSoft is adding to the upcoming quarter and maybe to the most recent one too depending on the specific close date? And then a bigger picture question is the macro outlook has in the past been a big focus for Cisco and something that has led to more confidence or less confidence in the business outlook. I'm wondering if you could share a little bit about what you are thinking through with the global picture, and how that may be helpful or may be overheated a little bit in certain places. Thank you. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: You want to go through them? Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes. I'll do the BroadSoft. So yes, so in Q2, like I mentioned, we had about 80 basis points of impact from acquisitions, which did not have BroadSoft. When I gave my Q3 guidance, overall inorganic impact bumps up another 0.5 point to about 130 basis points. So 1 full point is from inorganic. And for BroadSoft, just to remind everybody, when we do an acquisition and we bring it onto our balance sheet, obviously what deferred revenue they had ends up going through purchase accounting and gets a bit of a haircut. So the first quarter is going to be slightly less than what they were when they were a public company. But overall, it adds, we're at 130 basis points overall at the company level. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: So, Jeff, maybe I could just give you sort of a general view on what we saw around the world, and then we'll talk a little bit about sort of the overall economy. We referenced it earlier, the global strength in commercial was something that we were very happy to see. In U.S., we actually saw strength in our federal business. We haven't talked about that today. Across Europe, Middle East, Africa, everything was positive except the SP business there. APJC was flat, but that was primarily driven by SP routing deals largely in China and Japan. So the rest of business, we were pleased with, particularly enterprise and commercial in APJC. And then the emerging markets continue to be somewhat volatile, but I think we saw slight growth this quarter as well. But from an overall economy perspective, look, we came out of The World Economic Forum. We read and see and talk to the same customers and everyone that you do. There's a great deal of confidence right now on a global basis, probably more consistent than we've seen in a very long time. So that's good, but we believe that we also have driven innovation in our core technologies in the enterprise that we have needed for a long time. And so I think that both of those are contributing to how we feel about it in addition to the strength across the rest of the portfolio. So we appreciate the strength in the economy, but we're also very pleased with the new innovation as well. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Chuck. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Your line is open. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon, a question on the revenue growth profile. Could we actually see accelerating revenue growth going into the back half of the year because the 9000 intent-based networking and product portfolio is providing for a longer evaluation and lab work by some of your bigger customers? And then once they overcome that, you see more of a land and grab expand dynamic? And then, Chuck, I had a question for you in terms of the cash that's going to be burning a hole in your pocket here even after all the different nice shareholder return initiatives you're undertaking here. Do you need to put a stamp on the company in terms of making a big transformative acquisition, or can you do it other ways? Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes. Let me address the second one first, and then I'll let Kelly talk about some of the growth, the first question relative to growth. I think what we have said all along, even before tax reform, is that when it did occur that we would leverage our ability to continue our capital strategies, which you saw today relative to buybacks as well as dividend. But we also have kept plenty of powder dry. We also have obviously the ability to take on debt, if necessary. And we've also said that in the past, by virtue of our cash being outside the United States with access to the debt markets, we really had no impact on our ability to do M&A. And the bottom line is that we'll continue to look for any M&A targets that actually line up in an integrated way with what we're trying to do strategically, and that's just what we're looking for. I wouldn't put any parameters around the size. I think it's really around strategic fit, both from a technological perspective from what our customers are looking for, and then obviously the financial implications. So Kelly, any comments on the revenue? Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: On the revenue growth, we really do only guide one quarter at a time. But again, we are very, very encouraged with what we're seeing with the current portfolio of innovation, certainly in the switching portfolio. Both the data center side and the campus side are pacing well, and again we are going to keep executing through and we'll see how that goes. But we feel good about what we see next quarter of the 3% to 5% growth, and we're just going to keep working it from there. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Kelly. I believe we have time for one more question. Operator : Okay. One moment please, while we confirm. Okay, Jason Ader with William Blair & Company, your line is open. Jason N. Ader - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. Chuck, I was wondering what your thoughts are on the service provider business going forward and when do you think that might turn around. And what would be the puts and takes or the drivers that could turn it around? Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yeah, I think it's a great question, Jason, and the rest of the businesses were generally pretty strong. So when we think about SP, obviously one of the key variables for us is continuing to make the progress that we've been making in the web-scale community. And that's a key focus area for us, as they're included in this business. So that's certainly number one. Number two, the consistency of CapEx coming from everyone in this space around the world will certainly be a contributor to the future performance. So, I think that's the other thing that we look for. And then, third, as we mentioned at the financial analyst conference, we're also working on some next-generation platforms that we think can help us here as well. So if I had to just pick three things, those are the ones that we're focused on, and we're going to take it quarter by quarter and keep executing in all of those areas to try to get that business moving in the right direction. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: So with that, I just want to close by just thanking all of you for joining us today. We really appreciate you spending time with us. Appreciate the questions. And, Marilyn, I'll just turn it back to you to talk about our next call. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Chuck. Cisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our fiscal 2018 third quarter results, will be on Wednesday, May 16, 2018, at 1 :30 PM Pacific Time, 4:30 PM Eastern Time.

As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.  With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck. Charles Robbins : Thank you, Marilyn. Good afternoon, everyone. We had another great quarter. We are executing well against the strategy we put in place 3 years ago. Our innovation pipeline has never been stronger, and we continue to transform our business to reflect the way customers want to consume our technology.  We delivered another quarter of accelerating revenue growth of 4%, solid margins and record non-GAAP EPS up 10%. Our performance was driven by the acceleration of our intent-based networking portfolio, continuing strong customer demand for our innovative solutions and the increasing value of the network. We also made steady progress in shifting more of our business toward software and subscriptions. This resulted in broad-based strength across our products and geographies.  As I talk with customers around the world, it is clear that the network is playing an increasingly critical role in helping them manage their complex environments. They are consuming services from multiple cloud providers, multiple SaaS applications, connecting billions of new devices which are generating massive amounts of data, and the network is pervasive across all of these environments. We have been evolving our portfolio to help our customers deal with this complexity and provide unprecedented simplicity, visibility and security across on-premise, hybrid and multi-cloud environments.  Now I'd like to review our momentum across key priority areas and share some of the innovations we're driving across our portfolio. First, let's start with Infrastructure Platforms. We are leading the network industry's transformation to intent-based networking across the campus, branch, data center and the edge. We are paving the way to help customers simplify and manage the network. Only Cisco offers an end-to-end, intent-based networking portfolio that delivers assurance, industry-leading security, policy-based automation and segmentation.  We continue to see very strong adoption of the Catalyst 9000, the fastest-ramping new product introduction in our history. This includes another quarter of high uptake of our advanced subscription offer in DNA Center, our automation and analytics platform. The Catalyst 9000 now has over 5,800 customers, up from 3,100 last quarter. This is an excellent example of how we've begun to scale our enterprise networking business into a subscription model. We've also recently introduced additional intent-based networking innovations. These include new access solutions and routing software subscriptions which expand our software-defined WAN capabilities onto any platform.  We are extending our leadership in data center and cloud by providing highly secure and differentiated offerings such as our ACI SDN solution. With growing 100-gig deployments, especially in cloud infrastructure, we remain well positioned for future growth with our data center switching and intent-based portfolio. We also announced new hybrid cloud workload management solutions with ACI Multi-Site Management and new flexible consumption models, including SaaS delivery for our Tetration platform. Whether deploying enterprise applications or containers in a multi-cloud environment, customers are increasingly turning to Cisco's unique architectural approach. This is leading to strong momentum with UCS, our compute platform; and HyperFlex, our hyperconverged offering, as customers benefit from simplicity and scalability to support their hybrid cloud strategies.  Now turning to Security, which is foundational to everything we do. Our architecture delivers highly effective security from the network to the endpoint to the cloud. This unique ability to bring together networking and security at scale gives us a huge competitive advantage. With the largest customer base in enterprise security, it is clear that our strategy is working. The strength we saw in the quarter is driven by our integrated architecture, combined with best-of-breed products.  We are also leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to reduce time to detection and remediation. A great example of this is our Talos intelligence platform where we block 20 billion threats every day.  We continue to rapidly innovate in security to address key areas of concern for our customers such as security in their complex data centers. We introduced a comprehensive, integrated data center security architecture that is designed to protect the modern data center by seamlessly following any workload anywhere across physical and multi-cloud environments.  Now moving to Applications. This quarter, we introduced new innovations across our collaboration portfolio with the convergence of the Cisco Spark and WebEx platforms combined with new WebEx Meetings and WebEx Teams applications. We further enhanced our AI and machine learning capabilities across our collaboration portfolio with the acquisition of Accompany, a relationship intelligence platform with robust insights and intelligence to improve meeting and team experiences. We completed this acquisition last week. We are pleased with the consistent progress we've made to deliver on the strategy we put in place nearly 3 years ago. We have solid business momentum. We are confident in our pipeline of innovation and future growth opportunities. And our commitment to driving value for our shareholders remains as strong as ever. This is clearly demonstrated by the fact that we delivered record capital returns this quarter. As part of our commitment to shareholders, we are also very focused on our responsibility as a company to drive impact within our communities through innovation and active engagement. It is not only the right thing to do, but a key requirement for long-term business success. We are deeply committed to our long-standing efforts around sustainability, education and disaster relief as well as other key issues such as hunger and homelessness. I could not be prouder of our achievements or more excited about the impact we will have going forward.  Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more detail on our financials. Kelly Kramer : Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for Q4.  We were pleased with the financial performance in Q3 with broad strength across the business. We executed well with very good orders momentum, strong revenue growth and solid margins.  Total revenue was $12.5 billion, up 4%, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.66, up 10%. We continue to focus on driving margins and profitability with a strong non-GAAP operating margin rate of 31.5%.  Let me provide some more detail on our Q3 revenue. Total product revenue was up 5%, demonstrating the strength of our portfolio. Infrastructure Platforms grew 2% with strength in all businesses with the exception of routing. Switching returned to growth with revenue growth in both data center and campus. Campus growth was driven by our new switch, the Cat 9K. We saw solid growth in wireless with strength in Meraki and our Wave 2 offerings. Data center had very strong double-digit growth driven by servers as well as HyperFlex. Routing declined largely with the continued weakness in service provider.  Applications was up 19% in total with broad strength across the businesses. We saw very solid growth in TelePresence endpoints, UC infrastructure and AppDynamics.  Security was up 11% with strong performance in unified threat, advanced threat and web security. Deferred revenue grew 38% as we continue to drive more subscription-based software offers.  Service revenue was up 3%, driven by growth in advanced services as well as software and solutions support.  We continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions and recurring revenues. In Q3, we generated 32% of our total revenue from recurring offers, an increase of 2 points from a year ago. Revenue from subscriptions was 55% of our software revenue.  We drove good growth in deferred revenue, which was up 9% in total, with product up 18% and services up 4%. Deferred product revenue from our recurring software and subscription offers was $5.6 billion, up 29%.  We saw strong momentum in Q3 product orders growing 4% in total. Looking at our geographies, Americas grew 4%, EMEA was up 6% and APJC was up 3%. Total emerging markets was up 7%, with the BRICS plus Mexico up 12%.  In our customer segments, enterprise was up 11%, commercial grew 7%, public sector was up 2% and service provider declined 4%.  From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q3 gross margin was 63.9%, down 0.5 points. Product gross margin was 62.9%, down 0.3 points. And service gross margin was 66.9%, down 0.9 points. We continue to be negatively impacted by the higher memory pricing we have discussed over the past several calls, which we expect to continue in the near term. Our operating margin was strong at 31.5%.  When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our results year-over-year, there's been 120 basis point positive impact on revenue and a negative $0.01 year-over-year impact on our non-GAAP EPS.  In terms of the bottom line, non-GAAP net income of $3.2 billion was up 6%, while GAAP net income was $2.7 billion. We grew non-GAAP EPS 10% to $0.66, while GAAP EPS was $0.56.  We delivered operating cash flow of $2.4 billion, down 28%. We paid $1.3 billion of onetime foreign taxes during the quarter related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Operating cash flow increased 11% normalized for these tax payments.  We repatriated $67 billion of our offshore funds to the U.S. and ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $54.4 billion, with $47.5 billion available in the U.S.  From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $7.6 billion to shareholders during the quarter that included $6 billion of share repurchases and $1.6 billion for our quarterly dividend.  We recently announced an agreement to sell our Service Provider Video Software Solutions business. We expect this transaction to close in Q1 fiscal year '19 subject to any regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. We are continually looking to optimize our portfolio. To summarize, Q3 was a good quarter with solid top line growth, strong profitability and order growth. We continue to make solid progress on our strategic priorities, making key investments to drive our long-term growth.  Let me reiterate our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal year '18. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier.  We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 6% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29.5% to 30.5%. And the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 21%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.68 to $0.70.  I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move on into the Q&A. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Kelly. Michelle, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. [Operator Instructions] So with that, I'll turn it to you, Michelle. Operator : James Faucette from Morgan Stanley Investment Research. James Faucette : Great. Chuck and Kelly, I guess I wanted to ask, as you -- one of the key things that investors are looking at is the continued growth in subscriptions, et cetera. And it seems like the deferred continues to grow nicely. One of the key questions that we have though is, as you continue to show good demand for the new Catalyst 9K products and distribution expands, what are you seeing in terms of attach rates for subscriptions to that new product? Are they maintaining the levels that you had seen at the early stages of launch or are they starting to normalize back to more traditional levels? Just trying to get a little color on how well that tying strategy is working for you. Charles Robbins : Yes, James, thanks for the message. I'll comment. And then if Kelly wants to add anything, we'll let her do that as well. I would say it's been very consistent over the last 4 quarters, I think, since we put it in the marketplace in Q4 of last fiscal year. I think we had 1 month of activity. So it's been incredibly consistent. We're really pleased with the acceptance of this product. I think adding 2,700 more customers in the quarter, if you think about that, that means we added over 40 customers per day that acquired a Catalyst 9000 for the first time. And the acquisition of that product, in my opinion, is a clear belief in the next-generation architecture with the automation platform that we're announcing, which is what the advanced subscription model requires. And so I think that's reflected in the continued high uptake that we see on the advanced subscription. Kelly? Kelly Kramer : Yes. No, I think that covers it. Vast majority is the Advantage, which has the advanced features and the higher margin profile. And then the only other thing I would add is, it is very evenly spread across commercial, enterprise and public sector in terms of the demand and where we're seeing all the business. Operator : Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. Roderick Hall : I just wanted to try to dig under the covers a little bit on the revenue guidance. Obviously, service provider orders are weak and sounds like routing's weak, in line with that. Just wondering if you could, Kelly, maybe give us any idea how much service provider video is affecting that guide and also the routing within that guide, like what are you assuming there. Are you assuming routing continues to kind of drag that growth down? And then I have a follow-up. Kelly Kramer : Yes. So in general, I think the trends on both routing and service provider video, which is in the other bucket, have been consistent. And we're not assuming any improvement in either of those. So I would say our guide includes what we see. We feel really good about the rest of the portfolio, actually. And we see very good growth there, but those 2 trends are not improving. So that's basically what I have included. Roderick Hall : Okay. And then, Kelly, could you also comment on the OpEx to sales? It's ticking up a little bit in the guide, at least implied. And I'm wondering if you could maybe give us any color on what's moving around in OpEx for fiscal Q4. Kelly Kramer : Yes, sure. On OpEx, it's mainly driven by -- the increase is mainly driven by the acquisitions we've run, specifically AppDynamics. As you know, when we bought AppDynamics, very early stage. We're in heavy investment phase with them. So that's part of it as well as we've consolidated now BroadSoft. And then that also has a fairly high OpEx impact. If I back out -- if you look at my OpEx growth for the quarter, which was up a little less than 6%, 4 points of that alone is just purely the acquisitions. And that's, as I mentioned, the impact of acquisitions on my top line and it's hurting me on EPS. It's mainly in the OpEx line. So that's what's driving that. We're being very disciplined within the rest of the business to managing the portfolio. So I think it'll continue kind of in that range as we look forward to Q4, but that's kind of the underlying driver. Operator : Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer & Co. Ittai Kidron : Chuck, I had a couple of questions. First, on the Catalyst 9K, good progress, but help us understand how big is your Catalyst installed base from a customer standpoint? What percent of it do you really think the Cat 9K is relevant to? Because it's hard to gauge whether you're moving too slow or too fast. 40 customers a day sounds like a lot, but maybe for a company like Cisco it's not fast enough. So help me understand how do you think about driving that throughout your installed base especially with now Arista potentially coming to the marketplace. And then second question, I had a question about China. Clearly, relations there have not been on the good side recently. And you've been somewhat a little bit more optimistic on that country over the last year. What are you seeing out of there? And how do you take that into your outlook commentary? Charles Robbins : Okay. First of all, thanks, Ittai, and thanks for the positive comments. On the 9K, I think that we have roughly 840,000 customers. And I would say that there's a very long list of customers that are still available to us to deliver this platform. If you look at -- the products that we have put in the market and the new Catalyst 9K family are sort of like -- if you stack our portfolio and you say, we have a very low-end switch and then you have the old Catalyst 3000, the old Catalyst 4000, those are kind of the platforms that the current 9K family replace. So there's still a very long tail of customers.  The other thing you have to remember is, many of these customers are buying the 9K and then it will become the standard platform. And they'll refresh the balance of their networks. The other thing I'll point out is that I think we said on one of the calls a while back that the enterprise segment, we would expect to lag the commercial segment with the 9K. And we did, in fact, see the enterprise business improve, and the 9K was part of that. So I think we still feel good about it. And this architecture has a long future for us. And there's a portfolio of products that sit within it. So I think if we're really honest, the number of customers who are making the decision to upgrade to the 9K, I would say it's not necessarily because, wow, what a new fantastic new Ethernet switch. It's really because they're buying into this automation strategy of which the entire portfolio will sit over time. And I think that's what we're banking on. And that's where we're banking on the long-term success.  So the China question, look, if you look at our China business this quarter, we actually saw strength in switching in both the enterprise and commercial segments. And overall, I think there's still uncertainty there. But I believe, and I have been optimistic, and I remain optimistic that the 2 countries will come to some closure on the trade issues and that we'll get stability there. And I think -- we still believe in it. It's going to be, obviously, the largest economy in the world in the coming decade. And we remain committed and actually, we're doing pretty well. If you look at the SP routing business in China, it continues to be stressed, like it is around the world, but much of the other portfolio elements, we're very pleased with. Operator : Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank Securities. Vijay Bhagavath : Chuck, Kelly, these are solid results here. You beat on all major categories. A quick question for you. A bigger-picture question actually, Chuck and Kelly as well which is, as your software subscription attach rate sees strength, could we see the sales OpEx, for example, start to trend down? Are you already seeing that impact to your sales OpEx line? And then just a quick tactical question in terms of, approximately, what was the run rate of the SP Video business you've sold to Permira? Because that would help us to inflate your July quarter guidance if it wasn't sold so that it helps us in kind of this if-what scenario basis. Charles Robbins : Yes. Let me give some color around how we see the sales model evolving. And then I'll let Kelly answer the financial side of those questions for you. Vijay, I think what you're going to see is that we're actually building a traditional -- I'll say a traditional software model where we have a customer success organization that over time will take on more responsibility for all of the functions in the software company, the whole adoption expansion and particularly, the renewal space, which will allow us to renew a lot of these offers over time. It's a multiyear renewal window. But renewing over time at a much lower cost of sale, I would suggest that, that may give us either some, obviously, operating leverage or it may give us the ability to invest in more R&D or other areas. But that's the model. That's one of the key reasons that we brought in Maria Martinez, who is now our Chief Customer Experience Officer, who is helping us build out that capability, who has a long experience of doing that in several software companies. So that is one of the major efforts that we have underway right now to not only increase our ability and our rates of renewal, but also to do that at a much different cost structure going forward. Kelly? Kelly Kramer : Yes. And just on the SPVSS business, we will -- it is in my guidance right now because we're going to -- obviously, we continue to run this business until the deal closes. It is the majority of what's in the other bucket, Vijay. So it's the bulk of that. But like we did when we divested the set-top box business, once we closed the transaction, we'll give you all the history so we can adjust the model and go forward from there. So you'll have complete visibility all the way through the P&L once we close the transaction. Operator : Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research. Pierre Ferragu : I just wanted to... Marilyn Mora : Pierre, can you speak up just a bit? Pierre Ferragu : Yes. Okay. Is it better now? Kelly Kramer : Yes. Charles Robbins : Yes. Pierre Ferragu : So on the gross margin, so you still suffer from these DRAM prices. Has it like improved or is that -- has the pressure like increased sequentially compared to last quarter? And then we've had this pricing for some time now in the market, and I was wondering if -- how are you going to reflect that in your pricing strategy? And when should we expect you to start like passing on these extra costs to your client? And then lastly on the gross margin, I assume that you're still like increasing very fast your share of software and subscription services in your revenue mix. So it should have a positive impact on gross margin. If you can comment on that as well that would be great. Kelly Kramer : Sure. So I'll take that. So first, on the memory. So yes, memory is still hurting us year-over-year. In my product gross margin, it hurt us to the tune of about 60 basis points year-over-year. So more than what we were down year-over-year. It is marginally less bad than it was last quarter, which was marginally less bad than it was a quarter before then. So the slope of the increases are getting less, though it's still increasing year-over-year. So it was about 60 basis points. I would say, in terms of pricing, we had another very, very good quarter for price. We always have price erosion. But like you saw last quarter, our price erosion was at the very low end of what we've seen over the last 3 years, and that continues. And part of that reason of why that continues is, we have been passing on the memory DRAM cost increases through price increases on our servers, like we have been as well as a lot of our peers as well as our product managers in other parts of the portfolio have been really -- being very disciplined about looking at where we have some price elasticity and have been selectively and surgically looking for areas that we could take advantage of price elasticity. So I feel really good about where our price index was this quarter, much in line where it was last quarter. And then to your third point on the software being a benefit, that is true, though, I will say, a portion of that is getting offset now that we're ramping the Catalyst 9K so quickly. And as you know, a portion of that gets deferred because it's a subscription. That has a negative impact on our rate as well. So this quarter, it was about 30 basis points alone just for the Cat 9K alone now becoming bigger in the revenue contribution and impact on our rate.  So again, the 3 things are : 60 basis points on memory, 30 basis points on the Cat 9 impact and then we had pretty strong price and some favorable mix coming through from software. The only other last point I will make, we had a very, very strong quarter on our UCS, our server business. And that has a little bit of negative mix for us as well, okay? Operator : Paul Silverstein from Cowen and Company. Paul Silverstein : Against my better judgment, I'm going to ask you a wide-open question, which is for either or both of you, Chuck and Kelly. What are you most excited about in terms of upside opportunity, whether revenue or margin? And what are you most concerned about in terms of downside risk? Charles Robbins : So I'll start, Paul, and thank you for that -- the opportunity. Listen, I think that what I am most optimistic about is the renewed innovation that we have brought and will continue to bring in our enterprise portfolio, particularly into our core franchises, which was one of the things -- when I spoke to many of you when I became CEO 3 years ago and even when we were on the road last year, I said the #1 priority for us right now. Obviously, we're going to continue the business model evolution, but the #1 priority was to get the enterprise portfolio and particularly the switching business stabilized, which our teams have done a great job.  And even if you look at the security portfolio with the team, and then I will tell you on the enterprise routing space, Kelly talked a little bit about the overall routing business. But SP routing is about half. And the enterprise routing, I will tell you that our teams have been working hard on the integration with the Viptela acquisition into our enterprise routing portfolio. And I actually feel really good about how that's coming along, and I'm optimistic about where that goes in the future. And I'm very optimistic about the overall innovation within the intent-based networking portfolio that we're going to bring forward over the next months, quarters and years.  I guess if I had to say what I would be most concerned about in general, it's just sort of the macro and/or some geopolitical risk. I mean, you've got -- you've obviously got lots of trade discussions, which I remain optimistic on. But as long as there's uncertainty, then we wait and see. Obviously, the dollar rising, while we had a good quarter in emerging countries, and we're pleased with our execution there, the rising dollar obviously is another macro issue, but I'm very pleased with what the teams are executing on right now. And that's how I'd leave it. Kelly, any comments? Good. Operator : Jeff Kvaal from Nomura Securities International. Jeffrey Kvaal : You spoke about your progress in the data center switching side of things. I'm wondering if you could help us understand how things are going in the enterprise data center market and how your relationships are progressing in the web-scale data center market or just web-scale in general would be helpful to us outside of data center switching. Charles Robbins : Thanks, Jeff. So I'm very happy with what our teams are doing in the data center switching market. In general, I think that the 100-gig transition, we're pleased with the return to growth in both the data center and the campus from a switching perspective.  On the web-scale side, I would say the story continues to remain as I've articulated it. We continue to make progress. You've seen the announcement we made, obviously, with Google. We continue to work and execute on the details of those solutions that we announced with them. You'll see more coming out later this year from us there. We continue to engage deeply with all of these players. We've had continued progress with several of them and continued favorable discussions. But these are -- as I've said repeatedly, some of these are multiyear architectural decisions, and they take a while. But again, I'm optimistic and pleased with where we are right now.  And I think the other thing I'd point out is that, this environment that our enterprise customers are facing right now where, literally, 4 or 5 years ago, they thought they were going to move to the public cloud and have a much simpler IT world. They now find themselves with 3 or 4 public cloud providers that they're consuming services from. They have 50, 60, 100 SaaS providers. We're beginning to see this real explosion of IoT devices at the edge. They still have their private data centers. Those have not gone away. You've got all of the mobility in customers and suppliers. And so the network is so fundamental to making all that work. And the web-scale providers know that as well, which has really enabled us to build these broad relationships that extend well beyond just the data center. So we're still pleased with where we are and we have a long way to go. Operator : George Notter from Jefferies. George Notter : I wanted to circle back to a conversation from prior earnings calls. You guys had talked about the revenue headwind associated with the move to more subscription-oriented models. And Kelly, I'm wondering if you can give us an update there. Is that still a headwind this quarter? And how do you see that progressing going forward? Kelly Kramer : Yes, sure. Thanks. And so yes, the headwind is still there because we are very much increasing the number of offers that we have as well as the revenue dollar that we're putting on the balance sheet. So the headwind is increasing. And just as we had talked in the past, now that the enterprise portfolio with the Cat 9K is starting to hit revenue, the headwind is increasing. So we said in the past it was 1.5 to 2 points. It definitely now is approaching the 2 to 2.5. And as we ramp more and more of the portfolio, we'll continue to see that. Operator : Srini Pajjuri from Macquarie Capital. Srinivas Pajjuri : I guess my question is on the recurring revenue. It dipped a little bit to 32%. If you could give some color on that. And also, I think your target long term is exceeding 37% in fiscal '20. Is that primarily a function of Cat 9K ramping in volume? Are there any other products that could contribute to that? And also, I'm wondering if you need to expand the subscription model to other products to achieve that goal. Kelly Kramer : Yes. So thanks for the question. So yes, on the recurring revenue, it's basically in the rounds. If I look at our product recurring revenue, again, it continues to grow over 30% to over 30% of our total product revenue. And overall, total recurring revenue is again growing in the double digits. So it's really the math and a little bit of the mix now that we have product revenue growing so much faster than services that's driving kind of just the pure math of the round from 33% to 32%. But we feel great about how it's progressing.  Yes, if you go to our Financial Analyst Conference, we feel we're right on track of what we projected as that goes out to fiscal year '20. The only caveat I'll give you on that is, when we go into our fiscal year '19, we have to adopt the new revenue standard, which will have some implication on some of the products that are included in this. So we plan to have a call where we can go through the anticipated area that will be impacted to give you guys more clarity. And then we'll adopt that Day 1 of our fiscal year '19. But overall, we feel great about the traction. We're executing very well. And we're on track, if not slightly ahead, of what we expected when we talked at the Financial Analyst Conference. Charles Robbins : And Srini, just one last comment on the part of your question where you asked if we would need to extend this to other parts of our portfolio. I mean, we will. If you look at the new enterprise routing, some of the comments I made in my opening was that we're extending our software and subscription business in the routing space. Many of those are software solutions. So we'll continue to evolve. And frankly, it's driven by how our customers want to consume the technology, which is great. And as Kelly said, it will create a short-term headwind, but we think long term for the business it's absolutely the right thing to do. Operator : Jim Suva from Citigroup Global Markets. Jim Suva : I have a brief question for Chuck and then Kelly, more of a clarification one. But Chuck, there wasn't any mention yet, at least on the Q&A, about competitors going into the campus side of things with Arista making an announcement. How do you look at that? I know competition isn't anything new. But do you need to step up your sales efforts? Or how should we think about that? And then Kelly, for the CFO question. How should we think about, you've got time now to think about the tax law, sort through all the changes. Is your outlook kind of 21% outlook long term? And stock cadence, you did a lot more stock buyback this quarter than normal with your new announcement. How should we think about those financial metrics? Charles Robbins : Yes. So let me hit the first one. Relative to the competition in the campus, what I would say is that, look, we launched this architecture last June. And I think our customers have been incredibly excited about it. One of the very important things that we did is we made the architecture and DNA Center backwards compatible with at least one generation of our wireless products, our switching products, our routing products, et cetera. And I think that taking a look at all of those products is incredibly important because our customers don't want to have an automation platform that handles switching. They want an automation platform that handles the enterprise -- at a minimum, the enterprise network. And then over time, as we integrate our automation platform in the data center and the campus, you'll be looking at the ability to automate from the data center to the campus to the wireless network to the routing and frankly, the security architecture. And we think that is a unique architecture that we can deliver. We are leading right now. We see incredible acceleration of the Cat 9K and adoption by our customers. And we're very comfortable with where we are in this transition. Kelly Kramer : And on the tax question. So again, we feel really good about where we stand in terms of that. As we said in the call, we brought back $67 billion from overseas. And we -- like we said in last quarter's earnings, we announced a big increase to our share buyback authorization. So we have $25 billion remaining in our share buyback. And we anticipate using that in the next, basically, 18 to 21 months. So we're being very aggressive there, like we had stated we would be once we got our cash back. So that's going well. As far as the tax rate, we also stated in Q2 that we expect our tax rate to be in the 21% for fiscal year '18. And we expect it to go down to 20% in fiscal year '19 when we get the full benefit of the U.S. -- the new U.S. federal rate. So overall, we feel great about the tax law and the implications for us. Operator : Mitchell Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Mitch Steves : I actually wanted to circle back a little bit and poke at the recurring revenue piece. And now that it's 32%, and you're noting that you got 120 basis points from acquisitions. Can you help me understand what really drove the decline Q-over-Q from 33% to 32% given that the acquisitions you guys had done have been software in nature? Kelly Kramer : Yes. I mean, again, I think, basically, AppDynamics has been in the numbers as we go along. I would say, BroadSoft has a mix of both perpetual and recurring, so it is not all recurring. I would say the bigger impact on the numbers, and again, it's really just the mix of the products. When we have product revenue growing 5%, services growing 3%. And within that product revenue, we had very, very strong server revenue growth, which has a very low software recurring proponent of it. That's what's really driving it. As I said, overall, the growth of product recurring revenue was over 30%, like it has been for the last 5 quarters. So that just continues to grow. It's really more the denominator of total revenue that's driving just the slight round down to 32%. Operator : Tal Liani from Bank of America. Tal Liani : Security was up 11%, which is an acceleration from previous quarters -- the previous 2 quarters. Can you talk about what went right and what went wrong with security this quarter? And what are the things that are driving this acceleration? Charles Robbins : Yes. Thanks, Tal. So look, we remain confident in the security architecture that we built, even when we had some deviation in the revenue run rate over the last year. And I think that as you look at the architecture that we have, which extends from e-mail to endpoints to the network to the cloud and then has this massive state machine where we can correlate threats and then dynamically defend, it's a unique proposition. And we say that we have this integrated architecture but also best-of-breed products. So where we are convincing customers that the architecture is right, then we're winning. And I think that our teams are doing a really good job. I think that the engineering teams have continued to add new features and new capabilities that our customers are adopting. And I think it's as simple as that. It's just -- it's we have reasonably good traction in the field right now. Tal Liani : And can you share with us maybe the areas where you think you need to strengthen your portfolio? Charles Robbins : Well, I mean, we have -- the great thing about this architecture when we build it is that you can continue to add virtually any source of threat intelligence to this because it's built to digest massive amounts. I mean, we see 20 billion threats every day. So you can assume that we can add any sort of capability that we like. That includes threat sources and frankly, the same thing from a defense perspective. So within the portfolio, I think there's always an opportunity for our teams to continue to improve and continue to add features. And there's a lot of good competition in the space. It's very fragmented. So we just continue to execute against delivering that architecture. Operator : Mark Moskowitz from Barclays Capital. Mark Moskowitz : Just one more revenue question for me. Kelly and Chuck, how should we think about the second half of calendar '18 relative to your fourth quarter revenue guidance in terms of the 4% to 6% goalpost year-over-year? Is there any inflection point with respect to the selling cycle? We've heard anecdotally from some of our checks that it is a slightly longer selling cycle as customers try to understand more the subscription element. And as they do become more receptive, could you actually see accelerating revenue growth maybe closer to that 6% or better as you go into the October, January quarters? Kelly Kramer : Mark, so as you guys know, we really do just give guidance one quarter in advance. And we feel very good about the guidance we gave of the 4% to 6% growth. As we look forward though, just to give you some color, context, in the Cat 9K, the demand is great. We have fantastic demand. We are taking orders like crazy. And there's great adoption out there by our customers that we don't see slowing down. So we feel great about that. But again, there's a lot of moving parts, and we'll take it one quarter at a time. The only other thing I just want to remind you is, we do have -- when our fiscal year starts in August for '19, we do have the tweak on the new revenue standard that we'll take you through any implications of. So feel really good about the Q4 guide, and we're just going to take it one quarter at a time. Marilyn Mora : All right. Good. Charles Robbins : So I want to just thank everybody for joining us today. We appreciate you spending time with us. Appreciate the opportunity to answer your questions. And Marilyn, I'll kick it back to you for the details on the next call. Marilyn Mora : Great. Thanks, Chuck.

Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the financial information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic, and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements including the guidance we will be providing for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Chuck. Chuck Robbins : Thank you, Marilyn and good afternoon, everyone. We had a very strong finish to a great year. We generated our highest quarterly revenue of 12.8 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.70 as growth accelerated for another consecutive quarter. Our momentum was broad based across our portfolio, customer segments, and geographies. We also continued to generate solid margins, cash flow, and returns for our shareholders. Our results demonstrate a combination of strong customer adoption of our latest innovations, the ongoing value customers see in our software and subscription offerings, and excellent execution across our customer segments and geographies. Our strategy is working and we believe that we're well positioned to capture growth across the portfolio with our pipeline of innovation. The broad adoption of multi-cloud environment is changing the very nature of how modern IT infrastructures are built and secured, and Cisco is at the center of this transition. The recently announced intent to acquire Duo Security is another example of how we are extending our intent-based networking portfolio for the multi-cloud world. Duo\u2019s SaaS delivered solution will expand our cloud security capabilities to help enable any user on any device to securely connect to any application on any network. Combining Cisco's network, end point, and cloud security platform with Duo\u2019s zero trust authentication and access solutions, we will be able to further enhance the industry\u2019s broadest and most effective security architecture in the market. Now, I\u2019ll briefly highlight some of our innovation and the great momentum we're seeing across our key product areas. Starting with infrastructure platforms, we continue to rapidly innovate and transform our technology portfolio to drive even greater customer value. A year ago, we reinvented enterprise networking with the launch of our intent-based networking architecture. This quarter we saw continued strength in infrastructure platforms driven by the Catalyst 9000 as customers look to us to simplify and automate their networks. Over the last year, we introduced additional innovations across our networking portfolio including new access, WAN, and data center offerings. In June, we announced new developer capabilities across our intent based networking portfolio, spanning all network domains, campus switching, wireless, WAN, data center and cloud. We're also excited that our developer program DevNet surpassed 500,000 registered members. As part of this program, we introduced new offerings to help developers and network engineers innovate throughout our intent-based architecture. As we all know, the WAN is undergoing an architectural transition to a software defined WAN to enable IT to rapidly respond to changing business needs in a digital and cloud world. Our customers are driving this transition and looking to Cisco to help them make this shift. Our SD-WAN portfolio leverages our leading networking products, automation, and robust security architecture to enable greater flexibility, increased bandwidth, and lower costs. This quarter we saw significant traction with Viptela as it has now been deployed at over 800 customers driven by our ability to provide higher capacity at a lower cost. We are pleased with the ongoing integration of Viptela with our core portfolio to drive even more value for our customers. As our customers move to a multi-cloud environment, we see tremendous opportunities to provide value to them by redesigning their IT architecture, delivering security, and building, orchestrating and managing applications. In Q4, we saw the production launch of our hybrid cloud solution with Google, the introduction of a multi cloud solution with NetApp and numerous engagements with customers redesigning their IT architectures. We continue to believe Cisco is very well positioned to benefit from the increasing adoption of multi cloud. Turning to security, security continues to be our customers number one concern and it is a top priority for us. Our strategy is to simplify and increase security efficacy through an architectural approach with products that work together and share analytics and actionable threat intelligence. This architecture is supported by Talos, one of the largest commercial threat intelligence teams in the world. We identify and protect against new and emerging threats like the recent VPN filter vulnerability through our sophisticated infrastructure and unrivaled telemetry of data. Cisco is the largest network and enterprise security company and our approach of bringing security into the intent-based architecture and offering security across the network, end point, and cloud has proven to be very successful. This quarter we saw continuous strong momentum with revenue again accelerating and growing double digits year over year. We continue to invest in our product and technology innovation as we are committed to helping our customers on their multi cloud journey. Our focus is on delivering cloud security solutions that provide ease of use, scalability, and protect end users. As I mentioned earlier, with our acquisition of Duo Security, we will further enhance how we deliver simple, automated, trusted access anywhere for our customers environments. Moving to applications, in May, we announced the launch of WebEx teams bringing together meetings, calling and teamwork into an integrated experience as part of the WebEx platform. In Q4, we introduced major new enhancements to the platform including a new user designed for WebEx meetings and a new solution with Google, combining their contact center AI service with a WebEx platform. With more than 3 million customer service agents globally using Cisco's contact center software, our integration with Google will help to automate responses in our call centers by leveraging data and intelligence from AI. We also achieved another robust quarter of growth with AppDynamics underscoring the importance and value of our unique invisibility and analytics from the end user to the network to the application. To wrap up, 2018 was a great year. We returned to growth, investing in our core franchises, delivered new innovative platforms, and continued to shift our business to more software and subscriptions. Our record results demonstrate the strength of our business as well as the strategic focus and execution that we have delivered over the past twelve months. I want to thank our teams around the globe for delivering these results. We're looking forward to fiscal year 2019 with a clear focus on growth, execution, and innovation. We see incredible opportunities across our business and believe we're uniquely positioned to deliver on our vision to be one of the most strategic partners to our customers as they go through their digital transformation. Kelly, I'll now turn it over to you. Kelly Kramer : Thanks Chuck, I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter then cover the full fiscal year and the Q1 outlook. Q4 was a solid quarter across the business, we executed well with strong orders, revenue growth, margins, EPS and operating cash flow. It was great to see accelerated momentum in product orders which grew 7%. Total revenue was 12.8 billion, up 6%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 30.9%, non-GAAP net income was 3.3 billion, up 8% and non-GAAP EPS was $0.70, up 15%. Let me provide some more detail on our Q4 revenue. Total product revenue was up 7% with broad strength across the portfolio. Infrastructure platforms grew 7% with growth in all businesses except for routing which was down slightly. Switching had another great quarter with strong growth in campus driven by the ramp of the Cat9K and growth in data center driven by the Nexus 9K. We saw good growth in wireless with strength in Meraki and our Wave 2 offerings. Data center had very strong double digit growth driven by servers and HyperFlex. Routing declined slightly driven by weakness in SP routing. Applications was up 10% in total with growth across all the businesses. We saw a very solid growth in unified communications, telepresence, conferencing, and AppDynamics. Security was up 12% with strong performance in network security, unified threat, policy and access, and web security. Service revenue was up 3% driven by growth in advanced services as well as software and solutions support. We continue to transform our business delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions and recurring revenues. In Q4, recurring revenue was 32% of total revenue, an increase of 1 point from a year ago. Revenue from subscriptions was 56% of our total software revenue, up five points year over year. We drove good growth in deferred revenue which was up 6% in total with product up 15% and services up 1%. Deferred product revenue from our recurring software and subscription offers was 6.1 billion, up 23%. There was also a strong increase in the unbilled deferred which is not on the balance sheet. The combined total deferred revenue plus unbilled deferred was up 28%. When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our Q4 results year over year, there was a 90 basis point positive impact on revenue. We saw especially strong momentum in Q4 with total product orders growing 7%. Looking at our geographies, Americas grew 6%, EMEA was up 6% and APJC was up 12%. Total emerging market was up 12% with the BRICS plus Mexico up 22%. In our customer segment, enterprise was up 11%, commercial was up 9%, public sector was up 1% and service provider return to grow, up 6%. Our product backlog at the end of Q4 was 6.6 billion, up 38% year over year. From a non-GAAP gross margin perspective, total Q4 gross margin was 62.9%, down 0.8 points. Product gross margin was 61.5%, down 0.4 points and service gross margin was 67.1%, down 1.7 points. Product gross margin was down 0.4 points driven by our APJC region related to some FP specific deals as well as negative product mix. Product gross margin for the Americas and EMEA were both up year over year. Overall, pricing continued to have relatively modest erosion as you have seen over the past couple of quarters and we continued to be negatively impacted by higher component costs which we expect to continue in the near term. In terms of the bottom line from a debt perspective, Q4 net income was 3.8 billion and EPS was $0.81. The GAAP results include an $863 million benefit related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We've excluded the benefit from our non-GAAP results.  We ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of 46.5 billion. Q4 operating cash flow was 4.1 billion, up 2% with free cash flow of 3.9 billion, also up 2%. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $7.5 billion to our shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of 6 billion of share repurchases and 1.5 billion for quarterly dividend. I will now cover the full fiscal year. We delivered solid revenue, margins, net income, EPS, and operating cash flows. Revenue was 49.3 billion, up 3%, our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 31.1%, non-GAAP net income was 12.7 billion, up 5% and non-GAAP EPS was $2.60, up 9%. Our total non-GAAP gross margin was 63.8%, a decrease of 0.5 points, with product gross margin down 0.4 points and service gross margin down 0.9 points. GAAP net income was 110 million and GAAP EPS was $0.02 which includes the charges related to the Tax Cuts And Jobs Act of 10.4 billion. For the full fiscal year, we delivered operating cash flow of 13.7 billion. We paid approximately 1.4 billion of one-time foreign taxes during the year related to the Tax Cuts And Job Acts. Operating cash flow increased 8% normalized for these tax payments. We returned 23.6 billion to shareholders over the fiscal year which represented 184% of our free cash flow. That was made up of 17.7 billion of share repurchases and 6 billion for our quarterly dividend. To summarize, we had a strong Q4 and fiscal year. We executed well with strong top-line growth and profitability. We're seeing the returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the shift to more software and subscription, delivering long-term growth in shareholder value. As a reminder we are adopting the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 as of Q1 fiscal year 2019 on the modified retrospective basis, its primary impact will be to accelerate our revenue recognition for certain software licenses and sales to future distributors as well as a recognition of a deferred commissions assets that will be amortized over the terms of our sales contract. Let me reiterate our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue growth in the range of 5% to 7% year over year. This range includes the impact of ASC 606 which we estimate to be a benefit of about 1%. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%, the non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 30% to 31%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 19%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.70 to $0.72. The guidance included our service provider video software solutions business that we recently agreed to sell and excludes a Duo acquisition since both transactions have not closed. We expect the SPVSS transaction to close in the first half of fiscal 2019 subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. I\u2019ll now turn it back to Marilyn, so we can move into the Q&A. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Kelly, Michelle let's go ahead and open the line for questions. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question only. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Michelle. Operator : Thank you. Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank Securities, you may ask your question. Vijay Bhagavath : Good afternoon, Chuck, Kelly, hope you can hear me fine? Kelly Kramer : Yeah. Chuck Robbins : We can Vijay, thank you. Vijay Bhagavath : My question to you Chuck and Kelly, please chime in, is it reasonable to assume you'd be extending the software subscriptions, idea and plan across the portfolio. Give us an early glimpse as to how is it going, what were some of the challenges, what were some of the positive surprises and would the makeup of this software subscription portfolio meaningfully change as you look to extend this model across the portfolio? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : So, most of you know that we -- when we began the sale of the Catalyst 9000 that was the first attempt to sell a subscription software offering on top of a core networking product and that has gone as we\u2019ve said on prior calls reasonably well. I'm very pleased with how the adoption has been from our customers, they understand the value. As I said early on, we put - we knew when we started that process that we would need to deliver significant innovation that wasn't available in the traditional methodology of buying it in order for our customers to adopt it and some of those were the encrypted traffic analytics, the overarching analytics, I mean, the automation capability and then recently some assurance. And you'll see us over the next coming quarters when we bring new products to market in the - particularly, in the enterprise networking space but across the portfolio, we will apply that same strategy. So, I think that we've been pleased and our job now is to ensure that the operational infrastructure of the company is prepared and we're working towards being able to ensure the customer is deriving the value from that software as well as obviously putting in the operational capabilities to ensure the renewals et cetera, so that's what we're focused on. Kelly any? Kelly Kramer : No, I think you hit it. Operator : Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs, you may go ahead, sir. Rod Hall : Hi guys, thanks for the question. I\u2019m kind of beside myself, don't know where to start, these are so good. But let me - I guess, let me kick off with a question on the deferred revenue, Kelly. You said this off but including this off balance sheet deferred, it\u2019s up 28%, is that total deferred or a product deferred, can you just clarify what you meant by that and also maybe help us understand what ASC 606 impact on deferred was because that was I guess negative. Kelly Kramer : Yeah, sure. So, on your question on the deferred revenue [plus][ph] unbilled deferred, so that was up 28%. The big driver we have for that, that is just purely product, okay. So, it is - what we mostly have in our unbilled deferred is from our collaboration, our applications business. They have a lot of periodic billing that they book month to month that is a very large number. So it is kind of apples to apples of business that we have booked that we\u2019ll recognize in the future. So that's why we look at both. When we do adopt ASC 606 for Q1 that will be one of our disclosures showing you the combination of deferred plus unbilled. So you have a remaining performance obligation. But it is just product that 28%. As far as the ASC 606, we adopt that in Q1. So in the results we just went through of the 6.1 billion of deferred from software and subscriptions that is related to how we've been accounting for it under the old ASC 605. So when you go into \u2013 Rod Hall : Can you just clarify though, would you write down some - you\u2019ll write some of the deferred down in Q1 as a result of the change or not much or --? Kelly Kramer : Yes, so yeah I can give you some direction, you'll see that in our K. So we will be writing off a portion of that balance, so of the 6 billion, we will be writing off and restating because you basically restate your balance sheet for the new accounting rules. And like we said over the past year, where we will have that impact is things that were term-based software licenses things like our ELAs or Cisco One those will now be recognized up front where they used to be deferred. So the deferred revenue balance will be written down for that and will lower the balance of the deferred revenue and then as we go into Q1, we'll be recognizing any new business that we bill up front from that. Operator : Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer, you may go ahead. Ittai Kidron : Thanks and congrats, great quarter. I guess Chuck maybe you can help me figure out how you managed to navigate so well in what seems to be such treacherous waters out there between some deceleration in economic activity in Europe, the FX movement recently which is not favorable to you, although you price in dollars nonetheless makes your products a bit more expensive internationally, poor CapEx metrics, out of the large telcos; tariff wars. Globally, you seem to be moving along sidestepping all of those things; which of these things really bother you, concern you, you\u2019re watchful, you\u2019re preparing for. And then second question, maybe you can kind of dig a little bit on the networking, Cat9K clearly good progress, are there a customer metrics or anything you can give us there to help us solidify or get better visibility into the trend there? Chuck Robbins : I was feeling pretty good until you asked the first part of your question. I have said publicly I think we're operating in a - we have been operating in what I would call it's been a very you know consistent global economic scenario, there's clearly even in the last few weeks been things that have risen you've got the strengthening of the dollar that you mentioned, you've got some uncertainty in a couple of emerging countries. So those are clearly things that we'll watching, we've seen these in the past and we know how to deal with them. We obviously have the impending tariff situation which we're watching closely and, on that front, we're in deep discussions in Washington with the administration on trying to get to a favorable outcome. We like to see that land in a good place, but overall all of those are things that we are very actively involved with and we watch on a daily basis. As it relates to the networking business, the Catalyst 9000 as I said previously has been the fastest ramping product that we've ever built. So the customer count became less of an indicator pretty quickly and it flowed through to the infrastructure systems growth that you saw this quarter. So we didn't see it as a metric that was we usually use that metric on customer count when we're just trying to give you visibility to the ramp up of new product when it hasn't become real material to the revenue line and I think that we exceeded that point in time with a 9K pretty quickly. But I will tell you just so you know, I think Kelly keep me honest on this, I think we had roughly 9,650 plus customers on the 9K as of the end of the quarter, we had a great Q4, great adoption and we're very happy with where that product in architecture is. Operator : Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research. You may go ahead. Pierre Ferragu : I actually wanted to ask you about service provider, you returned to growth this quarter, which is fantastic. And I think you mentioned as well that your routing business was weak and most of that weakness was in the service provider vertical as well. I was curious to understand how you grew revenues even if routing was negative or maybe I got something wrong. And then, of course, I am very curious to hear whether this recovery in service provider spending might be driven by 5G already. Chuck Robbins : Let me answer the macro question about the overall situation we see in service provider and then Kelly maybe you can cover the routing and the impact of the first part of the question. So, Pierre, in the service provider space, we were obviously pleased. I've said a number of times over the last couple of years that this is a business that is dominated by large customers. And so, as we've always said, when we have several of them that are slowing their spending and it looks bad and when we have several that are spending it looks pretty good and that's just the nature of this business. Relative to 5G, I will tell you that I think I've said this on prior calls, starting at Mobile World Congress earlier this year, we really - we heard these customers in earnest begin and engage in discussions around what network requirements would look like for the infrastructure to support 5G assuming that they're going to add lots of high speed connections at the edge it will require high performance networks with quality of service and slicing and all those things. So I would say that, I would not say that this is a material result of the implementation of 5G to be honest. We expect that is still a year out before many will start and probably see it in earnest into 2020 to be fair, but we're pleased with what our teams have done, it has been a tough market, our teams have continued to battle, our engineering team continues to work on next generation innovation and we're pleased with the results this quarter. Kelly? Kelly Kramer : And to the point of, will I have better revenue, if you remember last quarter, the SP segment was down 4% and you're seeing that flow through the revenue this quarter when we talked about routing overall. So, when I look forward, we don't kind of talk about our guidance in the upfront by business, but some of this on the order side might play well as we go into Q1. What I will say adding on to Chuck's comments is I do think and as you know very well our service provider segment is made up of very, very large customers and in any one quarter, we can get big orders and that can fluctuate around. So, it adds to the sustainability. I would say we feel good about our position though I expect this could move around either way as we look forward. Operator : Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead. Sami Badri : Thank you for the question, my first question has a lot to do with Europe and the strength you saw in the region in this last quarter. and then is it safe to assume that going into next quarter and your very strong guidance, are you expecting to see the same kind of magnitude of strength in Europe again despite all the moving pieces politically. And then the second question I really have is about the Viptela product launch. Are you addressing customers that are already big users and customers of the campus product and the Meraki products to kind of up sell customers into your new Viptela product or maybe you can give us just an idea on the sales cycle and the customer base that you're addressing. Chuck Robbins : If you don't mind, Sami, I'm going to answer the second one, and then I'll give you a little qualitative color on Europe and then Kelly will answer the specifics on the business expectations. So on the second part of the question relative to Viptela and software defined WAN. We have two offers, we have - we Meraki has an offer for those customers who have embraced the Meraki architecture, they have a very effective SD-WAN Solution that is actually being well received in their customer base and they are using it to extend their customer base. So that's being very successful. On the Viptela front, we have been working hard on the integration between the Viptela platform and Cisco's product. And so we're going to have a variety of offerings for our customers, we\u2019ll have a version that will have software running on different types of hardware, a software-only solution will have our integrated ISR solution and so we're seeing a number of those. This was a quarter where I would say we really saw the engagement level increase significantly. We got the offers in the marketplace the first wave of those and I said on the Q3 call that our teams were signaling us that Q4 was where we're going to see some of this come to fruition and we, in fact, did. So we feel good about where we are right now, there's more work to go. We haven't gotten the SD-WAN integration into DNA center yet, so that will only be I think a positive boost when we get that done and teams are working on that, I think it's coming in one of the upcoming releases.  So, in general, we're pleased with where we are at this moment in time with Viptela. Europe, our team is doing really well there, our teams are executing well, I think that they are competing very well because we have some very tough competition there. We have - the team in Europe is always one of the early teams leading with some of the new technology areas, so they've had a lot of success in this core enterprise networking space as we move to intent-based networking. So, we're pleased with what they're doing. We feel the entire global macroenvironment right now, there are so many dynamics that we're calling it like we see it based on what we know today. And Kelly, you want to comment just on how we see the \u2013 Kelly Kramer : Yeah. I mean, I think just to add to your point, I think the environment is very strong in Europe despite the political things that are going on and just as a data point, the UK is up double digits for us on product orders this quarter. So again, it is, I think, like Chuck was saying, the overall environment is very favourable as of right now. So we\u2019re hoping we see this continued strength. Chuck Robbins : And a lot of the innovation that we\u2019re bringing right now is actually targeted at helping our customers lower the expenses of running this infrastructure. So, there is a significant play to be made, almost like as customers look at where they are economically, there is reduction of cost by going to this automation platform. There is reduction of cost by moving to SD-WANs. So, these are technologies that we are hopeful will continue to be important to our customers regardless. Operator : Samik Chatterjee, you may go ahead, from JPMorgan. Samik Chatterjee : I just had a question on the guide for the first quarter. You clearly have good momentum on the top line, although when I look at the operating margin guidance, it\u2019s kind of flat year-over-year. So I just wanted to check, is there something that\u2019s limiting kind of the flow through of the solid momentum on the top line to the operating margin. Is there something that\u2019s limiting the leverage of that to the bottom line? And is that something we should hope for in the future and provides kind of a second leg to the earnings growth? Kelly Kramer : No. I don\u2019t think you need to read anything different of what\u2019s happening on the margin. I mean if I look at the puts and takes that we have to our margin, I spoke a little bit about, we can have \u2013 we have a little margin pressure this quarter and some specific deals in APJC, but otherwise, our margin is driven by the same things, right. Our pricing is very robust, we\u2019re being very disciplined. The price that you\u2019ve seen the last couple of quarters is in a range that\u2019s very, very strong. So that\u2019s good. We\u2019re still facing component headwinds and even though it\u2019s less of a headwind, it is still higher year over year. The prices are up, it\u2019s again, just as last, but that\u2019s part of what we see both in Q4 and the guide and then everything else, kind of balances out. So right now, this is kind of what we see. We obviously are going to be driving for it as much as we possibly can, but it\u2019s really the same dynamics. Operator : Paul Silverstein from Cowen. You may go ahead. Paul Silverstein : A clarification question. Kelly, just in response, your previous response, I trust you expect DRAM at a minimum to moderate come next year and I'm wondering what if you have any thoughts on the impact and the larger question, I've recognized this has been asked and answered in various forms, but Kelly, my takeaway from your comments is that there's an awful lot of things going right and my simple question is how much of this do you attribute to the macro and I recognize even in that portion, it\u2019s not simple in terms of different moving pieces globally, but how much of the strength is macro related, how much of it is better execution in various areas like campus switching et cetera? Chuck Robbins : Do you want to take the first, clarification on? Kelly Kramer : Yeah. Sure. So on the component stuff, yeah, DRAM is loosening though. Again, as I said, the prices still are up whether you look quarter-on-quarter or year-over-year, but we are optimistic that both on the demand side which is also driving some of that pricing mix, back that to get better through \u201919. And I don\u2019t know if you want to hit the other \u2013 Chuck Robbins : Paul, it's virtually impossible question to answer, although I\u2019m pragmatic enough to know that it's a combination of both. I will say that I think that, it's, clearly, the economy has been pretty consistent and the markets have been positive. So that has certainly helped and I think correspondingly, this new architecture and the new technology that we've brought out first, about four quarters back actually, right at the end of Q4 from a year earlier, has clearly been adopted at a record pace for us. So I could never possibly give you any sort of split on what that looks like. The best I can do is acknowledge that it's a bit of both and there are a lot of things going right, right now, but there's also, as we said earlier, Ittai asked the question, there's a lot of dynamics out there that we're watching very closely. So sorry I can't give you a better more specific answer, but I think that's as honest as I can be. Operator : James Fish from Piper Jaffray. You may go ahead. Jim Fish : It\u2019s been a while since we got a security metric update. Can you just kind of walk through some metrics you\u2019ve given or what you\u2019re willing to give today. I know in the past you\u2019ve given deferred revenue growth as well as penetration of certain parts like buyer ramp. And then secondly HyperFlex version 3.0 is released I believe recently. Can we get an update as to kind of how we should think about the sizing of that business or any metrics around it hyper converged infrastructure and how it\u2019s competing against the Nutanix? Kelly Kramer : Sure. So, like I said in the prepared remarks, on the security side, they continue to have -- they're over -- 60% of their businesses is software and so obviously they have a lot of their business going through deferred revenue and it continues to grow in high double digits. So we feel good about that. They had a very strong Q4 and like I said, from a revenue perspective, it was broad based this quarter, driving that 12% up on revenue across all of their subsegments. So I'd say it's continuing to grow very quickly and with this addition of Duo, it really just round out the portfolio very well.  In terms of HyperFlex, I mean that's growing very strongly for us. I think this new release has been well received and again we find ourselves in a lot of head-to-head deals and winning against Nutanix, which is obviously a really tough competitor out there, but we feel good about the offer we have. Now, it's really fairly small compared to the broader data center business that has all of our servers in there, but we're pleased with how it's ramping and how we're competing. Operator : Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Simon Leopold : I wanted to see if maybe we could talk a little bit longer term trending big picture around the concept of multi cloud, which you talked about at Cisco Live and on a number of other occasions. Within the answer, I think what I'm looking for is how does this help the evolution, transformation and importantly how does this help Cisco do more business with the Web scale customers? Chuck Robbins : Simon, so it's a really good question and I think the key message for us that we're trying to get across is that this transition to this multi cloud world actually is changing the way our customers look at building their IT infrastructure and how they secure it. So if you just think very simply that, look back over the last five to seven to ten years, a great majority of the traffic in our enterprise customers\u2019 networks was terminating in their private data centers. So networks were architected and security architectures were built to deal with that reality. Now, we're moving into a world where there is still some percentage depending on the customer of their traffic that is obviously terminating in the private data center. Then they have traffic terminating in SaaS applications in multiple public cloud providers. They have this whole IoT Edge data aggregation issue. So what's happened is the traffic flows in the way data is moving across their networks and across their infrastructure is much more complex than it was five to seven years ago where it was all very predictable, which leads us to when you think about ultimately our customers are going to just need to build a world where you look at the user, you look at the application, you look at their policy and you look at the destination and then you have technology in the network that actually provides policy routing quality, security in that world and that's the role that we're playing with our customers because they need to re-architect their networks to accommodate a massively diverse traffic flow scenario that they're going to deal with.  So I'll stop with that right now, but that's why it's so important in US, what does that do to our partnerships with the Web scale providers. Well, they understand this dynamic that is going on and so many of the -- you're seeing some early -- some of the early work we're doing with some of the Web scale providers to ensure that we have integrated hybrid cloud solutions, so that we can provide security and policy, whether applications are in the private data center or in the public. They're interested in our ability to process data at the edge as customers are building out IoT applications, they're interested in us helping define security architectures that make it simple for our customers to take advantage of their services. So it's emerging as a really attractive partnership because of the reality that everybody sees in the marketplace today.  And hopefully that was clear, if not we can have some folks talk to you afterwards. Simon Leopold : Great. I appreciate it. Yeah. I understand it's obviously a complex topic, just trying to figure out how to bake it into a model. Chuck Robbins : I\u2019ll let Kelly talk to you about that one. Operator : James Suva from Citigroup Global Markets. James Suva : A quick question, Chuck. Earlier in your remarks, you mentioned with service provider stream coming back that you don't believe it's 5G related. That\u2019s more of a 2020 phenomenon. Can you give us a little bit about a history lesson here of, back in 3G or 4G or 2G uptakes, was there a linear into the build that happened? Is there a pause before the positive happens or is it just more of a steady as she goes as we kind of look ahead more longer term strategically to 5G impact to Cisco? Chuck Robbins : Jim, it's a good question. And I think if you go back and look at the earlier transitions in this space, they have largely been around delivering, I don't want to say incrementally better, but a better performance for mobile devices that are connected to the network already. So when you go from 3G to 4G, you get better data performance, you're happier with your apps on your phones, et cetera. This is a step level difference because we're talking about the latency dynamics of 5G and the belief that this will actually enable them to deliver real time business applications to small offices or remote branches over 5G networks, that's a completely different dynamic.  And so I would tell you that we're, we don't know yet, but I think if you operate under the assumption that it lives up to its billing, then it is going to create a significant demand on the core networks of these service providers. And so I can't say that there's a huge historical example for us to learn from. But I think what you're going to see is just between now and when they start building these things out, they're going to be working on design and then we're just going to see them begin to gradually build out as they open up a certain market, they'll build out bandwidth and backbone capacity. And that's how we're -- that's how we're thinking about it and we'll be able to give you guys updates on upcoming quarters as to how we see this thing emerging. It's not going to happen overnight. Operator : Tal Liani from Bank of America Securities Merrill Lynch. Tal Liani : I wanted to ask about the routing, just again, it's repeatedly under pressure and you gave an answer before about, you were saying that it's going according to the plan. I'm wondering if there's a link between the two yet or that the pressure in routing has to do with other things and not to do with SD-WAN. That's the first question kind of to understand or maybe you can provide different explanation to understand the pressure on routing and what's the outlook for recovery or is it like Nokia and others are saying that maybe there is a long term pressure on this market? The second question, just a follow-up on 606. What's the impact on operating margin, if you've provided this or you provide this information? Chuck Robbins : Okay. Tal, let me make a comment on the first one and then Kelly can add to it and she can give the 606 answer as well. I think when you look at our routing business, first of all, Kelly, half of it is, 50%, 60% of it is SP, right. So it's significantly impacted by the SP. Some of the players you mentioned, they probably have a much higher percentage of their routing businesses coming from service providers would be my guess. So that's just sort of couched in the discussion on 5G and everything that we've said so far, but SP I would say is the answer on that piece of it. From an enterprise perspective, Tal, I think over the last couple of years, we've just seen a classic architectural stall in the marketplace as we've talked about historically when there's a big architectural transition. And you said that was going according to plan. I think the way I would characterize it is, we've begun to see customers actually move forward with deployments, but it's early, but we like where we are and we like what we see. So I think that -- I think we'll see the Enterprise continue to improve relative to this architectural clarity and I\u2019ll let Kelly answer sort of how you think about the overall routing or the 606 question. Kelly Kramer : Yeah. So on 606, Tal, so just to kind of again ground everybody on how we are impacted on 606. So one thing I will say is operationally nothing has changed. We've made no changes to our offers. We've made no changes to our contracts or any changes to our cash conversion cycle. So it is literally just an accounting change. Now, what the implications are to us is likely said it is going to accelerate some of our term base licenses. So we will have to write off some of our deferred revenue. We won't see that revenue, but we will offset that with acceleration of those offers when we book new orders and build new orders. Net-net, we think it will be a net positive for us of approximately 1%. And so that's the impact on the revenue, it will fall through down through margin. So it's on operating margin, half a point to 70 basis points roughly of goodness falling through there. And as we go into the new rev standard, as part of our disclosures, we will be laying out very clearly for everybody since we have a -- we're adopting the modified retrospective approach, we will lay out very clearly the implications of the new accounting versus what would have been under the old accounting. So hopefully that answers your question. Operator : George Notter, you may go ahead, from Jefferies LLC. George Notter : I guess Kelly, I was curious about the revenue headwind that you're seeing from the subscription transition. You've talked about that in the past. I'm just curious about what that might have looked like in the July quarter and what do you think that would look like for the October quarter? Kelly Kramer : Yeah. That's a great question, George. So, there's good news, there's good news there I would say. So like we anticipated, as we are so rapidly ramping the Cat9K, and as we're blowing out DNA across not only that, but also our tele offerings and across wireless, the revenue headwind was getting more closer to 2.5 to 3 points. Now, the good news on this is, with the new revenue standard going forward, because it's accelerating some of these offers that we did have previously deferred, that headwind will become less of a headwind. Okay. So as opposed to the 250 [ph] to 300 current accounting standards, that will be much less closer to like a point a half or so if I had to guess roughly. I mean, again, this will all flush out as we go through it, but it will become less of a headwind because we have such a big portion of things that we will now be recognizing upfront. George Notter : You said it was 1% increase on the other side. Kelly Kramer : On the revenue. Exactly. I mean, the good thing about this accounting standard is it does normalize some of the natural headwinds that we\u2019ve had on revenue and margin because of it, it\u2019s not going to kind of come back and benefit us. Chuck Robbins : All right. I want to \u2013 I think that was the last question, Marilyn. So if I could just thank everybody for spending time with us today. Thanks for the questions and the dialog and Marilyn, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Chuck and thanks everyone.

As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that, I\u2019ll now turn it over to Chuck. Chuck Robbins : Thank you, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered another great quarter. It is absolutely clear that the strategy in transformation that we laid out three years ago is working. We accelerated revenue growth, expanded margins and generated strong operating cash flow and double-digit earnings per share growth. We saw broad-based growth across all of our geographies, product categories, and customer segments. This was driven by strong execution, differentiated innovation and our transition to more software and subscription offerings. We are well positioned to capture significant growth opportunities while creating long-term value for our shareholders. In today's environment there's an ever increasing number of connected devices with users expecting an always on experience with access to any application. The enterprise has expanded to now include multiple clouds and applications are evolving at an unprecedented rate. Customers facing a new level of complexity are increasingly seeing the value of our integrated platforms over standalone products. We are fundamentally changing the network and security industry. We're building an architecture that is designed to securely connect any user on any device on any network to any application running anywhere. This creates an enormous opportunity for us as we deliver a multi-domain intent-based networking architecture that drives automation, simplicity, and agility for our customers. Now let's take a more detailed look at our results as we continue to deliver new innovation across our entire portfolio. Starting with infrastructure platforms, over a year ago we set out on a strategy that would disrupt how growing data from a proliferation of new connected devices and complex traffic flows would be managed and secured from the private enterprise into multiple cloud environments. We brought to market and intent-based architecture capable of capturing business intent and applying it across wired, wireless, and enterprise routing, including SD-WAN. This allows our customers to automate their operations, applications, and security policies for efficiency and business agility. This value proposition resonates strongly with our customers and is driving continued strong customer ramp of our Catalyst 9000 family of switches. Yesterday, at our Partner Summit we announced several exciting new additions to this architecture. We launched the next additions to the Cat9K family, the 9200 and the 9800. The Catalyst 9200 series of switches extend intent-based networking to simple branch deployments and midmarket customers. The Catalyst 9800 is our newest wireless controller. We continue to help our customers run consistent security, automation and analytics services across wireless and wired environments. The 9800 gives our customers ultimate flexibility, running anywhere from on-premise and any cloud or embedded virtually on Catalyst 9000 switches. We also announced a major new architectural change for the modern branch network. Cisco is unifying our security in SD-WAN technologies to help organizations embrace the cloud faster with choice and confidence. We provide the simplest way to integrate SD-WAN with our cloud security. This is a great example of how the expansion into the cloud is driving our entire portfolio. In the data center as more customers move to multi-cloud environments, the need for secure virtualized infrastructure grows. Our strategy is to enable our customers to address increasing connectivity and data growth while securely enabling workloads across any combination of private, public, or multi-cloud environments. We continue to invest in innovation to help our customers transform their data centers for improved efficiency, scale and resiliency. This has resulted in tremendous traction with our Nexus 9K, ACI, and UCS solutions as we architect security from the application to the network and support cloud workloads wherever they may reside. Building on the success of our industry-leading Nexus switch portfolio we recently unveiled new Nexus 400G switches. We are committed to leading the market transition from 100G to 400G providing customers with increased bandwidth and scale in their data center environments powering any workload in the cloud. The addition of 400G to our Nexus portfolio extends the power of ACI providing intent-based networking to Enterprises, web scale, and service providers, to enable them to build compact, fully automated, high-bandwidth fabrics. Cisco is the only company to not only deliver the best of breed 400G portfolio, but also brings customers the architectural solutions for today's multi-cloud world. Last week we expanded our hybrid cloud portfolio by introducing the industry's first hybrid solution for Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services. We are delivering a hybrid cloud solution that is designed to enable our customers to easily connect, secure, and monitor Kubernetes based applications across on-premise and the AWS cloud. Turning to our security business we again delivered another robust performance with double-digit growth. Our goal is to be our customers' number one security partner. We are building a comprehensive and integrated security portfolio focused on effectively detecting, rapidly containing, and quickly responding to threats, spanning from the Edge to the data center into the cloud, our customers, users, devices, applications and data are protected wherever they are. We continue to add more SaaS based offerings to our broad security portfolio. A great example of this is our recent acquisition of Duo Security which provides cloud-based identity solutions for unified access security and multifactor authentication. Duo solutions play an important role on extending our intent-based architecture in a multi-cloud environment simplifying policy for cloud security and expanding endpoint visibility coverage. The integration of Cisco's network, device, and cloud security platforms with Duo's zero-trust authentication and access products is designed to allow us to easily and securely connect users to any application on any network device. Moving to applications, data intelligence continues to be critical for organizations to improve business outcomes and agility. Our AppDynamics solution uniquely addresses this need resulting in another quarter of strong double-digit growth. Our innovative capabilities and application monitoring and analytics provides unparalleled real-time business insights to our growing customer base making us the clear market leader. We achieved a solid quarter in our collaboration business and continue to set the standard for how people connect, collaborate, and create every single day. We are defining the future of productivity and collaboration by providing customers of all sizes with a comprehensive portfolio to help them share data through any device anywhere. Customers recognize the value we bring with more than 95% of the Fortune 500 using our collaboration solutions. We're delivering unique capabilities, enabling rich collaborative experiences, increased productivity, and helping our customers transform their workspaces. This is accomplished through our new modern WebEx experience, AI enabled devices, and enhanced interoperability across our on-premise and cloud solutions. Yesterday, we expanded our collaboration offerings with a full suite of cloud calling and team collaboration tools to extend our customers' on-premise investments with new hybrid solutions from the cloud to the end-user. These innovations include the availability of broad soft cloud calling with WebEx teams through service providers, 85-inch WebEx board and our new portfolio of total room solutions with Room Kit mini and WebEx Share. In summary, we had a great quarter and our opportunity has never been greater. Our growth continued to accelerate as we executed well against our strategy, continued to drive innovation across our portfolio, and delivered more software and cloud-based offerings. It is clear our customers are looking to Cisco as a trusted partner to help them operate in a multi-cloud world and to transform their businesses. We are well positioned with our growing portfolio across multiple domains as we continue to innovate to bring our customers a more secure, automated, and simple IT infrastructure. We believe the strength and differentiation of our portfolio, combined with the power of our business model provides us with a strong foundation for fiscal year 2019 to create long-term growth and shareholder value. Kelly, I'll now turn it over to you. Kelly Kramer : All right, thanks Chuck, I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter followed by the guidance for Q2. We executed well across the business with strong orders, revenue growth, margin, EPS, and operating cash flow. We had continued momentum in product orders which grew 8%. Total revenue was $13.1 billion up 8%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 31.9%, non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion up 14% and non-GAAP EPS was $.75 up 23%. Let me provide some more detail on our Q1 revenue. Total product revenue was up 9% to $9.9 billion. Infrastructure platforms grew 9% with strong growth across all businesses. Switching had another great quarter with growth in Campus driven by the continued ramp of the Cat9K and growth in data center driven by the Nexus 9K. Routing returned to growth driven by Service Provider. Wireless had double-digit growth with strength in our Wave 2 offerings and Meraki. We also saw good growth in data center driven by servers and Hyperflex. Applications was up 18% with growth across all the businesses. We saw good growth in Unified Communications, TelePresence and AppDynamics. Security was up 11% with strong performance in Identity & Access, Advanced Threat and Unified Threat. Service revenue was up 3% driven by software and solutions support. We continue to transform our business delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software after subscriptions were 57% of total software revenue, up 5 points year-over-year. To remind you, we adopted ASC 606 in Q1. There have been no changes to our offerings to customers or our cash conversion cycles. This is purely an accounting change. It does not impact the metrics, I'm sorry, it does impact the metrics that show our continued business transformation. We think the most meaningful metric going forward is software subscriptions as a percentage of total software revenue. When we look at the impact of acquisitions and our Q1 results year-over-year there was an 80 basis point positive impact on revenue. We saw strong momentum in Q1 with total product orders growing 8%. Looking at our geographies, Americas grew 8%, EMEA was up 6%, and APJC was up 12%. Total emerging markets was up 16% with the BRICS plus Mexico up 19%. In our customer segments Enterprise was up 15%, Commercial grew 8%, Public Sector was up 8%, and Service Provider grew 2%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q1 gross margin was 63.8% up 0.1 point. Product gross margin was 63.2% up 0.2 points and service gross margin was 65.7% up 0.1 points. Our operating margin was 31.9% up 1.5 points. In terms of bottom line from a GAAP perspective Q1 net income was $3.5 billion and EPS was $0.77. We ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $42.6 billion. Q1 operating cash flow was $3.8 billion up 22% with free cash flow of $3.6 billion also up 22%. Normalized for the $400 million legal settlement we received from Arista operating cash flow was up 9%. From a capital allocation perspective we returned $6.5 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $5 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend. From an M&A perspective, we closed two acquisitions in Q1 with Duo Security and July systems. These moves are consistent with our strategy of increasing investment in innovation and R&D for our growth areas. To summarize, we had a great Q1, we executed well with strong topline growth and profitability, we're seeing the returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the shift to more software and subscriptions, delivering long-term growth in shareholder value. Let me reiterate our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. Note that we have normalized our second quarter guidance to exclude the SPVSS business for Q2 fiscal year 2018 which we divested on October 28, 2018. We have provided historical financial information for the SPVSS business in the slides that accompany this call. We expect revenue growth in the range of 5% to 7% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in a range of 30.5% to 31.5% in the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be at 19%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.71 to $0.73. I will now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Kelly. Michelle, let's go ahead and open the lines for questions and as a reminder, I ask that all of you limit yourselves to one question only. I'll now turn it over to you Michelle. Operator : Thank you. James Faucette from Morgan Stanley Investment Research, you may go ahead. James Faucette : Thank you very much. I guess maybe I'll this to Chuck and Kelly you guys answer what you think is appropriate, but one of the key questions we've been getting from investors is, if you're seeing any change in customer behavior either because of pending tariff implementations or macro conditions around the world you've seen, in this past quarter you've seen a lot of volatility on exchange rates as well as the pending implementation of these tariffs. So I am wondering if you are seeing any change whether customer is pulling forward deals or reducing deal size, et cetera? Thank you very much. Chuck Robbins : So let me, thanks James, let me give you some comments first of all and then I'll pass it over to Kelly. First of all, we \u2013 the tariffs were immaterial to us in Q1, the 10% I think we implemented them with a month to go, so we did not see any impact. But I can tell you that from a demand perspective when we implemented the pricing changes which we told you we would on the last call, we saw absolutely no demand change from the week before and the week after we did that. We have talked to all of the sales leaders around the world and I could tell you there are probably only a handful of customers that have made any indication to us right now that they are doing any pull forwards. Now that doesn\u2019t mean that there is stuff outside that we don\u2019t see, but in general we do not view this as a broad-based issue and our momentum from the first week of the quarter to the last week of the quarter was incredibly consistent. So, Kelly any comments? Kelly Kramer : Yes, I mean I'll say just to add some \u2013 add to that, if I look at the linearity by month through the quarter of Q1, it was the exact same as it was in Q1 2018. So we didn't see for the 10% churns [ph] we didn\u2019t see any pull ins. Just to kind of remind everybody, we are actively working with our supply chain to mitigate as much of this as possible and we've made progress, for that that we couldn\u2019t mitigate we passed on and we passed on the price impact just for the products impacted versus broad-based. We were very specific and surgical where we applied it, but overall we were very specific. Going into Q2, like Chuck said, it's pretty straightforward, but I would hope that it is the potential that drives some demand but the underlying the underlying strength of the IT environment is still there. Chuck Robbins : Yes, two other quick comments, I can just tell you personally I haven\u2019t had one conversation with any customer around the tariffs at this point. Secondly, I think that the once we got past the midterms we've begun to hear some positive at least headlines relative to the discussions and I remain fairly optimistic that this has become a top priority for the administration and we're hopeful that they will come to some agreement before we move to anything more significant. Marilyn Mora : Thanks for the question James. We'll go ahead and take the next question please? Operator : Thank you. Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank, you may go ahead. Vijay Bhagavath : Yes, thanks Marilyn. Yes good afternoon, Chuck, Kelly. Kelly Kramer : Hey Vijay. Chuck Robbins : Hey Vijay. Vijay Bhagavath : Yes, hi. I have a bigger picture question for both of you if I may, which is the subscriptions model the promise was to get a higher share of the purchasing dollars, the customers budgets, is that starting to happen, are you starting to see it in your sales figures, and if you could give us any data anecdote saying, yes now that we have kind of expanded and extended software subscriptions across the portfolio we are seeing x percentage more of the customers share of IT spending purchasing dollars would be very helpful? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Yes, thanks Vijay. Let me comment, because this was at the heart of our presentation this week at the Partner Summit and there's a significant recognition that I think is occurring in the marketplace right now. If you look at what our customers are dealing with, they are dealing with a world that truly does involve consuming services from multiple cloud providers, most of our customers have well over 100 and beyond SaaS applications that they're dealing with. They still have increased investments in the data center. They are beginning to see IOT explosions at the Edge, data the Edge, mobile workers everywhere, interconnectivity with suppliers and customers. And what that has done is it's completely made obsolete the original assumptions on which they did define their IT infrastructure. And so the IT infrastructure was built by assumption of traffic flows that just fundamentally don\u2019t exist anymore. And so what we're seeing is that they now need to drive security, and policy, and automation from the campus to the data center to the branch into the cloud and they are looking more and more at the simplicity of having a single architecture to provide that capability. So one of the big things that we talked about this week was the need to drive multi-domain architectures for our customers which actually give them the ability and you're seeing us extend and connect like policy in the Campus with policy in the data centers, you are seeing ACI being connected into DNA in our software defined access technology in the Campus so that we can extend policy. You saw it this week with the branch where we integrated our SD-WAN with our cloud security portfolio. So and I think we're seeing that come through in more and more of these broad-based software licenses that we continue to see our customers adopting. So I think that we are that play out exactly as we thought Vijay. Kelly any\u2026? Kelly Kramer : No it's fine. Vijay Bhagavath : Thanks. Marilyn Mora : All right, thank you. Michelle, go ahead and take the next question please. Operator : Thank you. Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs, you may go ahead. Rod Hall : Yes, hi guys, thank you for the question. I guess I wanted to focus in on product revenue growth. It was really strong for the quarter of 9%, I know that's SPVSS which if anything dragged that down. And then, I mean it feels like you've been pretty conservative in the guidance and I know you'll probably say, no we aren\u2019t. But I'm just curious what could go better in this guidance? What are you contemplating in terms of elements of conservatism? Can you give us any ideas how you are thinking about that forward quarter right now and how things might go better if let's say we do get a trade deal, et cetera? Chuck Robbins : Hey Rod, thanks for the question. Let me just give you some, a little color and then Kelly can answer some specifics on the math. I would say the last two quarters were probably the most consistent strong quarters that we've seen in years honestly and I think it's a combination as we've talked about of the macro environment, but also frankly the innovation. If you look at the portfolio that we have put out there and you look at the number of announcements in the technology and the innovation that we delivered this week, I think you're going to continue to see strong execution. We're really proud of what our teams have done. So and I think that the recognition by the customers of this architectural shift that I was talking about earlier is really beginning to play out. So we feel really good about how we're performing. I'll let Kelly comment on both the product revenue growth and the outlook. Kelly Kramer : Yes, I'd say actually. I think Rod, I feel like this is a pretty good guidance and actually better theoretically than maybe you guys were expecting. But don't forget that 6% growth in the midpoint of the guide gave you again excluding SPVSS out of both periods obviously is really solid because we have much tougher comparison a year ago. I mean we see the strength and I'm just trying to balance it with there is a lot of unknown depending on what tariffs do, but underlying strength in the macro gives us good confidence. So I feel actually very good about the call. Rod Hall : Hey Kelly, just one comment on that. What I would say I didn't mean that it was disappointing from a guidance point of view. I just meant that you were so strong on growth in the reported quarter. Why not be more I guess aggressive with the guidance that was really what I was asking. Kelly Kramer : Yes, I got it, then there is one - there is - you bring up a good point which I do want to get out there. Our growth was very, very strong in Q3 and again back to ASC 606, under new accounting rules, as you know we have a very strong presence in the Enterprise. Our Enterprise business is going very, very well. Whenever we sign these big multi-year Enterprise agreements under the new accounting rule that will accelerate revenue. So in this current Q1 software came in very, very strong because we happen to have two very large multi-year Enterprise agreements with some large enterprises where in any one quarter I might have one, but this was a big one. So that's one additional piece to it, but overall I'd say all of the underlying fundamentals are very, very positive. Chuck Robbins : I think these enterprise agreements are actually reflective of what the question Vijay asked? Kelly Kramer : That's a good point. Rod Hall : Great. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Alright, thanks Rod. Next question please? Operator : Thank you. Paul Silverstein from Cowen and company. You may go ahead. Paul Silverstein : Kelly, just two quick questions on pricing and the drag from the shifts are occurring or just 606 address that? And the bigger question for you and Chuck, and Chuck if you can't answer this I'm hoping you will answer a different question, but I hear you keep citing the strength of the macro environment. And the thought arises that it is far from even throughout the world. U.S. has been strong, but there are plenty of other places far less so. In fact, I don't think the word strong would apply and yet your revenue on a very broad base, across geographies is very strong and far outstripping what we see from the macro perspective. If you can't answer for the disconnect, my question to you would be, how \u2013 would you think is the time period? I know it\u2019s still early the Catalyst Switch architectural upgrade cycle, how far do you think that has to go? Where do you think you are in that process, how much strength is still to come? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Okay. Thanks Paul. Thanks for the four questions. Just kidding. So Kelly, you'll talk about pricing and other things. Let me give you the broader answer Paul. I think you're right and I mean when you look at our results on an orders perspective and you see emerging countries up 16% in the face of a rising dollar that's different than what we've seen historically when we were very, what I would say is we were directly connected to the global GDP and we moved with it. I think it - maybe this was the beginning of us answering the question that I've been asked for the last two calls which is how much of this is macro and how much of it is your own execution. When we began to perform differently than what's perceived to be in the macro, I think that will give us insight into how much of it is our execution, our innovation. The other thing I'd point out is that - and by the way in the emerging countries, just to be clear, it was very consistent across the board. So we had incredible strength in, we did have incredible strength in India. It was our second quarter of 50% plus growth in India. So we have really done a great job there and it's not just the large service providers. We had a large public sector deal this quarter, so we're - you know that is a key market for us that we intend to win in and the teams are doing a good job there. But I think the other thing to consider is that when you look at our customers even in a tough economic environment, what is one of the things that you want to do when you're in a tough economic environment is you want to continue to drive cost and productivity in your business. And at the heart of the automation strategy and at the heart of some of the SD-WAN stuff and at the heart of re architecting the infrastructure, the ending result is to drive cost out and drive productivity up. So it's unclear to me at this point, what a - any sort of significant macro shift is going to do to the spending in this environment because it is connected to what you're trying to achieve when you do have a tough macro environment. So we're going to have to see how it goes, but - so that's that question. On the Cat9K, look we're still incredibly early. I mean it is incredibly early. We just launched another product that addresses a market size similar to what we launched a year and a half ago. And so, we're just on the front end of it and as customers adopt that architecture then you're seeing, we announced the wireless portfolio that's going to fit within that. In the spring you'll see SD-WAN get integrated into the overall architecture in addition to the innovation we announce this week. So we feel good about where we are and we'll see how the macro plays out. Kelly Kramer : And Paul, on that price, we saw from a rate impact on project about 1.9 points down, so slightly up from what it has in the last couple quarters but still better than it was say in Q1 of 2018, but a slight tick up, 1.9 points. Paul Silverstein : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : All right. Thank you. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Samik Chatterjee, you may go ahead, from JPMC. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I kind of had another macro question which is just to focus on your EMEA business. You had a strong quarter there, which are the countries kind of driving that strength? And as you kind of get to this point where we have some more clarity building around Brexit, how do you \u2013 are you seeing any kind of enterprise customers starting to sort of come off the offensive and start to invest a bit more, given that there's no more kind of clarity building around what the eventual deals will look like? Chuck Robbins : Again, I'll make some color commentary and I'll let Kelly give you some details there on the numbers. But I think that Europe, for us Europe is held up in a time where there's been ongoing uncertainty and I think this shows a resilience that we've seen around the world in the face of a lot of uncertainty. You have Brexit, you've got Italy, you've had elections, you've got Merkel's announcement and yet we still see continued strength and it's been pretty consistent for the last what, Kelly four to six quarters I'd say it's been fairly consistent growth. So our teams are doing a good job there. I think that we'll continue to execute and I think that any clarity on any of these issues like Brexit can do nothing but help in my opinion. So Kelly? Kelly Kramer : I'd just say it is very broad based. I'd say enterprise is exceptionally strong. So it's there's no - and the UK specifically has been pretty good for us as I said the last four quarter, so I think it does just go back to it is a resilient IT environment. Samik Chatterjee : Okay, thank you. Marilyn Mora : Alright, thank you. Next question? Operator : Thank you. James Suva from Citigroup Global Markets. You may go ahead. James Suva : Hi, Chuck and Kelly, it\u2019s Jim Suva. I just have one question. I just have one question and that is on memory pricing. Can you just remind us of when memory pricing was going up, say the past 12 or 24 months, what sort of actions the company did and more importantly, what is the strategy going forward as memory prices appear to have softened, how should we think about that in your strategy or pricing or impact to your company?. Thank you so much. Kelly Kramer : Yes, so the historical what we did with memories around DRAM specifically, it was a combination of just prices going up and consistently for all of 2017 and 2018 and it was a very tight supply. So our strategy was securing supply. We bought inventory ahead. We did everything we could to try to minimize the impact. We had big purchase commitments and we are still seeing year-over-year price increases in this quarter. We still are seeing the prices being higher than they were a year ago. The good news is though when we look forward and like I alluded to in the last call, we should see it go from a headwind to a tailwind starting in the second half of our fiscal quarter. So Q3 and Q4 we fully expect that DRAM to be a tailwind for us, which will be good and this quarter the impact will be lesser then impact next quarter and then we get to goodness. And we did, much like we're doing with tariffs, we did pass-through a lot of the memory costs through price increases over that time as well. James Suva : Thanks very much for the details. Kelly Kramer : Yep. Marilyn Mora : Next please? Operator : Thank you. Tejas Venkatesh from UBS. You may go ahead sir. Tejas Venkatesh : Thank you. I'm on for John Roy [ph]. I wanted to focus on the enterprise orders which were up 15%, I think the best since 2011. Where is that strength coming from and are there businesses that are accelerating versus the reported quarter? And maybe secondly, somewhat related, you called out strength in Service Provider, routing but enterprise routing is a significant portion of your routing business. And it was down a lot last year after the Viptela acquisition. Now that that's partly integrated how is it going? Chuck Robbins : So I would say if you look at our enterprise business it was incredibly consistent globally. It was incredibly consistent across the breadth of our portfolio. I think every product category we had grew in the in the enterprise space. And it's largely driven by the strategy and you know in the automation side that we brought forward with that's represented in sort of proxy by the Cat9K from a revenue perspective. We've also - our team and we talked about this before, back in Q4 of 2018. If you go back to the Q3 call, we said that we felt confident that the SD-WAN Solutions would begin to be rolled out in Q4. We saw that and so we've seen continued adoption of that and I think with the announcements we made this week with a native integration into our cloud security portfolio that you'll even see that continue. So, I think the - our teams are doing a good job of helping our customers understand the cost and the operational simplicity that they can gain from some of the architectures that we're bringing forward and I think that's what's driving it. Kelly, any comments on that? Kelly Kramer : Yes, I mean it was across all basically across when I look across our business basically just about everywhere. So it was again broad based. Marilyn Mora : All right. Thanks for the question. Next question please, Michelle? Operator : Thank you. Sami Badri. You may go ahead from Credit Suisse. Sami Badri : Thank you. My main question has to do with Service Provider growth in the quarter and you made a comment earlier about India being up 50%. If you were to exclude the India growth in the quarter would Service Provider be flat to down maybe give some perspective on that? And then the second part is, I do think about the Service Provider segment or the customer vertical in the next year or two, are you seeing some customer spend being held back with the onset of 5G spending and deployments coming into the picture? And if we were to see a 5G revenue type of spending deployment or acceleration where in the next four quarters do you think that would start to be very noticeable? Chuck Robbins : Go ahead, Kelly. Kelly Kramer : Yes, I'll take the first one on the Service Provider excluding India. I will just say, this our Service Provider segment was up in the Americas and EMEA as well. So again, it was a not driven by India though India had a very strong Service Provider as well, but it was up everywhere. Yep. Chuck Robbins : I would say just a quick characterization on this market and we've talked about this before, different customers, different markets or different phases of their architectural transitions and we're seeing in Asia we had a couple of big wins obviously where we're helping them re-architect their networks, try to simplify their architectures and a lot of that is in some ways to prepare for 5G. So we're executing better and but I think, I'll still say what we've been saying is that we've been doing planning with many of the customers on 5G. I had a call with one CEO today talking about their rollout plans. So we're actively in the discussions and our teams are working on architectural designs to accommodate. You're going to see them go into trials. In fact you've all heard some of the U.S. providers are going into trials in the first quarter of next calendar year. I still believe it'll be calendar 2020 before we see anything if we're looking for some broad based movement. But we'll see how it goes if they move faster, then obviously we could be a beneficiary of that, but we're staying close to it right now. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Chuck, next please? Operator : Thank you. Jeff Kvaal from Nomura Instinet. You may go ahead. Jeff Kvaal : Thank you. Yes I have a question and a clarification. The question is on the 400 gig side, I think some of your peers in the space are hoping that this will be an opportunity for them to make insertions into the Web-Scale market. It seems Chuck from your language that you're focused primarily on the enterprise market, though I guess and I'm wondering if not now for Web-Scale when if I have that right? And then Kelly maybe on a clarification side, could you help us understand if you've baked anything into the January outlook or pass through of memory prices or increases in tariffs or what have you? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Yes, so Jeff my apologies if I misrepresented our 400 gig strategy. I think I said in the script that we were in the opening comments that we were we were absolutely focused on Web-Scale. And I think this does represent an architectural transition that gives non-incumbents the opportunity to insert, so we will look for those opportunities as well. I think when you look at the 400 gig advantages we have we're bringing forward much like we do with the Nexus, we're going to have a merchant version and then we have an ASIC based version we'll be delivering. We have telemetry. We've got optics, security automation, backward and forward compatibility that are going to provide differentiators for us. We're co-chairing some standard boards. We can extend ACI from the private cloud into the public cloud across these. So we think we have a lot of advantages. The teams - we have the ability to analyze data flows with security ACI automation policy. So the whole intent based portfolio that our teams in the data center actually introduced years ago, we think will be a big differentiator as well as the breadth of the options that we'll have in the 400 gig space. But we absolutely do see the Web-Scale as an opportunity that we're going to go after here. Kelly Kramer : And on the clarification, so yes, in the January outlook, like I said when I was talking about component costs and memory costs, I still will have some bit of, will have still headwind in Q2 from memory as well as some costs around the MLCC and I have an assumption baked in and certainly the tariff costs if they go up to 25% as well as an assumption on what we can offset with prices pushing through, so that's all incorporated in the guide I gave you on the gross margins. Jeff Kvaal : Yes. I'm sorry Kelly, I meant on the revenue side there was a pass through on tariffs or memory how much is that going to be. Kelly Kramer : Yes, it\u2019s the same. I'll tell you from an overall perspective. Let's assume they do cut in, in January because we will honor quotes if they have quotes in the system the data that we haven\u2019t taken a order yet, it will take a while before both the price increase cuts through as well as even when the tariffs do cut down on the cost side will lead through the inventory that has been brought in at the at the lower cost. So the real full big impact, we'll see, feel when the tariffs go to 25%. If they go to 25% we'll be in the third quarter. But I have baked in some incremental on both the revenue and the margin side and from January. Jeff Kvaal : Okay, thank you both very much. Kelly Kramer : Yep. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Jeff. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Srini Pajjuri from Macquarie Capital. You may go ahead. Srini Pajjuri : Thank you for taking my question. Kelly, one clarification and a question, first on ASC 606, is it just a one quarter benefit to revenue or do you expect any more in Q2 or going forward? And then the question is, you talked a little bit about some of the metrics that you used to give us on the recurring front not being as relevant going forward. Could you give us some more color on that and what sort of metrics that we should focus on? And then if you have any targets for those new metrics going forward? Thank you. Kelly Kramer : So, on the first question on ASC 606, so we will benefit from that going forward. The point I was making earlier was, this was a little abnormal this quarter because we had two very large enterprise multi-year deals that were very heavy software content, that we recognized now in the new accounting rules, you recognize upfront. You recognize up front, so just to remind everybody of where we are impacted on mostly from ASC 606, when we have enterprise agreements, whether these are term based or not we will be recognizing them upfront if basically the functionality of the software goes to the customer. So a lot of the enterprise agreements we have will all be recognized upfront. Cisco One for example a lot of that's going to be recognized upfront and even a portion of our enterprise networking like the Cat9K subscription a portion of that now will be upfront even though some are still deferred. So it's accelerating basically big enterprise license agreement. So this quarter we had two very large ones, but we will be benefiting going forward. And again it's incorporated in the guide and overall long term it will be in that 1% and 1.5% kind of range. Chuck Robbins : Yes, I just want to make a comment. When we set out to move to more of a software and subscription model, the real benefit for us is, it gives us the opportunity to go in and monetize those licenses again in three years, that has not changed. And that was the big benefit because if you looked at the way we saw the switch previously as an example, we would sell a switch with integrated software one time and perhaps five to seven years later we would go in and try to sell another one. In this model, the underlying ability for us to go in at either the three-year or the five year point whenever that subscription is up and renew it that still exists. This is just an accounting change. So the underlying value to our business is still valid. So we're going to continue to move very hard in this direction. Kelly Kramer : And so, on the metrics then to your . Second question there. So that's why to that point we think the right metric is looking of our software, what percentage is subscriptions right. And that continues to just increase and I'll use the Cat9K as an example. We've talked in the past where we used to sell the previous which they sold for 100 and we recognize $100 out front. We're selling the count we used before ASC 606 we sold that Cat9K for 100, about 25% of it was deferred and we recognized that 25% over say a three-year term. And then they would renew it for another three-year term. With ASC 606 that 25% that was deferred about 12% is now deferred. Now other eleven is recognized up front, but that full 25% is what we renew. And so that's why when you look at the software that's still subscription software, that's why we think that's a relative metric. We don't think the - like looking our deferred revenue. We look at that in the past. I mean that was a proxy but as you saw from our disclosures we wrote off $1.3 billion of that balance with the adoption of the new standard for those enterprise agreements and for Cisco One. So looking at that isn't as meaningful. And even with the recurring like using that Cat9K example it's not as meaningful. That's kind of why we think using subscriptions it shows we're still making the transformation. It shows that we're making progress and have that again nothing's changed with the customer. We still have that stickiness of having that subscription and the ability to continue to build out our offers with them. Srini Pajjuri : Great, thank you. Kelly Kramer : Yep. Marilyn Mora : Alright, thank you. Next please? Operator : Thank you. James Fish from Piper Jaffray, you may go ahead. Q - James Fish Hi guys, thanks for the question and congrats on a great quarter. Just quick one from me, the Edge is a topic popping up more and more. I guess, what are your thoughts around move towards a distributed environment, how that will impact Cisco and One bassinets are being made to win there? And just secondly, there's been a lot of larger M&A over the last few months. How is Cisco viewing the M&A pipeline today? And if a large enough deal were to come along would this impact that share buyback plan? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Let me talk a little bit about the Edge and I'm going to pile on with a little bit of a cloud, a little bit of discussion around just what we see happening with applications into the cloud and some of our announcements, and then we'll talk about the M&A question. So first off the Edge is incredibly important and I think that's what's leading us in many cases to some of these strategic partnerships that you hear us building with the Web-Scale Provider. Some of those are multifaceted where there's an Edge component involved because, you know for us to be able to aggregate the data and give the application developers the ability to run micro services at the Edge, that's why we put X86 into our Access products so that you can actually run services from within applications out at the Edge and process data as you need to. We've also built some data fabric technologies like Kinetic that are being used by our customers today very early days. So we think that, we think that what this Edge dynamic does is, it gives us the ability to re-architect the Edge like what you're seeing with SD-WAN, but frankly it makes the network more relevant in the world that we live in today because the traffic flows and where the data is where the applications are, where your users are, it's all just fundamentally dynamic. And so you have to architect an environment that accommodates for anything anywhere. And so, we think that this is actually good for us over time and we'll continue to build technology that enables our customers to deal with it. The other thing I want to just talk about relative to this, because part of the reason that these Web-Scale partnerships are so important is that we are enabling these developers with things like the Kubernetes solution that we have to actually build applications once and then move them seamlessly between private cloud and public cloud. And we did that with our Google announcement. We've done it with our Amazon announcement. So what I think is going to happen is instead of creating this complex software architecture at the core that is necessary to map applications back and forth, for future apps they're going to be built on Kubernetes and we're going to give the customers if they want to start in the public cloud they can seamlessly move them into the private cloud or if they build them in the private cloud they can move them into public cloud. And with our ACI being extended into the cloud now customers can actually seamlessly take their policy in an ACI architecture and extend it into any cloud that they like. So we're trying to make that simple and we think the combination of that and the Edge actually brings the network much more value in the future. There was a question? Marilyn Mora : Yes, about M&A pipeline. Chuck Robbins : Oh M&A, sorry Jim. We've always said we will look at any opportunity that arises if it strategically aligns and it's good for us fiscally. And I would say that the deals that you've seen done over the last few months have zero bearing on how we think about it. We continue to look at the opportunities that make sense for us and are part of our financial plan and makes sense for us from that perspective and that's how we'll continue to look at it. James Fish : Thanks. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Jim. Next question please? Operator : Thank you. We have time for one more question and that comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : Great. Thanks for squeezing me in here at the end. I just wanted to ask one quick one and one thematic. On the quick one there were some press reports about layoffs and I know Cisco regularly does some pruning, if you could address that? And thematically I'd like to get an understanding of how you think about the SD-WAN products. You've been in this marketplace for a while now and it looks like it's getting traction, but my thought is this is a headwind for your router business but a tailwind for the SD-WAN platforms, how do you see this playing out over let's say the next several quarters? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Okay, so let me address both. The first is that the restructuring that's going on right now is first of all it's not an OpEx reduction and we've \u2013 I've actually taken this issue and talked head on with our employees about what's going on right now very directly. And majority of this is part of the customer experience transition. If you look at what we've done relative to the software portfolio and how we're building out these offers for our customers any great software company has a very successful customer experience organization. And if you'll recall we brought in Maria Martinez from sales force back in May of this year and she has been putting together a strategy for how we need to be structured for the future, and this is actually just, it's an unfortunate step that we needed to take in order to expeditiously get to where we need to be relative to dealing with the renewals and the lifecycle that our customers are going to want us to drive with them in this new portfolio. So that's really the predominant driver for what's going on right now. And again I've been very clear with our employees, we've been very open and transparent with them about what's going on. On the SD-WAN side, I think you're \u2013 it's probably generally accurate what you described. However, I think that there's been such a stall in the enterprise routing business for the last couple of years waiting for this to take off that I would view it as a net positive now because we have movement. And you got to remember many branches are going to - they're going to leverage SD-WAN technology on top of one of our ISRs anyway. So you're going to see various flavors at the Edge. You're going to see some software only on X86 type platforms all the way up to software running on high end ISRs because you still need a high performance branch, but you want the flexibility in how you dynamically route your traffic out of that branch. So I view it as a positive and frankly I think when you see the enterprise business, the consistency we've seen over the last few quarters I think SD-WAN is a big part of that. Simon Leopold : Great, thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Thank you. I have just a couple of comments. I think I'll just leave you with, I think that you know our teams are executing incredibly well. There's clearly some uncertainty out there, but I think the macro economy has shown a level of resilience that not many people expected. I think that what we're beginning to see and what is coming through here is that while the cloud four or five years ago was viewed as an existential threat to our business I fundamentally believe that the cloud and the transition to the cloud that our customers are undergoing is actually driving our growth now. So we feel good about where we are. We feel good about the innovation and we feel good about our team's execution. Thank you guys for joining us and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Marilyn Mora : Thank you, Chuck. Go ahead Michele. Operator : And thank you for participating on today's conference call. If you would like to listen to the call in its entirety, you may dial 866-417-5767. For participants dialing from outside the U.S. please dial 203-369-0735. This concludes today\u2019s call.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Michelle. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2019 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I\u2019m joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release, a corresponding webcast with slides including supplemental information will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found in the financial information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter of fiscal 2019. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q which identifies important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. As a reminder, in Q2, on October 28, we completed the sale of our SPVSS business and accordingly had no revenue or expense from that business in Q2 fiscal 2019. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP, and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SPVSS business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SPVSS business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q1 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way. I will now turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Robbins : Thank you, Marilyn and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter we again demonstrated that we have built a resilient growth engine that is firing on multiple cylinders. Our strategy of expanding our portfolio, while investing in our core markets is delivering unprecedented innovation for our customers and sustainable value for our shareholders. We delivered revenue growth across all geographies and businesses, strong margins, double-digit non-GAAP earnings per share growth, and continued solid cash generation. We're building the technologies that enhance our customers\u2019 new digital capabilities and experiences like never before. With a continued expansion to the cloud, the increasing connectivity of users and devices and the need to secure their enterprises, our customers are facing the most complex and dynamic IT environment we've ever seen. Cisco's intent-based networking architecture helps them navigate this complexity by enabling them to simplify, automate, and securely transform their infrastructure. We are redefining every networking domain for our customers from the campus to the wide area network to the data center to the cloud, delivering the agility, operational efficiency, and most importantly, the security our customers require to accelerate their digital transformations. Only Cisco can build and deliver a multi domain intent-based architecture that sits at the intersection of users, devices, applications, and data that can securely connect any user on any device on any network to any application. Simply put, the Cisco of today is at the center of our customer strategies and no longer view just as an enabler of those strategies. Now, let's review some of the highlights in our key strategic growth areas. Starting with infrastructure platforms. Over the last 18 months, we've been reinventing networking from the ground up to connect every domain of the extended enterprise and it's clear that the investments we've made in our core business are paying off. We are executing well, with continued growth in our infrastructure portfolio and strong customer uptake of our Catalyst 9000 family of switches and our SD-WAN offerings. We are now extending our industry-leading security and intent-based networking capabilities to new IoT edge platforms, connecting devices throughout the enterprise with unprecedented scale, unparalleled flexibility, and control. Going forward, you will see us continue to extend our intent-based networking innovations across the portfolio with subscription-based offers that will enable our customers to adopt a consistent architecture across every domain. In the data center, we're enabling digital enterprises to securely access their applications and their data everywhere from private to public cloud environments, as well as the edge. Two weeks ago, we announced a new architecture that extends a data center to wherever the data exists and across all applications running anywhere. We introduced several new innovations to extend our multi-cloud leadership with ACI Anywhere, HyperFlex Anywhere, and cloud center capabilities. We are also well positioned to take advantage of 100 gig and 400 gig upgrade cycles across enterprise data centers, service provider, and web scale networks. With global Internet traffic expected to increase three fold over the next five years, our customers are facing an exponential demand for capacity. To address their need for speed and performance, we continue to innovate to drive the industry's transition to next generation high-speed networks of 400 gig and beyond. Our acquisition of Luxtera will further augment our existing capability around silicon and optics, enabling our customers to build the fastest and most efficient networks. Now moving to our security business, we generated strong double-digit growth reflecting the increasing demand for our market leading solutions and the trust our customers place in us. The attack surface is only increasing. And our comprehensive approach of integrating security into the intent-based architecture from the network to the cloud to the endpoint has been successful, as our installed base continues to grow. With our industry leading threat intelligence, we are redefining how security is delivered with our multi-domain architecture. For example, as a leader in both SD-WAN and security, Cisco provides the most robust SD-WAN platform integrated with cloud security. This helps to simplify and secure our customers\u2019 deployment, operation, and management of their environments. Increasingly, we're helping to secure our customers\u2019 distributed enterprises with remote access and cloud based security solutions. A great example of this is Duo Security\u2019s cloud delivered zero trust platform, which significantly expands our footprint in the Identity and Access market bringing together user, device and application visibility and trust. We are seeing strong traction with Duo and good progress in scaling their capabilities while strengthening our cloud-based subscription portfolio. Turning to applications, and collaboration, enterprise communications continue to evolve as we move to a digital cloud-based world. We are defining the future of work with next generation collaboration platforms that have flexible, intuitive, and intelligent on-premise and cloud-based solutions. This comprehensive approach to collaboration is a key reason why customers are adopting our market leading portfolio resulting in another quarter of exceptional growth. Cisco provides a full suite of collaboration solutions for calling, meeting, team collaboration and care, with flexible subscription offerings designed to easily integrate into customer workflows. With a deep integration of BroadSoft with our core capabilities, we are now the market leader for cloud-based calling and care solutions with compelling solutions for SMBs as well as enterprises globally. AppDynamics is the largest APM vendor providing real-time analytics and insights across applications, infrastructure, and the network, driving solid momentum with our customers. We have been investing in several new capabilities delivering the broadest application visibility and monitoring platform in the world. Our real-time analytics and monitoring offerings are mission critical for our customers as they face a growing complex application environment. To simplify and automate their IT operations, we recently launched AIOps, leveraging AI machine learning and automation to enable improved customer experiences and greater business performance. In summary, we are very pleased with our strong quarter and first half performance. Our teams are executing incredibly well, aggressively transitioning to a software model and accelerating our pace of innovation, and I'm proud of the work they're doing. Our multi-domain intent-based architecture is helping to simplify, automate, and secure the complex IT environments our customers are facing. And I believe we are well positioned to play an even more strategic role with them as they embrace multi-cloud, edge computing, and digital transformation. The innovation our teams have been driving has now given us the strongest portfolio that we've had a very long time and I couldn't be more confident about our future. Kelly, I'll now turn it over to you. Kelly Kramer : Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for Q3. Q2 was a solid quarter across the business. We executed well with strong orders, revenue, gross margin, EPS, and operating cash flow. We had continued momentum and product orders which grew 8%. Total revenue was 12.4 billion, up 7%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 32.1%, non-GAAP net income was 3.3 billion, up 6%, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.73, up 16%. Let me provide some more detail on our Q2 revenue. Total product revenue was up 9% to 9.3 billion. Infrastructure platform grew 6%. Switching had another great quarter with double-digit growth in the campus driven by the continued ramp of the Cat 9000. Wireless also had double-digit growth, with strength of our Wave 2 offerings and Meraki. Routing declined due to weakness in service provider. We also saw decline in data center servers partially offset by strength in hyperconverged. Applications is up 24%, with growth across all the businesses. We saw strong growth in unified communications, telepresence, and AppDynamics. Security was up 18% with strong performance in identity and access, advanced threat, and unified threat. Service revenue was up 1% driven by software solution support. We continue to transform the business delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 65% of total software revenue, up 10 points year over year. When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our future results year over year, there was 140 basis point positive impact on revenue. We saw strong momentum in Q2 with total product orders growing 8%. Looking at the geographies, America grew 7%, EMEA was up 11%, and APJC was up 6%. Total emerging markets was up 6% with BRICS plus Mexico up 2%. In our customer segment, enterprise was up 11%, commercial grew 7%, public sector was up 18%, and service provider was down 1%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q2 gross margin was 64.1%. In terms of the bottom line from a GAAP perspective, Q2 net income was 2.8 billion and EPS was $0.63. We ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of 40.4 billion. Q2 operating cash flow was 3.8 billion, down 7%. We paid 750 million for the first transition tax payment related to the tax cuts and jobs act. Normalized for that tax payment, operating cash flow was up 12%.  From a capital allocation perspective, we returned 6.5 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of 5 billion of share repurchases and 1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend. Today, we also announced a $0.02 increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.35 per share, up 6% year over year. This represents a yield of approximately 3% based on today's closing price. We also announced a $15 billion increase to the authorization of the share repurchase program. This raises the remaining share repurchase authorization to approximately 24 billion. This dividend increase and additional share repurchase authorization reinforces our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Luxtera, a company focused on silicon photonics, which closed on February 6. To summarize, we had a great Q2, we executed well with strong top-line growth and profitability. We're seeing the returns on the investments we\u2019re making in innovation and driving the shift to more software and subscriptions driving long-term growth and shareholder value. Let me reiterate our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal \u201819. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. Note again, that we have normalized our third quarter guidance to exclude the SPVSS business for Q3 of fiscal \u201818, which we divested on October 28 of 2018.  We have provided historical financial information for the SPVSS business in the slides that accompany this call. We expect revenue growth in the range of 4% to 6% year over year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64% to 65%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 31% to 32% and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 19%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.76 to $0.78. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn, so we can move to Q&A. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Kelly. Michelle let's go ahead and open the line for question. As a reminder, I ask that all of you limit yourself to one question only, so that we have enough time to get to all of you. I'll now turn it over to you, Michelle to start the queuing process. Operator : Thank you. Jim Suva from Citi Global Markets, you may go ahead. Jim Suva : Thank you very much. And congratulations on the results and the outlook. When we look at a couple of dynamics, whether it be tariffs, government shutdown, or maybe even weather for installation and shipping your product around the whole US, any thoughts around how we should think about those items, how they played out and your forecast of what's built in? Chuck Robbins : Jim, this is Chuck. Look, first of all, I would tell you that we -- it certainly is one of the more complex macro geopolitical environment that I think we've seen in quite a while with all the different moving parts. But to be honest, from the first day of the quarter to the last day of the quarter, we saw zero difference. We saw very steady demand throughout the quarter and just saw great execution by our teams. And, when we look out ahead at the guide, there's -- we're looking at the conditions as they exist today. And, so far, we've been able to navigate all the different dynamics I think pretty well. We're pretty proud of what the teams have accomplished. Marilyn Mora : Next question please. Operator : Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank, you may go ahead, sir. Vijay Bhagavath : Good afternoon, Chuck and Kelly. Congratulations, these are solid results. My question Chuck and Kelly, I would like to get your thoughts into, you know, the secular growth portfolio you have around AppDynamics, Meraki, Viptela, Duo, et cetera, are these assets starting to drive new sales opportunities, perhaps new product refresh for the core business, or are these mostly like standalone like they're growing in their respective areas? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Vijay and thanks for the nice comment. If I look at the different acquisitions, if you look at -- let me just pick a few like BroadSoft and the integration has been done with the collaboration portfolio, that clearly enhances the overall architecture, and I would say has a positive impact on the total business. As you look at things like Meraki and as we continue to do tighter integration between the Meraki portfolio and the classic Cisco portfolio and we bring together the automation strategies on each side, it gives customers the ability to deploy a hybrid model with both of those technology areas, which I think is a benefit that many of our customers have. They might want the traditional Cisco portfolio in their core headquarters buildings and they might like Meraki out in their retail outlets or in small branches, so that's very positive. When you think about an acquisition like Duo, that's clearly part of an overarching security architecture that clearly our customers are buying into as you can see from the 18% growth which is like the fastest growth rate we've seen in security in many years. So, I think it depends on the acquisition, but most of them are pulling forward an architecture that they are associated with. Kelly Kramer : And just to add I think, we're also embedding it in our products right and you can look at like when we acquired Stealthwatch, it's now part of what we're doing at the Cat 9000 or what we announced with Umbrella being in part of other products. So, I think it's a combination of both. Chuck Robbins : Yeah, bringing together like some of the traditional technologies, I mean thinking about bringing together ISR with Viptela with Umbrella to create this new secure SD-WAN offering, I mean that's a unique capability that only we have and look at taking some of the security technologies like advanced malware and moving them into the Meraki portfolio. Those are obviously key differentiators for us. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Vijay, next question please. Operator : Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs, you may go ahead, sir. Rod Hall : Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess I wanted to start off with the public sector side of things and the order trajectory there improved a lot to 18%. And yet, you know, we're all sitting here expecting US Fed to be week. So, I wonder if you could sort of comment on the US Fed impact on the current quarter, and then why we're seeing such a big order acceleration there and then I have a follow up. Chuck Robbins : Yeah, I would say -- I think first of all, it's important to understand the dynamics of the shutdown that we experienced, it was really, you know, only about 25% of the government agencies were impacted. And some of the groups that we do business with when they had a sense of shut down might be coming, some of them pulled some orders ahead and actually got them in the system. So, I will tell you that we saw minimal impact, our US Federal business even with the shutdown grew double digits, which is I think a testament to our team and the relationships in the execution. And so -- and around the world when you look at our business in Europe, I mean, you look at the -- I mean, think about the 11% growth in the EMEA. When we talked to our team there, a lot of that is public sector oriented, same across the world. We just saw, obviously, at 18% growth in our public sector business around the world. It's obviously, the technologies resonating in that vertical, that's for sure. Rod Hall : And then I wanted to -- on the follow up just on the enterprise order rate. I mean, that was I think, 15% of last quarter. It's decelerated a little bit to 11%. Just comment on what you're seeing there. I mean, you've talked before about last year being such a strong year and just curious if you know that's just kind of a one quarter thing or is that a trajectory we would expect to continue? Chuck Robbins : You know, Rod, I think that -- as I think about the enterprise and you look at our portfolio right now, we really line up with -- whether our customers are looking at strategies to drive revenue and looking at how our collaboration architecture or our location analytics in retail outlets can help them or they're looking at how do they reduce their operating expenses and simplify and the automation we're driving in the networking space, the SD-WAN solutions, they're just -- these are all really core to what our enterprise customers are looking for.  And we've talked about over the last several calls that you know, this Cat 9000, the early phases of that we're still in the very early innings and now we've deployed you know, a wireless portfolio that fits within that architecture. The SD-WAN solutions are going to be integrated into that architecture and the customers are still on the very front end of deploying all this technology. So, we feel good about where we are and we think that assuming we continue to execute well on that technology and that portfolio, the benefits to the customer are such that, you know, I think that we should have a pretty successful run ahead of us in our enterprise accounts assuming we continue to execute. Marilyn Mora : Next question please. Operator : Paul Silverstein from Cowen & Co., you may go ahead sir. Paul Silverstein : I've got two related questions; one my customary what's your rate of price erosion in connection with that. If you could talk about gross margins drivers looking forward. And related to that, if I did the math right, you all did 4.5 billion of operating cash flow if you exclude the 800 million in connection that one-time tax item. That's a record by over $400 million or 10% of what historically is not your strongest cash flow quarter. The question is, is that a new normal? Or were there other extraordinary items in that number? Kelly Kramer : So just on the cash, there's nothing extraordinary in that. And again, that 750 that we paid out that's, you know, we\u2019ll be paying that -- those charges and it escalates in the later years or the next eight years, right. That was just part of the transition tax. But besides that, no, there's no extraordinary. Remember, in Q1, we had the extraordinary $400 million payout from a risk, but there's nothing in Q2 besides that. Paul to your question on price this quarter. It was a one point impact on gross margin. Teams did a good job on that. And so that's in that range. And then if I go back to the gross margin drivers, like we talked about last earnings call, it has been the same drivers, right, we still had a definitely negative headwinds for the last quarter here in Q2 from DRAM and component costs. But, as you look in our guide forward, you'll notice that the guide went up another half point because like I expected last quarter and what we're seeing the DRAM turns into a tailwind in Q3 and Q4. So, that's why you see that tick up in the guide on the gross margin. So the drivers we had are really just, again, the headwinds being the component costs in Q2 that turns around and then we still have a little bit of a drag on our rate for the you know, as we continue to ramp the Cat 9000 portfolio for that deferral impact, but otherwise, we're executing well. Paul Silverstein : Kelly, I trust you. I\u2019ll go and shift software will have a benefit over time? Kelly Kramer : Oh, yeah, I mean, we're seeing them, and that\u2019s what\u2019s offsetting a lot of these headwinds on the component stuff, right. So, yeah, that will continue, which is, again, why you continue to see them in [indiscernible]. So, when the DRAM which has been a significant headwind for us, the last bunch of quarters, you know, we'll continue to see that benefit of. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Paul. Michelle, next question. Operator : Thank you. Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer & Co., you may go ahead sir. Ittai Kidron : Thanks and congrats, let me add my congrats, a fantastic execution in what seems to be a very crazy world. Maybe I have a two part question. I guess, Chuck, trying to kind of dig into what Rod was asking before. You're running multiple product cycles and in multiple product areas, but if you have to kind of put it all together across your entire customer base, in what phase of the adoption are we embrace of the customers of this new portfolio, are we early cycle, mid cycle, help me think about that? Chuck Robbins : Ittai, thank you. Look, here's the thing I think it's important understand. We have been working over the years on building best of breed technology for what we're calling -- what we talk about relative to domains with our customers. So, we've been building the best data center switching portfolio, the best campus switching portfolio, the best campus wireless portfolio. Over the last three years, what we've done is we built an automation architecture within a domain. Okay, so we built ACI in the data center, we built DNA in the campus, we've got SD-WAN platform in the branch, we've got a security control center that actually automates a security architecture. And now what we're doing is we're beginning to bring those together. So, when you hear us talk about multi domain, it means that we're giving our customers the ability to drive automation across all of those domains. And you're going to see even more announcements over the next few months relative to extending that. We extended it into the IoT architecture. So, think about an application that's either running in the cloud or running in the data center that requires a certain policy that gets deployed across all those domains. And I think that's the thing that our customers are really excited about. So, now, where are we? We're still early. I mean, I would still say we're in the early innings. I mean, this transition -- if you look back at the number of years that customers were buying and sweating a lot of this infrastructure, then that's sort of the base that we have ahead of us to actually move into this new architecture. So, I would say it's still very early across all those areas that I just described. Ittai Kidron : That's great. And then just as a follow up, I didn't catch the data center switch comment. Was there one or that's a -- can you give us some color on where you stand there and how do you envision 400 making its impact there, timeline wise? Chuck Robbins : Yeah, I think what we gave -- Kelly you gave a broader switching number, I think. We said, our overall switching business was up double digits. So, I mean, it's a pretty big business. So, we were pleased with that. Kelly Kramer : And on the 400-gig [indiscernible]. Chuck Robbins : And the 400 gig, yeah, I'll tell you, we have a -- we've got a lot of work going on in both our data center switching portfolio where you know, we're in some early field trials as well as in our networking portfolio with some of the work that's going on there. And we believe that sometime middle of this year will begin to see broad-based deployments. We're happy with that. I think there's a couple of key differentiators for us, Ittai. We build our own silicon, the Luxtera acquisition is going to bring the optics into that for us as well, instead of us having to go out and procure the optics, we will be able to more tightly integrate them. The whole intent-based architecture we have and the ability for us with our silicon to do real-time packet examinations for the customers and let them look at packet flows dynamically. There's a lot of differentiators, including a lot of power consumption advantages we think we're going to have. So, sort of middle of this year we\u2019ll begin to see if all that comes to fruition, but I think the teams are in good spot. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Chuck, next question. Operator : Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan, you may go ahead, sir. Samik Chatterjee : Chuck, I just wanted to check with you how -- what are you seeing in terms of momentum in the emerging countries? I believe last quarter, you had a very solid momentum in countries like India, are you seeing those stronger dollar at all catch up to them in terms of what their appetite is, in terms of IT spent if you can help us with that? Chuck Robbins : We gave that number, right, the emerging markets? Up 6% on orders. Kelly Kramer : And BRIC was up 2%. Chuck Robbins : And BRIC was up 2%. So, I think 6% in light of what we've heard from others around that space. And, you know, historically, what we've seen is when interest rates in the US start rising, it creates challenges in emerging countries. And I think if you press Kelly, she\u2019d probably tell you the currency was a slight headwind for us as well. So, I think the teams are doing well and it speaks to the relevance of what we built. We\u2019ve had some big build outs in India. So, India slowed a little bit for us but still quite positive. I think Russia was slightly negative. Mexico was positive. It is a same story, it is a portfolio of emerging countries and right now we have more that are performing well from a volume perspective. China was roughly flat for the last quarter. But overall, again, I\u2019m pleased given the complexities that our teams are facing both geopolitically and from a currency perspective, I think they executed really well. And I think it speaks to the teams themselves on the ground and the portfolio that our engineering organizations built Operator : Thank you. Tal Liani from Bank of America, you may go ahead. Tal Liani : I have two questions or one question and one follow up. The first one is just about cloud spending. We hear a lot about weakness in spending. On one hand, you're not very, very exposed, you're exposed in certain areas and other areas not. On the other hand, it's a big growth opportunity for you. Can you discuss your participation in cloud and your comments on any weakness in cloud spending and then I have a follow up on the Chinese vendors? Chuck Robbins : I guess, this is a quarter where it helps not to have as much exposure. But, I think, we're still very happy with our progress we're making there. Some of these big transitions that we're talking about, the 100-gig, the 400-gig, those are going to be opportunities for us to try to insert and we're working hard to actually position ourselves well for that. But I don't think that I could give any more color than what you've already heard from those who are -- who have a pretty significant exposure in that space. We're still plugging along and doing all the same things that we've told you we're doing. I would say that we still haven't gotten to a substantial different position than what we described to you probably 12 or 18 months ago. But we continue to make progress and we've said it's going to be a long -- it's going to be a long journey to get there. Tal Liani : So maybe again, I have a follow up just on that. But maybe you can discuss your exposure at the cloud and the difference between hyper scale, hyperscalers versus smaller cloud vendors and if you see similar trends with smaller companies where you do have exposure versus larger companies. But I wanted to ask you this morning, I hosted a call with Huawei. And one of the things they were saying is they think they're actually going to gain market share, despite all the issues. And I want to -- I know you don't have, you don't compete with them in China on certain things, but \u2013 and you don't compete with them in the US. But you do compete with Huawei and ZTE globally. And the question is being asked repeatedly about share gains versus Huawei and ZTE. What is your position -- what is your view, what kind of experiences you have had in the last few weeks and few months on the competition with Huawei, when you talk with or when you discuss this with big carriers and how do you see your portfolio versus Huawei\u2019s portfolio in light of these issues? Chuck Robbins : Yeah, it's a good question. So first of all, the magnitude of the market opportunity in China skews the overall global market share numbers. So when -- if you're not participating in a material way in China, then it's very difficult to gain share, if you're just looking at it broadly across the world. So we\u2019ve begun to look at it without China and with China, just to see how we're doing.  What I would tell you is that, look, I think our innovation, I said this in my prepared comments at the beginning, I think our portfolio right now from an innovation perspective, and particularly with the work the teams are doing in the SP space and the work that we're doing around the 5G packet core and some of these next generation platforms that are going to hit the market this year, I would put our innovation up against there as anybody else's in the world right now. I think if you look at our performance in EMEA and an APJC over the last few quarters, that would suggest that we're not only holding our own, but we're competing and winning and I will tell you last quarter, we saw positive growth in SP in both of those regions. And so I feel very confident that not only can we compete, but that we are and we're winning right now. And so the share comment from them could be related to the size of the Chinese market and they're confident that the math works, but in other parts of the world, I'll tell you we're doing really well right now. Operator : Tejas Venkatesh from UBS, you may go ahead, sir. Tejas Venkatesh : I\u2019m on for john. You talked about double digit growth in Campus, are the new Catalyst 9K products that you introduced about a quarter ago starting to contribute to revenue. I\u2019m really just trying to get at how much more there is to go in Campus and whether it's unreasonable to think Campus could be up double digits for the full year as a newer Cat 9K products start to layer on? Chuck Robbins : Well, I think, when you just look at the 9K sales versus the install base of the products that the 9K replaces, we are very early in that cycle. And we just launched a 9200. When did that start? Kelly Kramer : A quarter ago. Just started shipping this quarter. Chuck Robbins : A quarter ago. Just started shipping this quarter. So the products that we announced in the middle of 2017 clearly are flowing through revenue. The 9200 just started contributing to that. But again, if you look at where we are versus the install base that these products replace, it's very early. Tejas Venkatesh : And then a quick follow up on M&A, I wonder if you could comment on capital allocation, now that the core business is growing very healthy, is it time for accelerated M&A perhaps? Chuck Robbins : Well, I'll make a comment and Kelly can add on to it. I don't think that the growth of the core fundamentally changes our overarching acquisition strategy. I think that we've had an acquisition strategy that's continued to add to our portfolio and expanding our portfolio. What I alluded to early on is that our strategy of not only creating adjacent expansions to our portfolio, but really driving innovation back into our core, so that we can get growth from both, given the size of our core markets, that's working. So I don't think that our overall M&A strategy changes because of the success of the core, but Kelly? Kelly Kramer : Yeah. It never has changed, right? I mean, I think our strategy has always been clear, we're going to invest in the business first. And we're always looking for M&A, no matter what the environment is, and we're going to do smart M&A, and then we're committed to our dividend growth like we have been. And then of course the share buyback, and again, I think you saw the latter two there, we just announced again another increase to the dividend, just showing the commitment we have and the faith we have in the cash flows of the business as well as just another increases of share buyback authorization. So I'd say it's independent to how the core business is doing. It\u2019s just a critical part of our overall strategy. Operator : Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research, you may go ahead. Pierre Ferragu : Hey, thank you for taking my question. I'd like to come back to the comments you\u2019ve made Chuck on emerging market, on China, so what I heard is clearly that you\u2019re very happy with your performance there relative and now it's true that having like a flat sale in China is great and overall, your emerging market is holding well, in, especially when you take into account currencies, but really the question I would like to ask you is about how conversations with clients are going there. What's your outlook, like you guys at Cisco used to be a bellwether, you have very, very good insight into how enterprises are feeling about macro developments. So from all the conversations you've had with clients this -- in the last three minutes, what's your take? What's your 2019 macro perspective? Chuck Robbins : Pierre, thanks for the question. What I've said several times in a lot of interviews is that I've been amazed at the resilience that we've seen around the world in light of all of the macro environment and the geopolitical dynamics, whether it's a shutdown or it\u2019s US China trade or it\u2019s Brexit or it's stress in Italy, or it's political unrest in certain emerging countries. I mean, it's amazing the resilience that we've seen. What I will tell you is that our enterprise customers, given the focus, they really -- they don't view this technology anymore as an optional enabler of a strategy that they've come up with. They now view the technology as a core part of their strategy.  So I mean, many of the strategies they're driving around revenue growth don't work, if they don't continue to invest in technology. Many of the things they're trying to do around simplification and cost reduction and productivity in their IT infrastructure as well as being able to efficiently deal with this new multi cloud world, which is super complicated. I mean, they can't just stop. I mean, it's -- they have to keep executing. And I'd say that most of them have a paranoia that if they do stop investing, their competitors will not and they'll fall behind.  So all that being said, I will just tell you, our customers, I haven't seen any general difference over the last 90 days in the discussions we've had with the exception of talking to a customer who has very high exposure to the Chinese market. But even then they talk about the impact of the geopolitical situation. But they never connected to any sort of spending shift that they, some of them may do that. But I'm not having those conversations, everybody seems to be moving in the same place they were three, six months ago. Operator : Sami Badri from Credit Suisse, you may go ahead. Sami Badri : Hi, thank you. I just wanted to get a quick one regarding the number of ELAs you signed in the quarter and what percentage of revenues that actually reflected? Kelly Kramer : Are you talking just Cisco One, what we have provided before? Sami Badri : Yes, exactly. That's right. Kelly Kramer : Yeah. I'd say for Cisco One, we are now basically over 31,000, 31,500 in that range. And I'd say that the thing to think about, as you think about that going forward, as we move more and more of the portfolio, so this DNA architecture and the architecture we're rolling out more and more, you're going to see -- you're going to see more and more of our customers going to that that kind of framework where the software is included in that as well. So, we continue to grow the Cisco One bundles, but again as we progress through the early innings of the enterprise networking Cat 9K and so on portfolio transitioning, you're going to see more and more going to the DNA architecture and software bundle with that. Sami Badri : And then are you comfortable giving a percentage of revenues, something like that that we could get a little bit of an indicator from? Kelly Kramer : No, we don't disclose that. Operator : Steve Milunovich from Wolfe Research, you may go ahead. Steve Milunovich : As a follow on, at the last Analyst Day, Kelly, you talked about software as a percentage of total revenue I think going from 22% to 30% over three years. Can you indicate where you are in that range, if 30 is still the goal, if there's now a higher goal and then how is 606 affecting that? And specifically in this quarter did 606 give you a revenue boost? Kelly Kramer : Yeah. Yeah. So I would say to the first part of that question, we are continuing to progress along those lines. And with the new rev rec, because it's accelerating some of these things that, when you pull a snapshot for this year, it's accelerating some of it, but overall for the longer term strategies, it\u2019s absolutely progressing like we said it would at SAC. And yes, this quarter, we were around 2% for the acceleration when you compare the 606 versus 605 accounting change difference. Operator : James Faucette from Morgan Stanley, you may go ahead. James Faucette : Chuck, I wanted to ask you, it\u2019s interesting to me that the focus on hybrid and hybrid cloud is starting to evolve, especially given where people thought we might end up just a couple of years ago, can you talk about how well formed you think your customers are. And I guess are they seeing or can they understand the real value that Cisco can deliver in hybrid implementations yet and how much missionary work you will still have to do? Chuck Robbins : Yeah. Thanks, James. Look, here's a situation our customers find themselves in. If you contrast where they thought they were going to be four or five years ago, they thought that they were going to move to the cloud. And we've joked about it being a euphoric neighborhood, you know, where they just move and everything is simple and somewhere along the way, they find themselves with four or five cloud providers, multiple collaboration cloud providers, 100 SaaS providers, an explosion of IoT at the edge, and so what's happening is, and by the way, still, they still have private data centers with applications that can't be migrated to the cloud.  They've now gotten to a place where certain applications they're repatriating from the cloud. And the reality is that, they've now find themselves with a more complicated environment than they had five years ago when they began this journey to simplification. So that's the irony. If you think about what I just described, there's only one piece of technology that is consistent across all of those things that I just talked about and that is the network. And so what's happening is a lot of the things that have to occur to help them navigate this need to happen in the network.  And so that's where this whole policy automation strategy that we have is really important because for them to be able to deal with applications running anywhere, deal with users operating anywhere, the date it flows and the traffic flows are nothing that look like what led them to architect their networks the way they did a decade ago. And then couple that with security and the fact that security, you're not protecting a perimeter anymore, so it's not about a big fat honking firewall, it's about an architecture that really does have Integrated Security from the network to the cloud to the edge to email where you're built -- you're building a comprehensive integrated strategy where you're seeing threats in one area and you're protecting across all those domains  So to answer your question, I think that two years ago, we had to convince customers that this is what we felt and today, I'd say most enterprise customers, they could present the whole set of slides to you before we even start talking about the challenges they face and the importance of the network going forward. Chuck Robbins : Thanks for the last question. Thank you. I want to thank all of you for joining us today. I'll make a few closing comments. First of all, I think, our teams have executed incredibly well in light of a very complicated macro and geopolitical environment that we find ourselves in. Our engineering teams over last few years have delivered on innovation to a point where I will tell you that our portfolio is in the best shape it's been in years. And I think we are in a very good position with our customers based on the strategies that they're deploying going forward. And I have a high degree of confidence in our ability to execute. When you look to the future, there's two elements we have to consider, there's geopolitical macro issues and will continue to navigate them to the best of our ability and then there's our own execution, which I think is probably near the peak of what our teams have done in quite a while. So we feel good about where we are. There's obviously a lot of variables, a lot of complexities, but we're pleased with what we accomplished last quarter. We feel good about next quarter, and we're going to continue to execute. Thanks for joining us. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Chuck. And I'm just going to wrap up here. Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal 2019 third quarter results, will be on Wednesday, May 15, 2019 at 1 :30 PM Pacific Time, 4:30 PM Eastern Time.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am you may begin. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Michelle. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2019 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I\u2019m joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release, a corresponding webcast with slides including supplemental information will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found in the financial information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements including the guidance we will be providing for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which indentify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. In Q2, on October 28, we completed the sale of our SPVSS business and accordingly had no revenue or expense from that business in Q3 fiscal 2019. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP, and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SPVSS business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SPVSS business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help understand these impacts. The guidance we provided during our Q2 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way. I will now turn it over to Chuck. Chuck Robbins : Thank you, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone. We had another strong quarter of performance across the business, demonstrating our ability to execute despite the ongoing uncertainty in both the macro and geopolitical environments. Technology continues to be at the heart of our customer strategy and now more than ever our market-leading portfolio and differentiated innovation is resonating with them as they transform their IT infrastructure. In the quarter, we delivered strong revenue, margins, non-GAAP earnings growth, and operating cash flow. As we continue to help our customers achieve their business objectives, I am confident about the future of Cisco and the growth opportunities ahead of us. New technologies like cloud, AI, IoT, 5G, and WiFi 6 among others are coming together to revolutionize the way we operate our businesses and deliver new experiences for our customers and teams. We are fundamentally changing the way our customers approach their technology infrastructure to address the rising complexity in their IT environments. We are building the only integrated multi-domain intent-based architecture with security at the foundation. This is designed to allow our customers to securely connect their users and devices over any network to any application, no matter where they are. We are integrating capabilities like artificial intelligence and machine learning across the entire portfolio, so customers have greater insights resulting in better and faster business outcomes. Now for some highlights across our business. Starting with Infrastructure Platforms. Over the past several years, we've been working to integrate intent-based networking across our enterprise access portfolio to help our customers manage more users, devices, and things connecting to their networks. We brought to market tremendous innovation across wired, wireless, and enterprise routing, including SD-WAN resulting in a continued strong traction of our enterprise networking portfolio. We are moving into an era of truly immersive and pervasive wireless connectivity, which generates demand for high density, low latency performance, for real-time experiences over both wired and wireless networks. Enterprise networks today must be optimized for agility and security, leveraging cloud and wireless capabilities with the ability to garner insights from the data and security integrated throughout. Cisco is in a unique position to deliver this for our customers. We recently announced several new platforms expanding our enterprise networking portfolio with the launch of our subscription-based WiFi 6 access points and Catalyst 9600 campus core switches purpose built for cloud scale networking. By combining our automation and analytics software with our broad portfolio of switches, access points, and controllers, we are creating a seamless end-to-end wireless first architecture for our customers. We also expanded our open roaming partnership ecosystem to now include Apple, Intel, Samsung, and others to make Wi-Fi on-boarding simple. With our newest Catalyst 9000 family additions, we have completed the most comprehensive enterprise networking portfolio refresh in our history. We have rebuilt our entire access portfolio with intent-based networking across wired and wireless. We also now have one unified operating system and policy management platform to drive simplicity and consistency across our customers' networks all enabled by a software subscription model. In the data center, our strategy is to deliver multi-cloud architectures that bring policy and operational consistency no matter where applications or data resides by extending ACI and our hyperconverged offering HyperFlex to the cloud. Our partnerships with Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure are great examples of how we continue to work with web-scale providers to deliver new innovation. For example, we recently introduced Cisco cloud ACI for AWS, a service that allows customers to manage and secure applications running in a private data center or in Amazon Web Services cloud environments. We also expanded our partnership with Google. We announced support for their multi-cloud platform Anthos to help customers build secure applications everywhere from private data centers to public clouds with greater ease. Going forward, we will integrate this platform with our broad data center portfolio, including HyperFlex, ACI, SD-WAN, and Stealthwatch cloud to deliver the best multi-cloud experience for our enterprise customers. Moving to security. We continue to see strong momentum with another quarter of double-digit growth driven by our world-class security portfolio. Cisco is the world's largest cybersecurity company for enterprises with thousands of cybersecurity experts helping our customers globally. Our portfolio covers the entire threat continuum of the modern enterprise and integrates security into every networking domain. We are enabling all of our customers to transform and secure their networks for the rapidly evolving multi-cloud world. We have a platform that continuously detects threats and verifies trust. By combining Duo, Umbrella, Stealthwatch, ISE, and Tetration, we offer an end-to-end zero trust architecture that is strongly resonating with customers. Now turning to applications. We continue to execute very well on our collaboration business. These platforms are becoming increasingly critical to how enterprises operate and manage their workforce. Customers are always looking to enhance their meeting  experiences and cognitive collaboration is quickly becoming the de facto standard for delivering more personalized experiences and transforming how we work. At Enterprise Connect, we introduced several new cognitive collaboration capabilities within our WebEx portfolio, integrating AI and ML to bring context and intelligence to meetings. The new innovations we launched include people insights, facial recognition, and WebEx calling, all which helped to increase our customers' productivity, making work simple and seamless. Going forward, you'll see this greater level of intelligence integrated into every piece of our collaboration portfolio across calling, messaging, meetings, devices, and contact center. We also had another quarter of strong growth in AppDynamics as thousands of customers rapidly adopt our Application Intelligence platform for smarter and faster decision-making. The ability to manage end-to-end application performance across all cloud environments is increasingly important. AppDynamics is the market leader in application and infrastructure analytics delivering unparalleled innovation. We offer the most comprehensive end-to-end visibility from connected devices and applications to the underlying network providing better application performance and user experience. To summarize, I'm very proud of the progress our teams have made against our strategic priorities to drive profitable growth, accelerate differentiated innovation for our customers, and successfully execute on our own transformation to more software and subscriptions. Enterprise IT architectures must transform to help our customers get the most out of all of their IT investments. More than ever, our customers need a trusted partner with an end-to-end architecture strategy to simplify, transform, and secure their businesses and Cisco is that partner. Kelly I'll now turn it over to you. Kelly Kramer : Great. Thanks Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter followed by the guidance for Q4. Q3 was a strong quarter across the business. We executed well with solid orders momentum strong revenue growth margins EPS and operating cash flow. Product orders grew 4%. Total revenue was $13.0 billion, up 6%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 32.2% up 0.2 points. Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion up 8%. And non-GAAP EPS was $0.78, up 18%. Let me provide some more detail on our Q3 revenue. Total product revenue was up 7% to $9.7 billion. Infrastructure platforms grew 5% with solid growth across all businesses. Switching had another good quarter with growth driven by the continued ramp of the Cat 9K and strength in our ACI portfolio. Routing grew driven by SD-WAN. We saw a solid growth in wireless driven by growth across the entire portfolio. And Data Center was up with growth in both HyperFlex and servers. Applications was up 9% with growth across all the businesses. We saw solid growth in Unified Communications software, TelePresence and AppDynamics. Security was up 21% with strong performance in identity and access, advanced threat and unified threat. We're very pleased also with integration of Duo into the Security portfolio. Service revenue was up 3% driven by software and solutions support. We continue to transform our business delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 65% of total software revenue, up 9 points year-over-year. When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our Q3 results year-over-year, there was a 40 basis point positive impact on revenue. We saw solid momentum in Q3 with total product orders growing 4%. Looking at our geographies; Americas was flat, EMEA was up 9% and APJC was up 6%. Total emerging markets was up 5% with the BRICS plus Mexico down 2%. In our customer segments; Enterprise was up 9%, Commercial grew 5%, Public Sector was up 10% and Service Provider was down 13%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q3 gross margin was 64.6%. In terms of the bottom line from a GAAP perspective, Q3 net income was $3.0 billion and EPS was $0.69. We ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalent and investments of $34.6 billion. Q3 operating cash flow was $4.3 billion up 79%. Normalized for the $1.3 billion of foreign taxes related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we paid in Q3 of fiscal 2018 operating cash flow was up 16%. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $7.5 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $6 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion of our quarterly dividend. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. In terms of M&A, we closed on the Luxtera acquisition. These moves are consistent with our strategy of increasing investment in innovation and R&D for our growth areas. To summarize we had a strong Q3. We executed well with strong top line growth and profitability. We're seeing the returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the shift to more software and subscriptions delivering long-term growth and shareholder value. Let me reiterate our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. This guidance includes a type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. Note that we have normalized our fourth quarter guidance to exclude the SPVSS business for Q4 of fiscal 2018 which we divested on October 28, 2018. We have provided historical financial information for the SPVSS business in the slides that accompany this call. We expect revenue growth in the range of 4.5% to 6.5% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64% to 65%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 31% to 32% and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 19%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.80 to $0.82. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Kelly. Michelle, let's go ahead and open the lines for questions and start to begin the queuing process. Operator : Thank you. Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead. Rod Hall : Yes guys. Thanks a lot for the question. I guess I'm going to ask an obvious one and then from the order volumes another obvious one. I wonder if you could comment on the trade situation and the 25% rate increase, and just kind of give us some idea for how much is contemplated in guidance of that? And anything else you can tell us about exposure of the business? I know that you guys had said that you thought, if it went to 25% there would be price elasticity effects, so that's the first question. The second one is obviously the Service Provider orders down 13%. That is quite a lot worse number than we would have expected. So, I wonder if you could just give us any more color on what's happening there? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Sure. Thanks Rod. So on the tariffs, if you remember back many months ago when the 10% tariffs were announced, we said, we had basically three phases to our strategy. The first was we would continue the dialog with the administration to make sure they understand the impact. The second is, we'll continue to do what we've always done which is optimize our supply chain, which we've been doing for the last 20 years. And then the third is, we will make pricing adjustments where necessary if needed. I'll tell you that the team has been working incredibly hard over the last six months. And so last week when we saw the indication that the tariffs were going to move to 25% on Friday morning, the teams kicked in and we actually have executed completely on everything that we need to do to deal with the tariffs. We are -- operationally all that we needed to do is now behind us. And we see very minimal impact at this point based on all the great work the teams have done and it is absolutely baked into our guide going forward. So that's the first question. The second question on the service provider business, look we've always talked about this business as being highly lumpy and very big customer driven, and we've seen quarters where you see several big customers stall, and this is a result. And most of the impact of what we saw was in the Americas. And if you just look at the CapEx spend year-over-year, I think it's in the U.S., Kelly. The data that we had was -- the CapEx spend overall was down almost 20%. So, this is something that we have always said from one quarter to the next until we get into a real network build out relative to 5G that we knew these quarters were going to be lumpy. So, it was very isolated to the Americas, and I think that the strength in our public sector and our commercial and enterprise business continues to indicate that the innovation that our teams have brought into the portfolio is still resonating with our customers. Rod Hall : Great. Appreciate it guys. Nice job on the execution in such a tough environment too. Chuck Robbins : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. You may go ahead. Ittai Kidron : Thanks, and again congrats on a great quarter and execution. Chuck, maybe you could talk about applications, a big deceleration from the level we've seen over the last four quarters. Clearly AppDynamics is doing well in there, but they'll zoom out now in the marketplace, making a lot of noise. Help us think about WebEx, how that business is doing, how do you feel competitively positioned in the marketplace and how do you think about addressing potential competitive headwinds over there? Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Ittai. So, a couple of comments. Number one, the WebEx business continues to grow very solidly. We're very happy with what's been going on. The team has done a phenomenal job of really modernizing that platform over the last year under Amy's leadership. And the other thing to remember is that this is the first quarter where BroadSoft is normalized in the run rate so we've had the benefit of that. So some of the growth rates that you've seen were, obviously, boosted by that over the last few quarters. So that's on the numbers front. I\u2019ll tell you what, the cognitive collab stuff that was announced at Enterprise Connect, I think is going to be game changing. What we see with some of our competitors is that they're focused on taking four collaboration endpoints into a customer and showing a great simple experience. And frankly if we take four endpoints in with WebEx, the new WebEx we can show a great, more rich simple experience as well. So, one of the things that we're focused on right now is transitioning all of our customers to our modern platforms, because we've been in this business for years and so our customers have varying combinations of technologies. So one of the big things that we need to do is get everybody to the most modern platforms, which we think are very competitive. And when you put the cognitive capabilities on top of it that -- if you haven't seen it, we should get you a demo of it, it's pretty powerful. So we're very confident where we are in this space. Ittai Kidron : Very good. Good luck. Chuck Robbins : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Ittai. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead. Vijay Bhagavath : Yeah, thanks. Hey, Chuck, Kelly, Marilyn\u2026 Marilyn Mora : Vijay, can you speak up a bit? We're having a heard time hearing you. Vijay Bhagavath : Yeah. Can you guys hear me? Chuck Robbins : Yeah. That's better. Thank you. Vijay Bhagavath : Yeah, yeah. First, I mean honestly, I would like to commend you for your recent social contributions. We do monitor that news flow in addition to what's going on in the business with many programs, mitigation programs. Honestly I'd like to commend you on that. And then on the earnings call question, your General Manager seemed quite excited on this WiFi 6, the Campus core switch. So my question to you and helpful for all of us is, how impactful is this new Wi-Fi 6 refresh and the new Campus core, the Catalyst 6000 refresh heading into the back half, and is there a pull forward across the portfolio or would this just be kind of a point product swap? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Yeah. Thanks for your comments, Vijay. On the \u2013 look, I think we have to step back and look at what the team has accomplished on the enterprise networking portfolio. We launched the first Catalyst 9000 in the summer of 2017. And two weeks ago, we completed the portfolio across -- our enterprise routing platforms are going through a refresh, our -- the Catalyst 9000 switching family as well as all of the access points. And if you go back two years ago, we didn't have a single networking product with a software subscription on it. And today, every product in the enterprise routing space, enterprise Wi-Fi space, and the enterprise campus switching space is sold with a mandatory subscription. So, the progress that the teams have made is phenomenal. They've also -- we had multiple operating systems running across those different platforms. We've now consolidated it to a single operating system and it all is running under a single automation platform, so that our customers can deploy policy. So, it's been an incredible amount of work that the teams have done. Now when I look at -- as we've talked about with the customers we're still very early in the transition. If you look at -- you could assume customers used to keep Campus switching products for, I don't know seven years, five to seven years. And we've been at small portions of this portfolio for the last two years, but just very small portions and so we still believe we're in the very early days of the transition. And what you see -- Wi-Fi 6 is effectively what used to be called 802.11ax. And what's happening now is when you get these high performance access points into the organizations and you get the low latency immersive experience possibilities then it's also going to drive the need to upgrade the backbones. Our guys like to say behind every great wireless network is a great wired network and so we think it's the beginning of an overarching refresh for our customers as they modernize their infrastructure based on this cloud transition that they're all going through. So that's how we look at it today. Vijay Bhagavath : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Next question please. Operator : Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead. Sami Badri : Hi, thank you for the question. I'd like to focus in on security and more specifically in the strength in the quarter that you saw. Is that being mainly driven by the new acquisitions you guys have made? Or is that more from legacy? Given that you are refreshing the campus, are you pulling forward some of the more legacy security offerings that you had? Or is this predominantly just strength in the M&A, all the acquisitions you've made being integrated and finally going to market? Chuck Robbins : I'll give you some color and then, Kelly, I'll let you comment on the breakdown of the numbers. I think, this is being driven -- if you think about what's happening with our customers today, they build their security architecture based on the underlying assumption that, they had users at the edge of the network and they had applications in the private data center. And so, the way you architect that was you protected your parameter. And now our customers are operating in an environment where they have mobile users everywhere. They have branches out there. They have this explosion of IoT connectivity that's occurring and they have applications that are running in hundreds of different places, between SaaS applications, their private data center, public clouds. And so the whole notion of a security architecture has changed completely and our teams have been building towards that over the last couple of years. So what happens is, we have to protect the customers' data and their traffic wherever it is, and that's why we've been investing in all these new capabilities, making these acquisitions. And I think that architecture where you can actually see threats across the continuum and then dynamically defend across that same -- those same threat -- that same threat surface area, is what's really driving the growth here. And it's also a part of our business that is very, very, very software-rich and is highly concentrated in subscriptions. And so, we also have that recurring piece of this business, which is what we're trying to drive in the rest of our portfolio. Kelly? Kelly Kramer : Yes. I think the only thing I'll add to that is -- I mean, it's the revenue growth -- obviously, the Duo acquisition I talked about in the earlier comments was part of it. But I can tell you, it was very broad-based across the entire Security portfolio, including network security, advanced threat, cloud security is a big drivers, so very broad-based. And just to add to Chuck's comments, don't forget that, because we are embedding security into this Enterprise Networking portfolio, we also benefit from the great growth that we're seeing in Enterprise portfolio. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you. And then just small follow-up after this. It's just, are you disclosing recurring revenue percentage of total revenue this quarter, just because some of the comments around subscription? Just wondering, if you're giving that out. Kelly Kramer : Yes. No, we haven't really given out the software revenue actual number, but I think the last time we gave it out was at our Financial Analyst Conference. And again, we're growing very quickly the software portfolio in line, if not faster than what we had talked about then. Sami Badri : All right. Thank you. Chuck Robbins : So, well on track or ahead of where we told everyone we would be at the Financial Analyst Conference in 2017. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you very much. Kelly Kramer : Okay. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Chuck. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Paul Silverstein with Cowen & Co. Paul Silverstein : Thanks. Two quick clarifications and a question. Kelly, you announced this shortly, but can you talk about the rate of price erosion and what you're seeing specifically with respect to DRAM? And then, Chuck, on your comment earlier about the 25% tariff, I apologize if I misunderstood, but I just want to make sure. Are you telling us that you shifted all of your supply chain out of China, so there's no exposure going forward? Or is it just a matter that you've incorporated into your guidance? And then for the question, some of your smaller peers have commented about a pause in wireless LAN and related switching deployments. As customers are waiting for Wi-Fi 6, you've now rolled out your Wi-Fi 6 Access Points, you upgraded the new 9600, et cetera, are you seeing that pent-up demand? Kelly Kramer : So maybe I'll start with the first few and then Chuck you can hit on the wireless. So, Paul, on price, we continue to be very disciplined on price. And what you'll see in the Q is from a product gross margin rate impact, it was 1.1 points year-over-year. So right in line, if not, slightly better than what has been in the last few quarters. And to your question on DRAM, yes, as we expected DRAM turned this quarter and became a tailwind for us in Q3. So that is part of why I guided Q3 gross margin where I didn't -- than where we actually ended up on our gross margin at the 64.6%. We're benefiting from that. And if I'll just comment a little bit on the tariff question, as Chuck said, it is baked in our guidance. And from what we have baked in, there will be -- there we still have some manufacturing happening in China, but we've greatly, greatly reduced our exposure working with our supply chain and our suppliers. So the impact that we're expecting that -- again, we're trying to mitigate. We have incorporated in the guide that we gave for Q4 and we think we can manage through that. Of course, we'll be watching that as the quarter goes on. Chuck Robbins : Yes. And, Paul, then on the Wi-Fi, I don't think -- we've not -- I don't think we've seen any substantive change on the Wi-Fi front. I saw some of the same comments earlier in the week, I think. But in general, I think, our customers -- I think that most of our customers are just continuing to build out and I think they'll transition now to the new WiFi 6-enabled ones and keep moving. Kelly Kramer : We launched in the last week of our quarter, so it was too early for the -- take any -- Chuck Robbins : Yes. We wouldn't have any, given when we launched. And the tariffs, I'll tell you, our teams have just done an amazing job. I mean that's the bottom line. And so everybody worked so hard to a point where literally last week the teams executed on everything incremental we needed to do to deal with it. And it's relatively immaterial at this point and it's baked in the guide. Paul Silverstein : Super. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Paul. We'll take our next question? Operator : Thank you. Jim Suva with Citigroup Global Markets. You may go ahead. Jim Suva : Thank you very much. Some companies have talked about pauses in demand, whether it be digestion of inventory, such as overbilling a uncertainty economic environment. It appears, if I'm reading your outlook and your results pretty correctly, you haven't seen that. Can you maybe help us bridge the gap of was it -- did you just have a lot better pulse on the inventory in the channel? Or end markets a little different? Because if I remember right, I think, your cloud sales are north of 20%, but maybe below 30% or something, but we've heard a lot about a pause in cloud spending. Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Yes. I think, the only area where we saw a real shift was in service provider. And across the rest of the business, look, we watch the same TV shows you guys watch. We see the same stress around the world. We see the same risks. But if you go back and look at our quarter, if you just -- obviously SP was SP. But in general our linearity from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter was pretty much the same as it was in the same quarter a year ago, based on where we ended up. So outside of SP, I don't think we saw any substantive change. Kelly Kramer : No. It was really SP. And Jim just to clarify because I saw your note that you published when you say cloud \u2013 if you're meeting the subset web scale, I guess that's not the correct number out there what our \u2013 we've never \u2013 we haven't given it out but I just want to make sure that that's not really kind of like what our web-scale exposure is. Jim Suva : Got you. Okay. Thank you so much for the clarification. Its greatly appreciated. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : Great. Thank you very much. I just wanted to ask a couple of questions perhaps maybe for Kelly on a couple of small things. First deferred revenue was down a little bit quarter-over-quarter and I know that there's been some adjustments around 606. So I'm just wondering, if we can get a little reflection kind of what the mix is doing there. And then also I know you addressed gross margins and some benefit and tailwind you got from components there. But at least the numbers were reported it seemed like a lot of that improvement was concentrated in the APAC region. And just wonder, if we're interpreting that correctly. And if so was there anything unique happening there perhaps that we didn't see in the rest of the world? Kelly Kramer : Yeah. So first the deferred revenue. Yeah \u2013 no it's a great pickup. I will say the only thing that's kind of changed in the deferred revenue is \u2013 and we kind of talk about this maybe a couple of calls ago is really driven by our collab business. They've gone much more to month-to-month billing. So therefore, it doesn't flow through deferred revenue anymore whereas in the past we might \u2013 it might be financed with customers or it would go through \u2013 they'd pay upfront. Now it's really going month-to-month which again is just how it's recognized through the balance sheets. So that's really what's driving it. If you look at the rest of our businesses like with the ramp of the subscriptions of the Enterprise portfolio as well as Security those are all growing quarter-on-quarter. And as you know, the big tick-down from a year ago is because of the change of the accounting standard down. But from a business operational thing the only change is \u2013 quarter-on-quarter is really just the shift to the collab business going more month-to-month versus paying upfront. James Faucette : And can I just ask just a quick follow-up there? And so when should we expect that to stop being a drag? And \u2013 or are we going to see that happen across other parts of the business that you could see some volatility there? Kelly Kramer : No. I think you're going to continue to see \u2013 I mean, again the collab I think is just going through that just how we're changing our offer and what we're offering there. But I think the rest of the business is going to continue to start building up. So, you'll see that get back to I'd say growing here over the next few quarters. James Faucette : Okay. And then the gross margin is seemingly concentrated in APAC. Any major reason for that? Kelly Kramer : Yeah. Actually, the gross margin in APAC was literally very focused mostly in Japan and mostly driven by our \u2013 some big deals in Service Provider that had some lower margins and the typical average that we have in Japan. But it's very isolated to that. James Faucette : Okay. Great. Thanks. Kelly Kramer : Yep. Marilyn Mora : Michelle, let's go ahead and take the next question please. Operator : Thank you. Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. You may go ahead, sir. Mitch Steves : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I only have two. One in kind of the securities side and secondly maybe some back half update. On the security side, growing with 20% plus. I think that back a couple of years ago people would never believe that and would have viewed Cisco as kind of a shared owner. So I guess what has changed in terms of the products that you guys are selling? And then secondly do you think that's something that's more sustainable or let's call it teens growth instead of the historical 10% growth? And then secondly, I know Cisco used to kind of give kind of IT spend number. Can you maybe provide us any sort of commentary in terms of what you guys think of the back half? I mean is the demand environment you guys view better worse or kind of the same? Because I think it's a little bit difficult to figure out what you guys are going to grow out considering the first half has already been solid. So I just wanted to know if you can give any color there as well. Chuck Robbins : Yeah, Mitch. So, on the security front I think it's really what I was talking about earlier. The architectures in our \u2013 for our customers have changed. And I know \u2013 I can remember conversations a couple of years ago about things that we're building. And team would tell me, look we're building for where our customers are going to be next year and the year after. And so, because I was debating with them in some cases about where they were investing and they were right. So they've -- we've had some very strategic acquisitions that have contributed to it and continue to grow. And I do believe that this \u2013 the architecture approach as opposed to historically what we've seen which is when you're defending a perimeter you just \u2013 you can just buy the best-of-breed all around. And just like if I'm defending e-mail, I buy this. If I'm \u2013 I put in a firewall here and it can be \u2013 they don't have to necessarily communicate. And today the architecture really requires a platform where you ingest threat information from lots of different sources and then you dynamically defend across all those same vectors and I think that's what the teams have built. So as far as growth rates we'll have to see. I'm sure they'll move around based on acquisitions and other things that we do. But I think that we're quite happy with where the teams are. I think it's a good solid business for us for a very long time. As far as the IT spending look I don't have anything to add to what we \u2013 what you've heard. I think that in today's world we've \u2013 I've said repeatedly that I've been pretty amazed at the resiliency of the global economy over the last couple of years. There are certainly \u2013 as I said early in our prepared comments there's a lot of dynamics at play around the world. There is a lot of geopolitical issues. We've heard some macro issues in certain cases. And we're just going to continue to execute on the things that we can do. And \u2013 but what's going to happen six months from now I don't have any greater visibility I don't think than anybody else. So. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Mitch. Mitch Steves : Got it. Thank you so much. Marilyn Mora : Yep. Apologies for that. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Jeff Kvaal from Nomura Instinet. You may go ahead. Jeff Kvaal : Yes. Thank you. Just following up on the prior question about web scale. Your progress on web scale has been a little bit TBD for a number of years. I'm wondering, what you can tell us about when you think your efforts in that regard might pay-off, if you think the 400-gig migration is an entry point for you. Or what do we have to look forward to in that particular vertical? Chuck Robbins : Yeah, it's a very valid question. And we have a lot of things going on with the web-scale providers today. I think 400 gig certainly will represent an opportunity for us to insert. I think that the architectural transition points is really where you have an opportunity. We've known that for decades from working with the telcos and service providers. You typically don't insert into an existing architecture. It really requires a transition. So, I think thinking about those kinds of things and 400 gig would be representative of that. But to give you any time line I think we're just going to have to wait and keep plugging away. We're still making progress. We've made a ton of progress on the relationship side. We've got a lot of deep technical discussions that are going on. They're spending a lot of time on our Campus with us. So, we continue to make progress but these are big long-term decisions that they're making and we're going to keep plugging away. Jeff Kvaal : Okay. Well, I'll keep asking then I guess. And then Kelly from your side what can you tell us -- I guess I mean the mix to software does continue to increase. What can you tell us about where you would like the gross margins to be over an intermediate timeframe or whatever timeframe you choose I guess? Fingers crossed. Kelly Kramer : Yes, I mean again I think if you go back and look over the last couple of years of where -- just when you look at our guide over the last three years we've steadily moved up our gross margins. And I think if you go back three years we were guiding 61% to 62%. We've steadily come up. And when I guided Q3 I moved up another 0.5 point to get to the 63% 64%. So, again you're seeing that go through our gross margins as we're going up there. I think there's always puts and takes. We have the natural price erosion that we see every quarter but we're driving productivity. DRAM turnaround is helping us a lot and that's going to help us with positivity there. It's going to help us if we do have again incremental costs we can offset whether it's tariffs or anything else. So, the 64% to 65% here we're guiding now I think is pretty good. And our whole goal and the whole reason we're making the shift to software besides to continue innovation is it's a great way to drive margin accretion. So, you're just going to continue to see us shift our portfolio that way. Jeff Kvaal : Okay. Thank you. Kelly Kramer : Yes. All right Michelle, let's tee-up the next question. Operator : Thank you. Jim Fish with Piper Jaffray, you may go ahead. Jim Fish : Hey Chuck and Kelly congrats on a fantastic quarter and execution here. Maybe just going back to Rod's initial question specifically around 5G. Maybe what products do you expect to benefit with or are you seeing orders for already? I know its early days. But then Kelly maybe you could discuss is there going to be any impact related to the shift of VNS on the model? Like should we expect lower revenue contribution in the cycle but higher gross margin kind of going off to what you were just saying before to? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Okay. Jim so let me -- on the 5G front I think there's a couple of things I would call out. Number one the CapEx data that we saw last quarter -- and even the forecast don't look incredibly healthy for these guys. But where they are spending money primarily today as it relates to 5G is they're building out the macro radio portion of their networks first and they're leveraging their existing core networks to run the early trials that they have on 5G basically. And we believe that sometime in the future when they have -- when the number of connections increases and the capacity gets to a point then they're obviously going to begin to build out these new backbones dedicated to the 5G infrastructure which is where we will generally come into play. We're also obviously selling them packet core technology for the new 5G networks today but the big play for us is when they begin to evolve their networks to accommodate the traffic. And we've always said we felt like that would be sometime in calendar 2020. We're working with lots of them on architectural designs and where they're going but it's really going to be core routing backbone technology where we're going to see -- we should see the big impact from 5G. And we'll obviously have to wait and see how it plays out. Kelly Kramer : Yes. And just on the VNS I would just say I don't SP customers are a little different than Enterprise customers right? Everybody's looking for automation and software-defined everything and I think our entire portfolio is moving that direction. And it's just the nature of the beast whether it's SP or enterprise right? Prices for core are getting less and less the more that we're driving just more throughput and everything else. So, it's nothing VNS-specific but it's the entire portfolio. The software value -- the values where the software is in the automation that we're bringing to our customers. Jim Fish : Great. Thanks. Congrats again. Kelly Kramer : Thanks. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Steve Milunovich from Wolfe Research, you may go ahead. Steve Milunovich : Thank you. First Kelly any concern about bridging the 4% order growth to the 4.5% to 6% revenue growth? And maybe while you're talking about that you could net out the year-over-year impact of 606 M&A which I think you gave us and then deferred which I think is still a bit of a drag and maybe how that might look next quarter. And then Chuck I think you wanted to kind of tweak the culture a bit when you came in. And if you could update us in terms of things like your Net Promoter Score externally your return on employee surveys how you sort of assess the culture and if that's part of the results that we're seeing. Chuck Robbins : Kelly? Kelly Kramer : Yes sure. So, I'll take the topline first. So, yes, the 4% orders growth again like Chuck said if you look at the rest of the business they were all up the 9% for enterprise 10% for public sector 5% for commercial. So that's all great strengths. It's service provider where we had the issue. And as you know when we guide we have what's sitting in backlog. We can -- we have very good visibility into the pipeline and we have -- we work with all our regional sales leaders in terms of what they're seeing. So, we feel very comfortable with the guide that we're giving you based on all of those factors. So, it's basically incorporated for the SP slowdown that we saw in the orders. In terms of the revenue question so yes we talked about acquisitions. It's really only Duo and a very tiny bit of Luxtera as our inorganic from the acquisition. So, it was only 40 basis points of our growth. And the 606 impact this quarter was only 1.2 points so it was a relatively small number compared to the other quarter. So, it was 1% -- slightly over 1% 1.2 points from that perspective. And then on the deferred it's -- that's more of a one of the puts and takes on the margin driver because we are like for example on the Enterprise Networking portfolio deferring we're still deferring. Even though we're deferring last, we're still deferring. So that kind of -- as we have these new replacement products that we have the subscription on. That hurts your rate a little bit, but it's nothing material. So from a revenue, the 606 and acquisitions are fairly small. Chuck Robbins : And Steve, on the culture issue, we've basically I think been amplifying what's always been a core part of Cisco, but really, really prioritizing it and trying to just create an environment in today's world where people want to work because it's an incredibly competitive environment for talent. And I guess, the way that we look in metrics -- we've been focused on communication with our employee\u2019s, clear authentic frequent communication. We've been focused on giving back. And what we've discovered is that we have a lot of employees who care deeply about giving back to their communities and so I've told them that our ability to give back and our ability to do the things that they love to do is highly contingent upon us running a great business. And so the two are very interconnected. As far as how do we rate it? I mean if you look at every external employer ranking, we've moved up. The one -- I tell you around the world, great places to work. I think we're number one in countries around the world, maybe 15 to 20 countries around the world. And in the U.S. which is one that just came out recently, we -- I think when I became CEO, we're number 87 in the U.S. And two months ago, we were rated number six. And over 70% of the input for that rate -- those rankings come directly from the employees. And we obviously watch Glassdoor where we're above 4.0 and all those kinds of things. So we're working very hard on it. We think it's important because of -- it's important because when your employees are happy, they actually do a much better job and help the overall results. So it's somewhat cyclical. Steve Milunovich : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : All right. I believe, we have time for one last question. Operator : Thank you. Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research, you may go ahead. Pierre Ferragu : Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Chuck, I heard you talk about how Cisco technology gets small and more integrated with the platform of leading cloud vendor. As you can imagine, I love hearing that having different -- quite a long time that the Enterprise IT will expand into the cloud that this is going to migrate to the cloud. So I was curious to hear from you a bit more on that in terms of how big it is today in your business. I don't know if you have any idea of the take rate of Cisco technology that are moved to -- that are integrated with the cloud vendors. And if so how do you go to market with the technology? Do you go to market in partnership with cloud vendors? Is that something you have directly to your clients? And of course any idea of the business model how big it is in your revenues already today. Chuck Robbins : Yes. Thanks Pierre. It's really hard to quantify because the technology that we're building that is either integrated in with the cloud providers or offered off the cloud platforms or enabling our customers to transition to the cloud or expand to the cloud as you put which is the same word we like to use. So we appreciate you coming up with that. We still -- it's everything from extending ACI from the private data center into the cloud to offering virtualized routing functions off of AWS and Azure for developers, virtualized security services even to the SD-WAN technology and now integrating it with our cloud security gateways and then the integration of some of these hybrid stacks like Azure Stack or what we talked about from Google that they announced recently integrating that with our technology on-premise the Kubernetes stack that we've done. So there's an awful lot of areas where we play. We talk about the fact that while customers are moving some applications to the cloud, they didn't move their employees to the cloud. And so there's a big opportunity which is what we've been focused on which is to evolve this access portfolio to really enable this transition to the cloud that our customers have been undertaking. So it really is touching massive amounts of our portfolio and I think you'll only see us continue to drive more technology that facilitates our customers' move in this area. So appreciate the question. Chuck Robbins : So I'll wrap up. I want to thank everybody for spending time with us today. Obviously, we're proud of what our teams continue to accomplish. We're operating in an environment that has very complex macro and geopolitical dynamics right now. But we're continuing to execute as well as we can on the things that we control and that's what we plan to do going forward. So thanks for spending time with us today and we look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Chuck. This is Marilyn. Just want to close up the call here. So Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call which will reflect our fiscal 2019 fourth quarter and annual results will be on Wednesday, August 14, 2019 at 1 :30 PM Pacific Time, 4:30 PM Eastern time. Again I'd like to remind the audience that in light of Regulation FD, Cisco's policy is not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it's done through an explicit public disclosure. We now plan to close the call. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact the Cisco Investor Relations department and we're very much looking forward to speaking with you through the remainder of the week. Thank you for joining today. Operator : And thank you for participating on today's conference call. If you would like to listen to the call in its entirety, you may call 888-446-2545. For participants dialing from outside the U.S., please dial 402-998-1344. This concludes today's call. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.",

If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am you may begin. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Michelle. Welcome everyone to Cisco's fourth quarter fiscal 2019 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now you should have seen our earnings press release a corresponding webcast with slides including supplemental information will be made available on our Web site in the Investor Relations section following the call.  Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found in the financial information section of our Investor Relations Web site. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements including the guidance we will be providing for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. In Q2, on October 28, we completed the sale of our SPVSS business and accordingly had no revenue or expense from that business in Q4 fiscal 2019. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP, and product orders information we will be discussing today is normalized to exclude the SPVSS business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SPVSS business in the slides that accompany this call and on our Web site to help understand these impacts. The guidance we provided during our Q3 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way. With that, I will now turn it over to Chuck. Chuck Robbins : Thank you, Marilyn. Good afternoon everyone. Our Q4 results marked a strong end to great year. Our teams executed well through a very dynamic environment. We delivered significant innovation across our entire portfolio and we continued our business model transition with software subscriptions now at 70% of total software revenue, up 12 points year-over-year. We delivered strong revenue and double-digit non-GAAP earnings per share growth for the full year and in the fourth quarter. We also continue to generate healthy margins, cash flow, and returns for our shareholders. Our technology is fundamentally redefining IT architectures to help our customers manage the complexities of a multi-cloud world and transform for the future. Let me cover some recent highlights across our portfolio. Starting with infrastructure platforms. We continue to see strong performance with broad based growth across the majority of our portfolio led by our next generation enterprise networking solutions. Over the last two years, we have built a foundation for intent-based networking by rearchitecting our entire networking portfolio to deliver new capabilities through our automation platform. At Cisco Live, we launched several new technology innovations across networking domains to more effectively secure and manage users and applications across the entire enterprise from campus networks and wide area networks, to data centers and the IoT Edge. We also added several AI and ML software capabilities to improve network management through automation. A great example of this is our new AI network analytics capability which delivers greater visibility and insights across the entire enterprise network. In data center, we continue to execute well as we help enable our customers to securely access their applications and their data anywhere from private to public cloud environments as well as at the Edge. We are innovating across every facet of our portfolio integrating AI, automation, security, and assurance into our Nexus switching platforms and our 400-gig offerings. This quarter, we delivered data center network insights providing critical analytics and proactive network management capabilities through automation to increase our customers' ability to troubleshoot and remediate their environments. We also continue to invest in silicon and optics to build the next generation Internet for our customers. The recently announced intent to acquire Acacia is a good example of how we are enhancing our silicon and optics portfolio to enable web scale service provider and data center operator customers to meet today's fast growing consumer demand for data. Now turning to security, which had an incredible year. Cybersecurity continues to be the top priority for our customers, driving another consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. As the industry leader in networking and cybersecurity, we're investing in and extending our subscription-based security innovations across all networking domains in today's zero trust environment. By extending our ability to detect threats across public clouds and by protecting the campus, branch, WAN, and data center against threats, we are the only company providing an integrated end-to-end security architecture across multi-cloud environments. Throughout the year, we've expanded our family of cloud security solutions to help secure identity, endpoints, and the network, which has led to accelerating customer adoption as they move or expand to the cloud. We're also extending this protection from the network to branch offices to roaming users with flexible solutions designed to secure our customers\u2019 SD-WAN environments. During the quarter, we were excited to announce the availability of a full Web proxy capability on our global SaaS platform umbrella to complement our on-premise appliances. Trust plays a critical role as customers access their network and applications, and identity plays a critical role in delivering a secure consistent experience no matter how, when, or where they connect. This market dynamic was central to our Duo Security acquisition, and we continue to see customer momentum -- customer momentum reflecting the power of Duo's differentiated market leading SaaS platform. Moving to applications. Our collaboration business continues to perform well as we execute against our strategy to accelerate the future of work, communications, and collaboration. Earlier this year, we shared our vision for cognitive collaboration, which we believe is quickly becoming the foundation to deliver massively personalized experiences and transform how we work. We are leading the market in integrating AI. and ML into our enterprise collaboration portfolio bringing intelligence and context to help our customers work smarter and increase productivity. Through our AI-driven innovations like people insights, facial recognition, and Webex Assistant, we're driving expanded collaboration experiences on any device integrated with our customer's business process workflows. Building on these cognitive innovations, we announced our intent to acquire Voicea, a market-leading provider of voice-based artificial intelligence solutions. With Voicea's technology, we will enhance our entire Webex portfolio with a powerful transcription service combining AI and automated speech recognition to enable more actionable meetings, improve productivity, and enhance experiences. We also achieved another outstanding quarter of growth with our AppDynamics demonstrating rapid customer adoption of our differentiated end-to-end visibility and analytics platform from the end user to the network to the application. In summary, we had a great quarter and finish to fiscal year 2019, and I'm proud of what our teams have accomplished. We are executing well in a time of uncertainty, delivering differentiated innovation across our portfolio, and extending our market leadership and enterprise networking applications and security. Our performance reflects our relevance as well as the ongoing value we're providing our customers as they transform for the future. We are as committed as ever to providing them with the right innovation to drive greater impact and success. As I look ahead, I could not be more confident about our unique position in the market and the tremendous opportunity in front of us. Kelly, I'll now turn it over to you. Kelly Kramer : Thanks Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter. Then cover the full fiscal year followed by the guidance for Q1. Q4 was a great quarter across the business. We executed well with strong revenue growth, margins, net income, and EPS. Total revenue was 13.4 billion, up 6%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 32.6%, up 1.4 points. Non-GAAP net income was 3.6 billion, up 9%, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.83, up 19%. Let me provide some more detail on our Q4 revenue. Total product revenue was up 7% to 10.1 billion, infrastructure platforms grew 6%, all of the businesses were up with the exception of routing. Switching had a great quarter with double-digit growth, driven by both campus and data center with the continued ramp of the Cat9k and strength of the Nexus9k. We saw solid growth in wireless across the portfolio. Data center was up with growth in both HyperFlex and Servers. Routing declined due to weakness in service provider. Applications was up 11% with collaboration, AppDynamics, and IoT software all up double digits. Security was up 14% with strong performance in identity and access, advanced threat, unified threat, and Web security. Service revenue was up 4% driven by software and solution support. We continue to transform our business delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions where 70% of total software revenue up 12 points year-over-year. When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our Q4 results year-over-year, there was a 60 basis point positive impact on revenue. In terms of orders in Q4, total product orders growth was flat. Looking at our geographies Americas was up 1%, EMEA was up 4% and APJC was down 8%. Total emerging markets was down 8% with the BRICS plus Mexico down 20%. In our customer segments, enterprise was down 2%, commercial grew 7%, public sector was up 13% and service provider was down 21%. Remaining performance obligations or RPO at the end of Q4 was 25.3 billion. RPO is our deferred revenue plus unbilled deferred and represents total committed non-cancelable future revenue. From a non-gap profitability perspective, total Q4 gross margin was 65.5% up to 2.3 points. Product gross margin was 64.7% up 2.8 points and service gross margin was 67.9% up 0.7 points. In terms of the bottom-line from a GAAP perspective, Q4 net income was 2.2 billion and EPS was $0.51. The GAAP results include a charge of approximately $900 million, which is a reversal of a tax benefit recorded in Q4 fiscal year '18, which relates to new U.S. Treasury Regulations issued during the quarter related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of 33.4 billion, operating cash flow was 3.9 billion down 4%. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned 6 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of 4.5 billion of share repurchases and 1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend. In our Q2 fiscal '18 earnings call, we said we would return 31 billion through share repurchases over the following 18 to 24 months. As of Q4 fiscal '19, we completed that commitment with share repurchases of 32.6 billion. Going forward, we will return to our capital allocation strategy of returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders annually through share repurchases and dividends. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline, during Q4 we announced our intent to acquire Acacia, an existing supplier that is focused on Optical Interconnect Technologies. This move is consistent with our strategy of increasing investment and innovation and R&D for our growth areas. I'll now cover the full fiscal year results. We delivered strong revenue growth margins, net income, EPS and operating cash flow. Revenue was 51.7 billion up 7%, total non-GAAP gross margin was 64.6% up 0.3 points and our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 32.3% up 0.7 points. From a bottom-line perspective, non-GAAP net income was 13.8 billion up 9% and non-GAAP EPS was $3.10 up 20%. GAAP net income was 11.6 billion and GAAP EPS was $2.61. We delivered operating cash flow of 15.8 billion up 16%, normalized for the tax payments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in each fiscal year and the cash received in Q1 fiscal '19 related to the legal settlement with Arista, operating cash flow was up 8%. To summarize, we had a strong Q4 and fiscal year. We executed well a strong top-line growth and profitability and we're seeing the returns in the investments we're making in innovation, driving the shift to more software and subscriptions delivering long-term growth in shareholder value. Let me reiterate our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal '20. This guidance includes a type of forward-looking information that Marilyn refer to earlier. Note that we have normalized our first quarter guidance to exclude the SPVSS business for Q1 fiscal '19, which we divested in October 28, 2018. We have provided historical financial information for the SPVSS business in the slides that accompany this call. We expect revenue growth in the range of 0% to 2% year over year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64% to 65%. The non-gap operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 32% to 33% and non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 20%. The 1% increase in tax rate over fiscal '19 is primarily due to a forecasted decrease in tax benefit from foreign income. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.80 to $0.82. I'll turn it back to Marilyn, so we can move into the Q&A. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Kelly. Michelle let's go ahead and tee up and open the line for questions. And while Michelle is doing that I'd like to remind the audience to limit yourself to one question. Operator : Thank you. Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead. Rod Hall : Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess I'm going to ask the obvious one and then maybe pepper in a little bit of detailed color if I can get it. The guidance is weaker than, I think we had anticipated, we know it's a tough macro environment. So, just hoping Chuck that you would maybe comment on that? And maybe juxtapose the change in trend in enterprise orders which did weaken quite a bit with commercial which seems to be holding up fine and kind of why that is going on? And then, Kelly, if you could comment on backlog as well, I know you guys usually give it in the K, so it would be great to get that number as well. Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Hey, Rod. Thanks for the question. So, let me start by saying first of all the strategy and the work that we've done on our portfolio and the engagement with our customers is absolutely going in the right direction and we continue to make progress and the strategy is working. So, we're quite happy with what our teams have accomplished and where we are right now in that space. There's a couple of things that we saw in the quarter and I'll outline these, and then I'll answer Rod to your question about the enterprise. First is that, we had continued challenges in service provider and I'll double click on that in just a moment. As you saw in the order growth that Kelly talked about. And then, we did see in July some slight early indications of some macro shifts that we didn't see in the prior quarter. So, those are the two things that happened. Let me double click on service provider just a bit. The Americas was generally the same from an order perspective from the prior quarter, so no real shift positive or negative. Europe was actually positive in the SP space. In Asia, we saw continued weakening in our China service provider business and we had two massive build outs in India a year ago that just didn't replicate this year with the two major players there. That's the net of the service provider situation it's not more complicated than that. If you look at our overall business, our orders outside of service provider grew mid-single digits. So, we feel good in this environment about the rest of the portfolio and the work that we're doing to those customers. As it relates to commercial enterprise and public sector and I'm going to probably give you a little more granularity than normal just so you understand with what we believe went on. You can see that the portfolio that is being sold into all three of those segments is obviously being well received. Our public sector business on a global basis was up 13%. So, we continue to see success and as you mentioned Rod, global commercial was up 7. The enterprise business was really, we saw weakness in China, which was contributed to it. We saw some weakness in the U.K. in enterprise, and then candidly in the U.S. as much as I don't want to use compares for an excuse, we had two major software deals a year ago that were tough to compare against. So, that's really it. The rest of the business and everything we see is still very positive, and we feel good about where we are. Rod Hall : Thanks for that Chuck. Kelly Kramer : Yes. Right, on your backlog question, since we adopted ASC 606, we've been disclosing our RPO, which is a more meaningful metric of our future revenue because again with the problem with our backlog, it didn't include our subscription businesses, so it didn't include anything on collaboration or security. So, RPO has everything it has, the deferred revenue, the unbilled deferred, and any committed future revenue and like we\u2019ve disclosed in our Qs, we expect -- of that 25.3 billion, we expect about 56% of that to be recognized over the next 12 months. Rod Hall : Okay. Thanks a lot Kelly. Kelly Kramer : Yes. Marilyn Mora : Next question please. Operator : Paul Silverstein with Cowen. You may go ahead. Paul Silverstein : I appreciate it. Just a follow-up from Rod's question, Chuck, a clarification. I felt China was not down or had been down for a while. So, well, less than 3% of revenue and I guess that's not zero. So, you still have exposure. But, I'm surprised it impacted you to the extent you suggested. And then, I want to ask Kelly about the pricing environment, I assume there's been no change in what we should expect for margins throughout the year. I assume they're going up on both the gross and the operating line given DRAM and the ongoing shift in software, along with benign pricing environment, but if you could comment on that. Chuck Robbins : Yes. Let me just comment on the China situation. I mean you're right, it's down below 3, it's a small part of our business, but obviously when it falls very dramatically, it can still have some impact because it is greater than zero. But, long term, it's not a concern that I worry about much at this point. And so, that's really the extent of what we saw there. I mean the China reduction contributed to a point of the issue in all of enterprise for us. So, it was that significant, and we definitely saw significant impact on our business in China as it relates to what's going on with the trade war right now. Kelly Kramer : And then, Paul on your margin question. So, yes, pricing, the environment stays good, actually we had a very good quarter on pricing. It was less than a point that you'll see when we give you the Q. So, that's been very good. And again, you can see, we are benefiting in our gross margins and OMs from the tailwind from DRAM as we expected and you're seeing that in not only the results but also as we've been guiding on the margin. Paul Silverstein : Appreciate it. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Paul. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Tejas Venkatesh from UBS. You may go ahead. Tejas Venkatesh : Thank you. You obviously give a year-over-year order growth number every quarter, but I wonder if you could give us a sense of what the sequential looks like versus historical seasonality. If I have my math right sequential order growth looks somewhat in line with seasonality, but your revenue guide is a tad below where you've grown sequentially in recent years. So I just want to confirm that's right. And then, secondly, you're coming off a strong year of 7% revenue growth. I know you don't guide for the year, but expect -- investor expectations were somewhat high and I wonder if you could comment even qualitatively on how to think about full year revenue growth. Thank you very much. Kelly Kramer : Hey, Tejas. So, yes, you're right on our sequential down orders. I mean if we've had this phenomena -- it's not a phenomena, but our Q4 always has a double-digit growth in Q4, it's our largest quarter from a dollar perspective on orders growth for us. So, that happen and then I -- again in Q1 it's double-digit down. So, the sequential isn't a change from historical and again the year-over-year takes into account the kind of phenomenon we're seeing now. In terms of the long-term guide, again, we don't give more than one quarter. I would say to Chuck's earlier point in terms of how we feel about the portfolio and the margins and the update we feel good about that. The macro and the certain segment issues like SP, I think that I don't foresee that. I'm not planning on that changing in the near-term. Marilyn Mora : Okay. Thanks Kelly. Michelle, next question. Operator : Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead. Sami Badri : Hi. Thank you. I was hoping you could kind of just give us an update on the campus switching refresh. And then, perhaps maybe your view on where we'll be next year as you see the campus switching cycle playing out and maybe even potentially more consistent data center switching deployments play out especially, since we're going through some transitions in an industry. So, I guess what I really wish we all understand is, where we are in the cycle, where we in like the fifth maybe sixth maybe even first or second ending the way you see it and then maybe the equivalent of where we see that for data center switching for your customers? Chuck Robbins : Hey, Sami. Thanks. It's a great question. So, in the last 120, 180 days, I mean we completed the full refresh of our portfolio across switching, routing and wireless in the enterprise. And we're now in a position where all of those have mandatory subscriptions. So we've made that transition from a product development perspective and now those are all out in the marketplace with our customers. On the catalyst 9000, Q4 was the -- we added more customers in Q4 for the catalyst 9000 than in any quarter prior. So, that continues to move forward favorably. In the campus what I would suggest to you is that we're -- I'd say maybe we're in the second inning at this point of this transition that we see from our customers. As you know they're all rearchitecting their entire enterprise infrastructure to accommodate these traffic flows that are presented from the massive number of cloud applications that they're running. And so it requires a completely different architecture which is what this portfolio is built for. As it relates to data center, I think that next year you'll probably begin to see some upgrades transitions when the pure 400 gig optics are available. And one of the things that we believe is a big differentiator for us is that we're extending this policy management out of the data center into the campus, from the campus into the wide area, from the wide area into the cloud security portfolios. So, we think being able to enable our customers to deliver policy from the data center all the way across the campus to the branch into the cloud is a very unique differentiator for us. And we think, we'll begin to see customers adopting and deploying that sometime in the next year as well. So that's how we see that playing out. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Tal Liani from Bank of America. You may go ahead. Tal Liani : Yes. Hi, guys. If you look at the growth this quarter, it's about 1%. And then, a few quarters ago. Marilyn Mora : Hey, Tal. Can you speak up just a little bit? Tal Liani : Yes. Can you hear me? Chuck Robbins : Yes. Better, yes. Tal Liani : I'll pick it up here you go. Now it's better. This quarter you're guiding for 1% growth, a few quarters ago, you reported 8%, but you had roughly organically growing -- you were growing about 4% to 4.5%. Can you take the 1% did you have now, and then build on top of it all the things that you're seeing today to see what's the growth environment now that is more sustainable going forward. I'm trying -- I have difficulties to go from 4%, 4.5% to 1% within like three quarters. And if it's not a major deceleration in the growth environment what could it be? So you mentioned China, what are the other things that are happening today that are unique to Q1 that are bringing the growth down so much from the levels we've seen just a few quarters ago. Kelly Kramer : Hey, Tal. I'll take a crack at it. I mean at the end of the day, when we are guiding it's based on what we're seeing with the orders [around] [ph] and the pipeline and everything else. And the biggest driver of the guide where it is, is the massive decline we've seen in service provider over the last few quarters. So, that is the biggest driver. Again, like Chuck said, we feel good about the risk portfolio from [indiscernible] perspective growing in the -mid single digits. But, China is part of it, but again like we said it's small in comparison, but SP is still a large part of the business and that's driving this outlook that you're seeing. Tal Liani : So, what's the -- can you quantify this, can you quantify what is the decline in the growth related to service providers and you think you mentioned one point is related to China. Am I correct? Kelly Kramer : We are talking about for that is, for the orders rate that we just had -- the order rates for enterprise being down 2 points, 1 point of that at the global level was adjusted China alone. China overall was down over 25% this quarter for us. Tal Liani : Got it. And if I can just have a follow up on China. We always thought that you're not selling much in China. It's hard to compete in China. Where are you --w here did you have position in China. I know you were selling some routers to service providers, but where are you selling in China and what's being impacted in China, what are the types of products that you're selling into the Chinese market. Chuck Robbins : Let me just give you a little bit of color then Kelly I can give you some numbers. I mean tell the overall Chinese market as I said earlier is certainly not a major play for us, but it has just dropped precipitously in light of the trade discussions. So, it has a short-term impact and if you were -- where we are selling for years we've sold infrastructure to the large carriers in China, which has just -- it's been slowly declining and we saw it even decline more rapidly last quarter. And then, what we've seen is in the state-owned enterprises anymore, we're just being we're being uninvited to bid. We're not being allowed to even participate anymore. So those are the enterprises that's where the large impact was this past quarter, so it was just a much faster decline of what we candidly expected. Kelly Kramer : Yes. And I would just add to that. So, again we talk about the big impact that had on enterprise. It was -- the second largest was down in service provider which is part of our overall service provider being down. But, from a product perspective, we sell everything there from switches, routers all the way down through security and Meraki products. So we sell everything including collab in China and everything is being impacted. Tai Liani : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Tal. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Jim Suva from Citigroup Investment Research. You may go ahead. Jim Suva : Thank you very much, Chuck and Kelly, you've been very clear about the softness in revenues. When offer the outlook, when you think about the outlook and a lot of it seems to be service provider, softness that has not been a new theme you've talked about it for the past several quarters. So, where we sit today looking out, is there a lot of risk that it could get worse or you kind of looking at this saying, we're kind of near a bottom for service provider trends because it's been chugging along pretty low and they're starting to sweat their assets potentially. Or is there still some risk that you have, they're just kind of thinking about the service provider headwinds. Could it get worse, or is it you looking at it and saying hey we're calling for a bottom. Chuck Robbins : Look I think that, when you get into this area there, there is certainly pressure in the business models across all different types of service providers. I think that if you look at the early 5G build outs, most of the telco customers, we have particularly in Americas, they're focused on the consumer 5G trials today they're not -- I mean that is the primary focus. And then getting their 5G consumer networks built out. But they also don't -- I would say don't anticipate that being a huge profit driver off of the 5G transition that's going to come when they build more robust broader 5G infrastructure where they'll deliver enterprise services and that's going to come after they do the consumer side. So, it's a bit unclear when that will take place. I'd say we're not modeling and don't anticipate any significant improvement in this business in the very near term. And we're just going to have to wait and see. It's been a tough business for us for years and it's now -- it obviously represents a much smaller percentage of our business than it did five years ago. But it clearly was a major point of weakness for us in the last quarter. Jim Suva : Thank you very much. Chuck Robbins : Do you want to add anything to that Kelly? Kelly Kramer : I think you got it. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Chuck. Let's go ahead and take the next question. Operator : Thank you. James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead sir. James Faucette : Great. Thanks. I just had a couple of questions, one related to gross margins and one to the deferred revenue. On gross margins, Kelly, it looks like even though the July quarter was very good, is that you're guiding for both the gross margins to be flat to down a little bit and sequentially historically we've seen at least some improvement. So I'm wondering if you can help parse a little bit what may be going on there. And my second question is, deferred revenue actually looks quite good. So, can you give us some insight into how much of that may be ELAs or software or other aspects, so we can get a little bit more color on what's driving the deferred revenue? Thanks. Kelly Kramer : So, on the margin, yes, I mean I'd say the margins are going great. We feel good about it. I kept the range in that 64% to 65% to take into account the cutting end of list four of the tariffs. Again, we're going to run the same play that we have for all the other tariffs and we'll be -- again we continue to mitigate, we continue to do everything we can do. But, we see that in that range, which I think is pretty good. And as you look as that falls down through them and are actually doing well and I've actually raised a little bit on the OM guide. So again, I think we're able to offset the headwinds from tariffs was again continued benefit from the software which leads to your point of the deferred revenue. Yes, I mean again we continue to add to deferred revenue, which again is why I think look at that RPO is a key metric which has both the deferred revenue as well as unbilled deferred when you have month-to-month contracts, it shows the progress we've made. Just to remind you guys, we adopted ASC 606 at the beginning of the fiscal year, we wrote-off 2.8 billion from our deferred revenue balance for the new accounting rule. And again, you're seeing just big sequential increases since then as we just continue to ramp the portfolio with like for example the entire enterprise portfolio that all have subscriptions. So it's broad based, we continue to have great adoption of the new products, all the subscriptions we have great adoption of the ELAs. We had really strong performance of software and ELAs in Q4. So, it's all going in the right direction which is again that's why we're still despite any macro environment why we're so bullish on the overall strategy of the company what we're doing an a transformation. Chuck Robbins : Hey, James. If I might add to that, I know like three years ago, I think I made a comment on one of the earnings calls that I felt like we had figured out how we could drive a subscription business on top of networking products. And now here we are and we've got every product in our portfolio in the enterprise networking now that has mandatory subscription. And we really started showing that two years ago, so the first renewal window is really still a year away. So that's -- the team has done a great job that transition has been good. We're on track with what we told everyone in the Financial Analyst Conference where we'd be relative to our software. And I think that's what you're seeing show up in the RPO metrics as well. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Chuck. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Tim Long from Barclays. You may go ahead. Tim Long : Thank you. Yes. Just to follow-up and another question if I could. Chuck, you mentioned a little bit of the weakness was also related to some macro shifts in the month of July. Could you talk a little bit about that kind of what we are seeing with deals pushing out, scaling down more competition or anything like that? And then, you also had mentioned the move to 400 gig upgrades next year. Could you talk a little bit about how you think Cisco will fare in these data center deals as we move to 400 gig and this strategy to take in-house and develop more optics internally, do you think that helps as early as that 400 gig transition? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Yes. Thanks Tim. So basically we just felt a slight difference in July. I mean relative to close rates and just -- it just wasn't as strong a finish as we would normally expect particularly in Q4 and I think that's what kind of set off the flags for Kelly and I. I've met with 17 customers in the last five, six business days and nothing's changed about how they're thinking about the role of technology and what we do and how we're playing there. So we're monitoring this, we're watching it, we'll see. Obviously, I think what we've seen in the markets in the last few weeks and what we hear from some of the other players would indicate that others have seen similar things some a lot worse. And I do feel very good about our position and where we are in the level of criticality that we are playing with our customers now versus five, six years ago and I think that. So, I feel good about that piece. But, that's really what we felt and we'll just have to see how it plays out and whether we get any resolution on some of these major geopolitical issues that are sort of lingering out there. I've said for like 18 months that I've been amazed at the resilience of the economy and hopefully it can bounce back pretty quick if we get to some -- get more clarity on some of these issues which I think people are just -- I think they're just hedging their bets relative to some resolution on some of the stuff. And then, the second question was around -- oh around the 400 gig and around. Yes, I'll tell you -- we have -- I feel good about it, number one, where we're in the game. We have our technology roadmaps mapped out. Our teams have made these acquisitions, which allows us to have good control of our components that go into these products. We've talked to lots of customers including the Web scale providers who are very supportive of where we're headed what we're doing. They're supportive of the strategy. They like the acquisitions. And so, we feel good that we'll be in a good place in a much better position to compete in this transition than we were last time around. So I feel good about where we are. Tim Long : Okay. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Next question please. Operator : Simon Leopold from Raymond James. You may go ahead. Simon Leopold : Thank you for taking the question. I know you don't want to guide beyond the quarter, but maybe if you could help us sort of level set how to think about the year given that I think you're facing a pretty tough comparison in October. And so guiding 0% to 2% seems to set a new level, but if I just apply normal seasonality through the balance of the year, it would look like the year-over-year growth rate should come back somewhat in the January through July quarters. I just want to see how we should think about really the full fiscal year trending. Kelly Kramer : Yes. Hey, Simon. I think the way you're looking at, I mean, again, we don't guide and again there's a lot of unknown out there. But, I'll say the way you think about kind of the right way. I think the way you're thinking about the second half certainly, you get more normalized compares on that in the second half. But, I think the way you're looking at it is very rational. Simon Leopold : And just a quick, do you have a metric for percent of revenue that's recurring. I think you've given it in the past and then with the fiscal year over hope you maybe have that number. Kelly Kramer : Yes. I know, Simon, we started this fiscal year on that, when we adopted 606 because a lot of our recurring subscriptions like for example D&A, with the Cat9K because of the accounting it changes how we have to recognize it. So that's why really the metric that that we talk about now is how much of our software revenue is subscription based, so recurring isn't as meaningful. Simon Leopold : Okay. Thanks for taking the questions. Kelly Kramer : Sure. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Simon. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Jeff Kvaal from Nomura Instinet. You may go ahead. Jeff Kvaal : Thank you very much. Kelly, you had mentioned a little earlier that you're taking the operating margin up a shade. I wonder if you could comment on how you are making the magic happen there in light of a little bit of a lower revenue trajectory than we all might have hoped for a few months ago. And then, just to clarify your capital return plan sounds like it's going to be mostly about the dividend here rather than buybacks going forward. Well thanks. Kelly Kramer : Yes, sure. So on, yes, on the profitability on OM, I think it's not magic, right? It is -- we are working the gross margins hard with like we talked earlier. And then, we're also work in the OpEx side hard as always as well our engineering teams do a really good job of rebalancing their portfolios and making sure they're investing in the right stuff and we are constantly driving for efficiency. So, it's good old fashioned running the business and executing well despite the top-line. So, that's how that's happening and on the capital allocation. Yes. So, if you go back to when we dig a tax reform back in Q2 of '18 and we announced the big buyback, we had a 31 billion authorization then and we said we'd use that 31 billion. We did effectively use that up through -- up till now, the 18 months. And so, now, since we've really gotten our balance sheet where we want it in terms of -- we reduced our debt. We've brought our cash balance from 74 billion back then now to 33 billion. We've reduced our debt from 35 down to 25. We're going to get back to our normal strategy, which is being very opportunistic when our stocks down like on days like today in buying. But, really balancing between both the dividend and the buyback to be at least 50% of our free cash flow. Jeff Kvaal : Okay. Thank you. Kelly Kramer : Yes. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Kelly. Chuck. Our last question. Chuck Robbins : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. You may go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi. Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I just wanted to follow up on the guidance you guys mentioned the service provider weakness is kind of what's driving the weakness, and then, although there seems to be a broader concern here from investors relative to a slowdown in enterprise spending. So, I just want to get your thoughts particularly given the change in the business towards kind of higher software subscription mix. How should we think about levers you can pull to drive growth even if enterprise spending does kind of see a slowdown next year? And just a quick follow up. At Cisco Live, the team had talked about a major refresh of the collaboration portfolio. So just I want to see what the early response to that refresh has been. Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Yes. I think one thing that is, I think important to look at is, when we talk about enterprise spending and when many companies talk about enterprise spending that would be -- in some cases a combination at a minimum of our enterprise and commercial business and in some cases people would just include public sector in there and that's sort of a view. And that when you put it all together was actually quite healthy, the orders were quite healthy. We just had a little bit in July of a feel that -- we just didn't close as strong as we would like. And so, we felt like there was even more that we could have done. And it just didn't feel like a normal Q4 finish and it felt a little bit like some of the macro issues may be manifesting themselves. So, that's really what we saw there. And then, Kelly, you want to talk about the software and\u2026 Kelly Kramer : Yes. I mean, again, just on the software, I think again because more and more -- again, even despite like I talked about the write-off on deferred revenue -- the adoption of 606 even despite that the amount of revenue -- software revenue coming off the balance sheet continue just to grow as we put more on the balance sheet. So that helps to buffer when you do go through any tough macro issues. So, I think we'll continue to add to that and it'll continue to help soften whenever there is any kind of macro slowdown. But, it's helping maintain kind of the growth that we do see going as well as margins. Samik Chatterjee : Sorry. Any feedback on the collaboration portfolio? Chuck Robbins : Oh, sorry. I'm sorry. Yes. I think what Amy and the team have been doing is really -- they've been refreshing new elements of the portfolio with end units, end points they've been, they've consolidated the -- to a single user interface. We've got new refresh versions of Webex out there. They're bringing the cognitive capabilities in, there's a lot of new technology that they've been bringing. So, I think they're in the midst of delivering on that right now and the result in that business would suggest that our customers are viewing it favorably because it continues to perform really well for a decent sized business. Is that all? Samik Chatterjee : Okay. Thank you. That's it. Chuck Robbins : Thank you. So, I just want to thank everybody for joining us today. I look -- we're four years in and I'm really proud of what our teams have accomplished. I mean we've come a long way in four years. And I don't actually judge where we are based on this quarter. I think or the quarterly guidance, I think that what we've built in the portfolio and the innovation and the value that we bring to our customers is sustaining and we'll continue to do that with our customers going forward. We have a strong record of our execution. I have high conviction in the portfolio and I think we're well positioned for long-term growth opportunities. So, thanks all of you for spending time with us today and thanks for the questions. Marilyn Mora : All right. Thanks Chuck. So, Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call which will reflect our fiscal 2020 first quarter results will be on Wednesday, November 13, 2019, at 130 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. Again, I'd like to remind the audience that in light of regulation FD, Cisco's policy is not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done to an explicit public disclosure.

At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded [Operator Instructions]. Now, I would like to introduce, Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Michelle. Welcome everyone to Cisco's First Quarter Fiscal 2020 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. And I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our Web site in the Investor Relations section following the call. As discussed in early in Q1, we have made certain reclassifications to prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information, can also be found in the financial information section of our Investor Relations Web site. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for second first quarter of fiscal 2020. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. In Q2 of fiscal 2019, we completed the sale of our SPVSS business and accordingly, had no revenue or expense from that business in Q1 fiscal 2020. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP and product orders information we will be discussing today is normalized to exclude the SPVSS business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SPVSS business in the slides that accompany this call and on our Web site to help to understand these impacts. The guidance we provided during our Q4 earnings call has been normalized in the same way. I will now turn it over to Chuck. Chuck Robbins : Thanks Marilyn. We delivered a solid quarter against a challenging macro environment. While we're pleased with this performance, we're most focused on the environment as we move forward. We'll discuss this more in a moment. What's happening inside Cisco regardless of the macro is an unrelenting focus on driving innovation, transforming our business and exceeding our customers' expectations.  In Q1, as you've seen, we have revenue growth of 2% and double digit non-GAAP earnings per share growth. We also delivered strong non-GAAP gross margins and non-GAAP operating margins along with solid operating cash flow. We continued to invest in innovation and expand our market opportunities, while maintaining our commitment to maximizing shareholder return. Over the last year, many of you have heard me talk about the resilience of the global macro environment. However, on our last earnings call, we indicated that we had begun to see some weakness and that weakness continued throughout Q1 and was more broad-based. While the main challenges continue to be service provider in emerging markets, this quarter we also saw relative weakness in enterprise and commercial. Despite these headwinds and because of key decisions we made four years ago to change our business model, we remain well positioned to capitalize on the tremendous opportunities across cloud, automation, 5G, security and collaboration. Our transition to software continues to progress and we are on track with where we said we would be at the end of fiscal year 2020. This transition to software not only aligns to how our customers want to consume our technology, but we also believe it will lessen the impact of macroeconomic shifts in the future. Despite the current uncertainty, our innovation pipeline remains strong. At our annual partner summit last week, we announced several exciting additions to our portfolio, including network automation and analytics, cloud based networking, collaboration, as well as new security capabilities. Over the next couple of months, you will see us deliver even more innovation to help our customers achieve their business objectives. Now, I'd like to share some recent highlights across the business. Our enterprise networking portfolio continued to grow as customers increasingly adopt our intent-based networking portfolio, spanning our Catalyst 9000 family of switches, Meraki cloud based platforms and next generation data center solutions. Our customers today are running applications across multiple cloud environments and this shift requires a fundamental change in how they build their networks and their security architectures. To help them achieve this, we are automating connectivity across any cloud. A good example of this is our recently announced partnership with Microsoft to help our customers improve network connectivity with the highest level of security from branch offices to cloud based applications by integrating Cisco's SD-WAN solution with Azure\u2019s virtual WAN. To further extend our enterprise networking leadership, we continue to expand our cloud managed network and security offerings. Last week, we also announced an expansion of our Meraki portfolio, including continued integration between Meraki's dashboard and Cisco's switching portfolio, as well as innovative new LTE based WAN connectivity solutions. We believe our planned acquisition of Acacia will also play a critical role in building upon the strength of our switching, routing and optical networking portfolio. By utilizing our innovations across silicon, software and optics, we are enabling our customers to transform their networks. Now let's turn to security, which is always at the heart of everything we do. It's deeply integrated into the fabric of our entire portfolio to help secure our customers' data and address their modern application and multi cloud environments. Cyber security continues to be a top concern for our customers as they evolve their enterprise architectures to address the challenges of an ever changing threat environment. We have the most comprehensive integrated cyber security platform in the market designed to enable our customers to securely connect any application running on any cloud and deliver to any device. We've been building an expansive zero trust framework for securing access across the workforce, the workplace and the workload. As the leader in zero trust, our customers are increasingly turning to us to help them extend simple and trusted access to their users in hybrid and multi cloud environments. This is leading to strong uptake of Duo, our identity access management solution, which provides continuous authentication, ensuring the right people are able to access the right applications. To further reduce complexity in our customers' environments, we recently announced new enhanced capabilities in our firewall, breach defense, endpoint protection and Talos incident response solutions. These innovations are designed to provide greater threat protection and enhance the benefits of our platform. We also continue to leverage AI and ML capabilities through our industry leading threat intelligence platform Talos, along with Stealthwatch and Umbrella to bring our customers simplicity, visibility and insight that no other company can deliver. Moving to applications. We are rapidly becoming the center of our customer strategy for empowering teams and increasing productivity, as 95% of the Fortune 500 use our collaboration portfolio. This is leading to the solid performance in our businesses as growing number of customers adopt our unique solutions. During the quarter, we expanded our offerings to empower our customers for the modern workplace protecting data from ever increasing cyber threats and delivering highly secure productivity and collaboration solutions. A good example of this is our next generation WebEx, our cloud based team collaboration platform, enabling better teamwork while helping users stay secure with integrated end-to-end encryption. We also launched Single Platform Advantage, delivering all collaboration workloads, including calling, messaging, meeting and contact center from a single platform. In addition, we announced our new Cisco WebEx Edge for devices, as well as hardware-as-a-service options for phones, desks and room-based video systems. We're raising the bar for the industry by continuing to drive innovation in our expanding family of cognitive collaboration offers with AI and ML integrated capabilities. During the quarter, we acquired CloudCherry, a market leading customer experience management solution to augment our contact center portfolio with cloud analytics and AI to increase productivity and enhance user experiences. We also achieved a strong quarter in our App Dynamics business with yet another quarter of double digit growth, Our investments in App Dynamics have made Cisco the leader in application monitoring and analytics. We're helping our customers transform their digital businesses through our comprehensive portfolio of solutions that turns data into actionable real time insights by linking application performance to business outcomes. To summarize, while we remain in a challenging macroeconomic environment, I'm proud of our progress, both in our own continued transformation and in how we are empowering customers to drive their own transformation and shift to the cloud. We have a clear vision and strategy and are executing well against it to capture the many opportunities ahead. I feel great about our portfolio and I believe fully in our customers' commitment to our technology solutions. We will also continue to invest in organic and inorganic innovation to position Cisco for the long term. We also remain committed to managing our business to ensure we drive the greatest long term value for our customers, employees, partners and shareholders. Now, let me turn it over to Kelly. Kelly Kramer : Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for Q2. Our overall Q1 results were solid. We executed well with revenue growth and strong margins, net income and EPS. Total Revenue was $13.2 billion, up 2%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 33.6%, up 1.3 points; non-GAAP net income was $3.6 billion, up 5%; and non-GAAP EPS was $0.84, up 12%. Let me provide some more detail on our Q1 revenue. Total product revenue was up 1% to $9.9 billion. Infrastructure platform was down 1%. All of the businesses were up except for routing. Switching had growth in both campus and data center with the continued ramp of the Cat9K and strength of the Nexus 9K. Wireless grew driven by Meraki. Data center had solid growth, led by HyperFlex. Routing declined due to weakness in service provider. Applications was up 6% with growth across all the businesses, including double digit growth in app dynamics. Security was at 22% with strong performance in Identity and Access, advanced threat, unified threat and web security. Service revenue was up 4%, driven by software and solution support. And we continue to transform our business delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 71% of total software revenue, up 12 points year-over-year. When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our Q1 results year-over-year, there was a 50 basis point positive impact on revenue. In terms of orders in Q1, total product orders were down 4%. Looking at the geographies, Americas and EMEA were each down 3% and APJC was down 5%. Total emerging markets were down 13% with the BRICS plus Mexico down 26%. In our customer segments, public sector was up 6%, enterprise and commercial were each down 5% and service provider was down 13%. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, at the end of Q1 were $24.9 billion, up 11%. RPO is our total deferred revenue plus unbilled differed and represents total committed non-cancelable future revenue. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q1 gross margin was 65.9%, up 1.7 points. Product gross margin was 66.1%, up 2.5 points and service gross margin was 65.4%, down 0.4 points. In terms of the bottom line from a GAAP perspective, Q1 net income was $2.9 billion and EPS was $0.68. We ended Q1 the total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $28 billion. Operating cash flow was $3.6 billion, down 5%. Normalized for the $400 million legal settlement we received from a risk debt in Q1 of fiscal '19, operating cash flow was up 7%. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $0.8 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q1, we closed four acquisitions all in the applications area. These moves are consistent with our strategy of increasing investment in innovation and R&D for our growth areas. To summarize, we had a solid Q1. We executed well with top line growth and strong profitability. We're seeing the returns on the investments we're making in innovation, and driving the shift to more software and subscription, delivering long term growth and shareholder value. Let me reiterate our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal '20. This guidance includes the type of forward looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier; we expect revenues to decline in the range of minus 3% to minus 5% year-over-year; we anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64.5% to 65.5%; the non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 32.5% to 33.5%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 20%; non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.75 to $0.77. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn. So we can move into the Q&A. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Kelly. Michelle, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. And while Michelle is doing that, I'd like to ask the audience to address one question only, so that we have plenty of time for the others. Michelle, I'll turn it over to you. Operator : Thank you. Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer, you may go ahead. Ittai Kidron : Chuck, maybe you can kind of walk us through a little bit kind of how the quarter evolved as far as the demand pattern. You're talked about weakness became, first of all, more broad based but also started into the enterprise and commercial. Any more color you can give us there, either from a product or regional standpoint. And with regards to your working assumptions into the next quarter, into the January quarter, is it your assumption that the intensity of the softness you're seeing right now will just stay as is, or getting worse? Help us think about the framework you have in mind when you give the guidance. Chuck Robbins : If you recall in the last earnings call, I did say that we began to see some early signs of some macro impact towards the end of Q4. And then we just basically saw that continue throughout the quarter and as obviously the entire quarter was worse than we had expected when we began. And it was fairly broad based. It was -- I mean Kelly just read the regional numbers off from an orders perspective. So you saw negative 3, negative 3, negative 5, from Americas, EMEA and Asia. I'd say across the technology areas, it was pretty broad based. The segments that we saw, public sector continue to be strong but the rest were -- enterprise commercial did weaken. Service provider and emerging markets, which were stressed last quarter, were about the same. We had shown the ability to offset that with strength in commercial, and enterprise and public sector. And when those weakened, obviously this quarter that impacted our ability to offset them. And while all that might seem like this excuse, it also had to happen in a quarter where we did have incredibly tough compare. So this is the worst quarter that could have occurred for us. But that's really what we saw. As far as what we've modeled going forward, we've effectively assumed that it will stay as is. I don't think -- we haven't modeled any material further deterioration or improvement, I think than what we what we put forward today. Operator : Thank you. Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan, you may go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Chuck, thanks for the detail on the last question. I just wanted to get a sense of what you're hearing from your customers in terms of are you hearing that if some of the trade aspects of that are depressing the macro get resolved. Do you expect some of them to come back in terms of spending, what are you hearing from your customers? And if you can give us an update on the order trends in China as well that would be helpful? Chuck Robbins : So from the customers, it feels like there's not a broad base loud noise out there. It feels like there's a bit of a pause. We saw things like conversion rates on our pipeline were lower than normal, which says that things didn't closed the way we've historically seen it. We didn't see any incremental loss ratios. It was really just stuff slipping. We saw some large deals get done but got done smaller. Kelly and I were involved in a couple personally that we saw that when we began talking to the customers about the transactions and by the time they got done, they were smaller than when we have begun. So that happened. And then we just saw deals that slipped, and so we saw little bit of all that. But it's not -- I'd say we also had our teams telling us that the approval process in several customers across different number of industries were changing, which is usually indicative of, hey, let's add another signature requirement, because we want to just put another set of eyes on every expenditure right now. So those are the things we've seen. And unfortunately, I've done this long enough that I've seen it before. So you recognize it when you see it, and that's really effectively what we saw during the quarter. In China, Kelly was\u2026 Kelly Kramer : China continued its decline. It was down 31% versus last quarter we -- it was down 26%. So that momentum continuing to just accelerate the decline in China. Operator : Thank you. Paul Silverstein from Cowen, you may go ahead. Paul Silverstein : Kelly, if you could tell us pricing, I know we're going to see in the Q. But if you could tell us the rate of price erosion, if there has been a change. And then if I did the math correctly on OpEx, it looks like your guidance would suggest around $3.8 billion for the January quarter, that'd be down $400 million sequentially and $150 million year-over-year. Do I have that right? Is that the way you're thinking about it? And related to that, how should we think about OpEx going forward throughout the year? How do you plan on managing expenses given the less than expected revenue outlook? Kelly Kramer : So let me take those. So on price, we had a really very, very good quarter on price. It is the lowest in some time in terms of the least amount of price erosion. So from impact on our product gross margin rate, Paul, which is I know the metric you're looking at, it was only 40 basis points. Now I will say, that's great, and I think we've done a lot of great things on our pricing. For example, we've been selectively -- where we have price elasticity, we will raise prices, and we've been effective on driving some product transitions and we've been realizing that benefit. I will say we are starting to see, we didn't feel the impact of it this quarter, but we are starting to see pricing pressure in the server market that we expect to accelerate next quarter, but that's, of course, including the guide. But for Q1, it was a very, very strong pricing quarter, which has been fantastic. From an OpEx perspective, if you play down the ranges I just gave you, it does show that OpEx will be down and how you're thinking about it. And yes, we are managing it like we always do, which is balancing the investments we're making plus driving trade off and cost out. So you're looking at it correctly and that's what we're driving it to. Paul Silverstein : Kelly, the real question is, can operating margin go up with revenue being slightly down, could you drive higher operating margin\u2026 Kelly Kramer : So let me break down the margins overall, because I think that is the key question. I would say our margins are -- there's positive certainly driving the margin increase that you're seeing and you're seeing that in the guide. On the positive side, we are definitely feeling the positive impact of the software mix on our margins. So that is driving benefit to us just purely on the increased software content that we have and what we're selling, so that's helping tremendously. I do think we're going to see some more pricing erosion as we go forward for some of the things that are specific, like of course, the server market is going to get tougher now that the DRAM prices are going down. So that will be a little bit of a negative next quarter, but that's okay. And then of course, we are still benefiting from the DRAM price decrease related to the server market, that we started to feel the benefit of a couple quarters ago. It's a very large impact this quarter favorable to us that will I expect to continue next quarter. But after that, as you recall, we started seeing the benefit on the Q3 of '19. So that'll become less of a year-over-year favor ability for us. And then, we'll see what happens to the pricing there. So net-net to your question, I don't think it will stay at this rate that we delivered in Q1, which is the highest than it's been, because of those key things. But the underlying trends are all going in the right direction with software that's benefiting and driving the favorable mix. And then the real strong product management we're doing around managing pricing elasticity. Operator : Thank you. James Faucette from Morgan Stanley Investment Research, you may go ahead. James Faucette : I'm wondering, Chuck, or Kelly or maybe both of you. Can you talk a little bit about the order of growth versus your current expectations for economic development? Clearly, Chuck, as you pointed out and Kelly, we saw weakness kind of across the board in orders. But if we think about kind of a relatively flat environment from here going forward, as you said you're forecasting on. How long does it take us to start to get to more of a flattish and then even recovering order book in that kind of scenario and environment? Thanks a lot. Chuck Robbins : Kelly, I'll let you handle that. Kelly Kramer : James, that's a tough question, right? I mean, I'd say, certainly, the headwinds we have right now are going to be with us I think in the short term. Again, whether it's just the -- I don't see any catalyst to changed momentum right now with uncertainty and business confidence in the macro like Chuck talked about. I do think from a portfolio perspective, obviously, we feel good about portfolio and you're seeing still, regardless of macro the improvement we're making on the software metric that continues regardless. Going forward, we do have easier compares as the second half comes around, it's not that that's a big victory but that is the reality. And I think we're just going to keep executing through whatever the macro is. I don't know if you want to add, Chuck. Chuck Robbins : James, I would say that, if you just go around the world right now and you look at what's happening in Hong Kong, you look at the China-U.S. trade situation, you look at what's going on in DC. You've got Brexit. And you've got uncertainty in Latin America. I mean, I think it's -- in any of those that are big issues if they get resolved then you could see some of the uncertainty removed, and I think that's what -- business confidence just suffers when there's lack of clarity. And there's been lack of clarity for so long that I think it's finally just came into play. So I think, you're probably able to guess that, as well as we are, based on some of these bigger issues sort of coming to some level of conclusion. And then obviously, we have the elections coming in next year that we have to see how they work. But I will reiterate what Kelly said. Despite the order growth rate, this software transition that we've been embarking on is going exactly as we planned. It continued this quarter. We had solid results in our software portfolio again this quarter. And we put up some numbers at our analyst conference that we said we would hit by the end of 2020, we're on track to get there. So we feel good about that. And we're going to keep on executing. I think the teams have done a phenomenal job of getting our portfolio in the position that it's at. And that's why I said I have full confidence that our customers are committed to these technologies, just because they pause and we see a slowdown in one quarter. I think for the long term, we're in good shape, and I feel good about where we are. Operator : Thank you. Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs, you may go ahead, sir. Rod Hall : I wanted to ask about the commercial order rate deterioration. I think last quarter you guys hadn't really seen much deterioration at that at the end of the quarter. And then I'm assuming through this quarter, it's been getting worse. But wondering if you could just comment on what you're seeing there in that particular market. And regionally, are you seeing -- is it mainly in U.S. where you see that weakness, do you see the weakness all over the place. Just any further color you could give there would be helpful. Chuck Robbins : Rod, that was one of the big -- that's a good question. That was one of the big signals to us that this thing is -- that there's definitely something going on to, because the commercial business is usually fairly resilient. And it was broad based across the globe in each of the regions. I think all three were negative. So it was it was broad based. But I think that also be one of the first to bounce back when we start seeing that come back, that's a good sign. Operator : Thank you. Tejas Venkatesh from UBS, you may go ahead. Tejas Venkatesh : I wonder if you could provide more color on what you're seeing in the U.S. service provider business and also more broadly, how you're thinking about the service provider vertical going forward. Obviously, it's been weak for a while, but assuming that that environment stays that way. Are there product refreshes and so forth coming down the pipe that can better the year-over-year trends? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : So in the U.S., I think it's pretty clear if you just follow what's going on with the major players here, and we talked about this on the last call that they're currently focused on building out their trials and then their broader consumer based 5G services. And that's an area that frankly they'll run most of that traffic across their existing networks. We've said that when they begin to build out the broad based enterprise service delivery 5G networks that that's where we would really come into play on helping re-engineer backbones for higher throughput and more traffic. And I would suspect that we'll see them start to do some of that maybe in the second half of 2021, we'll have to see how fast they get moving. And we have some announcements coming over the next couple of months that I think line up with what they're trying to accomplish. And so we'll see how it moves. But that's the transition that we would be looking for that could help get this business to a little better position. It was -- and on a global basis, I'll tell you, it was -- it got much weaker in Europe. It was about the same in the U.S., I think. And we've had some pockets of strength in Asia. Outside of China, we had some strength in, particularly in Japan. So as we've always said about this business, it's so big deal driven. But for right now, I think that's the story of what we see. Operator : Thank you. Tal Liani with Bank of America, you may go ahead, sir. Tal Liani : So if I take a five quarter view, six quarter view, on your results, not just this quarter on the guidance, I see constant deterioration in the growth rate, organically from about 4.5% now we're getting to minus 5%, or I have to look exactly at the guidance where we are. And the question I have is, not about the environment but rather about the portfolio. If you ignore the environment as much as we can, what can you do with the portfolio in order to change the trend line and reaccelerate the growth? Maybe even start with, can you identify what are the weak areas versus what are the strong areas and then what's in your power to change versus something that may take longer? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Tal, it's a good question and that's actually what we spend every day doing. I will tell you that we saw strength, continued strength in the campus refresh in the portfolio that we brought forward there, which obviously, if you think about what we've been doing over the last couple of years, and I made a comment in my opening remarks about this is, we have now transitioned our entire enterprise networking portfolio to a mandatory subscription model and those products and that those area, those new products are still, they're growing very strongly right now as customers continue to deploy. So one of the big things we want to do is continue to transition towards the software model. We had 30 years of a net 30 CapEx model. So it's, we're in the midst of that transition. We're making progress on the timeline that we expected. That's the biggest strategic thing I think we can do. From a portfolio perspective, I think you have -- if you go across the portfolio, we made a lot of new announcements last week, we've got new announcements coming up. And I think that, clearly, we have a lot of customers that are still buying a lot of stuff. So while there's a slowdown, I think there's still meaningful value that our customers are seeing with our technology, and we'll continue to do everything we can to try to find those areas that resonate the most right now. I think you saw you see it with security given the importance of that technology to them. And we're working on some other things that we haven't announced yet. So we're going to continue to do all the things that you described. Operator : Thank you. Jim Suva from Citigroup Global Markets, you may go ahead, sir. Jim Suva : Obviously, you laid out a lot of the details about the challenges. When we look back historically over Cisco, their history, the last time we kind of saw such negative trends, were kind of July 2017. There was kind of about a fourth quarter pause before recovery. Is there anything different about it this time? And some people will say, well, white boxes starting to hurt you a lot. Is it white boxes? Is it generally macro? Or why wouldn't it be, like four quarters, like what we saw last year in 2017? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : First of all, I think that given the broad based and the rapid change that we saw, I don't believe it's anything like white box or anything like that. It's broad across the portfolio. It's broad across geographies. And we're, as Kelly said, obviously, in the second half. We don't like to talk about comps. But the math is different in the second half of the year. But we also have all the things that I just talked about with Tal. We also have this Wi-Fi 6 transition. At some point, we will have some spinning going on around the 5G backbone transitions. We got 400 gig coming next year. So there are a lot of things. And I also believe that our customers, they will pause for a while. But technology is so absolutely core to their fundamental strategies that it just seems to me that the time that they're going to be able to pause is going to be shorter than what you would have seen in the past. I mean, they worry about their competitors' investments, they worry about falling behind. So I think they'll hit the pause button because of all the uncertainty. I think we have to just see how long it lasts in today's world, given the strategic value of all the technology. And frankly, everything that we're building is incredibly important to them as they deal with this new cloud world and re-architecting their traffic flows and their security architecture. And there's only so long they're going to build a pause on doing that. But we'll see how it turns out. Operator : Thank you. Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo, you may go ahead. Aaron Rakers : I want to go back to kind of the comments earlier made around kind of the software expansion, and kind of progressing to what you laid out at past analyst days. If I recall, it seemed to kind of map out that you would have about 20% of your total kind of revenue being -- product revenue being contributed from software. As we think about the product portfolio and the push to subscription, is that the right trajectory to think about? And as we look even beyond that, could you see even higher mix of kind of just recurring nature of your business? I'm just trying to understand what more is left to kind of build out the product portfolio around this kind of subscription motion for the company. Kelly Kramer : I'd say what we laid out is we said by the end of '20, we should have 30% of our revenue be software, and software and services be 50%. So that's the metric we are pacing towards. And your 20% number, we are already passed. So we are driving to be at that that 30% by the end of this year. So like Jeff mentioned, we are pacing well with that. This transition that we're driving has greatly increased the amount of software we are selling with our system. So that is all going well. Chuck Robbins : Yes, I think if you just -- I think Kelly said, by the end of 2020, our target was to be at 30% of our revenue coming from software. And if you also correlate the metric we shared today, which is in Q1 71% of our software was coming from subscription and SaaS, which four years ago that number was probably a third or less. So that's the nature of the success of the transition that we've been driving so far. Kelly Kramer : Yes, it\u2019s a good point. Actually, the target for the end of '20 for that was to be 66%, so we've passed that metric already. Operator : Thank you. James Fish from Piper Jaffray, you may go ahead, sir. James Fish : I just hoping to get more color on sort of the campus switching cycles with the Cat9K, and just kind of where you think we are, especially with large enterprises as that really drives, it seems like more of the growth of the business anyways and just trying to understand that. And then just make sure that we're thinking about it correct. When you're talking subscription within this business line, you're talking more of a term license than kind of recurring monthly, correct? Kelly Kramer : Yes, on that one, subscription meaning. Yes. So if I sell a Catalyst 9K switch now, it's sold with a subscription that gets renewed three or five years since putting on the term from now. So that's what we're talking about. So of all the software we're selling is it based on a term based value that gets renewed. Chuck Robbins : And Jim, just to give you a little sense of where we are. I mean, we're still -- we're seeing very strong growth year-over-year on those platforms, the transitions happening from the old to the new, just like we would have expected. And we were actually talking about yesterday how we would answer the question relative to where we are in this, because I think I said last time we were in the second inning, and we joked that maybe we're in the bottom of the second inning now. But we're still very early in this transition and it's going very well. And we now have the entire enterprise networking portfolio in refresh mode with Wi-Fi 6 access points, with the new Catalyst 9000. And then one of the things we announced last week was the ability to manage the Cat 9K, one of the products in the Cat 9K under the Meraki platform, so customers could take advantage of it and we'll continue to extend that across the other portfolio of products. So it's going very well and it's still early. James Fish : Thanks for that color, Chuck. Chuck Robbins : Thank you, Jim. So let me just wrap up and say that, obviously, it's a complicated world right now. And we certainly felt the continuing impact that we talked about at the end of our last quarter. That being said, I have great confidence in where we are with the portfolio. We shared some metrics today on the software transition that I think is going incredibly well. And notwithstanding, you know, the short term challenges, we feel really good about the future. And so thank you all for being with us today. And I'll kick it back to Marilyn. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Chuck.

With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck. Chuck Robbins : Thanks Marilyn and good afternoon everyone. As we told you last quarter and still see now the feedback from our customers is that they remain strongly committed to both our products and services. However, like many in our industry, we are seeing longer decision-making cycles across our customer segments for a variety of reasons including macro uncertainty as well as unique geographical issues. The good news is once this uncertainty passes for our customers, we expect to see spending recover as technology continues to be at the heart of all they do. You'll see in our numbers this quarter that we continue to make progress on several key metrics including our shift to more software and subscriptions with 72% of our software now being sold as a subscription. While we still have a lot more work to do, I firmly believe we have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us. The long-term secular growth trends of 5G, Wi-Fi 6, 400 gig, and the shift to the cloud remain and we expect to benefit from them. This is a multiyear transformation and we are managing our business well while staying focused on helping our customers build simpler, more secure, and cost-effective networks. The broad adoption of multi-cloud and modern application environments is changing how the world's largest networks are built, operated, and secured and Cisco is at the center of this transition. We have made significant investments in the development of software, silicon, and optics; the building blocks for the Internet of the future. We believe this strategy will change the economics of how the Internet will be built to support 5G, 400 gig, and the demands of the future, while helping our customers innovate and move faster than ever before. In December, we introduced Cisco Silicon One, a first-ever single unified silicon architecture; and the Cisco 8000 carrier-class router family built on Silicon One; as well as our new iOS XR7 operating system. We also announced new flexible purchasing options that enable customers to consume our technology however they choose. We also collaborated closely with several of the largest web-scale and SP companies throughout the development process. Their participation in our launch demonstrates their strong support of our strategy as well as our commitment to continued innovation. Our goal is to accelerate the deployment of next-generation Internet infrastructure by offering our customers choices of components, white box, or integrated systems in a flexible consumption model. Now, let me share a brief update on our businesses starting with infrastructure platforms. As the global leader in networking, we believe we are well positioned with our intent-based networking portfolio given the strategic investments we've been making. Over the past several quarters, we've made tremendous progress integrating automation, analytics, and security across our enterprise networking portfolio, while at the same time shifting to a subscription-based model. A great example of our success is the ongoing strong adoption of our Catalyst 9000 platforms. We continue to extend our secure SD-WAN solutions as customers move more applications to the cloud. To do this, we are actively engaging with web-scale companies to help our customers extend their wide-area networks to the cloud and secure their business applications. Recently, we announced integration with Microsoft, Azure Virtual WAN and Office 365 along with a deeper partnership with Amazon Web Services to deliver highly secure end-to-end connectivity and better application performance. Now to Security. We had another solid quarter with strength across our advanced threat and cloud-based solutions including Duo and Umbrella, which are important growth drivers of our business. We continue to see significant opportunity as we execute on our strategy to deliver an integrated security platform. As the market moves to a multi-cloud environment and the need for visibility grows, we're benefiting from our strong position as our customers' most trusted partner. Our differentiated end-to-end approach across the network, cloud and endpoint is winning customers with 100% of the Fortune 100 now using one or more of Cisco security solutions. This quarter, we expanded our security portfolio from the cloud to the edge. We brought to market an integrated IoT architecture, providing enhanced visibility, insights and threat detection across our customers' entire environment. This architecture includes our new software-based security solutions Cyber Vision; and our Edge Intelligence data collection tool to enable our customers to make better business decisions. Finally Applications. There is no question that customers are undergoing a significant workplace transformation and they are turning to Cisco to help them with this transition. As a global market leader, we believe we are the only company providing a cognitive highly secure and analytics-driven collaboration platform which is the foundation for their workplace transformation. This platform is becoming increasingly critical to how enterprises empower their teams by allowing their employees to work more effectively together. To extend our value proposition, we continue to make strategic investments. For example, we recently brought to market several key WebEx capabilities, which combine context, AI and machine learning to enable our customers and their teams to further enhance their meeting experiences. We achieved another strong quarter of growth with AppDynamics demonstrating our ability to deliver unique real-time AI-powered insights from a single pane of glass providing complete visibility. Our customers are looking to connect application performance monitoring with infrastructure automation to simplify IT and increase productivity. Two weeks ago, we announced we are bringing together AppDynamics and our Intersight Workload Optimizer to deliver comprehensive visibility of applications and infrastructure both on-prem and in the cloud using machine learning and AI to proactively remediate problems and optimize user experiences. To summarize, I am pleased with our business transformation and with the new innovative platforms we're bringing to market. While we continue to experience some pause in customer spending related to the uncertainty in the global macro environment, our long-term growth opportunities remain unchanged. Going forward, we will continue to focus on developing groundbreaking technologies and building a new Internet for the 5G era that will help our customers innovate faster than ever before. I remain incredibly confident that our execution against our strategy will drive profitable growth and generate strong shareholder returns for the long-term. I will now turn it over to Kelly. Kelly Kramer : Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter followed by the guidance for Q3. Our overall Q2 results were consistent with our expectations. We executed well with strong margins and EPS growth. Total revenue was down $12 billion -- was at $12 billion, down 4%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 33.7%, up 1.6 points. Non-GAAP net income was $3.3 billion, flat year-over-year; and non-GAAP EPS was $0.77, up 5%. Let me provide some more detail on our Q2 revenue. Total product revenue was down 6% to $8.7 billion. Infrastructure Platforms was down 8%. Switching revenue declined in both Campus and Data Center. We did see growth with the continued ramp of our Cat 9K and strength of the Nexus 9K. Routing declined driven by weakness in service provider. Wireless declined overall, but we did see strong growth in Meraki and are starting to see the ramp of our WiFi six products. Data Center revenue declined driven by servers offset by strong growth in HyperFlex. Applications was down 8% driven by a decline in Unified Communications, partially offset by double-digit growth in AppDynamics. Security was 9% with strong performance in identity and access, advanced threat and unified threat management. Service revenue was up 5% driven by software and solution support. We continue to transform our business delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 72% of total software revenue, up 7 points year-over-year. In terms of orders in Q2, total product orders were down 6%. Looking at our geographies, the Americas was down 8%, EMEA was down 1% and APJC was down 4%. Total emerging markets were down 7% with the BRICs plus Mexico down 20%. In our customer segments, public sector was flat while enterprise was down 7%. Commercial was down 4% and service provider was down 11%. Remaining performance obligations or RPO at the end of Q2 were $24.9 billion, up 11%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q2 gross margin was 66.4%, up 2.3 points. Product gross margin was 65.9%, up 3.1 points; and service gross margin was 67.7% flat year-over-year. In terms of the bottom line from a GAAP perspective Q2 net income was $2.9 billion and EPS was $0.68. We ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $27.1 billion. Operating cash flow was $3.8 billion flat year-over-year. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $0.9 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend. Today we announced a $0.01 increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.36 per share up 3% year-over-year. This represents a yield of approximately 2.9% based on today's closing price. This dividend increase reinforces our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. In early Q3, we closed our acquisition of Exablaze a designer and manufacturer of advanced network devices aimed at reducing latency and improving network performance. To summarize we executed well with strong margins and EPS growth. We're seeing the returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the shift to more software and subscriptions delivering long-term growth and shareholder value. Let me reiterate our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue to decline in the range of minus 1.5% to minus 3.5% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64.5% to 65.5%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 32.5% to 33.5% and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 20%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.79 to $0.81. Our guidance does not reflect any potential disruptions in our global supply chain that could result from the coronavirus. We will continue to monitor the situation closely. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into Q&A. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Kelly. Michelle let's go ahead and open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. Tim Long from Barclays, you may go ahead. Tim Long : Yes. Thank you. Chuck maybe if I could just start talking about the macro and the kind of the longer decision process. In your sense, how long do you think this would last particularly if you maybe put into the context that you mentioned a lot of industry drivers going on in 400 gig and WiFi 6? And obviously you got some new router and silicon products out. So maybe just talk a little bit about the timing of that recovery and how you think you can maybe outperform it given all the different dynamics you have going across the businesses this year? Chuck Robbins : Yes. Tim thanks. It's a great question. So I think first of all, there are many secular growth drivers that are lined up the 5G transition the 400-gig transition WiFi 6 the shift to cloud. And what we're seeing from customers is really just -- it's just pausing just trying to see what's going on. Now what I'll say is that clearly late in the quarter, if you look at some of the issues that had been outstanding that were creating some of the uncertainty like Brexit, we got closer to resolution. We obviously got a signature late in the quarter on a first phase of the U.S./China trade deal and USMCA has now gone through in the U.S.. So hopefully those will give our customers a little more viability. When I speak to the customers, they're still fully planning on moving forward. They're just a little cautious and trying to see what's going on. We obviously have the virus now that we'll see how it plays out. But overall, I don't think it's deep. And we expect that given some of this uncertainty has now dissipated, notwithstanding what we see obviously from the virus that hopefully, we'll see our customers pick up again. Tim Long : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Tim. Next question please. Operator : Tejas Venkatesh from UBS. You may go ahead. Tejas Venkatesh : Thank you. I had a big-picture question. With the December routing announcements and the Cat 9K before that, a lot of the Cisco strategy is now around selling incremental automation software to lower customer OpEx. That seems to require a significant change in your organization. So how far along are you in the sales and channel transformation to fit that goal? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : That's a very good question. Thank you. We have done a lot of work on the transformation of being able to support the software model and the subscription software model in particular with the automation. And we have -- if you go back to 2017 when we first launched the Catalyst 9000, and we announced subscription businesses on our enterprise networking portfolio, the second half of this year will have some -- a number of -- a small amount of the early renewals on that. So our team has been working hard to be prepared for those renewals. And then in fiscal 2021 we'll see a material number, a reasonably material number associated with that. So I think the sales organization, we've run pilots and now we've scaled things. We're running other pilots and we're scaling things. And we've got the customer experience organization that Maria Martina is leading that has been building out their capabilities. So we have more to do, but I feel good about the progress we've made, and I think that we're in a pretty good position right now. Marilyn Mora : Next question, please. Operator : Simon Leopold from Raymond James. You may go ahead. Simon Leopold : Thank you very much. I'm wondering if maybe you could talk a little bit more about the service provider vertical given, it's been a long-running challenge and seems as if maybe to some extent it's less of a focus for Cisco given that it's such -- become a smaller part of the business. But I want to see if you can maybe talk about how you see this market eventually recovering kind of the timing and the drivers maybe double-clicking beyond just sort of the 5G hand-waving, if we could get a better understanding of what will drive it and when? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Simon, it's a lot better just to wave hands. Now let me tell you a little bit. I don't think that it's a market that we are ignoring or we -- in fact, if you look at the announcements we made in December let me give you a little update on that. We have about five years of R&D effort in what we announced in December. So that's a lot of commitment to the market. So we do believe that there will be a resurgence. I think that-- I will talk about 5G and 400 gig as well. But just to give you an update on -- in December as you know we launched Silicon One, which is at the heart of these new systems called Cisco 8000 that we launched. And we also announced that we would be willing to sell our Silicon to go into a white box or sell it just directly to a customer if that's how they like to procure it. I will tell you that across the cloud titans there, we're engaged with all of them on variations of those architectures. Several of them were with us at the announcement in December, which shows you their belief in what we're doing. We have taken orders for both from different cloud players, and so we feel good about the acceptance of that launch. The 8000 series will be a fundamental backbone product for 5G networks and I will tell you that we have early wins on IP infrastructure to support 5G rollouts in over 30 customers around the world. They're early. Some of those are cell site, aggregation, backhaul, some core wins. Most of them are in non-standalone, which means they're enhancing their current networks, and then they'll look to build standalone networks. As we've said, we believe that will start in 2021 where we could begin to see some of that pick up. So we think the 400 gig transition as well as the 5G build-out will be the drivers that we'd be looking for over the next couple of years. Simon Leopold : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Chuck. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Paul Silverstein from Cowen and Company. You may go ahead. Paul Silverstein, your line is open. Paul Silverstein : Sorry, I'm still -- don't know how to use the cellphone. Kelly, your margin structure was particularly strong this quarter and that represents a long-standing trend both near-term and longer-term. I recognize the guidance represents an easing. I assume some of that is due to the backup in DRAM pricing or the pending backup. Can you go back through the drivers and what you expect over the next year or two, so that's gross and the operating level? Kelly Kramer : Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Happy to. And I know we're really happy about where the -- both gross margins and op margins are. But as you know Paul it's driven by a few things. This software transformation has been benefiting us through both \u2013 you can see it in the mix of our products when we show you the gross margin walks in our Qs as well as just overall so we're benefiting from that. I'd say the second big driver is price. We've been very, very disciplined on price, meaning we're taking advantage of raising prices where we have elasticity for example on really older products that we want to shift to newer products or where we know we have room to move. We've been doing that I think very effectively. We've been managing the decline in the pricing and the server market fairly well balancing that with the DRAM prices that are going down dramatically. So what you're going to see in the reporting this quarter Paul and I know you always ask you'll see our pricing. I mentioned in the last quarter's call that pricing was at an all-time lowest level of impact meaning the most beneficial it's been. We're right back at 1.1 points on our year-over-year gross margin walk, so it's still very, very good for us and more in line of what it was I'd say a couple of quarters before Q1. So that's going well. DRAM is benefiting us this quarter for sure. And as you know that's becoming less and less of a benefit to us now as we're starting to see the DRAM prices tick back up. But we again manage that pricing and DRAM cost equation very well. So just in general I think you can expect a little bit more pressure from DRAM pricing the year-over-year compares getting less which is why I guided what I guided. But overall you're still going to see the goodness coming through from the continued increase of our business being software driven. Paul Silverstein : Kelly, if I could just quickly follow up. Looking beyond the quarter, looking beyond April, given the ongoing shift to software is there any reason why margins should continue to head up putting aside quarterly volatility? Kelly Kramer : Yes. I mean, again, I would say yes, because what we're doing on the portfolio is more and more software content. So by definition it will be good for us. We will always have the potential for large swings for things like component costs like DRAM plus or minus. But as always, we'll let you know when those are happening. But yes, I mean, if you go back and look three years back from where we were there to where we are now it is long term just the shift of the overall portfolio that we've been driving. Paul Silverstein : Appreciate it. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks. Next question please Operator : Jim Suva from Citigroup Investment Research. You may go ahead sir Jim Suva : Thank you very much for the clarity so far. And I had one question that's kind of more broad. I don't know if it's \u2013 for which of you. But on product orders, I was just kind of looking and thinking about the product orders. It looks like the enterprise product orders got incrementally a little more challenged. Public sector got a little more challenged. Service provider marginally improved compared to last quarter year-over-year. So can you maybe just give us some color on product orders? It looks like maybe enterprise a little difficult year-over-year comps. Was it last year a big product cycle in enterprise? Or why are we actually seeing enterprise kind of decline incrementally a little bit worse? Thank you. Kelly Kramer : Yes. Hey, Jim good question and let me take a crack at it. So when I look at the segment it's \u2013 if I focus on enterprise, a lot of it is the Q2 2019 really, really strong product cycle ramps we had. So if I go back to Q2 2019, it was a record for the campus switching for \u2013 as well as for Collaboration back in Q2 2019. No excuse, but that's what that was. I would say beyond that if I would isolate overall kind of our regions from a bookings point of view, the Americas was down 8%. And if I look at that the U.S. itself was slightly better but in that range and I'd say it was driven by two areas. It was driven by the routing portfolio largely SP segment. That was the biggest driver. And the second biggest driver was the decline we're seeing in the server market. And again that's directly related to the decline of DRAM prices flowing through the entire market and we saw that last quarter as well. So that drove the Americas. Europe was at minus 1% basically flat. But that \u2013 the biggest driver when I look at Europe was really the U.K. We are seeing a slowdown because of Brexit and we did see it in the public sector significantly, which is always a big growth driver for the U.K. for us. So U.K. both enterprise and public sector has slowed down for us, which drove Europe. Europe would have been up 2 points without the U.K. And then for APJC, it continues to be the rapid decline of China. China, as I've talked about and the BRICS plus Mexico being down, China was down again over 30%. It's still only about 2% of our total business, but it still hurts the overall -- I mean, Asia Pac, excluding China, would have been up a couple of points as well, 3 points. So from geography, those are the key drivers. And, again, to your point, we are going off against some tough compares in enterprise for both the Catalyst 9K ramp a year ago and Collab just had a record quarter. Jim Suva : Thank you. That was a great explanation and greatly appreciated. Thank you so much. Kelly Kramer : Thanks Jim. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Jim. Next question, please. Operator : Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer & Company. You may go ahead, sir. Ittai Kidron : Thanks. Chuck, I wanted to dig into applications, down 8% on a year-over-year basis. And I understand the pressure on the unified communications business and it's good to see AppD is still growing. But you haven't talked WebEx. Am I to assume that WebEx is not growing, stuck in the middle here? Help me think about the transformation AMI has been doing over there, where we are in that transformation? And how should I think about the growth and competitiveness of that platform going forward? Chuck Robbins : Yes. I think the -- first of all, they have re-architected all those platforms, integrated the back ends and have a very modern set of solutions to take to market. And we're currently working -- I was talking to the team yesterday. I think, there's 11 workshops with major customers in the next 30 days to work on plans, to get them to the modern portfolio, because some customers have been running variations of the stuff that we've had out there for 10 to 15 years, so we're in good shape. In fact, there was a great analyst report that was written just a couple of days ago about -- industry analyst, about the portfolio and how far it's come and how effective it is right now. So I feel good about what they're doing. I think if you look back a year ago flat out -- Collab was up 24%. I mean -- and it's a huge business to be up that much. So they had a very tough year to compare against, but I'm pleased with where they are. There is competition. Obviously, there's some good competition in the space, which frankly should just keep making us better. But the team is doing, I think, a really good job. Kelly, do you want to comment on -- Kelly Kramer : Yes. I mean, I'll just give you the -- I'd say, the largest driver was the UC business and the revenue being down, the huge majority followed, by a bit on the endpoints on the TP. And conferencing was down marginally, hardly anything. So the biggest driver was for sure on the Unified Communications side. Ittai Kidron : Very good. All right. Good luck, guys. Kelly Kramer : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Jeff Kvaal from Nomura. You may go ahead. Jeff Kvaal : Yes. Thank you very much for taking the question. I was hoping that you could unpack, sort of, a bit of a bigger downtick, maybe, in IP than we were expecting a balanced by a better performance on the services line. Can you sort of help us understand what the dynamics are and some of that maybe accounting for where the software goes? I'd love to understand that a little bit better, please. Kelly Kramer : Yes. I would say -- I've talked about this. On the service increase, there's been no change on the accounting side for how we account for software. Service improvement, we've been really driving that. Maria Martinez, the lead CX for customer experience, has been really focused on driving renewal rates and adoption. And you've seen our services business from a revenue perspective tick up over the last four quarters. So, I'd say, that 5% growth you saw in services is just continued performance by that team to do that. I'd say, on the infrastructure platform side, it does go back to, again, just very, very -- we were peak -- not peak, but we were very, very high ramping of Campus, switching last year that -- so that's a tougher compare. I mean, it's still growing like crazy, but that's a big driver. Routing is still down, driven by the SP segment. And then in terms of the last piece from a year, again, we talk about, and you saw that applications was up 24%, again, which was all Collab basically, a year ago as well. So it's nothing more than those things, I would say. Combined with, just the data center server market, is -- we're starting to feel that, you can see what's happening in the market there. Jeff Kvaal : Does that imply, Kelly, that that 5% services growth rate is a durable number? Or should we be thinking it will fluctuate between that and the sort of low single-digit growth that we've seen? Kelly Kramer : Well, we certainly \u2013 we're certainly trying to make that a sustainable kind of range. We have no desire to have that slowdown. But again, it's \u2013 the team is doing everything they can. They're offering new solutions not just \u2013 they're trying to find more ways to drive incremental growth versus just being tied to the maintenance to the product orders. And they're driving much more solutions along software and everything else, so they're working a lot of plays in the services area. Jeff Kvaal : Obviously they are. Congratulations. Thank you. Kelly Kramer : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Next question, please. Operator : Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead, sir. Rod Hall : Yeah. Thanks for fitting me in. I just had a quick question trying to juxtapose the guidance with the order rates. If you look at the total product orders, the rate they're down 6%; after down 4%. So that deteriorated. And yeah, your revenue guidance for the midpoint at least your revenue decline is a little better than last the quarter you just printed. So you printed down 3.5%; and the guide down 2.5%. So kind of tailing on Jeff's question there is the services making that up? And what should we be expecting for product revenue in the guided quarter? And then, I also \u2013 I'm hoping Chuck maybe you'll make a comment on this whole 5G investment commentary coming out of the press and maybe the government. What do you think about \u2013 how interested is Cisco in potentially helping deploy U.S. wireless infrastructure not the stuff you do today, but actual base stations and things like that? Could you just comment on how you see some of those \u2013 that commentary, how you think that might develop? Chuck Robbins : You want to go first? Kelly Kramer : Yeah. I can go first. Yes. Your question is a good question Rod, but I would say really the \u2013 where we ended up at the minus 6% was not a surprise. That's kind of when I gave guidance for the Q2 kind of what the expectation was. I would say, as you know when we roll up \u2013 when we roll up the guide as we go for Q3 we just \u2013 it's the same process and we know exactly what's coming off the balance sheet. We have \u2013 we know exactly what's in backlog. We know exactly what we expect for orders coming in and it's just pure math. I think again back to a lot of the decline in the order rate was there's a bit of compares. But the rest when you do the math and add it all up to what you expect to come through for the next quarter it gives you the number I guided the midpoint. If you look at that it's very consistent with what our normal Q3 to Q2 sequentials are. Rod Hall : Excellent. Chuck Robbins : And then Rod on the question around the 5G discussions in Washington, I mean, obviously they're very interested in having U.S. companies participating in 5G and frankly lead in 5G. And so we have spent a lot of time educating different folks in Washington about what technologies actually constitute an entire 5G network. So you rightly said not the stuff we have, but the radio which is pretty much what we don't have. But I think that \u2013 I think the U.S. is in really good shape. I think we have packet core. We've got cell site and radio backhaul. We got the IP routing core. We got security and we have \u2013 obviously, there's a couple of companies in Europe one in South Korea that provide the radio technology. There's also software players that are out there right now that are building disaggregated open RAN solutions that can be used in the future. And so we're spending a lot of time helping them understand that and working to just make sure that there's a recognition that there's a lot of technology that's been built and being built here in the United States that is leading in these 5G infrastructures. And I actually, think the U.S. is in fine shape. I think both from a carrier deployment perspective, I think we're in great shape, and I think we're in good position with the technology. I don't think the U.S. government should make investments in these companies, but we are certainly working with lots of industry peers again on both education, and then trying to just make sure that the U.S. does have solutions with combining these European players with a lot of our technologies to make sure that everyone's comfortable with those solutions. Rod Hall : That's great Thanks, Chuck. Chuck Robbins : Yeah. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Chuck. Next question, please. Operator : Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead. Sami Badri : Thank you. I would like to ask about the SP orders that were down 11% in the quarter. And looking forward to the back half of this year and any kind of forward-looking indicator trajectory commentary would be helpful. If we look at two scenarios; one scenario assuming a recent telecom consolidation, right that we've all heard about in the last two days; and then the scenario where no consolidation actually happens for the rest of the year. Should we expect service provider orders to inflect positively in one of those scenarios or in both of those scenarios as we look at the back half and maybe kind of mid to back half of 2020? Chuck Robbins : That's a tough question to answer. We've been dealing with challenges in this segment for a long time. I think the -- history would tell you that when we see consolidation, it creates a slowing. I'm not sure that this particular one represents that because I think they are going to be an investment mode and is triggering investment with other players as well. And I think the 5G build-out that all of them are working on will probably fuel investment. I think for us it just depends on how quickly they do that and how soon they decide to build a standalone 5G network for enterprises. I think most of them are looking at their consumer networks and believing they can accommodate them on their existing backbones with perhaps some minor upgrades, but I think that will determine it. So, I think it's more connected to how fast they move on that than it has to do with any of the consolidation or no consolidation right now. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Next question please. Operator : Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan, you may go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to see if we can drill down a bit more on the Cat 9000 product portfolio. You mentioned already a couple of times on the call that the product momentum -- the revenue momentum there is quite strong. I was just wondering if you can kind of talk about the impact on the growth rate that you've kind of seen directionally through this kind of broader landscape of slowing enterprise spending and if the growth rate there is kind of still substantially different from what you're seeing for the rest of the portfolio. Is it -- do you think it's more a reflection of the subscription kind of model that you're going with on that portfolio or more kind of the refresh that's driving that difference and kind of what you're seeing related to the rest of the portfolio? Kelly Kramer : Yes. I'll just say the growth rate of the Cat 9000 is unbelievable still. I mean it is a very high double-digit number. I would say there's no -- we haven't heard issues. I'd say for maybe some of the smaller DCEs there's a question about the subscription but we've managed through that. But I would say those the new products from the 9200 through the 9600 that isn't slowing and the growth rates are very, very strong. Obviously, the legacy products that they have replaced are falling off as you would expect, but we have not seen any slow on the transition. It's the fast -- and again, we mentioned this in the early ramp of the Cat 9000, but at this point the percentage of what the Cat 9000 as of total campus switching is the fastest ramp of any transition we've done. Chuck Robbins : And if you look at the -- what Kelly talked about earlier with Wi-Fi 6 beginning to ramp, that's a subscription model. Our Meraki business is a subscription model which is still growing very well. So, I don't think the subscription model has anything to do with it. I just think in certain cases some of our larger customers who are watching some of the things going on just decided to just take a pause and take a look at what's happening and then I think they'll kick back in. Samik Chatterjee : Okay. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Great. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Tal Liani from Bank of America Securities, you may go ahead sir. Tal Liani : Yes. Hi. I want to ask you a broader question and I will call it secular versus cyclical. Switching had a small cycle short cycle with a new switch. There was growth acceleration. Now, we see a decline overall in switching and there's probably substitution between new and old and routing is also declining. And the question I'm asking is of the trends you see today, data center switching, campus switching, routing, service providers what is cyclical and what is secular? Meaning when are we going to see a reversal -- or not when in terms of timing. What's going to drive I should say -- what's going to drive a reversal of the trends in routing? What could drive? What could drive a reversal in data centers and campuses? What are the things that could drive at least a cyclical growth from here or even secular growth kind of longer term? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : So Tal, it's great question. I think in the routing space is simply it's the 5G backbone build-out that we've been talking about for a few years. Once that starts I think -- given the percentage of our routing business that is attributed to service providers, I think that's the key as well as us winning these Cisco 8000 insertions that we have proof of concepts going on today with many of the large customers both service provider and web-scale players. So, I think that's that one. And I think on the campus side, I just think that's just a timing issue. I think that the growth we're seeing in the Catalyst 9000 is tremendous. And I think that customers that began to build out their refresh. Given where we are as a percentage of the installed base that we have replaced, it's got a long road ahead of it. I think that the only reason that we saw a little slowdown is just because customers just decided to pause the deployments a bit. But I think that that will come back when this uncertainty and the capital spending frees up. Tal Liani : And routing? Chuck Robbins : Routing, I answered first with the SP with the 5G backbone stuff, because of how big a percentage service provider represents in our routing portfolio. Tal Liani : Okay. Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Thanks. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Tal. Next question please. Operator : Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great, thanks. With subscriptions being 72% of software revenue, which you stated, I wondered if you kind of had an update as to how much of a headwind that kind of business model transition is. In the past you kind of said a couple of hundred basis points. But just any \u2013 directionally, if that's still about right would be helpful. Thanks. Kelly Kramer : Yeah. I mean again, I think back a few years ago before we adopted the new revenue standards, it was a bigger impact. It was up to like 250 or 300 basis points with ASC 606. It's come back down to the 100 basis points. But at this point, we don't even talk about it that way because we've been ramping so quickly the entire portfolio to that. But at max, it would be I'd say 100 bps or so. Meta Marshall : Great, thanks. Marilyn Mora : Yes. We have time for one more question, Michelle, for one more. Operator : Thank you. Jim Fish from Piper Sandler. You may go ahead, sir. Jim Fish : Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. One part that we haven't talked about here today is on the security side. We have RSA coming up at the end of the month. So just wondering if we could double-click on where we are with Duo and Umbrella together as it seems like they're the biggest drivers of the business? Can you guys talk a little bit more about the contribution of these two specifically to the portfolio and how Umbrella specifically is impacting your adoption of secure SD-WAN versus some of the other vendors that are out there? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Yes. So, I'll give you the sort of the qualitative answer and Kelly can give you something on the data. But I think the secure SD-WAN is, the solution that our customers are looking for. I mean they want the integration with their cloud gateways from their branches. And so, it is a key differentiator for us. Our teams are working hard on continuing to build that out. And I think, over the next couple of years, it will continue to -- it will be even more of a differentiator as we continue to get more and more integration between those two portfolios. Kelly? Kelly Kramer : Yeah. No. I'd say that's absolutely right. And in terms of how important Umbrella and Duo are they absolutely are the key growth drivers for us, the whole cloud security space for us. And will continue to be so. And I'd say we recently launched our Security in a great way, which is just starting. And that will be all part of our cloud security portfolio as well. And we expect that to be a huge growth driver as well. Jim Fish : Got it, thanks. Marilyn Mora : Yes. Chuck Robbins : Thank you. All right, well let me just thank everyone for joining us today. And I'll just recap by saying that while we have seen a bit of a pause, we actually feel really good. The conversations I have with our customers, I mean all of the things they're trying to do I believe, our technology is at the heart of. Whether it's, rebuilding their applications, whether securing their data, transforming their infrastructure in this new era or changing their user experience as well as the way they interface with their customers. I think that we're in a very good position to help them do that. And we feel good about where we are. So thank you all for joining us today. And we'll look forward to catching up with you next quarter. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Chuck. Just to wrap the call, Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call which will reflect our fiscal 2020 third quarter results will be on, Wednesday May 13 2020 at 1 :30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

If you have any objections you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am you may begin. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Michelle. Welcome everyone to Cisco's third quarter fiscal 2020 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides including supplemental information will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found in the financial information section of our Investor Relations' website. Throughout this conference call we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today including forward-looking statements including the guidance we will be providing for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties including those related to COVID-19 that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during this quarter or during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. Chuck, I'll now turn it over to you. Chuck Robbins : Thanks Marilyn. Before we get started, I want to express my gratitude and appreciation for all the frontline workers who are fighting this pandemic every day to keep so many safe. I also want to express my sympathies for those who have lost their lives and the families that have endured the deepest pains from the impact of this tragic situation we are in today. This truly is unlike anything, any of us have ever experienced. As you can imagine, we have been focused on helping our employee\u2019s, customer\u2019s, partners and communities. We currently have 95% of our global workforce working from home, which was a seamless transition for us, as we already had a flexible work policy. And we build the technologies that allow organizations to stay connected, secure and productive. For those 5% who must be in the office to do the roles, we are clearly focused on their health and safety and are taking all of the necessary precautions. During the crisis, many of our customers and partners have been under enormous pressure as they face cash flow challenges. This is why we introduced a variety of free offers and trials for our Webex and security technologies as they dramatically shifted entire workforces to be remote. In addition, we announced $2.5 billion in financing with a new Business Resiliency Program through Cisco Capital to offer financial flexibility and support their business continuity. This will help customers and partner\u2019s access to technology they need now, invest for recovery and defer most of the payments until early 2021. This pandemic is highlighting so many inequities that already existed and is exacerbating these problems. I'm proud to say that Cisco has committed nearly $300 million to date to support both global and local pandemic response efforts, including providing technology and financial support for non-profits, first responders and governments. We are also donating personal protective equipment to hospital workers, including N-95 masks and face shields, 3D printed by Cisco volunteers around the world. I'm so proud of our teams who have been relentlessly focused on these efforts and continuing to identify how we can be innovative to help those most in need. I particularly like to call out our IT, Webex, security and supply chain teams, along with our partners and suppliers who have been working around the clock to ensure we are doing all that we can to keep organizations around the world up and running and giving back to our communities. Thank you. Now, turning to our third quarter performance. Despite the challenging environment we are all operating in, we delivered a solid quarter and financial performance in the midst of the greatest financial crisis of our lifetime. While we are not immune to the impacts of the global pandemic, we believe our underlying business fundamentals and financial position remains strong. As we look at the quarter it very much reflected the journey of the pandemic. In March, we were performing ahead of our expectations, as companies focused on building resiliency in their IT environments. Then in April we began to see a slowdown across the business, as countries across the world were locked down. While parts of our portfolio have been more impacted than others, we believe our leadership from a product, innovation and operational perspective remains solid. While there is so much uncertainty now, we believe our role has never been more important and our responsibility has never been greater, as much of the world is running on Cisco's technology from networking to collaboration to security to stay connected, secure and productive. Organizations more than ever must focus on resiliency and agility and those who had invested in digital capabilities were able to make this shift more seamlessly. While we cannot predict when it's going to happen, one thing we believe is that the demand for our products and services will be strong when we emerge from this situation. We believe the transition in our own business model through our shift to more software and subscription-based offerings is paying off. We saw continued strong adoption of our SaaS-based offerings and now have 74% of our software that is subscription versus 65% a year ago. We also believe, we remain well positioned over the long-term to serve our customers and create differentiated value aligned to cloud, 5G, Wi-Fi 6 and 400 gig. Our business model, diversified portfolio and ability to continue to invest in key growth priorities gives us a strong foundation to build even stronger customer relationships. As we prepare for the future, we will closely partner with our customers to modernize their infrastructure, secure their remote workforce and their data through our innovative solutions that will serve as the foundation for their digital organizations. Next, I'll turn to the performance of our business segments, starting with infrastructure platforms. With the world going online practically overnight, the demand on networks has never been greater, with users looking for secure connectivity, reliable performance and consistent experiences. This has led to our customers evaluating how to expand their capacity quickly, how best to protect their teams and how to keep their data secure, while keeping their business productive. It is also requiring enterprise IT to rapidly setup, deploy and provision mobile offices or mobile healthcare clinics. What I've seen IT teams do around the world and what they've made possible is simply astonishing. Our strategy and value proposition are clear. We are powering the world's ability to stay connected, productive and secure, while automating many of these capabilities. Our intent-based networking architecture was built for environments like this. For industries like healthcare, public services, financial services and service providers especially, having network infrastructure tightly integrated with security is mission-critical. In Q3 we offered new cloud-based COVID-19 bundles for teleworker, mobile healthcare and pop-up branch use cases through our partners and service providers. As customers modernize their network infrastructure, we saw continued strong customer adoption of our subscription-based Catalyst 9000, as customers look to quickly scale remote access capabilities to keep their employees safe and their businesses running. We continue to execute on our secure cloud scale SD-WAN strategy by investing in innovation and partnerships to help enterprises accelerate their multi-cloud strategies. As an example, we are now integrating with our Umbrella secure Internet gateway to give our customers flexibility to use best of breed cloud security with our industry leading SD-WAN solution. Our partnerships across web scale providers like AWS, Azure and our most recent announcement with Google Cloud allow us to offer a truly multi-cloud network fabric. As bandwidth and SaaS application demand increases, we are enabling our customers to securely connect branches and interconnect to different cloud providers to enable consistent application performance and user experience. Moving on to security, which is always at the heart of everything we do. In Q3, we saw solid growth, reflecting increased demand for our robust solutions to secure the rapid growth in remote workers and their devices. Being the largest enterprise security company in the world, we are uniquely positioned to safeguard our customers wherever they work. We have the most comprehensive and integrated end-to-end portfolio in the industry across the network, cloud, applications and endpoints. As I mentioned earlier, we provided extended free licenses for key security technologies that are designed to protect remote workers, including Cisco Umbrella, Zero Trust Security from Duo, industry-leading secure network access from Cisco AnyConnect and end point protection from our AMP technology. We are also supporting our customers on their multi-cloud journey by enabling them to secure direct internet access, cloud application usage and roaming users. We are only two quarters into our secure Internet gateway transition and we are already seeing strong adoption from existing and new customers. Building on the investments we made in innovation partnerships and acquisitions, we also introduced SecureX. This is the industry's broadest cloud-based security platform, connecting the breadth of our portfolio and our customer\u2019s security infrastructure by providing unified visibility, automation and simplified security across applications, the network endpoints and the cloud. Turning to applications. Teleworking and collaboration tools have become a lifeline for businesses and their people to stay connected and productive, with security and privacy being more critical than ever. Our portfolios at the center of our customer strategy for empowering teams and increasing productivity, as 95% of the Fortune 500 use our collaboration portfolio today. We take a security first approach to remote working and provide highly secure cloud-based collaboration solutions with integrated end-to end-encryption, while protecting our customer\u2019s privacy. Throughout the quarter, we invested in scaling our platform at an unparalleled speed to deliver a highly secure consistent experience and ensuring business continuity for our customers. We are now running our Webex platform at three times the capacity we were running at in February to manage the dramatic increase in usage growth. We had well over 500 million meeting participants, generating 25 billion meeting minutes in April, more than tripled the volume in February. We also added many new prospects through free Webex trials that we anticipate converting to revenue in the future. With applications at the core of every business and the surge in demand for monitoring tools that provide real time business insights and optimize user experiences in multi-cloud environments, AppDynamics continues to perform well, particularly in this environment. As I wrap up, I just want to reiterate how grateful I am to have our teams, our resources and our operational resiliency during this time. I also want to commend the heroic efforts of IT organizations and teams around the world who have had to digitize their operations and support remote workforces at an unprecedented speed and scale. This crisis has highlighted the importance of having highly resilient, globally scalable infrastructure technologies to keep the world running and this is what we build. We are providing an innovative solutions that help our customer support business continuity, drive productivity and ensure a highly secure work environment. We believe we will emerge from this crisis stronger than before. With our accelerated innovation cycle, refresh portfolio and significant progress on our shift to more software and subscriptions, we are in a better position today than in past times of uncertainty. Our confidence is further supported by our strong balance sheet to invest for the future and our proven ability to execute no matter the environment. I also believe our incredible culture has been amplified during this time and I'm so proud of what our teams have achieved. I am confident Cisco is resilient and we are built to last, regardless of what the future brings. Kelly. I'll now turn it over to you. Kelly Kramer : Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by guidance for Q4. Our overall Q3 results reflect good execution with strong margins and non-GAAP EPS growth in a very challenging environment. COVID-19 did have an impact on our financial results and business operations this quarter, especially in our supply chain where we saw manufacturing challenges and component constraints. Total revenue was $12 billion, down 8%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 34.9%, up 2.7 points. Non-GAAP net income was $3.4 billion, down 2% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS was $0.79, up 1%. Let me provide some more detail on our Q3 revenue. Total product revenue was down 12% to $8.6 billion. Infrastructure platforms was down 15%. This is the area that was most impacted by the supply chain challenges. Switching revenue declined in both Campus and Data Center. We did see strong growth with the continued ramp of the Cat 9K. Routing decline in both service provider and in enterprise. Data Center revenue decline driven by continued market contraction impacting both our servers and HyperFlex offerings. Wireless declined overall, but we did see strength in the ramp of our Wi-Fi 6 products and solid growth in Meraki. Applications was down 5%, driven by a decline in Unified Communications and TP end points. We did see growth in conferencing, as we saw a strong uptake with the COVID-19 environments. We also saw strong double-digit growth in AppDynamics and IoT software. Security was up 6% with strong performance in unified threat management, identity and access and advanced threat. Our cloud security portfolio performed well with strong double-digit growth and continued momentum with our Duo and Umbrella offerings. Service revenue was up 5%, driven by software and solutions support. We continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 34% of total software revenue up 9 points year-over-year. In terms of orders in Q3, total product orders were down 5%. During the quarter, there was a slowdown in April, as we saw the impact of the COVID-19 environment continue. Looking at our geographies, the Americas was flat, EMEA was down 4% and APJC was down 22%. Total emerging markets were down 21% with the BRICS plus Mexico down 29%. In our customer segments, public sector was up 1%, while enterprise was down 4%, commercial was down 11% and service provider was down 3%. Remaining performance obligations or RPO at the end of Q3 were $25.5 billion, up 11%. The portion related to product was up 25%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q3 gross margin was 66.6%, up 2 points. Product gross margin was 65.8%, up 2.1 point and service gross margin was 68.9%, up 1.6 points year-over-year. The increase in product gross margin was driven by productivity with continued memory cost savings and positive mix, partially offset by pricing. In terms of the bottom line from a GAAP perspective, Q3 net income was $2.8 million and EPS was $0.65. We ended Q3 with a total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $28.6 billion, operating cash flow was $4.2 billion, down 2% year-over-year. We have a very strong balance sheet, healthy free cash flow generation and the ability to quickly access capital markets. This is a competitive advantage in a challenging environment. Our commitment to our capital allocation program remains unchanged and we intended to continue to deliver long term value to our shareholders through the return of a minimum of 80% of our free cash flow annually. In Q3 we returned $2.5 billion to shareholders, during the quarter that was comprised of $1 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend. To summarize, we executed well with strong margins and non-GAAP EPS growth in a very challenging environment. We're seeing the returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the shift to more software and subscriptions, delivering long term growth and shareholder value. Let me reiterate our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201820. This guidance includes a type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue to decline in the range of minus 8.5% to minus 11.5% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64% to 65% and non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 31.5% to 32.5% and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 20%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected in the range from $0.72 to $0.74. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn, so we can move into the Q&A. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Kelly. Michelle, let's go ahead and plan to open up the line for questions. And as my usual quarterly reminder, we ask that you stick to one question. So we have time to get to others. Michelle? Operator : Thank you, Marilyn. Our first question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen and Company. You may go ahead, sir. Paul Silverstein : I'm torn whether to ask you about the infrastructure decline. So let me focus on that. Chuck and Kelly maybe you could comment on pricing as a courtesy and the other aspects of the fine gross margin performance. But if I could ask you on the infrastructure side, the thought arises given that so many organizations shifted to work from home. That's likely to persist to some degree. What's your outlook in terms of the benefits from the work from home in terms of the need for your solutions or robust connectivity, but also the potential negative aspect, fewer employees within the four walls of the enterprise? How does that impact campus switching and wireless LAN? If you could, any insight would be appreciated. Chuck Robbins : Yeah. Paul, thanks for your question and you're spot on in how you should think about it. Look from - when we look at our customers working from home there's clearly collaboration capabilities that I discussed around, where there is clearly more security that needs to be deployed. And then the question about when they return to the office and how much - how many people return to the office and what does that mean to the infrastructure supporting their campus environments is certainly one that we're going to be watching. I will tell you that, I\u2019ve had a lot of customers who are not at the center of this crisis, who realized during this pandemic that that they have a fair amount of technical debt and they have a lot of aged equipment. And so we all know what the timeframe is. But many of them have said this is going - this is a wakeup call and this is going to actually give us air cover to talk to our senior leadership team about upgrading and building out a more robust modernized infrastructure. So again, different customers will be able to do that at different paces based on how they're impacted, what their capital situation is. But that's how we think about it going forward and let's see how it plays out. Kelly, you want to talk at all about pricing thing? Kelly Kramer : Yeah. Chuck Robbins : Yes. Kelly Kramer : So yeah, Paul, on pricing we again continue to have strong margins this quarter. But I will say you know, some of the dynamics, we did benefit still this quarter because we had built up some inventory on memory at the lower prices. So we benefited greatly from that, which you'll see in the VCP [ph] But pricing did get a little bit worse. So pricing to your question Paul, from a gross margin rate on product year-over-year it drove minus 1.9 points on pricing, which is slightly worse than it was year-over-year last quarter and certainly for the quarters ahead, the ones even before that even so. But overall very, very strong productivity, again driven by memory and cost savings, as well as positive software mix. Chuck Robbins : And so you may want to talk about the correlation between the infrastructure platforms revenue number and the supply chain? Kelly Kramer : Yeah. I mean, like I said in the prepared remarks, basically the majority, if not all of our supply chain challenges that we had with both components in the factories being impacted was on the infrastructure platform side, so that certainly drove a very large chunk of that revenue. Paul Silverstein : Great. I appreciate that. Chuck, can you compare this to 10 years ago to the financial crisis and 20 years ago to the bubble? Chuck Robbins : Well, I don\u2019t think you can compare it to the bubble because we were at the epicenter of that one, so that one felt a lot different. In this one, we are sort of \u2013 we\u2019re secondary collateral damage, I would say. But I think the difference here is the broad based challenges that this thing has represent - as has presented to customers around the world. And - but we all know that the response from the Fed, the response from Congress on stimulus and the commitment to the economic acceleration or the attempt to slow the economic deceleration is certainly at a level we've never seen before. So I think that like everybody else depending on the availability of testing, the availability of therapeutics and clearly at some point when we get a vaccine, I do believe that the one difference that I see in this one is, that this came upon us so quickly and so consistently around the world that I do think customers are now stepping back and asking themselves, what do I need to do to harden my infrastructure and to better prepare my business for the next time something like this happens. Marilyn Mora : Right. Thanks, Chuck. Next question please? Operator : Thank you. Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer & Company. You may go ahead, sir. Ittai Kidron : Thanks. And glad to hear everybody is doing okay, all the workers as well. Thanks for the hard work there. I guess I had a question about applications, just given the push with Webex and AppDynamics, I was a little bit surprised, it was down on a year-over-year basis. I guess, Chuck, can you be a little bit more transparent here and give us kind of a better understanding of the relative revenue levels of Webex and AppDynamics versus the unified IP that is clearly declining and then overshadowing those businesses. I'm trying to understand how close are we to a bottom in the declining businesses where the growth businesses can finally be transparent on an overall product category? Chuck Robbins : Yeah, Ittai, I think, let me give you some color and then, Kelly can give you some metrics. But I think if you look over the last couple of years at the applications business and collaboration, I think they've performed reasonably well. As you think about what happened with Webex this time, what I will tell you is that our number one priority was to get customers up and running and so we have, we really have three categories of opportunity from customers that, as I said in my prepared remarks, that we believe will convert to revenue in the future. So we have enterprise customers, many of whom already had licenses, who need more licenses and they've exceeded their usage and we'll go back and we'll work with them to clean that up in the future. But again our priority was getting them up and running and just allowing them to be productive. The second is we had a number of new customers, enterprise customers, commercial customers who took advantage of Webex and deployed it for the first time in the 90-day free trial programs that we put out. And then there was a third category, which are more the individual free accounts that customers would sign-up for online. I would say the first two categories represent the majority of what we believe to be the revenue opportunity going forward, but that's something we'll see in the future and wasn't really reflected in the quarter that we just announced. So Kelly, you want to make any comments? Kelly Kramer : Yeah, I mean, the thing I'll say in terms of just helping you think through the size, the relative size of these pieces, you know, of applications, monitoring and analytics, the AppD business is as I said, growing double-digits, super strong, very good, but it is still fairly small in terms of the percentage of the overall applications and then the same thing for the IoT software. So it comes down the collab, traditional collab and then when I break that down, the biggest chunk of total collab is unified communications and that is where we are seeing the pressure, which we have been seeing right in the endpoints. So that's going to be with us for a while as that goes. We're clearly trying to transition there with some of the things that the teams are building there, but that's a big portion that will continue down for a while I would guess. But again conferencing is strong and like Chuck said, the revenue - this is the revenue we're talking about. When we look at the demand and when I look at the uptake, the significant uptake we had, the offers we had during this last quarter, just using our normal what we expect to convert from free to paid is going to be a nice tailwind for us over the next few quarters here. Ittai Kidron : Got it. And when you say endpoints, just to clarify, mostly IP, is that the right way to think about this? Kelly Kramer : Yeah, that's the right way to think about it. It's the biggest driver. Ittai Kidron : Okay. Good luck. Thanks. Kelly Kramer : Thanks, Ittai. Marilyn Mora : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead, sir. Rod Hall : Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess I'll - I've got two. One is regarding the order volumes, I wondered if you guys could juxtapose the fact that the US is kind of surprisingly flat after being down 8% last quarter and then also the commercial order acceleration on the downside, could you guys dig into the regional effects. Is that mostly APAC that's driving that or was it also weak in the US. And then the second question I had is on the $2.5 billion financing plan that you guys announced. I don't know, Kelly, could you give us some idea of how that affects cash flow, like is it affecting cash flow in this quarter and then how should we expect it to unwind into cash flow over the next few quarters. Thanks. Chuck Robbins : So, Kelly, why don't I give a little color on the Americas and commercial and then you can give some metrics and talk about the financials - the programs. So Rod on the Americas, we had a - it was certainly stronger than what we saw in Asia and Europe and frankly, if you just look at the timing of the pandemic, you can see Asia got hit early. So we saw the more consistent decline in the business. What we did see in the Americas and in the US is we saw obviously strengthened Webex and security as more - as customers executed on their business continuity. We also saw strength in service provider as they built out capacity. So we saw strength in cable, we saw strength in webscale business. And just to comment on the webscale space, which we haven't talked about in a while. We've been talking for years about how that was a marathon and that we had been investing both in our innovation, as well as in the relationships with those customers and we have had the second quarter in a row of robust growth in that part of the marketplace, which frankly is the beginnings of us seeing the results from the years of hard work and re-establishing ourselves there. So I'm really proud of what the teams have done. So that's been a bright spot in the last two quarters. On commercial, if you think about it, commercial or mid-sized enterprises, small medium businesses, they have been disproportionately impacted by this pandemic. So it's not a surprise that that business is going to be hit a little bit hard here, harder than others and Kelly you got any color to add on that and then talk about the financial program? Kelly Kramer : Yeah. So, yeah and also just to add to the US just to add, switching was also up and strong in the America and U.S - Americas as well. On commercial, it's a similar story, all of the geos were down, but it was down the least in the Americas followed by EMEA and the biggest chunk by far, it was down in APJC. So it's directly related to the kind of the geographical look when you look at overall how the orders went. In terms of the capital - Business Resiliency Program, we really just launched that at the end of April. So like a week or two before the quarter ended. So nothing impacted that in the quarter. So in Q4, there will be I'd say a small amount - we have a pipeline that we're going through. The early signs of the pipe that we're looking at, there is a big interest for smaller commercial customers who haven't really done financing, like a lot of healthcare systems, small healthcare systems, a lot of small colleges, so that - there is a pipeline there. So we'll start to see that convert in Q4. From a cash flow perspective, I don't expect a huge impact. There will be some impact in Q4 and slightly more in Q1, but then they get back on to normal payments in the January months. So we'll be watching that and hopefully it's helpful to those customers that haven't leveraged that in the past, but no impact this quarter and it will be a small impact I think in Q4. Rod Hall : Okay. Thank you. Kelly Kramer : Yeah. Marilyn Mora : Great. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead, sir. Sami Badri : Hi, thank you very much. I know you stated that routing was both down for SP and enterprise, but you also mentioned solid progress with webscale customers for two consecutive quarters and given some of the big shifts you have made to work from home and also given the fact that you launched new products in just December of 2019. How has the products like the Series 8000 performed during the entire shift? Are you seeing things accelerate or adoption of the product accelerate or has adoption has been a bit slower than your expectations and maybe just a general update on the product? Chuck Robbins : Yeah, thanks. I guess the good news is the success we've seen in the webscale space the last two quarters hasn't even seen the impact of the 8000 yet. So it's in trials in lots of customers still - they have very extended evaluation periods before they deploy. But I will tell you, it's doing incredibly well in those trials. We're very optimistic about what the teams have built. We feel good about it. Our service provider business was up mid-single digits and orders in the Americas in Q3 which indicates obviously the capacity buildouts that some of them we're seeing as well as that webscale business. So we'll see how it goes, but right now we're very optimistic and feel good about where we are with our platform. And there are more versions of that platform coming. We've just announced the first couple of members of the family. Sami Badri : Great. Thanks very much. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Chuck. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. You may go ahead. Joe Cardoso : Hi, this is Joe Cardoso on for Samik Chatterjee. I just wanted to get your thoughts around some of your key initiatives given the macro backdrop, specifically as you look at cloud, Wi-Fi 6 or 400 gig? Are you seeing any acceleration of demand or vice versa a push out there versus your expectations 90 days ago given the change in environment? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : So I think what we see happening with 5G is a little bit mixed, but generally there is a tendency for our customers to want to sort of put their foot on the accelerator. I think you heard some of our customers that are looking for permits and with regional governments around the United States and other places that they are not sure they're going to be able to get that done during this pandemic. You got other customers who are saying that they actually are not having a problem. But it's - so we think generally there is going to be an acceleration, particularly as our service provider customers also realize that some element of this work from home scenario will not go away. And so we're going to be continuing in the future to work in these very hybrid worlds where we're going to have even a much broader distribution of where their users will be working from and I think that's the reason that they want to continue to accelerate the deployments and the strategies around 5G. I'd say in Wi-Fi 6, I don't see any big significant shift. I'd say on the cloud, I've had mixed feedback from customers. I think that in general, it's probably a tailwind to cloud, but there are some customers that believe they have a cloud strategy and this doesn't - they don't understand why this would change how they go about it. So - but it will, as it relates to our strategy. We are going to continue to accelerate those technologies that help our customers use the cloud more effectively. We are going to - as our customers, some of our customers are going to need OpEx offers in the future given CapEx restraints. So we're working on a balance of our portfolio to be delivered in both op CapEx models to give customers the flexibility that they need. And we're definitely going to continue to accelerate the development and work around our security portfolio as it relates to remote work and cloud connectivity because we think that's only going to accelerate as well. Marilyn Mora : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great, thanks. You know, understanding the end of March and beginning of April were largely work from home or business continuity focus with customers. But as we get into kind of this new normal, do you feel like customers have had an initial sense of what revised budget outlooks are looking like for 2020 or are customers still relatively uncertain that you're talking to. Chuck Robbins : It's a very good question. I think we went through a surge for a few weeks where customers were solely focused on business continuity and getting themselves prepared for this work from home environment and then I think they took a breath for a couple of weeks and then they stepped back and I could even see it in how we worked as a company. We were solely focused on the immediate virus response getting our teams up and running, getting our customers up and running, making sure we had investments in the community and all those things. And then frankly, we took a breather and now even my calendar and the things that we're focused on are much more sort of the traditional business issues and how we move forward. And I think our customers are in the same mode. I think again they dealt with business continuity. They took a few weeks to figure out okay, based on this, how do I re-prioritize the projects that I have - that I had planned for the rest of the year and I think every customer is at a different phase right now on how they're deploying it and it's going to be very industry-specific as to who moves forward. I'll give you a few examples. Obviously, we're working very closely with higher education because you see in the news the discussion around whether students will be on campus in the fall. As one of the heads of one of the biggest systems in the United States told me, they used anything and everything they could to get students online back in March and now they need to go step back and actually build the real robust long-term architecture that they need and we're working with them to do that. I think healthcare is one that they're going to make investments. I think telehealth is here finally and I think that's going to change forever and I think that those - that industry will continue to work and build out a more robust architecture to support telehealth as opposed to what we put together as quickly as we could with them over the last few months. You got the hospitality, the leisure, the travel that are going to struggle, which is one of the big reasons we wanted to make sure we got our financing program out there candidly is if they need to make investments during this time, we want to help them do that. Not only is it the right thing to do, but they remember afterwards that we were partners to them during their tough time and I think you see financial services moving ahead. So it's going to vary greatly by industry. But I think we're going to have better visibility in the next 60 days or so. Meta Marshall : Great, thank you. Marilyn Mora : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Tal Liani from Bank of America. You may go ahead, sir. Tal Liani : Hi, guys. Services was one of the only areas that grew both sequentially and year-over-year and the question is, why don't we see the impact of, first of all, what are the drivers for that and why don't we see the impact of COVID-19. We're hearing from others that customers are less willing because of the uncertainty to sign on contracts that are longer than one year. So they see the parallel decline in services and just - I would like to get an update on this space and how long does it take it to follow the trends in Infrastructure Platforms and the other products? Kelly Kramer : Hi, Tal. That's a good question. So I would say, yeah, we had another strong quarter in Q3 and again, it has been driven by like their solution support and their software support. That continues to be a big driver of it. But your point is - of what you're hearing from other companies is absolutely true and what's happening to us, I would say that I expect pressure in my guide for Q4. I have some pressure to services there and where we're seeing it is on things that are like in our advanced services, our proactive services, consulting kind of things, those things that are either discretionary or you only make progress when you're actually in the enterprises, those are seeing pressure that I think will see translate like hitting milestones or doing projects. And then in terms of the maintenance, there is a lag usually on infrastructure maintenance. When the orders drag, it\u2019s usually a lag for a while. So we'll start to feel maybe a little bit of that in the upcoming quarters. But overall, that's a very solid business and we've gone through cycles like this before and we always come out pretty strong on that, but I think your point is a fair point. Tal Liani : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Right, thanks Tal. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. You may go ahead, sir. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot for taking my question guys. I guess a fairly common question I get on you guys is how does Cisco stack up this time versus the past recessions like '08, '09 for example. So it would be really helpful to maybe get your perspective on how do you think Cisco handles and performance through this cycle versus past one and really to get to the bottom of how is Cisco different and perhaps better positioned to manage this correction versus the past one would be helpful. Chuck Robbins : I think that we're better positioned for sure and you would expect me to say that, but I do believe it. I think that we've spent the last few years driving a significant refresh across our enterprise portfolio, across our service provider offerings, our 5G packet core capabilities. Our security portfolio is robust. We spent the last two years rebuilding and modernizing the Webex architecture as well as unifying the user interface. We've now gone through two months of building out capacity on a global basis. Webex was the largest platform in the world in February and now, it's three times what it was then. So we've built that out. And I think that if you look at the software content in our product portfolio and the percentage of our revenue that, that represents and the percentage of that, that's coming from subscriptions and SaaS versus where we were in 2008, I think all of those things just position us more effectively than perhaps we would have been back then. So I feel good about where we are and I think that our balance sheet is strong. Obviously, our ability to navigate this financially is strong. So I feel good and I wasn't running the company in 2008 clearly, but I was here and it just feels like we're fortunate that we've spent the last few years doing complete refreshes on almost all of our technology. So we have very relevant new offers for our customers right now. Marilyn Mora : Right. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Jim Suva from Citigroup Investment. You may go ahead, sir. Jim Suva : Thank you. Can you talk a little bit about enterprise, the orders, the trends, maybe the monthly cadence and importantly the color or commentary you have as enterprises are working from home with their employees, keeping their networks up and running, potentially delaying things, how does that kind of look as you go forward because it seems like it's a typical request for proposals might be a little bit different discussions now. What I mean is, say for example, does this help the incumbency of Cisco a little more, does it give you more visibility to hey, Chuck, when things return back to normal in three or six months or at some point, hey, do we have a buildup of more visibility than what we currently have. If you could just help us with the enterprise some commentary, that'd be great. Chuck Robbins : Yeah. Thanks, Jim. I will tell you this, the number of emails that I've gotten from my peers from virtually every industry about what our teams did to help them, many of them saying we had to get 150,000 people up and running remotely over VPN and you guys helped us do that overnight and for that we're gracious or around Webex and how they couldn't be running their business right now if it wasn't for Webex. And I mean, so we hosted an advisory board call with about 50 of our strategic customers around the world last week or the week before, I can't remember exactly when it was at this point and they spent like the majority of the first third of the call just going through stories of gratitude around what our teams have done. And I tell you that because I think what's happened is, to your point, Jim, I think there is a tendency during these times, you want to work with companies that you believe are strong, are solid and are great partners and are going to do whatever it takes to make you successful during these times and I think that's what our customers believe we do. I think, again as I said earlier, you're going to have some customers right now that are going to look at their infrastructure, the CEOs are looking at it and saying, I will never be this unprepared for something like this again and if there is a wave two coming in the fall, many of them may say we need to work on a lot of this right now. I don't know that yet, but we think there could be. I talked earlier about what we see in certain industries where there will be investments like higher ed. Right now, frankly there is K-12 contingency plans being made, even though I know most K-12 institutions would much rather be teaching those kids in schools for obvious reasons, but it's also not a definite that they'll be going back into the classroom in the fall. So that's happening. The pharmaceuticals and the drug manufacturers are working to beef up their infrastructure for all the research, building up their cyber infrastructure for obvious reasons. So there is a lot of things that are going really well, but then again you have industries that are at the heart of this crisis who I wouldn't expect to make significant investments until we get to the other side. Jim Suva : Thank you so much for the details. It's greatly appreciated. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Jim. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Jim. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research. You may go ahead, sir. Pierre Ferragu : Thank you for taking my question. Chuck, I'd like to come back to you, just the very last comments you made, you said some industries are getting hit very hard now and it's going to be tough for them to make investments before we get on the other side of the crisis. And so what I'm trying to figure out is how much of the economy is already in a situation of feeling the pain, cutting IT budgets and how much of the economy is not there yet and actually at risk of getting into that stage, maybe in three months or even in six months from now because as you say though that these enterprises are like maintaining continuity are actually more into a mode of making the right spending to keep the business running. But maybe in three months to six months, they're going to actually start getting the more of a macro pains, the recessionary environment hurting their business as well. And so my question is really how much are we into that already. What percentage of the economy has been hurt and what percentage could be helped further down the line? Chuck Robbins : Yeah, Pierre. It's a very good question. I'm going to give you just my pure instinct on this. I think that any customer who potentially could be at risk in three months to six months is already pausing. I don't think that anybody is going to be aggressive right now because any of us can see if we have liquidity issues, we have solvency issues, we have anything that is three months to six months away, my peers, we're all planning, we're working on that right now. No one is waiting. So I think most of the impact that you will see in the next six months or nine months, I think those customers are impacted. Let me say it that way. They know they are impacted. I will tell you, from our perspective, if you map the industries that we believe will continue to invest against our customer base, there is a good correlation that a lot of the industries that we believe will invest are already a large percentage of our customer makeup. So whether you look at public sector, service providers, financial services, higher education, I mean these are all big pieces of business for us and we think that all those and others will also continue to invest. So it's mix, but to answer your specific question, I think anyone who is going to be in trouble three months to six months from now is already pausing and has already been impacted. Pierre Ferragu : That's great. Very clear answer. Thanks for that. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Pierre. We have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Tim Long from Barclays. You may go ahead, sir. Tim Long : Thank you for squeezing me in. Chuck, wanted to ask about competition, kind of a twofold question here. Number one, if you think about some of the pieces of your business where some competitors have been trying to take share, enterprise networking comes to mind where several companies are focused on gaining share there. What do you think this major pandemic disruption does to others ability to maybe disrupt the high market share that you have? And then conversely if you think about some of the markets where Cisco has a real opportunity to gain share, it sounds like cloud would be one of those, you guys are doing well. But do you think there is any of the markets where you are poised to take some share that are impacted either positively or negatively? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Yeah, it's a great question. I think you even heard from some of our competitors on their earnings calls where they had planned on entering markets and they've acknowledged that it is going to be more difficult to do that during this time in areas where we have good market share. And again I'll remind you that in those areas, like in the campus, we have probably the most robust portfolio we've had in a decade. So we're very - in very good shape with the portfolio. And I think again customers - they are in times like these, they want to go with people they trust and know and I think that will work in our favor. But on the - in the areas to your point where we can take share, I think certainly the webscale play that we've been running for the last 4, 4.5 years I think is one area over the next year. I think in the service provider space with the 8000s and recapturing some routing share because of those portfolios and both of those sets of customers, they will continue doing the evaluations and the new deployments, because they have to because they have just requirements that are increasing on a daily basis. And I think that in the carrier space with 5G and the access networks, the backhaul networks, the core networks with the 8000 and some of our other technology we've come out with, I think we can take share there as well. So, I feel good about where we are and the things that we are in control of right now, I think we're in a pretty good position. Tim Long : Okay. Thank you, sir. Marilyn Mora : All right. Thanks, Tim and that was the last question of our call. Chuck Robbins : Yeah. So let me just close quickly by, first of all, thanking all of you for being with us and just telling you all that we hope that you're safe and your family is safe and you continue to be safe. I also want to just reiterate our gratitude for the front line workers and these are the healthcare workers, the first responders, some of our colleagues locally who are in the homeless camps, helping try to stem the tide of this pandemic flowing through those kinds of environments. Those people who live paycheck to paycheck who are struggling right now, our thoughts and prayers are with everybody and our gratitude is especially with those who are on the front lines. We look forward to getting to the other side of this and we look forward to doing our part in helping our customers and helping society actually thrive as much as possible during this very difficult time. So thanks for being with us today on our call. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Chuck. Cisco's next quarterly earnings call, which will reflect our Q4 2020 and annual results will be on Wednesday, August 12th at 1 :30 PM Pacific Time, 4:30 PM Eastern Time.

Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Wolfe Research LLC George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC Operator : Welcome to Cisco's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 financial results conference call. At the request of Cisco Systems, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Sue. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO, and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties, including COVID-19, that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. In Q2 fiscal 2019, we completed the sale of our SPVSS [Service Provider Video Software Solutions] business. As such, all of the financial information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SPVSS business from our historical results. I will now turn it over to Chuck. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thank you, Marilyn. We hope all of you and your families are staying safe and healthy. Our thoughts remain with everyone who has been affected by the pandemic, and we are grateful to those who remain on the front lines working to help those impacted during these challenging times. As we've been preparing for this call, it's offered me some time to reflect on what we've achieved since I stepped into this role five years ago. Through the hard work of everyone at Cisco, we have undergone a significant transformation in the midst of some of the most complex times in our history. I am so proud of what our teams have accomplished. They have demonstrated resiliency, determination, and compassion as we delivered on our financial commitments, brought market-leading innovation to our customers, transitioned our business model, and driven a culture that has truly shined over the past six months. The Cisco of today is more agile, innovative, and focused. Through both organic and inorganic innovation, we delivered incredible new technology with new, more flexible consumption offers for our customers with more software and subscriptions. At our Financial Analyst Conference in 2017, we laid out key metrics for our transformation. We set a goal of 30% of our revenue to come from software. And while we achieved 29% in fiscal year 2020, we did achieve 31% in Q4. We also delivered 51% of our revenue from software and services in FY 2020, exceeding our target of 50%. Lastly, we now have 78% of our software revenue sold as subscription, beating our target of 66%. With our customers as our guide, we have successfully executed against our strategy to help them transform and modernize their organizations. We launched our intent-based networking architecture using automation and machine learning to help our customers drive simplicity and cost-effective management of their networks. As customers move more workloads to the cloud, we're offering fast, highly secure access to applications hosted anywhere, in the private data center, public cloud, or a SaaS platform, with our cloud security integrated with our SD-WAN solution. We introduced new capabilities across software, silicon, and optics to help bring to life the Internet for the future. The innovation we've driven in our security portfolio has helped us become the top enterprise security company in the world. With Webex, we have the most trusted secure platform for remote collaboration for the enterprise, and we're also delivering real-time insights for customers in their multi-cloud environments to optimize user experience with our insights and observability assets like AppDynamics. Over the past few years, this transition has resulted in improvements in our financial performance, including expanding margins and demonstrating continued financial discipline. Once again, I want to thank our teams for what we've achieved. If the past year has taught us anything, it's the need to always be nimble. I believe that the changes we've made to our business now put us in a position of strength as we focus on our future. We're a company that embraces change, and we've shown our ability to thrive in any environment. The past six months have unquestionably reshaped our world. Industries, governments, and work have changed dramatically, and many of these changes will become permanent. At Cisco, we are committed to helping our customers truly digitize their organizations for the future, regardless of the challenges or fundamental shifts that we may face. Like many other organizations, we've also had the opportunity to reexamine our business and our portfolio for this new world. As I said last quarter, we were going to take time to better understand the short and long-term implications of COVID-19, and we now believe we have a better view. Based on the many conversations we've had with our customers around the world, we believe we have perspective into how they will adapt their technology strategies for the future to ensure greater resiliency, agility, and innovation. We know how to adapt our business's strategy to align with where our customers are headed. The changes we are making to our business reflect how we are leveraging our existing strengths, investing for growth, and unlocking new opportunities. We will also be very disciplined on our cost structure, as we always have been. Over the next few quarters, we will be taking out over $1 billion on an annualized basis to reduce our cost structure. At the same time, we're going to rebalance our R&D investments to focus on key areas that will position us well for the future. More specifically, we will accelerate the transition of the majority of our portfolio to be delivered as a service. We will also accelerate our investments in the following areas : cloud security; cloud collaboration; key enhancements for education, healthcare, and other industries; increased automation in the enterprise; the future of work; and application insights and analytics. At the same time, we will continue our focus in the following areas, many of which have been accelerated by the pandemic : multi-cloud investment; 5G and Wi-Fi 6; 400-gig; optical networking; next-generation silicon; AI; and more. These investments will help define the next phase of our transformation and allow us to bring the best, most relevant innovation to our customers in simpler, more easily consumables ways. I am confident that, once again, we have the right strategy that will deliver what our customers need from us, and we will emerge from this challenging time as a stronger company than before. Now, let me discuss our performance in the quarter. While our results reflect the ongoing challenges in the current environment, we executed well. As you would expect, the pandemic has had the most impact on our enterprise and commercial orders, driven by an overall slowdown in spending. We are seeing customers continue to delay their purchasing decisions in certain areas, while increasing spend in others until they have greater visibility and clarity on the timing and shape of the global economic recovery. Despite this challenging economic environment, the pandemic has also triggered a massive and rapid shift to remote operations and automation to maximize personal safety. With this, many customers are increasingly reliant on our broad portfolio of technologies, resulting in another quarter of strong demand for our Catalyst 9000, security, Webex, and other SaaS-based solutions. Throughout fiscal year 2020, we demonstrated operational resilience based on our strong customer relationships, a solid financial foundation, differentiated innovation, and a compelling strategic transformation built on the strength of our key technology platforms. Now, I'll cover a few highlights from the quarter. In June, we introduced an expanded business resiliency portfolio offering healthcare and education solutions with simpler consumption models and services to accelerate adoption. We will continue to expand this portfolio to cover areas such as social distancing in the workplace, effective virtual employee engagement at scale, and pop-up connected clinics. Within our Infrastructure Platforms business, we continue to see a strong ramp of our Catalyst 9K portfolio as many customers take advantage of their employees working from home to refresh their aging infrastructure, enabling them to simplify, secure, and automate the management of their networks. Our acquisition of ThousandEyes will complement these capabilities by adding deeper and broader visibility and analytics across networks and applications, enabling us to deliver the best possible experiences for our customers. By integrating their SaaS-based offering with our AppDynamics application intelligence portfolio and SD-WAN technology, we can provide unparalleled intelligence and insights at cloud scale, driving improved customer experience as well as reliability of their applications. Security continues to be a top priority for our customers, particularly in this distributed digital world. Our ability to connect and protect our customers working from anywhere, on any device, is accelerating the adoption of our comprehensive security portfolio, resulting in double-digit revenue growth this quarter. As more data goes to the cloud and users become more distributed, we had good momentum in our cloud security solutions, protecting workloads, applications, and data. We also continue to expand our capabilities to enable simplification and automation of our customer security infrastructure. A good example of this is our SecureX platform, which is designed to unify visibility, enable automation, and deliver a consistent experience. Since our launch six weeks ago, we have over 2,100 active daily customers, two-thirds of which have two or more products active. We're also delivering Secure Remote Worker solutions that span our endpoint security portfolio combined with the power of our Zero Trust Architecture with Duo, AnyConnect, Umbrella, and AMP for Endpoints. Applications have become a lifeline for so many organizations, and this has only increased over the past few months. As organizations define what their future looks like, our collaboration technology will play a key role in evolving how they work, transact, and connect. Webex had strong performance this quarter with double-digit growth, as businesses, governments, educators, and front-line workers everywhere have embraced remote work. We expect this momentum to continue, as we have begun to see the conversion of free trials into paid subscriptions. AppDynamics also achieved another solid quarter. These monitoring tools offer our customers great value by providing real-time insights from a single pane of glass to optimize user experience in their multi-cloud environments. As we think about all that we've achieved over the past five years, I want to take a moment to acknowledge Kelly Kramer, our Chief Financial Officer, who has been an incredible partner to me. She has played a key role in reshaping Cisco into the company we are today. I want to let you all know that Kelly has made the decision to retire from Cisco. Over her 8-plus years here, Kelly has led the effort to improve our financial performance, focused on investor confidence, and helped position Cisco for success. Kelly and I have been focused on simple, clear communication, absolute transparency, delivering on our commitments, and always aligning Cisco for future growth. Kelly has graciously agreed to stay on as CFO until we have her successor on board and will advise us with a succession process. I can assure you that, with Kelly staying on during the search and with our world-class finance team, we will have a seamless transition. Kelly, thank you so much for your partnership and your friendship. You will truly be missed. Now, before I turn it over to Kelly, I want to reiterate my confidence for what the future holds. Over the past five years, we have not shied away from making bold moves to position us for long-term growth, and now is no different. We are committed to running a strong business as well as leveraging technology for good to solve the world's biggest challenges and create new opportunities for the future. As we've demonstrated, we have helped our customers build resiliency in difficult environments, through industry disruptions, and in times of rapid growth. We will also continue to use our position to make our communities and world a better place. Whether it's tackling the global health pandemic or social injustice and intolerance, we are committed to our purpose of powering an inclusive future for all. As we start a new fiscal year, I believe we have incredible opportunities in front of us. We will navigate the pandemic in the most effective way possible while not damaging the long-term prospects for Cisco. We remain strongly aligned to our customers' priorities and deeply committed to delivering long-term growth. Now, I'll turn it over to Kelly. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Chuck. It really has been great, and I want to thank you, the leadership team, and really all of Cisco. I also want to thank my finance team, who has an amazing job. I'll certainly miss Cisco, but I'm looking forward to what's next. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, then cover the full year, followed by guidance for Q1. Our overall Q4 results reflect good execution with strong margins in a very challenging environment. Total revenue was $12.2 billion, down 9%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 33%, up 0.4 points. Non-GAAP net income was $3.4 billion, down 5% year over year, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.80, down 4%. Let me provide some more detail on our Q4 revenue. Total product revenue was down 13% to $8.8 billion. Infrastructure Platforms was down 16%. This is the product area most impacted by the COVID environment. We saw declines across switching, routing, data center, and wireless, driven primarily by the weakness we saw in the commercial and enterprise markets. We did see pockets of strength with the continued growth of Cat 9K, which was up double digits, and the ramp of our Wi-Fi 6 products. Data center was particularly weak with the decline of the market and DRAM price declines. Applications was down 9%. On the positive side, we saw strong double-digit growth in Webex with the importance of remote working. We also saw solid growth in AppDynamics and IoT software. This was offset by declines in Unified Communication and TP endpoints. Security was up 10%, with strong performance in network security, identity and access, advanced threat and unified threat management. Our cloud security portfolio performed well, with strong double-digit growth and continued momentum with our Duo and Umbrella offerings. Service revenue was flat for the quarter, but we had growth in our maintenance business as well as software and support services. This was offset by our advisory services, which was impacted by the COVID environment. We continued to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 78% of total software revenue, up 8 points year over year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, at the end of Q4 were $28.4 billion, up 12%. RPO for product was up 17% and service was up 9%. The continued growth in RPO demonstrates the strength of our portfolio of software and services. In terms of orders in Q4, total product orders were down 10%. Looking at our geographies, the Americas was down 11%, EMEA was down 6%, and APJC was down 13%. Total emerging markets were down 19%, with the BRICs plus Mexico down 26%. In our customer segments, public sector was down 1%, while enterprise was down 7%. Commercial was down 23%, and service provider was down 5%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q4 gross margin was 65%, down 0.5 points. Product gross margin was 63.2%, down 1.5 points. And service gross margin was 69.8%, up 1.9 points year over year. Our Q4 GAAP tax rate was 16.7%, which reflects the true-ups to the annual tax rate. In terms of the bottom line, from a GAAP perspective, Q4 net income was $2.6 billion and EPS was $0.62. We ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $29.4 billion. Operating cash flow was $3.8 billion, down 4% year over year. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through our quarterly dividend. We continued to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. Just last week we closed our acquisition of ThousandEyes. This move is consistent with our strategy of increasing investment in innovation and R&D for our growth areas. I'll now cover the full fiscal year results. We delivered strong margins and grew EPS in a very challenging environment. Revenue was $49.3 billion, down 5%. Total non-GAAP gross margin was 66%, up 1.4 points, and our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 33.8%, up 1.5 points. From a bottom line perspective, non-GAAP net income was $13.7 billion, down 1%, and non-GAAP EPS was $3.21, up 4%. GAAP net income was $11.2 billion and GAAP EPS was $2.64. We delivered operating cash flow of $15.4 billion, down 3%. Normalized for the cash received in Q1 fiscal 2019 related to the legal settlement with Arista, operating cash flow was flat for fiscal 2020. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $8.6 billion to shareholders over the fiscal year, which represents 59% of our free cash flow. That was comprised of $2.6 billion of share repurchases and $6 billion for our quarterly dividend. To summarize, we executed well in Q4 and the fiscal year with strong margins in a very challenging environment. We're seeing the returns on the investments we are making in innovation and driving the shift to more software and subscriptions, delivering long-term growth and shareholder value. Let me reiterate our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. This guidance is subject to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue to decline in the range of minus 9% to minus 11% year over year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64% to 65%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 30% to 31%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 19%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.69 to $0.71. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Kelly. Sue, we'll now open up the queue for questions. And as a reminder, we ask the audience to address one question only so we have time to get through as many as possible. Sue, I'll turn it over to you. Operator : Thank you. The first question is from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead. Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you very much. My first question is for the team here. I just wanted to know. Now that you've achieved the 50% of revenue coming from software and services, and that was the guidepost given at the 2017 Analyst Day, do you guys have a new target in mind and new range? I know you guys introduced some new products and new services and some new investment areas. I'm just hoping to understand to see if you get maybe a new roadmap or a new target that we should hold you guys or measure you against? Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Sami, thanks for the question. And it's been a pretty successful three years as we've been making this transition, and we obviously still have a ways to go, to your question, relative to a new target. We were talking about this in the last week or so, and we feel like we just need to get through this pandemic cycle that we have, and then we'll set some new targets and we'll communicate them to you at that time. So we don't have one yet. Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it, thank you. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Sami. Next question, please? Operator : The next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley Investment Research. You may go ahead. Meta A. Marshall - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thanks. Chuck, you referred to kind of changes you were going to make to the portfolio based on conversations you were having with customers. Where do you feel like they are in terms of knowing what their kind of network architectures are looking like when they come back, or just how their budgets are looking for the remainder of the year? Thanks. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Meta. I think that when we think about the network architectures, I think one thing we know is that our customers are living in this multi-cloud environment. And as they went into this work-from-home environment, as I said on our last call, those who had technical debt and those who had not really invested in modernizing their infrastructure, they know they will need to do that and they'll do it at different paces based on their financial abilities. I'd say that it's clear that many of our customers do want to consume the technology as a service, so we're currently looking at the entire portfolio to see how deeply we can get into the portfolio relative to delivering as a service, and I think we'll have a lot of that in the marketplace by the end of the calendar year. We will also be working with our customers on their network architectures, which are certainly going to be prevalent on or dependent upon cloud security, on SD-WAN and the integration of those, so we're going to accelerate that, as well as helping them navigate this multi-cloud world because I do think that we have seen some customers accelerate that shift as well. So the network architectures that we built 15 years ago, as I've talked about, just aren't relevant today because the traffic flows are completely different. And so we'll continue to work with customers, and I think it will be at a different pace just based on how they all come out and how they manage the pandemic. Meta A. Marshall - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thanks. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer & Company. You may go ahead. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Chuck, when you talk about the portfolio and these changes you need to make over there and the acceleration of R&D in some areas, can you talk about more specifically what areas you feel you need the most adjustment in? And also, it feels like the pace of technology evolution clearly is just \u2013 it keeps accelerating. And there's so much of it you can do internally and you've been very acquisitive in the past, but I can't help but feel like you need to move much faster and much more aggressive on M&A. I know you've been very disciplined from a price standpoint, and clearly a market like we have today is not necessarily conducive to that. But just given the fact that we're moving much, much faster, are you more open to get a bit more aggressive here on the M&A front to fill in gaps, because it sounds like it feels like the longer you wait on this, the gaps will keep getting bigger, not smaller? Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Ittai, it's a great question. And your first question around the areas that we feel like we need to invest, I think this pandemic is basically just \u2013 it's just giving us the air cover to accelerate the transition of R&D expense into cloud security, cloud collab, away from the on-prem aspects of the portfolio. Clearly, we've got a lot of technology that we're working on today to help our customers over the next three, four, five years in this multi-cloud world that they're going to live in, and you'll see more of that come out over the next couple of years. But on the M&A question, I think that there's clearly a recognition that the valuations of the assets that are attractive have achieved different levels. And so, I think that we'll continue to be disciplined, but I would say that we're open to looking at the current world and the reality that we live in. So, I think we're open to any and all ideas and we continue to work through different options, and we have a list of potential targets that we maintain on a pretty regular basis. And so, I think the real difference is there has to be a recognition that the valuations have changed, but we'll try to be disciplined and do the right thing at the right time. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Ittai. Sue, let's get the next question. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jim Suva with Citigroup Investment Research. You may go ahead. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much, Chuck and Kelly. And Kelly, you'll be significantly missed, so thank you for the duration. But looking forward, if my model is right, and maybe it's wrong, it seems like year-over-year revenue comparisons get materially easier, maybe to the tune of 400 basis points year-over-year for the quarter outlook. And like with Huawei being pushed out and Cisco being preferred in many countries, even beyond the United States as well as an incumbency factor coming out of coronavirus, help me bridge your kind of year-over-year revenue growth. And maybe it's still yet to come about, why things aren't more positive because the comps are easier, Huawei is less preferred and Cisco has an incumbency factor, and we're coming out of coronavirus. Thank you. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Well, I'll comment subjectively, and then I'll let Kelly talk a little bit about the numbers. I wouldn't say that we're coming out of the coronavirus right now. I think that it feels to me very much like it felt 90 days ago. And clearly, in the US, we have not seen \u2013 we've seen some areas that have gotten better and obviously some that have not. But I'd say, in general, it feels pretty much the same as it did 90 days ago to us relative to that. I think that some of the things you're talking about around service providers around the world and the possibility where we would be getting opportunities that we wouldn't have had before, I think some of those are still to be seen, but we would share that optimism, and we'll have to wait and see how that plays out. Kelly, do you want to talk about the... Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yeah, and then from the compares, I mean, Q1 of 2020, so my guide for this next quarter, in Q1 of 2021, that's our toughest compare. Obviously, we had \u2013 Q3 and Q4 were very, very tough for us in 2020 because of COVID, so comparing to Q1 of 2020 right now, we still have some tougher compares. But they do get easier as the year goes on, assuming that the pandemic ends. But as you know, Jim, we forecast based on what we see, based on the order rates, and we feel this is a pretty accurate guide. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you so much, Chuck and Kelly, for the details. And Kelly, thank you so much for your service. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Jim. I appreciate it. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. You may go ahead. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe sort of a question, two clarifications. Chuck, to your response to Jim's question, when you talked about it feeling pretty much the same as 90 days ago in the US, you're referring to both enterprise and commercial, your small and medium customers as well as your large customers across the board? And then with respect to the $1 billion that you referenced in terms of coming out of costs, will that all be out of OpEx? And I appreciate there's probably some sensitivity if it involves head count reduction, as I suspect it does. But Kelly, I'm hoping you could give us a sense for the timing in that reduction and the nature of the reductions. Is that all in OpEx, or is some of it out of cost of goods sold? Thanks. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yeah. Paul, let me just tell you a little bit \u2013 I'll give you a little sort of a customer segment and around-the-world view of what it's felt like in the last 90 days or so, so maybe that will help add a little color. In the US, in particular, I'd say we saw some strength in the very high end of enterprise. And then sort of as you go down in the marketplace, we just \u2013 the weakness got a little bit worse as you just sort of went straight down, as you would expect with small business, medium business, and even smaller-sized enterprises that didn't perform as well as the very largest of enterprises. But we did see strength in the very large enterprise in the US. We also saw some strength in federal in the US clearly, and that was actually really promising because they had a very strong quarter a year ago, so they executed really well. Service provider around the world, if you look at Asia and Europe, our service provider business was positive in both of those regions, and it was just slightly negative in the US. It was primarily Canada and Mexico in the Americas that drove the negative here. So overall, that was a bright spot, particularly outside of the United States. We did see countries, a few countries that actually began to show some positives, and I'm trying to think through like can we build a model that says Asia went in first and so they're going to come out first, and we did see Japan had a good quarter for us on the demand side. Korea had a good quarter for us on the demand side, and we're seeing some positives. Germany had a good quarter for us. And I'd say if we think about how our European team feels right now, they actually feel reasonably okay. Not great-great, but better than they did 90 days ago. The Americas is still sort of the wild card I'd say that we see right now. So hopefully that gives you a little more color around what we're seeing up and down the stack. And then, Kelly, do you want to? Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Sure. Where you'll see the costs coming out, I'd say the majority of it in OpEx, I'd say maybe an 80/20 split. We'll certainly have some in COGS too on that side, on the services side, but mostly in OpEx. And in terms of timing, we should see a lot of this, most of this, the bulk of this coming out at the end of Q1 and a little bleeding over into Q2 depending on the country it's in. Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Kelly, thank you. You'll be missed. Thanks, Chuck. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thank you, Paul. I appreciate it. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yes, she will. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Paul. Next question? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead. Rod Hall - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks for the question. I guess I wanted to go back to the linearity of this order trajectory, Chuck and Kelly, on particularly enterprise. I guess if we go back to 2009, we're starting to see commercial order volumes deteriorating into the range we saw back then in that recession. We haven't really seen enterprise do that, and I wonder whether you think that that is where we're kind of headed here. It just feels like this is not turning out to be a V-shaped recovery. It's more like we're headed into a real recession, a prolonged recession. So I'm just curious kind of what you think about the trajectory of those volumes and what they look like at the end of the quarter versus the beginning of the quarter. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: I would say that \u2013 I'll make a couple comments and I'll kick it to Kelly to give you a little bit more color. I think that as Kelly and I looked at where we expected demand to be from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, we were pretty much in line. In fact, it was a slight, slight, slight bit better than we had anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. But I would not get too excited about it being slightly better, as you can tell from the guide. And then I think linearity was generally in line, but it was probably a little more back-end loaded than we've seen, and we had a lot of big enterprise activity towards the end of the quarter. So, Kelly, anything to add? Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: The only thing I will add, and Chuck kind of touched on this, again, it is the biggest, biggest premier enterprise accounts, they are still investing significantly and they had very good order rates. But it does \u2013 as you go down the tiers in enterprise, it did slow down, and commercial is not surprising. You saw what the commercial numbers are. So I do think it is related to they're waiting to see what comes out of the pandemic and they're pausing their spends. But I think this is why seeing the big, big accounts still investing in their digital transformation I think gives us confidence that once we do get through this, we feel good about how we'll come out of it. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Okay, next question? Rod Hall - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Can I have a follow-up? Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Sure. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Go ahead. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Go ahead, Rod. Rod Hall - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I just wondered if you guys could talk a little bit about what sort of color you're hearing from these enterprise customers. Do you think that they've \u2013 because they're investing so aggressively in work-from-home, are they pulling demand forward out of the back end of the year? Are their budgets changing, or are they just kind of robbing from the back end of the year budgets and moving it toward the front end of the year to compensate for work-from-home and all this stuff that's going on? Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: I don't think that \u2013 I hadn't heard anything about anybody pulling anything forward. I think that the larger the companies are, the more confident they have in their ability to come out at some point, and they're going to continue to invest to position themselves when they come out. And clearly, there are some large enterprises that are not investing, depending on which industries they're in. But I think it's just normal investment cycles that certain large companies have just decided they're going to continue to pursue. And I do think Kelly made a good point. As we've given like the number of software license agreements that we did, it says that the portfolio that we have and the strategy we have, I think, whether it's helping them with application visibility as they move more to the cloud, it's going to resonate even more. When you think about the security strategy we have going to the cloud, it's going to be more required in the future. We look at this infrastructure transformation as they deal with this multi-cloud world and these new traffic flows, I think that's going to be super-relevant. And then obviously, the employee and customer experience that they have, which are all areas that we're investing in, I think when we come out of this, those will be even more in demand than they were when we went into it. We've just got to get to the other side of it, and then I feel pretty good. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Okay. Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may go ahead. Simon Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great, thanks for taking the question, Kelly, we will miss you, and you're too young to retire. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Simon. Simon Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I wanted to follow up, Chuck, on the Cat 9K, because you did mention the strength there. And I guess I'm trying to discern sort of the macro versus the product cycle issues, and my understanding is that the portfolio has been releasing platforms that are more suited for small enterprises just at the time when those are the weakest customers. So if you could, help us maybe understand the overall contributions of this product and where you are in the product cycle, and maybe even explain what's macro-related versus normal cycle-related. Thank you very much. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Simon, I'll let Kelly talk about the numbers in a minute, but I'm going to share with you my instinct on this because I've thought about the same thing. Because the one thing that we know is that the campus business that we have, people aren't in their campus offices, so the whole notion of refresh and upgrades clearly are not top of mind for every customer the way they might have been nine months ago. However, what I think is that the 9K is for those customers who are either in the process of a real commitment to modernizing their infrastructure and they're continuing to do that, or they've made a decision and they have the financial wherewithal right now to actually embark on that, and the 9K is what they are using to do that in their campus environments. And some of them are using this opportunity with no one in their campus environments to upgrade. Clearly, that's not every customer, but I think what it says is those customers who are still on our older platforms, which we didn't see the growth on, it's sort of the story we talked about. They haven't committed to refresh, they haven't committed to that modernization piece, and so that part is not accelerating, but the 9K has continued to accelerate. So it's been a positive story for us. Kelly, do you want to... Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: I think you said it well, and I think, Simon, your point as well. So the products you referenced, the Cat 9200, which was launched for the lower end, the mid to lower end, is in that commercial segment, to your point. But when I look at it individually, that product is still \u2013 revenue is growing like amazing double digits, and so that just shows that we're still very early in the transition. When the customers are buying, they are buying the new portfolio hand over fist, and it's just the COVID impact of the overall and again the legacy products falling off is really what's driving it. But that's why we have faith and feel good about the portfolio when we come out of the environment. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Simon, I think two just comments on top of that. Number one is we still are very early in this whole process. And the 9200, I think it's important to note. It is a small business product, but it's also an access layer product in the enterprise, as it goes into branches, it goes into, in some cases, wiring closets, et cetera. So we will still see some continued demand for that. Simon Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you very much. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Sue, let's go ahead and move to the next question. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from James Fish with Piper Sandler. You may go ahead. James E. Fish - Piper Sandler & Co.: Hey, thanks for the question, guys, and congrats on the retirement there, Kelly. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, James. James E. Fish - Piper Sandler & Co.: For me, I want to bridge a few of the questions that have been asked together. But Chuck, you talked about accelerating the transition towards SaaS. Can you guys give us an update as to where that SaaS revenue is, not the term license contribution, and where you guys think it could accelerate given the investments? And then utilizing Ittai's question from before, do you need to acquire to help accelerate it? Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Well, I'll let Kelly answer the numbers question. We gave you the total software number and we gave you the percent that's coming from subscriptions and SaaS, but I think you're asking specifically about SaaS. And look, I think that we've made a lot of progress. If you do the math on where the software in our portfolio was five years ago and what percentage of it was coming from subscription and SaaS, I don't know, we've certainly increased it significantly over the last four or five years without any major, major revenue-driving acquisitions. So, that would certainly help. And we continue \u2013 as I said earlier, continue to look at alternatives in that space. And you should assume that we will continue to look at them, but we'll also be disciplined. So, Kelly, you want to touch on the SaaS numbers or...? Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, we don't disclose the total SaaS number. Again, it's made up of our Webex business, a lot of our portfolio, Duo and Umbrella and security. And again, acquisition, Meraki is a hybrid where we ship an appliance, but then it has the SaaS management, and things like ThousandEyes that we're adding to our networking portfolio and AppDynamics, I mean, that's just going to continue to accelerate. So, I think you're going to see it twofold, right? You're going to continue to see us to be \u2013 those are the type of assets that we have been acquiring and will continue to acquire, and you're seeing internally this is also how we are developing product to try to accelerate that. But the growth in the SaaS portfolio has been really good for us. James E. Fish - Piper Sandler & Co.: Understood. Appreciate the color, and congrats again, Kelly. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, James. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Kvaal with Wolfe Research. You may go ahead. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Wolfe Research LLC : Thank you very much and my congratulations again, Kelly. We look forward to seeing you in a new role at some point down the road. I have a question and a clarification. I think the question, Chuck, last quarter you spent a little bit of time talking with us about traction on the webscale side of things. I'm wondering if that traction has seen some follow-through, if you could update us on that. And then, secondly, for Kelly, you suggest that the OpEx will come lower by $800 million. Is that a gross number or is that a net number; i.e., you'll take it out by $800 million, but bring some back in the some of the growthier areas in business? Thank you. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yeah. Jeff, thanks for asking the question. I would have been in trouble if I'd gotten off this call and not talked about webscale. So, we saw another positive quarter, so that's one of the areas that was really positive for us. It was the third quarter in a row where we've had double-digit growth with the webscale players. And again, as I said last quarter, we have had some traction with the 8K, some traction with our silicon, but nothing that's meaningfully moving the numbers yet. So, it really is just the rest of the portfolio. But as I said, I think it speaks to the long-term effort that we've put in over the last few years of rebuilding these relationships, and I think it speaks to their belief in our strategy going forward. And we feel good about where we are, and we believe over the next one to two years that they'll begin to be meaningful contributors, and we're excited about what the teams have done. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: And on the cost-out, so again, we are taking out gross over $1 billion, so that is gross. But like anything, Jeff, there's puts and takes as we go forward, so whether it's things like the dollars, weaker FX, it's going to be a bit of a headwind this year, we reset the bonus, all that kind of stuff, that will be puts and takes. But that's a real cost-out that we're taking out as we go through and do our planning. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Got it. Thank you both very much. Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Yeah. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Jeff. Sue, I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our last question is from George Notter with Jefferies. You may go ahead. George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC : Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I guess I wanted to kind of go back to the discussion of moving more of the business to a as-a-service model. And could you just put a little bit more meat on the bone in terms of what areas are you specifically thinking about as new candidates to kind of move that direction? And how do you incentivize customers in those areas also? I'm just trying to think about the mechanics of how this works. And then congrats to Kelly also. Thanks. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Literally, we're looking at everything. We're trying to \u2013 we're looking at everything from our compute portfolio to clearly our software assets are already in the midst of that transition, and many of them are already being sold that way. And we're even looking at how we deliver our traditional networking hardware as a service over time. So it is literally across the portfolio. And we see an acceleration of some of the work that's already been underway. Obviously, the collaboration portfolio has been transitioning to as-a-service for quite a while. We even launched last, I don't know, two, three quarters ago, we launched our hardware-as-a-service in the collaboration portfolio as a pilot. And we've been working hard on all the operational capabilities and the systems work that needs to be done to do that. So it literally is across the entire portfolio, and we'll give you an update on the next call for sure. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: All right, I believe that was our last question. Thanks, George. I'll turn it back to you, Chuck. Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.: All right, I just want to recap and just thank first of all Kelly for everything and the friendship and all the great work that you've done and reiterate that she's going to stay with us until we actually identify her successor, and she'll help advise us through that process. So we're excited about her sticking around and helping us do that. I want to thank the team for executing through a really challenging time. And I really want to reiterate that I think that the strategy that we had going in, I believe when we come out of the pandemic, will be more relevant to our customers than it was six, nine months ago. So I'm optimistic about the future, and we're going to continue to execute through this. And thank you all for joining us today. Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Chuck. Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal 2021 first quarter results, will be on Thursday, November 12, 2020 at 1 :30 PM Pacific Time, 4:30 PM Eastern Time.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, you may begin. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Michelle. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's first quarter of fiscal 2021 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. As is customary, in Q1, we have made certain reclassifications to prior-period amounts to conform to the current period's presentation. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties, including COVID-19 that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Form 10-K, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck. Chuck Robbins : Thanks Marilyn. First, I want to start off by saying I hope everyone is safe and healthy. I also want to thank our employees for their dedication to our customers and their relentless focus on innovation. Cisco is off to a solid start in fiscal 2021. And I am proud of these results. Our teams are executing with excellence, and we continue to make steady progress on our shift to a software and subscription-driven model. We are encouraged by the signs of improvement in our business as we continue to navigate the pandemic and other macro uncertainties. Our focus is on winning with a differentiated innovation portfolio, long-term growth and being a trusted technology partner for our customers. Over the last few quarters, we've successfully adjusted to new demands by making necessary changes and shifts within our business. We remain closely aligned with our customers to provide them with the mission critical technology they need to stay resilient and move towards adopting new hybrid work models. In fact, we see many great opportunities ahead as every company in every industry is accelerating its digital first strategy. Our customers are rethinking how they support and serve their customers and their employees. They need speed, agility and simplicity. Many customers have shared with me that they are compressing years of work into just a few months. This is why we are driving new innovation that helps our customers connect, secure and automate their environments at a faster pace than ever before. With the right technology and tools, we can be even more effective and productive, and that's what we intend to deliver for our customers. Going forward, we are focused on building innovation that helps our customers and Cisco thrive in a hybrid cloud world. As we think about the next few years, there are six key areas we are focused on. First is delivering optimized application experiences for our customers. The application is the lifeline for all organizations and is increasingly how end users access their products and consume their services. Second is continuing to deliver the secure networking capabilities that Cisco is trusted for as a service, offering even greater simplicity and automation. The third area is focused on helping communications providers succeed with significant architectural transitions like 400 gig and 5G. These will be done with a combination of our software assets, silicon and optics capabilities, as well as complete integrated systems. We will deliver these technologies on-prem as well as from the cloud. Fourth is accelerating the future of work. As many enterprises look to adopt new hybrid work models with more remotely distributed workers than before, we are focused on helping them deliver consistent experiences, whether working remotely or in the office, from connectivity to collaboration, to security. Fifth is supporting our customers with their mission of securing everything they do. We will continue to deliver the end-to-end intelligent security architecture designed to keep their data private and their people secure. And the final area is around developing edge technologies that allow application developers to run distributed applications while securely accessing and managing distributed data. We believe that these key areas will drive our growth and success over the coming years. Now, let me share more on our Q1 results. As I mentioned earlier, we saw encouraging signs of improvement in certain areas of our business. Some large customers who are already in the midst of modernizing their infrastructure continue to do so, as we've seen with the ongoing success of the Catalyst 9000. Webex, our security solutions and business resiliency offers, also saw strong growth as our customers are trusting us with their most critical projects. We are succeeding in transforming our business model with 78% of our software revenue now sold as a subscription, and we saw double-digit growth in our deferred product revenue. As I mentioned on the last call, you will see us deliver more of our technology as a service to provide more choice and flexibility across our entire portfolio. Our new technology pipeline remains strong as we continue to accelerate our pace of innovation. At our recent Partner Summit, we introduced a number of new technology solutions that help our customers adapt, accelerate and simplify their operations through new agile automation platforms. Relative to our infrastructure platforms, our Cat 9K family of switches and Meraki cloud-based platforms continue to perform well, as our customers build highly-secure, resilient and scalable networks as the foundation for their digital strategies. Our customers are also increasingly running applications across multiple cloud environments, and this requires next-generation architectures with automation, security and insights. We recently announced new cloud and SD-WAN platform innovations to help our customers connect, secure and automate across their hybrid environments with greater visibility into their applications. We are making great strides with our web-scale customers with our fourth consecutive quarter of strong double-digit growth. This reflects their belief in our strategy going forward and their ongoing commitment to invest with us to build out their future architectures. We also continue to help our customers operate in a multi-cloud environment and optimize our overall cloud experience. In Q1, we extended these capabilities through Cisco's Cloud onRamp solutions, which deeply integrate cloud services from AWS, Google and Microsoft to better enable end-to-end visibility and manageability of their distributed applications. In security, we delivered another solid quarter of growth, driven by our broad cloud-native portfolio. SecureX, which offers a simplified security experience, saw strong adoption as it has been deployed across more than 4,000 organizations since it became globally available in June. As our customers' employees remain working from home, they are looking to bolster their existing security efforts with unified user and endpoint protection. We continue to benefit from the shift to cloud-based security capabilities and had robust growth in our secure remote worker offer that includes Duo, Umbrella and AnyConnect. Our customers are also looking for highly secure, high-speed, low-latency connectivity to the Internet. This is leading to the convergence of networking and security services in the cloud to securely connect any user or device to any application to provide the best experience. Our world-class security team recently delivered new innovations, including extended detection and response, Zero Trust and secure access services edge. By combining our leading solutions, SD-WAN and Umbrella with our new secure Internet gateway capabilities, our customers can deploy solutions to enable their users to simply and securely access cloud workloads and SaaS applications. Moving to our collaboration portfolio, business continuity and resiliency remain top of mind for our customers. Organizations are focused on creating flexible work environments to drive productivity, while ensuring that employees remain safe. The future of work will be a hybrid model with employees both in the office and at home, and we are leading in this area. Our collaboration portfolio is empowering organizations and teams to be more productive and secure as they adapt to new business, healthcare and learning models. We are providing seamless collaboration with anyone anywhere, while enabling consistent experiences for hybrid workplaces and continuing our leadership in security. Cisco Webex saw significant increased usage and solid adoption as customers look to us for a flexible work solution that also enables privacy and security. Whether at home or in the office, our customers need a solution that brings together meetings, calling, file sharing and messaging with a simple and highly secure user experience. Last month alone, Webex had nearly 600 million participants, almost double the number we had in March. We recently launched new return to office solutions that provide actionable workplace analytics with Webex Room Navigator and integrated collaboration device sensors that help ensure a safe working environment. We are also accelerating our innovation with new offerings such as Webex Legislate to keep critical functions of global governments running, along with capabilities like breakout rooms, virtual huddle spaces and noise cancellation. We are reimagining every aspect of the collaboration experience with built-in AI technology, security and integrated workflow applications to create a more intelligent work environment and to improve productivity. Lastly AppDynamics. Our customers are moving to highly distributed cloud-native applications, which require greater observability and insights. By combining AppDynamics and ThousandEyes, our cloud-based networking monitoring platform, we are delivering full stack observability to help our customers better manage their applications and improve their digital experiences through end-to-end visibility, deep insights and automated action. Now, I want to share more on our CFO transition. On our last call, I shared that our CFO, Kelly Kramer, had decided to retire from Cisco. Today, I'm excited that Scott Herren will be joining Cisco as our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer beginning December 18. Most recently, Scott served as the CFO for Autodesk. He brings an incredible background in software and helped lead Autodesk's successful business model transformation from perpetual licenses to SaaS and subscription software. As we continue our strong progress on our business model shift and sell more of our solutions as a service, Scott's depth of expertise in this area will help us accelerate our transition. He also has strong experience operating in complex global business environments at scale and a track record of profitable business growth, focused team building and prudent financial controls. I have no doubt that he will contribute to and foster the culture we are also proud of here at Cisco. I want to thank Kelly once again for being such a great partner and for the role she has played in our transition. We will certainly miss her, but we're very excited to have Scott this role and as part of our team. In summary, we are encouraged by the start to the year. I'm proud of our progress, both in our own transformation and in how we are empowering customers to accelerate their own digital strategies. We have a clear vision and strategy, and I feel very good about our portfolio and the innovation we are driving. Our customers want partners they can trust, as well as choice and flexibility in how they purchase, consume and implement technology based on their own individual needs. These anchors of trust, innovation and choice are core to who we are at Cisco. As we focus on growing our business, we remain guided by our purpose to power an inclusive future for all. We know that pervasive access to technology and connectivity directly impacts economic growth and enables key core human needs like healthcare and education. We know that technology can help solve some of the world's biggest challenges, and we are more committed than ever to building an inclusive future in which everyone can thrive. I'll now turn it over to Kelly. Kelly Kramer : Thanks Chuck. I also want to congratulate Scott on his new role. I've had the chance to spend some time with him, and I am super excited. I think this is a very positive news for Cisco and he will be a great addition to the team. Also thanks to you, Chuck. It's been a great time working with you over the years. Now, let me provide a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by guidance for Q2. Our overall Q1 results reflect good execution with strong margins in a challenging environment. Total revenue was $11.9 billion, down 9% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 32.7%, down 0.9 points. Non-GAAP net income was $3.2 billion, down 11%, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.76, down 10%. Let me provide more detail on our Q1 revenue. Total product revenue was down 13% to $8.6 billion. Infrastructure Platforms was down 16%. As a reminder, this is a product area most impacted by the COVID environment. We saw declines across switching, routing, data center and wireless, driven primarily by the weakness we saw in the enterprise and commercial markets. We continue to see growth of the Cat 9K and the ramp of our Wi-Fi 6 products. Data center revenue declined, driven by servers. Applications was down 8%. We did continue to see strong growth in Webex with the importance of remote working. This was offset by declines and Unified Communications and TelePresence endpoints. Security was up 6%. Our cloud security portfolio performed well, with strong double-digit growth and continued momentum with our Duo and Umbrella offerings. Service revenue was up 2%, driven by growth in our maintenance business as well as support services. We continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 78% of total software revenue up 7 points year on year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, at the end of Q1 were $27.5 billion, up 10%. RPO for product was up 15% and service was up 8%. The continued growth in RPO demonstrates the strength of our portfolio in software and services. In terms of orders in Q1, total product orders were down 5%. Looking at our geographies, the Americas was down 5%, EMEA was down 1% and APJC was down 14%. Total emerging markets were down 15% with the BRICS plus Mexico down 19%. In our customer segments, public sector was up 5%, enterprise was down 15%, commercial was down 8% and service provider was down 5%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q1 gross margin was 65.8%, down 0.1 points. Product gross margin was 65.3%, down 0.8 points and service gross margin was 67.1%, up 1.7 points year-over-year. In terms of the bottom line from a GAAP perspective, Q1 net income was $2.2 billion and EPS was $0.51. GAAP results include restructuring charges of $602 million related to the plan we announced in Q1. We ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $30 billion. Operating cash flow was $4.1 billion, up 14%. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $0.8 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend. Let me reiterate our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal '21. This guidance is subject to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue to be in the range of flat to minus 2% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64% to 65%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 32% to 33%. And the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 19%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.74 to $0.76. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Kelly. While the operator is queuing the line for Q&A, I'd like to remind the audience as I do every quarter that we ask you to address one question only so we have adequate time to take as many questions as possible. Michelle, I'll turn it over to you. Operator : Thank you. Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. You may go ahead. Ittai Kidron : Hey, guys. Good to see some stability in the business. I guess a couple of things for me. Chuck, when you look at the enterprise orders quite significantly down, should we gather from your tone that you think that reverses? Where is the bottom on order patterns? And as you look through the rest of the fiscal year, is this the sequential improvement that you're looking for? And then, Kelly, just clarification on RPO. Can you tell us if duration -- how duration is changing? It's hard to reconcile this if the duration is changing from quarter to quarter. Chuck Robbins : Hey, Ittai, thanks for the comments and the questions. So, on the enterprise side, I'm not too concerned about it, honestly. We had -- we did have some pretty significant compares from the year earlier, which contributed to that. But the thing that I would call out is, we saw a pretty significant improvement in our commercial orders. I think that we were minus 23 last quarter in the midst of the whole SMB meltdown that we knew was going on, and it was minus 8 this quarter. And I'll tell you, in the US, it was even a greater improvement from that. So, that gives us a fair amount of optimism. I think they enterprise thing is going to be fine. There is -- again, we just -- we had some compare issues that I think just resulted in the math, but I don't see anything that concerns me there. Kelly Kramer : And on RPO, Ittai, the duration hasn't changed much since we started reporting this over a year ago. About half -- slightly more than half of the total balance will get recognized in the next 12 months and the rest is longer term. Ittai Kidron : Very good. And it's been a pleasure, Kelly. Good luck going forward. Kelly Kramer : Thank you, Ittai, appreciate it. Marilyn Mora : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Paul Silverstein from Cowen & Co. You may go ahead, sir. Paul Silverstein : First of all, Kelly, I just wanted to thank you for your help over the years and wish you all good things going forward. In terms of questions, first off, Kelly, can you update us on what you're seeing in pricing environment? And the bigger question is, Chuck, the statements you just made in terms of improvement in commercial as well as enterprise, you've been talking for a while obviously about the benefit from remote work as well as the offset, the challenge presented by -- assuming we go back to the 21st century, there's going to be organizations that leave a certain percentage of the workforce at home and with fewer or smaller offices, headquarters, branch and remote workers in those offices, one would think that would be a challenge for switching and enterprise routing and wireless LAN access points. Any insight you can offer on that particular dynamic from a longer-term perspective? Chuck Robbins : Yeah, let me take that first, and then, Kelly, can get to the pricing question. So, Paul, I think if you look at commercial, a lot of that recovery was actually driven by collaboration and security on a global basis. And so, we feel good about that. I think that we also talked about the Cat 9K continued to show strength with double-digit demand growth, and it -- and so, what we think is going to happen is when customers go back, they are going to ensure that they have robust infrastructure. They're going to need to deal with social distancing issues. We think that in our [cloud] [ph] portfolio, you're going to see customers put high definition video in every conference room. We have technology that we've built in that I've actually seen working this week, where we have sensors in the units that -- not only will you have high definition video, but we have sensors in the units that actually monitor how many people are in a room and you get warnings if you're exceeding whatever capacity the company has defined for that room. And so, we think that the safety aspect of it will be helpful, too. So I think it's still TBD on what really happens in this space because I think 90 days to 120 days ago, there was this belief that we were going to shut down every headquarters building in the world. And now, I think people know that it's going to be a balance going back. So we've got the Cat 9K and Wi-Fi 6, which is the future modern platforms that the Company has been moving to that continue to show strength. And so, while we have to wait and see, we're optimistic about it. Paul Silverstein : And Kelly, prices? Kelly Kramer : Yeah, sure. On pricing -- and thanks for the kind words there, Paul. I appreciate it. On pricing, I'd say, our Q1 pricing is in our normal range from a product gross margin walk perspective. The rate impacts, the number that we usually talk about, it was down 1.8 points, which as you know, is in our normal kind of operating range. And just as a reminder, we've annualized all of the price increases we did a year ago for the list for tariffs. So now, this is kind of where we're stated. But I'm happy to see where we are this quarter on pricing. And even sequentially from Q4, it's better. So we're stable. Paul Silverstein : Thanks again. Kelly Kramer : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Paul. Michelle, next question. Operator : Thank you. Rod Hall, you may go ahead -- from Goldman Sachs. Rod Hall : Thanks for the question. I wanted to start off with the mismatch, I guess, in the order rate and the guide. Even at the top end of the guide, revenue is flat, but orders are down 5%. So I'm wondering if you guys could just kind of connect those two dots for us, help us understand why that is. And then, I know, Chuck, you said you're not that concerned by the enterprise orders. They did deteriorate quite a bit. Could you go into a little bit more detail on that? What is that -- even though those have deteriorated, you think it's just a short-term effect or kind of what's going on within that enterprise segment would be great? Thanks a lot. Kelly Kramer : Yeah, the orders versus revenue, it's really just timing of when things are and whatnot. That's no different than I normally go through. We know what's coming off the balance sheet with all the software. We know what's in our backlog. So it's really just the year-over-year compares. So, I feel good about the guide and you're seeing that in there. Chuck Robbins : Yeah. On the enterprise front, I think the real thing that I would point out is, there are just a couple of significant transactions. And we see -- in our pipeline, we see a robust pipeline right now. We see large transactions showing up again in the funnel, which is positive. And so, if you look at across the core infrastructure, enterprises are going to upgrade their core infrastructure. They're going to build out a robust on-prem collaborate -- I mean, on-prem meaning hardware video units when they go back into the offices because everyone -- every meeting is going to have remote attendees and you're going to have to have it in virtually every conference room. So that's positive. Everybody is moving to this WAN re-architecture with SD-WAN and cloud security. So I think it's -- the short answer is, Rod, it's largely a couple of big deals a year ago and we see the funnel strengthening. So it's -- that's what gives me the optimism looking forward. Rod Hall : Okay. Thanks guys. Good working with you, Kelly. Kelly Kramer : Thanks, Rod. Marilyn Mora : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley Investment Research. You may go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great, thanks. Chuck. I just wanted to ask maybe how linearity was during the quarter? You were pretty downtrodden on the initial earnings call, heading into fiscal Q1. Just when did you start to see that uptick? And then, maybe just are customers needing to be back in the office in order to start thinking about orders or if they just accommodated and are starting to make orders whilst still remote? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Yeah. So I would say that when we did the last earnings call, we had seen actually good demand in the first couple of weeks of the quarter, but clearly it was a couple of weeks. And so, we -- it was not anything that would give us a trend. But it started -- the quarter started and it stayed -- it was very linear. It was not -- we saw decent performance from the beginning, and it stayed pretty consistent throughout. So, that was a good sign for us. And the -- I'm sorry, what was the second question? Meta Marshall : In terms of whether people were needing to physically be in the office in order to start thinking about orders. Chuck Robbins : What I think has happened is, I think customers have come to grips with the fact that this thing is going to be with us for some period of time. Obviously, we're optimistic, like everybody else, some of the vaccines and some of the therapeutics and all will ultimately help. We're balancing that obviously with the current peaks that we're seeing all around the world. But I think customers just basically said, we're not sure when it's going to get better, but it's going to get better. And I can't sit around and do nothing. What I kind of was hopeful was going to happen, which I think we did see, is that we had customers who were super-focused on getting their employees working from home productively and getting their security set up. I think everyone raced to do that. And then, I think they took a pause, which is what we felt in our last quarter in orders. And then, I think they re-prioritized what they were going to be spending money on, and I think we started seeing some of that come back. And it's sort of exactly what I expected, but we needed to see it and we'll see if it continues. But we're all dealing with the same macro environment, everybody is, relative to this virus, but that's sort of how it played out. Any comments, Kelly, on the linearity? Kelly Kramer : Yeah, very good linearity. Meta Marshall : Great, thanks. And nice working with you, Kelly. Kelly Kramer : Thanks. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Chuck. Thanks Kelly. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Tim Long from Barclays. You may go ahead. Tim Long : Thank you. I'll offer good luck to you, Kelly, as well. Just wanted to ask on the cloud vertical. Chuck, you mentioned kind of fourth quarter [indiscernible] strong. Can you just talk a little bit about what products you're seeing strength there and what kind of breadth across that customer base you're seeing that strength? And then just a quick follow-up, if you could, on the public sector being up. Anything specific or more sustainable to that vertical being one of the better performers? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Thanks Tim. Yeah, in the cloud vertical, the web scale space, I think what I've said historically is that we've been rebuilding these relationships and we began to see them buying our broader portfolio as a result of them believing in both the fact that we're going to be there with them and that we were investing in technology that was being built the way that they want to consume it and aligned to the architectures that they want to build. What I will tell you now is that last December, we had a launch where we talked about disaggregating our software, our hardware and that we would sell our silicon, our optics, we would sell our software stand-alone. We would sell integrated systems, whatever our customers wanted. And I can tell you that we had now won in the web scale space across every one of those facets. And so, we've seen really good progress. And I would say now, some of the new technologies that we built and had been testing and positioning are starting to show up very well in the accounts. So we're very pleased with that. On the -- and the pipeline looks very strong. So on the -- in fact, one of the comment on that, in the US, we saw service provider flat and that -- and a lot of that was strength in the MSDC web scale space. And in Europe, we saw high-teens growth and we saw really good MSDC web scale strength there as well. On the public sector, that was reasonably consistent around the world, and a lot of it was -- there was a lot of stimulus that was put in the system by lots of governments around the world. Our federal -- federal spending in the US was strong. We saw K through 12 building out a lot of infrastructure for -- while students were not there. And E-rate was strong for sure, and we think that will stay strong. And then, we saw some spending from the CARES Act in the local and municipal governments. But -- and the teams, we spent some time with the leader, particularly in US, this week. And I think he remains fairly bullish. Tim Long : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Jim Suva from Citigroup Investment Research. You may go ahead, sir. Jim Suva : Thank you. And Kelly, you will truly be missed. Please keep in touch. For either Chuck or Kelly, can you help us reconcile or bridge the gap between -- public sector orders were up 5%. Enterprise was down 15%. Why would one be so much stronger than the other? So I look back on the year-over-year comps, and last year, enterprise orders were down 7% and public sector was flattish. So we actually have comps that don't explain it either. So can you just explain, are there different purchasing decisions because everyone has been affected in the world by COVID. So if you can just help us kind of reconcile that a little bit, that'd be great. Chuck Robbins : Well, I think a lot of it's what I just described, right? Public sector around the world saw a lot of stimulus. And in the US in particular, we saw strength and we saw everything from Department of Defense spending to the local municipal spending. States were slightly weak, but the federal government was good. Local was good. E-rate kicked in. The new E-rate program kicked in, Jim, which contributes a lot when that gets going. And that's sort of early in its next wave. And so -- and then, we just had -- there was strength in public sector in Germany. And so, I think it was just more consistency basically. And outside the US, obviously, some healthcare. Inside the US too, there's a lot of healthcare in there in public sector, particularly outside the US. Jim Suva : Thank you so much for the details and clarifications, Chuck, and bye-bye, Kelly. Thank you. Kelly Kramer : Thanks, Jim. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Jim. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Jim. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Tal Liani from Bank of America. You may go ahead, sir. Analyst Tal Liani : Hi guys. I'm trying to reconcile your comments to your numbers. Last quarter, you sounded pretty downbeat, highlighting some issues. This quarter, you sound a lot better. But on the -- and you talk about growth initiatives. On the other hand, I look at your numbers, infrastructure platforms are down 16% year-over-year, 15.9%, let's say 16%. And it's worse than all of your competitors. If I just look at switching and routing and Juniper and Arista, on a global basis, without getting into details of the composition, you're down more than they are. And the question is, why is it down so much versus competition? Do you feel that there is also share issues, market share shift issues? Can you give us some context about areas where you feel that you're growing share, maintaining share and areas where you see some challenges? Chuck Robbins : Yeah, I'll give you my quick perspective, Tal, and then Kelly can add to it. If you look at what really drove that, it was compute, and a lot of it is sort of the pricing that came through compute, which neither of those competitors you mentioned have. Also just the exposure to data center campuses this past quarter we talked about, the broader exposure we have I think would be the two things that I would call out. Kelly, you have anything to add? Kelly Kramer : The only other thing I would call it is some of those companies that you mentioned have different compares than we do from a year ago as well. But Chuck hit it right. Again, data center or the compute business has a big impact due to the DRAM pricing [indiscernible] pricing down, and that hurts, and then again the campus stuff. Tal Liani : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Tal. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Amit Daryanani from Evercore. You make good, sir. Amit Daryanani : Yeah. Thanks for taking my question, guys. I guess, my question is really on the top line guide. And Chuck, as I think about the Jan. quarter expectation of sales being flat year-over-year versus I think what you've seen in the last few quarters of down 10%, 11%, I think skeptics would say, well, your compares are easy, which mathematically they are, but it would be helpful to understand what do you think are the top two, three vectors that's driving this improved revenue trajectory in Jan. and to the extent you can touch on the durability of these metrics as we go forward, that would be helpful. Chuck Robbins : Do you want it, Kelly? Kelly Kramer : Yeah, I'll start and you can add. I'd just say this, again, back to the earlier point, we have been consistently shifting the revenue mix. So, as you see every quarter and you can see it in our RPO, we are getting more and more of our revenue coming off the balance sheet with the software mix. We have continued to make progress, as you can see, on the services side. For services, it's still growing for us. And software and services together have become a much bigger part of our portfolio. So, that benefits us on the revenue guide. In terms of strength that we see, yes, this Q1 revenue, though it'd still a tough Q1, we feel better about what we see in the orders profile. And again, the growth drivers are the same growth that Chuck talked about. We see real momentum and collaboration on the Webex side. We see real momentum in security. And we're just -- I mean, that's kind of what is driving. I don't know, Chuck would add anything else. Chuck Robbins : And I think also the web scale and the service provider, 5G build-outs, we feel like those are going to continue. But the short-term guide is a combination of what's coming off -- out of the RPO, what's in backlog and then we obviously assess the forecasts that the teams put forward and then we put the Kelly and Chuck factor on it. So it is -- and it is math to some extent, but I think that some of the things that we talked about earlier, the things that have given us -- it's hard to say super-optimistic because the numbers still aren't where we want them to be. But relative to where we were 90 days ago and how we felt or the uncertainty that we felt, we certainly feel like we have a little more visibility now. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Thanks on a nice quarter, guys. And best of luck. Kelly. Kelly Kramer : Thank you very much. Marilyn Mora : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. You may go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Chuck, in your prepared remarks, you outlined kind of six focus areas as you align the business to where you're seeing customer demand come back. If you can share how you're thinking about it relative to kind of investing organically versus where you might kind of need M&A to fill in those priorities? And just, I didn't hear in your prepared remarks anything in relation to plans about like having hardware as a service, as some of your peers are trying. So like what are your updated thoughts? What are you seeing in terms of customer demand for those kind of models? Chuck Robbins : That's a great question. So I think on the organic versus inorganic, I should probably clarify that our strategy there hasn't changed. And I think my comments were either misstated or misconstrued last time and some folks thought that we were thinking about some significantly larger acquisition strategy. Our acquisition strategy hasn't changed, just to be clear. But we'll use a combination. I would say that right now, there -- we are probably at the peak of internal innovation that we've -- that I've seen for a long time. If you look at the platform play, the work that our service provider, Mass-Scale Infrastructure Group, is doing and some of the wins we're seeing there, the 5G backhaul and packet core wins that we're seeing and the, at least, architectural progress we're making whenever our service provider customers start building out their 5G core standalone infrastructure, we feel good about where we are. So it'll be a combination of both and -- but again, it hasn't changed. As you think about it as a service, I do want to delineate between this because there is this offer in the marketplace today from some of our competitors around consumption-based as a service, and that's largely around compute. And so, you'll see us with a similar offer, but more of what I'm talking about is looking at what aspects of our intellectual property, can we pull, can we integrate together and can we deliver as a cloud service? So I'm not necessarily talking about selling Ethernet switch ports one port at a time. We're really talking about delivering our core intellectual property. Example, take SD-WAN, cloud security, secure Internet Gateway and deliver that capability for our customers as a service in the future, which is high value, very differentiated, those are kinds of things we're thinking -- that we're working through right now. And you'll see those kind of offers come out from us over the next 3, 6, 9, 12 months. Samik Chatterjee : Okay, got it. Very helpful. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Chuck. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. You may go ahead. Marilyn Mora : Aaron, we can't hear you. Aaron Rakers : Sorry about that. I was on mute. Congrats on the quarter, and also good luck, Kelly. I guess my question is building on the last question. As we think about the CFO announcements and we think about subscription now being 78% of the software revenue, how do we think about the progression of deepening subscription across the product portfolio? And how do we think about the renewal cycle of those subscriptions as we move forward? Thank you. A - Chuck Robbins It's a good question. So I think you're going to see us continue to add more software assets, both organically and inorganically as -- and most all of those solutions are sold as a service. So I think you'll see increases from that perspective. I think that you'll see -- on the renewal front, we have a focused effort right now. I think if you look at our core portfolio where we drove mandatory subscriptions, the first meaningful renewal cycle comes about a year from now or middle of next year, and our teams are working on that right now as we speak. We currently have renewal motions in place across collab and across security, etc. So I think what I would say is that we'll be looking at more and more of our technology being delivered from the cloud and as a service. So you'll see that contribute to it as well. And we're just going to continue to move forward, and I would say, you're going to continue to see software and services tick up as a percentage of our overall business going forward. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Aaron. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Simon Leopold from Raymond James & Associates. You may go ahead, sir. Simon Leopold : Thank you much for taking the question. Kelly, also send my congratulations on wherever you go next, and thanks for the help. In terms of question, I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about the maturity of the campus refresh in terms of the opportunity in front of you for the Cat 9K, as well as whether you're seeing a benefit from renewals on DNA subscriptions. I assume you're sort of coming up on that first round of three-year subscriptions coming due. If you could elaborate on those two? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Yeah. Thanks Simon. I would say on the campus refresh, when you look at Wi-Fi 6, you look at the Cat 9K stuff, we're still early on, honestly. And there is -- we have a large installed base out there. And so, that's a multi-year transition that we expect will go on for some period of time going forward. On the DNA renewal stuff, that's what I was telling Meta [ph] earlier that really it is -- the first real wave of it hits sometime in '21 because if you remember, we launched that in -- I think we announced that in the summer of 2017. Kelly, is that right? And so that was a beginning of fiscal '18. Kelly Kramer : Yes. Chuck Robbins : And so, when we get to the end of fiscal '21 -- and you had a lot of early adopters, and we didn't hit scale till sort of the middle of next year. So, you're really talking about getting into FY '22 when we'll start to see that come about. Simon Leopold : Great, that's helpful. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you, James Fish from Piper Sandler. You may go ahead, sir. James Fish : Thanks for the question, and congrats again on the retirement, Kelly. We're starting to see signs of 5G core spending and, Chuck, you alluded to it on the call and also more about the desire for OpenRAN. Hoping Cisco enable more the OpenRAN infrastructure, what are you guys hearing about timing for 5G core spending in terms of materiality, now that the first mid-band spectrum auction is through and the second is coming up? And how are you feeling about the products set across infrastructure competitively for 5G? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Well, Jim, I would say the active ORAN projects around the world, we are deeply in the middle of and have actually seen a lot of benefit from one in Japan and there is a couple of others going on in other places. And we're in the midst -- we're in the middle of the packet core side of it. We're in the middle of backhaul. We're in the middle of infrastructure to support it. We're in the middle of orchestration layers. And so our teams continue to work on building out our overall stack for how we're playing that OpenRAN space over time. As it relates to the 5G stuff, you're right, where we are seeing benefit today is we're winning a lot of backhaul opportunities. We're winning a lot of packet core. I think we had seven more wins between those two in the last quarter. And I would say, the core standalone build-outs are going to largely be dependent upon the enterprise service delivery that we've talked about historically, and I still think that's probably -- I think we're starting to see some early stuff going on around the world. But I think in earnest, I would say that's going to be -- notwithstanding pandemic and everything else, it's probably going to be starting middle of next year, and it will take several years. But again, there's a lot of variables that can move that either way. James Fish : Understood. Thanks Chuck. Marilyn Mora : Okay. We have time for one more question. Michelle, can you [indiscernible] the last question? Operator : Thank you. Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead. Sami Badri : Thank you very much for fitting me in. I just wanted to touch up a little bit on the public sector order strength. Is this something that can consistently be growing from a product orders and strength perspective in at least the upcoming quarter? Or was it just strong this quarter because the government's fiscal year closed in the September quarter, and therefore, there was a big uptick offsetting some of the dynamics? And then just as a kind of a follow-up here, is there -- have you guys been able to go through the commercial and the federal segments and determine whether CARES funding or stimulus funding was able to fund some of the reversals and dynamics that you guys saw in the quarter, and then that essentially lead to a better guide than what consensus was modeling? If your could fit those two questions in, that will be great thanks. Chuck Robbins : Thanks Sami. I'd say on public sector, we feel pretty good about it actually. And when we talk to our leaders around the world, that is one area that is pretty consistent that most of them feel pretty good about and particularly in the US where it's a big piece of the business regardless of administration. It's -- there's different priorities, but they're all dependent upon tech, and so that's good. On the commercial and federal segments, I think what I would say is it -- I would say in commercial, I would assume that there was some aspect of that. But I think looking at the collaboration and security spending. I think just a lot of those mid-size enterprises were really just putting themselves in a position to continue operating in this new world we're living in right now as much as anything. I'm not sure it's significant. I'll let Kelly comments if she thinks, but we did have a comment that I made earlier that our federal team did say that the stimulus was positive, E-rate was positive. And then we saw some local muni buying that was -- they felt like was -- and the customers were telling was connected to the CARES Act, and that's probably the extent of what I've heard on this. Kelly Kramer : And we heard -- we also heard that, from the European team, they've [ph] got a lot of benefit from the stimulus. And again, when I look at the orders within public sector globally, again, a ton [ph] of it is in getting this -- it's in securities and collaborations are working from home, doing school from home and like Chuck said, the K through 12 education globally is very favorable. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Sami. Chuck, I'll turn it over to you for last comments. Chuck Robbins : Yeah, I think, first thing I'll say is that I'm really proud of our team and how hard they're working and how committed they are to our customers and making sure that we're taking care of them during these complex times. And obviously, we're trying to take care of our employees during these complex times. But I really want to just focus on thanking Kelly. It's been an incredible partnership. We've had a lot of fun, and I think that there's a lot of love in the investor community for you. We're going to miss you. But we are excited about Scott. But Kelly, thanks for everything you've done. Kelly Kramer : I appreciate it, Chuck. It's been great working with you. And again, I do appreciate everybody in this industry and it's been a great relationship. But. Scott, I think it's great that Scott coming. He is going to be fantastic for the Company. But thanks for everything, Chuck. Chuck Robbins : And Kelly actually helped us make that choice. So you guys can feel good that she helped us with the candidates and was very very supportive on Scott's -- on the decision for Scott. So thank you all for joining us today and we'll look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Chuck. Thanks Kelly. So in closing, Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal 2021 second quarter results, will be on Tuesday, February 9, 2021 at 1 :30 PM Pacific Time, 4:30 PM Eastern Time.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Marilyn Mora : Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's second quarter fiscal 2021 quarterly earnings conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO; and I\u2019m very pleased to welcome Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties, including COVID-19, that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Marilyn. First of all, I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy. This year is full of promise as vaccines give us a path to healing and recovery. We are optimistic about the future and look forward to what lies ahead. This past quarter, our team delivered strong performance with revenues coming in at the top of our guidance range and non-GAAP EPS landing above the high end of our expectations all supported by margin expansion and a further strengthening of our balance sheet. More importantly, we are seeing encouraging signs of strength across our business as the recovery takes shape with all customer segments showing improvement in year-over-year growth rates. Our employees and partners have done a remarkable job executing and innovating throughout the pandemic to help our customers connect, secure and automate to accelerate their digital agility in a cloud-first world. We are partnering with them on core issues that are essential to their success : business resiliency, modernizing their IT environments and embracing secure hybrid work. Over the past year, our customers have relied on our innovation to accelerate their digital and cloud capabilities while protecting them from an expanding threat environment. In my numerous conversations with customers, it is clear that our technology will be a powerful engine for their recovery and growth as their technology needs continue to evolve at a rapid pace. Building on the strength of our broad portfolio, we are focused on six strategic pillars that will deliver highly secure next-generation architectures with unprecedented insights, automation and visibility. First, we are building networking solutions with built-in simplicity, security, agility and automation that can be consumed as a service. Second, we are optimizing our customers' application experiences, enabling greater speed, agility and scale of cloud-native applications and DevOps that deliver the best end user experience. Third, with the future of work being hybrid, we're delivering highly secure access, a safer workplace and the best collaboration experiences no matter whether workers are at home or in an office. Fourth, with our customers and partners, we are building the internet for the future by transforming connectivity and efficiently meeting the ever-growing demand for low latency and higher speeds. Fifth, with security and privacy a top priority, we are building integrated high efficacy end-to-end security solutions that are delivered on-prem or in the cloud. Lastly, as apps and workloads move closer to users and devices, we are developing new edge capabilities for a distributed world while enhancing the developer experience and extending enterprise and carrier networks. I am confident that this is the right strategy to deliver the innovation and integrated network solutions that our customers need no matter what the future holds. Now moving to our performance this quarter, we continue to see signs of gradual improvement led by order growth in our commercial, public sector and service provider businesses, which together account for nearly three quarters of product orders. The Enterprise market remains soft, driven by some elongated sales cycles and a continued pause in spending among some customers brought on by the pandemic. From a product revenue perspective, we saw strength in our Catalyst 9K, Data Center Switching, Security, Wireless and WebEx portfolios. The transformation of our business to more software and subscriptions continues to show great progress, as we achieved $3.6 billion in software revenue, with 76% of our software revenue sold as a subscription. We also saw our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in our deferred product revenue. We continue to accelerate our pace of innovation, delivering unique solutions and digital capabilities as we invest in flexible consumption models. I am confident in our ability to capture the long-term opportunities ahead in areas such as Cloud, 400 gig, 5G, Security, hybrid work and next-generation applications. Looking ahead, we are cautiously optimistic, as recent surveys of IT spending indicate year-over-year IT budget growth for calendar 2021. And Cisco remains well-positioned among CIOs' top forward-looking spending priorities, including network infrastructure, cybersecurity software, as well as cloud migration and cloud infrastructure. We are also mindful and vigilant about the uncertainty of the pandemic and its influence in the market, which is not fully behind us yet. Now, let me touch on Infrastructure Platforms. To manage the highly distributed and complex nature of modern IT environments, our customers must fundamentally change how their networks are architected. To help them achieve this, we are building a unified cloud-native platform suite to deliver secure, agile networking. A good example of this is our subscription-based, intent-based networking portfolio and is reflected in the momentum of our Catalyst 9K family, which saw another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. We are also delivering full stack observability from the application to the infrastructure to give our customers greater insights for faster, better decision-making. We are doing this through key elements of our portfolio like Intersight, ThousandEyes and AppDynamics, as well as our leading security innovations. As a global leader in transport network infrastructure, we are playing an important role in helping customers build their networks for the future. We continue to invest heavily to capture 5G, 400 gig and Wi-Fi 6 transitions to enable Open RAN and Edge services. This is reflected in our SD-WAN portfolio, routing, 5G mobile core platforms, optics and automation capabilities. In our web-scale business, we delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of very rapid order growth, increasing to triple digits. And on a trailing 12-month basis, our orders grew over 60% as we focus on delivering routing, data center switching and optical platforms built on Cisco Silicon One which had a \u2013 has a better efficiency over other silicon on the market. While we can see our performance vary quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of large deals, we are incredibly confident in our ability to further strengthen our position. By building a network on Silicon One, our customers can also save up to 30% of network switching power, resulting in a meaningful reduction in their environmental footprint as well as significant energy cost savings. Our agreement to acquire Acacia will enable us to deliver leading-edge optical technology to meet both the bandwidth requirements and the economics of next generation networks, which is critical to providing high-speed connectivity. This is just another reason why I'm still confident we will continue to win in the web-scale space. As I've mentioned, we plan to transition the majority of our portfolio to be cloud-driven, cloud-managed and delivered-as-a-service. If we can deliver it from the cloud, we will. For example, we are looking at offering SD-WAN plus cloud security as a service along with creating other new solutions. We will also provide simplified end-to-end networking with security, reliability control, and automation, plus seamless on-ramp capabilities to the cloud that no one else can deliver. Moving to Security, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue growth driven by increasing adoption of our next generation cloud-based architectures, which can enable fast and secured access to applications and data from anywhere. With the rapid growth in modern applications and more distributed work environments, our customers are adopting new security architectures as identity and data privacy are increasingly critical. The recent SolarWinds breach only highlights the urgent need for advanced threat defense. Our comprehensive security portfolio offers simplified protection for any workload on any cloud while minimizing the attack surface and automating security policies across an organization's hybrid cloud footprint. This extends to our secure access service edge framework and Zero Trust architecture, where we have developed a best-in-class cloud delivered stack across Umbrella, secure internet gateway, Meraki SD-WAN and Viptela. We're also delivering leading unified detection and response capabilities built on Cisco SecureX, our cloud native platform. Over 5,400 customers are already seeing the benefits of this platform since it became generally available last June. We remain committed to delivering simple, integrated and highly effective end-to-end security solutions delivered on-prem and in the cloud. Turning to Applications which includes our collaboration portfolio, we're focused on building solutions that will enable an engaged, productive workforce and an intelligent workplace, built with secured collaboration, automation, and insights. Our aim is to deliver the best collaboration experience for our customers, no matter where they are. Our strong momentum with WebEx continued, resulting in double-digit revenue growth. I'm still proud of the work that WebEx team has done to ensure our nearly 600 million quarterly average users are able to stay connected and productive. In addition, we are connecting over 6 billion calls every month for our customers around the world. We are bringing incredible innovation to the collaboration market at an unprecedented pace. Our goal is to deliver a 10X better experience than just in-person interactions. At our recent WebexOne event, we introduced more than 50 new product and feature innovations, integrating security and privacy to deliver inclusive experiences. Some of the new powerful capabilities we announced include noise cancellation, real-time language translation, and our Webex Desk Pro series platforms. Our recently announced intent to acquire cloud-based IMImobile and Slido furthers our vision of building a WebEx suite of applications as we combine these technologies with our Webex Contact Center to improve customer interactions. In summary, our strategy is clear and our business remains strong. We are executing and innovating with speed and delivered solid results with our Q2 revenue coming in at the high-end and earnings coming in above our stated guidance. As we move into the gradual recovery phase, we believe our customers will continue to turn to Cisco as their partner of choice. I am so proud of what our teams have achieved. The incredible innovation and trusted partnerships we're building will serve us well in the years ahead. While the past year has highlighted far too many inequities in our society, we believe in the power of technology to drive more inclusivity and opportunity to underserved populations and communities around the world, which is why we are committed to powering an inclusive future for all. With our ongoing disciplined approach to investment and innovation, we expect to be in an even stronger position post-pandemic as our customers look to deploy their next generation networks at the heart of their organizations. I firmly believe Cisco is well positioned to capture the long-term growth opportunities ahead and win for years to come. I'll now turn it over to Scott, our new CFO to walk through our financial results. As you know, Scott has strong experience in software and a proven track record of leading successful business model transitions from perpetual licenses to SaaS and recurring subscriptions. Scott has proven to be a powerful addition to our team, and I'll look forward to partnering with him as we plan the next phase of Cisco's continued transformation Scott, over to you. Scott Herren : Thanks, Chuck. Let me start by saying how excited I am to join the Cisco team at such a pivotal time in the company's transformation. Before turning to our performance in the quarter, I thought I'd share my initial observations and key priorities. I'm impressed by the team here at Cisco and the progress the company has made on its transformation. Achieving the goals laid out three years ago of driving 50% of our revenue from software and services. It's also clear that leadership team is unified and focused, and that the strategies Chuck laid out earlier in the call will drive our growth over the next several years. It's an exciting time to be joining the company in this role. In terms of my key priorities, they include the following; driving profitable growth, a continued disciplined focus on financial management and operating efficiency, setting a long-term plan to maximize value creation through strategic transformation and examining investments, both organic and inorganic. I'm also committed to providing you the insight and metrics needed to understand and properly value our business longer term. Now let's turn to our results. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for Q3. Our overall Q2 results reflect very good execution with strong margins and growth in non-GAAP net income and earnings per share in a continuing challenging environment. Total revenue of $12.0 billion came in at the top of our guidance range, flat year-over-year, as we see gradual recovery in several key product areas and sequential growth rate improvement in two out of three of our geographies. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 34.4%, up 70 basis points; non-GAAP net income was $3.4 billion up 2%, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.79 coming in above the high end of our guidance range and up 3% year-over-year. Now let me provide some more detail on our Q2 revenue. Total product revenue was $8.6 billion, down 1%, infrastructure platforms was down 3%. As a reminder, this is the product area most impacted by the COVID environment. Switching revenue was flat overall, we saw solid growth in data center switching with strong growth of the Nexus 9000, we also saw continued strong momentum of the Cat 9000 products within campus switching. Routing declined driven by weakness and service provider, wireless had solid growth driven by the continued ramp of our Wi-Fi 6 products and strengthened Meraki. Data center revenue declined driven primarily by servers, as we experienced continued market contraction. Applications was flat overall, we continue to see strong double-digit growth in Webex driven by our continuing product innovations and the criticality of remote working. This was offset by declines in Unified Communication and TP endpoints. Security was up 10% with growth across the portfolio. Our cloud security portfolio performed well with strong double-digit growth and continued momentum of our Duo and Umbrella offerings. Service revenue was up 2% driven by growth in our maintenance business, as well as solution support. And we continue to transform our business delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 76% of total software revenue, up 4 points year-over-year, as Chuck mentioned earlier. Remaining performance obligations or RPO at the end of Q2 were $28.2 billion, up 13%, RPO for product was up 17% and for service was up 10%. The continued growth in RPO demonstrates the strength of our portfolio of software and services and as another indicator of the broad recovery we see happening. In terms of orders in Q2, total product orders were up 1%, a significant improvement from Q1. Looking at our geographies, the Americas was down 1%, EMEA was up 7% and APJC was down 5%. Total emerging markets were down 14% with the BRICS plus Mexico down 11%. In our customer segments, public sector was up 10%, service provider was up 5% and commercial was up 1%, enterprise down 9%. Non-GAAP total gross margin was 66.9% up 50 basis points, product gross margins were 66.6% up 70 basis points and service gross margin was 67.9% up 20 basis points year-over-year. The growth in product gross margin was driven by positive product mix, including some software benefit and productivity improvements partially offset by pricing. In terms of the bottom line from a GAAP perspective, Q2 net income was $2.5 billion and earnings per share with $0.60. We ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $30.6 billion up $600 million sequentially. Operating cash flow was $3 billion down 22% as expected, driven by a lower beginning receivables balance for the quarter, timing of payments and the restructuring payments. We expect operating cash flow growth to normalize over the course of the fiscal year. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividends and $800 million of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we've returned $4.6 billion to shareholders, which represents 69% of our free cash flow. And today we announced the $0.01 increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.37 per share, up 3% year-over-year. This dividend increase reflects the 10th consecutive year of increasing our dividend and reinforces our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q2, we announced an amendment to the definitive merger agreement under which we previously agreed to acquire Acacia Communications. We expect to complete the Acacia acquisition in our fiscal Q3 subject to closing conditions, including Acacia stockholder approval. In addition, we announced our intent to acquire IMImobile, the cloud communications software and services company and Slido a provider of SaaS based solutions to enhance our Webex platform and our new cloud native contact center offerings. These investments are consistent with our strategy of complimenting our internal innovation and R&D with targeted M&A to allow us to further strengthen and differentiate our market position in our focus growth areas. To summarize, we executed well with strong margins and growth in non-GAAP net income and earnings per share growth. We're seeing returns on the investments, we're making an innovation and driving the continued shift to more software and subscriptions delivering long-term growth and shareholder value. Now, let me reiterate our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. This guidance is subject to the disclaimer regarding forward looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. Q3 does include an extra week, which occurs every five to six years. We've factored this extra week into our guidance for both revenue and expenses, although it's difficult to forecast the impact of the extra week, we have assumed roughly 2% to 3% year-over-year impact on total revenue growth, along with approximately $185 million of incremental cost of sales and operating expenses. The guidance for Q3 is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of 3.5% to 5.5% growth year-over-year, we anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 65% to 66%. The non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33% to 34%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 19%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.80 to $0.82. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn, so we can move into the Q&A. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Scott. Michelle, let's go ahead and queue up the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. Maybe to start off for me, I just wanted to get a sense of where you feel like organizations are in planning for a return to work and what the hybrid workplace looks like? And when do you think that investment will take place in that architecture versus kind of when employees return to the office? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Yes, Meta, thank you. I think that the \u2013 what we have been operating under is a premise that customers will probably begin to come back to the offices in \u2013 we had been thinking sort of mid to late summer. I think if you were watching the news this morning, you heard some of the New York companies say that they may be September. But I would suspect that as companies look to prepare their offices for the return, in our case, we\u2019ve seen significant uptake in Wi-Fi 6, as an example, as they have begun to get ready for that return. We believe that that will require switching infrastructure as people come back to the office and begin to put load on those wireless networks. We also believe that every meeting in the future is going to be a hybrid meeting, even when people are back in the office. You\u2019ll have people in the office, and you\u2019ll have people remote. And in order to accommodate that, we suspect most of our customers will be putting video units in every conference room they have, which again will also accommodate the hybrid work model but will also drive bandwidth requirements which could lead to switching infrastructure. So that\u2019s the way we see it playing out over the next few months. And we would expect that with some of the solutions we have around worker safety and the collaboration portfolio and the Wi-Fi 6 build outs that we\u2019ll continue to see some progress from our customers as they prepare to return. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. Marilyn Mora : Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. Jim Suva from Citigroup Investment Research. You may go ahead. Jim Suva : Thank you very much. Looking at your guidance, I think some investors are asking a little bit about, hey, the revenue guidance is up year-over-year quite impressively off a little bit of easy comps and also an extra week. But the EPS year-over-year, there\u2019s not much leverage there. There are additional costs I think with less travel. Why wouldn\u2019t there be more flow-through to the bottom line of earnings per share? Scott Herren : Yes, thanks, Jim, for the question. And I think there\u2019s a couple things you have to bear in mind. Not only does the extra week in Q3 bring along with it additional revenue, it brings along additional spend as well. And we touched on this in the opening commentary. It\u2019s about $185 million. Our expectation is about $185 million of additional spend. Coming through, when you compare year-on-year coming through from last year, we also have comp plans reset. So as you\u2019d expect, commissions and bonuses are on a different track this year than they were last year, and FX. The weakness of the dollar is having an effect on us as well. And so when you add those up, that\u2019s what drops through to the COGS and the OpEx line. We are on track, just to get ahead of maybe what your next question would have been. We\u2019re on track with the $1 billion of savings that we talked about through the restructuring. That continues to go well. Almost all of that is behind us at this point, but there are some year-on-year things there that are factoring into our spend rate for this year, for this coming quarter. Jim Suva : Thank you, Scott. And welcome. And thanks for the color and details. I\u2019m looking forward to working with you. Thanks, Scott. It\u2019s Jim. Chuck Robbins : And you, Jim. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Jim. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. You may go ahead, sir. Ittai Kidron : Thanks, and good luck, Scott, in your new role. I guess I have a couple of questions, first on the declined 9% in orders on Enterprise, Chuck, can you give us a little bit more color? It seems like a significant lag growth to the others. When do you expect that to normalize and improve? And then perhaps a second question, more of a bigger picture one for you, Chuck. It\u2019s been a clearly a very difficult year all around. Maybe you could give us a little bit more, the bigger picture perspective that you have here about the company. In what ways Cisco here and now different in the way it operates and thinks and moves going forward versus the Cisco of a year ago just before heading into the pandemic? I\u2019m trying to understand kind of the lessons learned and how they\u2019re implemented and impacting the company. And how should we think about you differently going forward? Chuck Robbins : Yes, Ittai, thank you. And, look, first of all I think that if you look at the customer segments, we saw improvement across Service Provider, Commercial and Public sector. And we saw improvement in Enterprise, although it\u2019s still negative year-over-year. But what I would tell you is, from a vertical industry perspective, we did see positive movement from industries that are not directly impacted by the pandemic. Think financial services. Think manufacturing. Think technical services. And then those that are still in the midst of the pandemic continue to struggle \u2013 hospitality, retail, transportation, energy. And so I think from that perspective, it gives us confidence that as we come out of this thing that those industries that are being depressed by the pandemic will obviously look to the future and will recover as well. So the other thing that we\u2019ve reflected on is that when we came out of the 2008 crisis, we saw Commercial lead, and then Enterprise followed. And it\u2019s just been a really good sign that the U.S. Commercial business this past quarter grew 6% from an orders perspective, which I think is a nice bounce. And obviously it was 1% globally. But seeing that go positive gives us also confidence in the future of the Enterprise following. As it relates to the bigger picture, I think we talked a lot about giving our customers consumption flexibility. Earlier in my comments, I actually outlined six of the strategic pillars that we\u2019re all focused on. I\u2019d say that we are super optimistic about the progress we\u2019ve made in the web-scale space. We continue to deliver on our software revenues, which were $3.6 billion this quarter. And again, 76% of it coming from software, and I think that will only increase. So I think that those six pillars combined with more flexibility and consumption options for our customers and continued transition to software and a continued focus on web-scale and other growth opportunities is what we\u2019re trying to do over the next two to three years. Ittai Kidron : Very good. Good luck. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Ittai. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Paul Silverstein from Cowen & Company. You may go ahead. Paul Silverstein : Thanks for taking the questions. Scott, can you tell us what the rate of price degradation was? In connection with that, any thoughts in terms of the mortgage structure of the company at both the gross and operating line asset both resiliency and even hopefully better as to upside and where you can drive that from? Scott Herren : Yes, thanks, Paul. The pricing mix was really in line with what we\u2019d seen over the last several quarters. And you\u2019ll see this next week, obviously, in the Q, but I\u2019ll go ahead and give you the data point. It was 1.6% for the second quarter, slightly better actually than what we had seen in Q1 and actually modestly better than what we\u2019ve seen over the trailing four quarters. So pricing mix was as expected during the second quarter. I think as you look longer-term, the gross margin is going to bounce around a little. It always does. I think part of what is factoring into our view of gross margin ahead is that the benefit of a greater mix of software and services in there being somewhat offset by some of the supply chain concerns that we have right now that I think you\u2019ve seen, not just from us, but from everyone who is building products that contain a significant amount of semiconductors. So we\u2019re doing what you\u2019d expect us to do on the supply chain front. We are contacting all of our key suppliers on that front. We\u2019re leveraging kind of the volume purchase that we have, extending that supply chain further out, all with a goal of ensuring we can protect customer shipments. So there\u2019s a little bit of a headwind coming in those lines from just the supply \u2013 the current supply chain. Paul Silverstein : Hey Scott, I trust though, the supply chain commentary, that\u2019s a transitory issue that\u2019s going to pass if we look beyond assuming the world goes back to normal. It sounds like if you net that out, there should be a positive trajectory at some point. Scott Herren : I think that\u2019s right. I mean, we\u2019ve talked about growing the percent of our business, and you\u2019ve seen Cisco do a really nice job of growing the percent of the business coming from software and services. And, obviously, that comes through at a higher margin. Paul Silverstein : Appreciate it. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research. You may go ahead. Pierre Ferragu : Hey. Thank you for taking my question. Scott, I have a question for you on your gross margin. I was just checking my model, and I think the 66.9% you reported this quarter is actually a record for as far back as my model goes. I think it goes back quite far. So congratulations, like, a great stuff on that front. Scott Herren : Thanks. Pierre Ferragu : And my question is actually how should we think about gross margin in this transition you want to accelerate and continue throughout the Cloud? Are we now in a phase where we should expect gross margins to head up over-time with ups and down, of course? But should we expect structural margin expansion going along with your transformation? Scott Herren : Yes, again, Pierre, your model must go back to our fiscal 2006, because this was the highest gross margin we\u2019d reported since second quarter of 2006. So you\u2019re right from that standpoint. And again, I would just in terms of where this goes longer-term, I expect there to be a little bouncing around over the next couple of quarters given some of the supply chain concerns that everyone that\u2019s building product based on semis. And a slight headwind still from memory. But I think everyone in the market is going to see that same set of trends. Longer-term, again, as we drive up the mix of software and services that should have a positive impact on gross margins. Pierre Ferragu : Great. And maybe if I have a quick follow up on the same theme. You mention extending the transition. What\u2019s up next for grab for you to evolve in the product portfolio to increase the share of technology that you deliver as a service in Cloud-based? Scott Herren : Hey, Pierre. It\u2019s Chuck. I\u2019ll take that one. And Scott is pretty proud of the immediate impact he had by delivering the record gross margins being here very short time. Pierre Ferragu : I\u2019m very impressed. Chuck Robbins : Yes, exactly, high impact. So I think as you look at the as-a-service offerings, what we\u2019re going to do is take \u2013 we\u2019re taking intellectual property we have in our core enterprise portfolio, we\u2019re delivering a lot of that as both Cloud-delivered as well as Cloud-managed. Think about what we\u2019ve done with the whole discussion we\u2019ve had over the years about the Meraki platform and how we bring those capabilities to the rest of the portfolio, taking technologies like SD-WAN and Cloud Security and integrating those together and delivering those as a service, which, frankly, are uniquely capability \u2013 that\u2019s a unique capability that we have. And so I think those are areas where you\u2019ll see that continue to move forward. In addition to anything that we've sort of virtualized over the years, you can now deliver that as a service, anything that's pure software. So we're looking at every aspect of the portfolio. Pierre Ferragu : Thanks, Chuck. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Pierre. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Jeff Kvaal from Wolfe Research. You may go ahead. Jeff Kvaal : Yes. Thanks very much. I'm hoping to ask two, I guess first is I'm wondering, could you help us understand better the dynamics involved in the web-scale progress, which product lines and what type of applications are you into, is that a Silicon One story? And then secondly, I was just wondering if you could help us with the expectation for the durability of the public sector strengths. Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Yes. Thanks, Jeff. So let me start with the second one, the durability of the public sector. I think two comments on this one, clearly there is stimulus that\u2019s flowing in both in the U.S. and around the world and I think that'll continue for some period of time, obviously and that's certainly helping. But the other thing that I think has occurred over the last year is that countries have realized that they have to invest in infrastructure, and digital infrastructure and technology to be prepared for these sorts of crises in the future. So I think that notwithstanding stimulus, I think the spending we see post-pandemic will be greater than what we saw pre-pandemic. And in fact, some of these countries have come to the conclusion that they need to take more dependency on themselves and less on some of their allies given sort of what we've seen over the last few years and so they're beefing up their technology investments from that perspective. So I think net, once a stimulus goes out, I still think you see a positive segment for a few years to come. On the web-scale front, I'll just take a minute to explain, we actually gave more information today than we've given. And over the last few years, many of you have heard me say that this was a marathon and we got a lot of work to do. And what has become clear to me over the last five quarters is that, the work that our teams have put in over the last five years has begun to pay-off. And so this quarter we saw triple digit growth year-over-year in our web-scale portfolio. As I said in earlier comments the prior four quarters, I will tell you that the growth rates range from 17% to 74%. So it's been up for the last five quarters as we've talked about. From a portfolio perspective, you asked we're selling the 8000 series which we announced in December of 2019, we're winning 400 gig franchises. We are selling some silicon, we're selling our Catalyst 9000 and we're selling the rest of the portfolio as well. And so it's been pretty broad-based relative to what we are selling them, but we feel good about the investments we've made, the hard work we put in. And the last thing I'll tell you is that, the other question you're probably going to ask is how material it is from a size perspective. And I'll tell you that last quarter that we just finished, it was 25% of our service provider segment. And over the last four quarters, it's averaged 21% of that SP segment. So it's gotten to a point where it it's meaningful. So that's why we decided to give the additional information today. Again, this business much like the service provider business that we've talked about over the years we'll have \u2013 will be big deal driven, big customer driven. So it will have a tendency to be lumpy. But I think if you look at it over the course of four quarters, six quarters, eight quarters, it's going to be a \u2013 it should continue to be positive. Jeff Kvaal : Thank you, Chuck. Congratulations. Chuck Robbins : Thanks. Marilyn Mora : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs, you may go ahead. Rod Hall : Yes, thanks for the question. I had two as well. One would be, I guess, one of the most surprising numbers in here is the service provider order growth rate of 5%. I think huge turnaround from last quarter. And I think you just gave me part of the answer to that, Chuck. But just curious if you could dig into that a little bit more color, what drove that? Just a little bit unexpected for me. And then the second thing I wanted to ask, back to you Scott on the FX impact, is there any way you could quantify those, if you help us understand how the dollar move has affected for instance, revenue growth year-over-year and maybe margins as well. If anything, you can help us with based on quantification there. Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Hi Rod I'll take the first one. On the SP space, so yes, if you look at what we saw in the quarter from an order perspective, we saw a positive growth in cable, which represents about 15% of segment. We saw triple digit growth in web-scale, which is representing 25% of the segment. And then our telco business was down and that's roughly 60% of the business and primarily that is because where we are in the stages with 5G. We have roughly 35 customers around the world that were working on 5G solutions with mobile backhaul, with orchestration, with packet core. And so we're just early in that transition. And I think that particular sub-segment of SP will begin to show progress for us as we see the core backbone build-outs as we've been saying over the last few years. And the good news is we're seeing the backhaul stuff being built. We're seeing the packet core decisions get made, which means that the core network backbone decisions will be made. And the fact that we are being \u2013 having some positive success in a web-scale space would give me a high degree of confidence that those same products will bode well in the service provider space. So I think, this has been a tough segment for us for many, many years, and we're hopeful right now with the web-scale success and then with the 5G build outs underway that this could be a tailwind over the next few years for us. Scott Herren : And Rod this is Scott on the FX impact. As you know in most markets we price in USD. So there's a limited impact from FX on the top line. But of course with the weaker dollar, we have employees worldwide and obviously you pay them in local currency. And so when you translate that back, it has a \u2013 it creates a bit of a headwind for us on the OpEx side. I'm hesitant to give you an exact figure on that, but just so you can understand the dynamics that's the way it works. And it has created a headwind for us during the second quarter. Rod Hall : Okay. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Rod. Next question. Operator : Tal Liani from Bank of America Securities, you may go ahead. Tal Liani : Hello, I have two questions. One is just clarification from my understanding and I'll ask it in a general way. What's holding up the closure of Acacia and what will change now versus the delays we've seen so far, so that's the easy one. The second question is I want to understand your outlook on a product basis rather than a vertical. When you \u2013 we focus on legacy switches and routers. Can you discuss the trends that you're seeing for the next four quarters or the next kind of calendar year? Where is the change, meaning what are the areas where you see increase versus the previous four quarters? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : So Tal, I am going to ask for clarification on the second one before I start. So are you talking about in the enterprise space? Are you just or you're just talking about what do we feel good about from a product perspective over the next few quarters in general? Tal Liani : Exactly. I'm trying to understand it at the product level rather than the vertical level. Chuck Robbins : Yes, got it. Okay. So on the Acacia thing, I think it's quite clear what occurred, we didn't have China approval, we thought we did, we didn't have it in time. So we renegotiated the price because our contract with them had expired and candidly the performance they put up in the 18 months between our original deal and this deal was pretty astounding, so the price was not was not out of the question. And then we subsequently got Chinese approval and I think Scott keep me honest, but I think they have to get shareholder approval and the proxies out. So we expect that should happen, it'll happen during Q3 Tal. So China approval is done, there's no more approvals to get. It's just up to the shareholder vote at this point. So we think that is in pretty good shape. On the on the second front, let me just run through the portfolio and I'll tell you sort of how I feel about everything right now. So I think, if you look at the Mass-Scale Infrastructure, the service provider portfolio, whatever you want to call it, where the 8000 is and some of the other stuff that's being built for 5G and for 400 gig, in the mass-scale data centers, I think that portfolio is in really good shape, and I would expect it to be a very positive contributor, not only over the next year but over the next two to three years. I think that there's if I look at the campus switching infrastructure, I think with customers begin to come back they are going to look at upgrading. We've seen \u2013 we saw significant growth last quarter in demand for WiFi 6. Just to give you a data point that we don't disclose anywhere, but we had \u2013 I think our orders for WiFi grew 20% last quarter. And what typically happens is that when you effectively put a lot of load on WiFi, like WiFi 6 is going to accommodate, it's going to require an underlying infrastructure upgrade to accommodate it. And when you add to that, the video load that will likely go on to these customers as they come back to the office and put video in every conference room and continue to use video the way they've used it during the pandemic. We think that that will also be a driver. So I think we have the Catalyst 9000 portfolio, the WiFi 6portfolio. We feel good about as well. The SD-WAN technology continues to move forward. We're seeing good growth there. And I think as we deliver that technology as a service integrated with our cloud security, I think that's going to be a differentiator for us. Within the security portfolio the teams are working on a couple of very differentiated tracks on strategy, I'd say that we need \u2013 I'd say we need another six months or so to see how that evolves, but I feel good about what they plan to do. Our current portfolio is performing well and they just need to execute. So we have to see that. I think the teams have done an amazing job on what they've brought forward with the WebEx platform. Again, you have to remember in the applications space, there's probably a view on that, when it's not performing the way you would think, you got to remember all the phones are included in that space too. So while WebEx was up double digits as Scott said. You've also got the drag of the handset business, that's in there as well. But I think the WebEx work and the pace of innovation, the feature velocity, the suite aspect that they're looking at I think the teams are doing a really good job. And I think over the next year, you'll see us actually, that portfolio will continue to improve and I think we have a chance to take share back. What did I miss? And then we're working on things like full stack observability which are somewhat nascent. We're working on our edge service strategy, which is somewhat nascent, but I feel like the team \u2013 I think the portfolio is in probably as good a shape as has been in awhile. And we just have to execute. Tal Liani : Right. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Next question, please. Operator : Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan, you may go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for the question. Chuck just wanted to see if you can dig a bit deeper into the demand drivers for the security segment here, particularly how have you seen customers respond to the recent events on SolarWinds. If we would have expected a bit more momentum on the security segment here? Is that more particularly to come or particularly is it more going to be hardware or software that we should expect the demand from? Chuck Robbins : Yes. I think that what we see across that portfolio is we had a really good quarter actually in network firewall and cloud security. So it was a good quarter across the board, across the portfolio. And I think what you'll see is that, we're in the early phases I think of any positive impact that you would see from a SolarWinds buildup, because most of the customers are going into assess like, where am I, what have I missed, what do I need, what caused me to miss what I missed, and then they're going to move from there. So I think we're sort of in the midst of that right now, with a lot of our customers doing those kinds of assessments. But, it's been from the early parts of the pandemic when we saw VPN technology being absorbed as much as we could possibly build and then the network firewall, and then combine that with the cloud security, it feels like customers are consuming whatever security they can consume right now to try to avoid those sorts of situations. So I would think that that will continue to be positive for us. Samik Chatterjee : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James & Associates. You may go ahead, sir. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask first an easy one and then more of a thematic one. On the easy side hopefully, is just wondering if the supply chain constraints, your ability to get components, if that cost you any revenue in the quarter, if you could quantify that. And then in terms of the broader trend, maybe you could help me understand how you see the campus environment developing because it sounds like you've highlighted a number of positives \u2013 getting back to work, long legs in the CAT 9K cycle, Wi-Fi sounds good. But I have to imagine there are some offsets as well \u2013 maybe not as many people go back to work, legacy products rolling over. Just if you could build a bridge on what's going on in Campus over the longer term. Thank you. Chuck Robbins : All right. Scott, you want to take supply chain? Scott Herren : Yes, we didn't really see any impact on our ability to get product out the door during the second quarter. The team has stayed on top of the supply chain scenario, and it's been evolving, as you know, throughout the quarter. As we look ahead at Q3, that is something that is factored into our guide, both in our expectations on the top line and on the gross margin line. But it really hasn't been \u2013 in the second quarter at least, it hasn't been a significant headwind for us. Chuck Robbins : Yes, I think that our teams are doing a good job on that of trying to buy ahead, trying to build inventory. And I think that there's certainly some unknowns and it's certainly complex. But I think the teams have done a pretty good job navigating, and it is built into the guide. On the Campus front, I think what I described is actually what I would expect for most customers. I think, Simon, the question you ask is a philosophical discussion that we have a lot in that when customers go back, what is it going to look like? Are more employees going to stay at home? Does that mean they're going to shrink their footprint? Does COVID stay with us? Do people now believe that they want to be, they want to maintain somewhat of a social distance in the office even post-COVID until we really get well beyond it? And does that mean that you need more footprint? What's the future of shared space? Are employees comfortable coming in and sitting in a shared space that someone else occupied the day before or do they want their own space when they come in so that they feel safe in it? And I think those are the kinds of things that we don't understand. But if I net it out, I don't think, personally \u2013 this my own opinion based on customer discussions and everything else. I don't think that some of the earlier beliefs in the pandemic where the early days is like no one is going to go back to the office because we're actually productive at home. I think we sort of moved into that phase where people actually struggle mentally. People are \u2013 they're not enjoying it. One of our employees said to me the other day, I don't mind the option of working from home. I don't like being forced to work from home. And so I really believe it's going to be hybrid, where people are going to work from home and everybody's sort of landing here where they're going to work from home three days a week and work from the office two days a week or vice versa. The question is what accommodations does that lead to for customers, based on employees' concern over space issues, concern over future pandemics or other concern. That's what we just don't know yet. But I do believe, based on what we've seen with Wi-Fi 6, that tells me customers are getting ready, and they're upgrading the wireless infrastructure now. And in the Commercial space, we've seen a fair amount of the follow-on with the switching, and hopefully we'll see that in the Enterprise space beyond this quarter. Simon Leopold : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Simon. Next question? Operator : Tim Long from Barclays. You may go ahead, sir. Tim Long : Thank you. Yes, two if I could as well. First, maybe, Chuck, on the Cat 9K still doing very well. Just curious what you think the impacts will be when some of the kind of earlier adopters licenses are coming due. So kind of what impact is that? Kind of what inning are we in there? And then second on the Cloud business, curious kind of who you're winning against there. Is this against just traditional competitors or are you starting to see any wins back from white box or are you just serving to maybe limit where white box can go with that Cloud customer base? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Tim, thanks. So on the Cat 9K, I think the way I would think about it is that the license \u2013 I think you're really asking about the renewal side of that piece, which in this fiscal year is \u2013 it's not significantly material. And I think I've said on a couple of calls before it's really good, the size it is this year because it gives us a chance to test our processes and our renewal value proposition and all that stuff because it's meaningful in fiscal 2022. So the teams are working hard right now to try to get ahead of that and be ready for it. On the Cloud front, what I would say is that when we announced in December of 2019 we had a launch, the future of the internet launch, we talked about that we would be \u2013 we would sell our customers systems, integrated systems. We would sell them silicon or we would sell them white boxes. I mean, I'm sorry, our software. And we have all three of those scenarios actually playing out right now. So we have customers who have standardized on our systems for 400 gig. We have customers who are testing our silicon and actually putting it in white boxes, which is what we would expect them to do. We have some customers running our software stack on their hardware. And the people we're competing with are, they would be quite evident to you, short of me calling them out. I think these are the traditional players that have been successful in that space, and we talked a lot back years ago about the fact that we missed the first wave and we were going to work hard to be in a position when the 400 gig transition occurred and try to work our way back in and earn that business back. And I think the teams have begun to do that. So I'm really proud of what they've done. Tim Long : Okay. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Hey, we have time for one last question. Michelle? Operator : Thank you. Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead. Marilyn Mora : Sami? Operator : Sami, your line is open. Marilyn Mora : Sami, are you on mute? Sami Badri : I don't think so. Chuck Robbins : There you are. Marilyn Mora : We hear you now. We didn't hear you before. Sami Badri : Okay. Perfect. Sorry about that. First question is for Chuck. One thing that I think has not come up in this call is anything regarding the 5G really, and we're about year three in the telecommunications 5G cycle. And at this point, a lot of people are just trying to understand what's really the effect to the equipment supply chain and how these telecommunication providers are going to consume equipment from the different vendors? And then the other question is for Scott. You do have some M&A that has already closed in fiscal 3Q, and there are projections for other closures of deals in fiscal 3Q. Does any of the guide include acquired or inorganic revenues? And if you're prepared to give us a breakout of organic versus inorganic, that would be helpful. Chuck Robbins : Let me take the 5G. I think what you're seeing right now is most customers \u2013 most of our customers that are working on 5G, they've been building out the radio networks; they've been building out packet core capabilities; they've been building out mobile backhaul; and in many cases, they're running these hybrid 4G/5G backbones, with some exceptions where you have like a standalone 5G network that's been built. And in that case, what we participate in, in there with the packet core for sure, mobile backhaul, and some elements of orchestration. And what we believe is that over the next couple of years as these providers begin to build out a standalone 5G backbones and in many cases to serve up enterprise services that they will be making decisions on core upgrades to support the bandwidth and the traffic that's going to load those networks. And I think that's when we believe that we will see this \u2013 most of the benefit from the 5G build-out. So that's kind of where we are right now. And we're having good success in the areas that we participate based on where they are in the life cycle of these networks. Scott, you want to touch on the M&A question? Scott Herren : Sure. Sami, we did have a couple of acquisitions that closed during the second quarter but they were both quite small. Strategically important but not meaningful in terms of adding to the Q3 guide, we've got some more meaningful ones that we do expect to close during the quarter. Obviously, Acacia would be meaningful. We've got IMImobile which we expect to close during the quarter, which will have some level of impact on the guide. Neither of those are factored in at this point. So as we get those closed \u2013 and at this point it's not exactly certain when they'll close, which is why they're not currently factored into the guide \u2013 as those close, we'll give you some insight into what our expectations are for them. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you very much. Chuck Robbins : All right. Just to wrap up, I want to thank everybody for spending time with us today and again, just hope that everybody stays safe as we work through what we're all hopeful is the beginning of the recovery. And I think that from a business perspective, we continue to feel like that is definitely the case; that we are in the midst of a recovery, which gives us a lot of optimism. I'm proud of what our teams have done. I'm proud of the innovation that we have built during this complicated time. And we have Cisco Live coming up at the end of March where there'll be a lot of innovation that we'll be announcing. And based on that and some of the performance that we see and the continued improvement in our business, I remain fairly optimistic about where we are right now as we come through this pandemic. So we'll look forward to talking to all of you on the next call. And, Marilyn, I'll turn it back over to you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Chuck. Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal 2021 third quarter results, will be on Wednesday, May 19, 2021, at 1 :30 PM Pacific Time, 4:30 PM Eastern Time.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Marilyn Mora : Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's third quarter fiscal 2021 quarterly earnings call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides including supplemental information will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue, and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties, including COVID-19, that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify the important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Marilyn. Good afternoon and thanks for joining today. I hope everyone is staying healthy and safe as we start to see the benefits of vaccine deployments and the continuing improvement in economic activity. I want to start by acknowledging our employees, customers and partners in India who are experiencing a devastating surge of COVID cases. Cisco is providing critical resources during this challenging time, and our thoughts remain with all of you. While many of us are seeing great progress in our recovery efforts, we must remain vigilant and adaptable as we manage the ongoing pandemic around the world. Turning to the quarter, we had impressive momentum in Q3, which gives me a great sense of optimism going forward. We returned to growth, with revenue up 7%, driven by an improving macro environment, the strongest product portfolio in our history and great execution by our teams. We saw broad-based demand across the business, led by our biggest growth opportunities : hybrid work, digital transformation, cloud and continued strong uptake of our subscription-based offerings. We are also seeing early momentum in the ramping of key technology cycles that are long-term growth drivers for our business, such as 5G, 400 gig and Edge. The next phase of the recovery and the future of work will be heavily reliant on our technology. Cisco's end-to-end portfolio will serve as the foundation for next-generation infrastructure solutions as well as cloud-enabled delivery models and innovation, allowing our customers to move with even greater speed and agility. This will require a significant investment cycle and reinforces the strength of our strategy while driving greater opportunity to create a world that is more connected, inclusive and secure. We remain focused on accelerating innovation while simplifying the adoption of our offerings with network-wide automation, analytics and flexible as a service consumption models, all aimed at improving our customer's network performance capabilities and security, which we believe will drive tremendous long-term opportunities for us. Our Q3 performance only reinforces my confidence about the future. These results reflect a return to a strong spending environment and an economic recovery that has gained momentum driven by vaccine rollouts and the easing of restrictions. As the economy has improved, customers have increased their investment across our portfolio to prepare for the upturn and return to office. In Q3, we saw 10% growth in product orders, the highest growth rate since Q1 of fiscal 2012, reflecting robust improvement across all of our customer segments and geographies. From a product revenue perspective, we saw 6% growth, led by strength across our portfolio including campus switching, routing, wireless, security, collaboration, and Webscale, as well as from our acquisition of Acacia, which closed during Q3. We continue to aggressively shift our business to more recurring revenue streams which we expect to grow over time as we expand our offerings. In Q3, we achieved $3.8 billion in software revenue, with 81% of our software revenue sold as a subscription, up from 76% last quarter. We also saw another quarter of double-digit growth in our deferred revenue and remaining performance obligations. Over the past six years, we have made significant progress and now have one of the largest software businesses in the industry with an annual run-rate well over $14 billion. Let me now touch on Infrastructure Platforms. We saw strong demand across a majority of our portfolio, led by our next-generation Enterprise Networking and Service Provider solutions, as companies accelerate the modernization of their infrastructure. This modern infrastructure delivers higher performance and faster access to data, while offering the best user experience in an increasingly distributed environment. Customers are turning to us to help them create the trusted workplace of the future, with Wi-Fi access points, video endpoints, cameras and IoT sensors feeding data into DNA Center and DNA spaces. We're enabling operations teams to remotely monitor workplace conditions for a safe return to office. We're also working to provide visibility beyond corporate networks, which is increasingly critical as our customers accelerate their adoption of SaaS and cloud solutions for hybrid work. At Cisco Live, we launched the industry's first enterprise-wide full stack observability offering by integrating ThousandEyes cloud intelligence with our Catalyst switching portfolio and AppDynamics. This provides IT with visibility and actionable insights across both external and internal networks to provide a seamless digital experience for users. And with users more distributed than ever, it is vital that they have the most efficient and secure connection to the cloud. Our deep partnerships with Google, Amazon and Microsoft allow native connectivity from our SD-WAN fabric to each of these cloud offerings. With our technology, customers can reduce deployment times and connect branch offices to cloud workloads in minutes. In our Webscale business, we delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of strong order growth, which increased over 25% in the quarter, and over 50% on a trailing 12-month basis. Our Webscale customers are starting their 400 gig upgrade cycles and aggressively pursuing long-haul build-outs while our Carrier customers are exploring new architectures to realize the full potential of 5G. We are building the internet for the future by creating breakthrough innovation with our routing, optical and automation technologies to deliver significant economic benefits. Recently, we launched a new routed optical networking solution, integrating our scalable, high-performance routers and Acacia's pluggable optics, which offers significant cost savings. Last week, we announced our intent to acquire Sedona Systems to extend our cross-work automation platform to build on these capabilities. We also expanded our Silicon One platform, from a routing-focused solution to one which addresses the Webscale switching market, offering 10 networking chips ranging from 3.2 terabits to 25.6 terabits per second, making it the highest performance programmable routing and switching silicon on the market. We know our customers increasingly want to consume Cisco's technology in new and more flexible ways. At Cisco Live, we launched our new As a Service portfolio, Cisco Plus, and our first offer, Cisco Plus Hybrid Cloud, combining our data center compute, networking and storage portfolio. Cisco Plus includes our plans to deliver networking as a service, which will unify networking, Security, and observability across Access, WAN and Cloud domains to deliver an unparalleled experience for our customers. Turning to Security, we had a record quarter, surpassing $875 million in revenue, up 13% as we expanded our reach with customers around the world. Our Security strategy is focused on delivering a simple and secure experience. We have an unrivaled ability to provide end-to-end Security capabilities across users, devices, applications and data, on any network or any cloud. This is the key reason why our customers trust us to help them proactively protect against and remediate threats. In fact, leading customers in every industry, including 100% of the Fortune 100, are using Cisco Security solutions. These customers are increasingly deploying our Zero Trust and Secure Access Service Edge or SASE architectures, along with automation, authentication and analytics capabilities. With today's distributed workforce, companies must quickly deploy highly secure, trusted access to critical applications everywhere without compromising performance. Customers like Ford are using our cloud-delivered Security platform umbrella, as they secure over 100,000 of their remote team members. And this quarter, Lyft turned to Cisco to strengthen their security protection for all of their users accessing their applications. By deploying our duo portfolio, Lyft was able to provide strong access controls, as they protect their users' sensitive personal and financial information while reducing their total cost of ownership by more than 50%. With nearly $6 billion in annual R&D, the investment that Cisco is making in both Security and the Network continues to lead the momentum across our portfolio, with 23 consecutive quarters of double-digit umbrella cloud Security growth, nearly 7,000 customers using our cloud native SecureX platform and strong platform growth with Security enterprise agreements. We continue to expand our leadership with new innovations, including passwordless authentication, data loss prevention, observability, cloud-based malware detection and enhancements to SecureX. We're also complementing our organic innovation with assets that enable greater security efficacy. Our intent to acquire Kenna Security will bring together their risk-based vulnerability management platform, with SecureX's threat management capabilities to prioritize and more effectively manage overall risk. Lastly, let me touch on Applications. Our collaboration business continues to perform well. We had a record quarter in WebEx, as we execute against our strategy to power the future of hybrid work. Over the last six months we've added more than 400 new features and devices to our WebEx portfolio. We are enabling seamless experiences through our desk camera and desk hub solutions while extending the WebEx suite of devices, including digital signage, touchless calls, room capacity alerts and environmental sensors to help enable a safe return to the office. Wellbeing is top of mind for so many right now as we face a new way of working. This is why we launched People Insights to help people monitor and manage their wellbeing. These new features, devices and capabilities combined with Cloud Calling and Cloud Contact Center provide our customers with the most comprehensive and inclusive hybrid work platform. Last week, we announced our intent to acquire Socio Labs. By integrating Slido and Socio Labs into our WebEx platform, we will also be able to provide the most comprehensive internal and external event management solution on the market. In summary, we had a very good quarter. I'm so proud of the continued success of the business transformation our teams are driving. As I mentioned earlier, we are experiencing the strongest demand in nearly a decade. We are also seeing similar component shortage supply issues as our peers. The good news, and this is reflected in our guidance, is that we are confident we will work through this as we have already put in place revised arrangements with several of our key suppliers. We believe these actions will enable us to optimize our access to critical components, including semiconductors, and take care of our customers by fulfilling their demand as quickly as possible. Our strategy and commitment to leading with trust, innovation and choice, along with our continued focus and discipline, are positioning us well for growth and profitability. As we accelerate the pace of innovation for our customers and partners, it's critical that we continue to support our people, our communities and our planet. I'm very proud that Cisco was recently named the Number One Best Place to Work in the United States by Fortune and Great Place to Work. This is a tremendous honor for us, as it recognizes the incredible work of our people and the power of the culture we have created. And lastly, in terms of actions we are taking to protect the planet. Last month, the Cisco Foundation announced $100 million over 10 years to fund nonprofit grants and impact investing in climate solutions. We have already achieved 100% renewable energy in the U.S. and in many countries across Europe, and this is another strong step forward. Whether it's our deep focus on delivering the best results for our customers, partners and employees or our commitment to making a difference in communities across the world, Cisco remains committed to our purpose, to power an inclusive future for all. I'm quite optimistic about what's ahead and confident in our team's ability to deliver. I'll now turn it over to Scott. Scott Herren : Thanks, Chuck. Last quarter I identified four key priorities that we are using to define our financial strategy : driving profitable growth, a continued disciplined focus on financial management and operating efficiency, setting a long-term plan to maximize value creation through strategic transformation and examining investments, both organic and inorganic. We made progress on all these fronts in Q3 and are continuing to build our financial approach based on these core pillars, providing a strong foundation for enhanced financial performance as well as long-term value creation for our shareholders. Now, let's turn to our results. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter followed by the guidance for Q4. As Chuck said, Q3 was a strong quarter, across the business. We executed well, with strong product orders and solid growth in revenue, net income and earnings per share. Total revenue increased to $12.8 billion up 7% year-on-year, exceeding the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. We saw broad strength in all product areas and geographies. We also saw continued recovery in our business and building momentum was sequential revenue growth of 7%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.6%. Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion up 4%, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.83, up 5% year-on-year, coming in above the high end of our EPS guidance range. Now let me provide more detail on our Q3 revenue. Total product revenue was $9.1 billion, up 6%. Service revenue was $3.7 billion, up 8%. Infrastructure Platforms has rebounded nicely, with revenues up 6%. Within that, Switching Revenue increased overall with growth in campus driven by strong double-digit growth of our Catalyst 9K products. Routing had strong double-digit growth, driven by strength in the Service Provider market. Wireless had strong growth, driven by the continued ramp of our Wi-Fi 6 products and strength in Meraki. Data Center revenue declined, driven primarily by servers as we experienced continued market contraction. Applications were up 5%. We continue to see double-digit growth in WebEx, driven by our product innovations and the value we bring to remote working. We saw growth in Unified Communications, IoT software, and AppDynamics, offset by a decline in TelePresence endpoints. Security was up 13%, with growth across the entire portfolio. Our Cloud Security portfolio performed well, with strong double-digit growth and continued momentum of our Duo and Umbrella offerings. So we continued to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving growth in subscriptions and recurring revenue. Software revenue was $3.8 billion, and subscriptions were 81% of total software revenue, up 7 points year-on-year. As we continue to increase our software subscriptions, we're driving higher levels of recurring revenues. In fact the majority of our total revenue growth in the quarter came from recurring revenue streams. Additionally, the strength of our portfolio and transition to more software and services is driving growth in remaining performance obligations or RPO. At the end of Q3, RPOs were $28.1 billion, up 10%. RPO for Product was up 15% and for Service was up 7%. There was a 90 basis points positive impact on revenue growth in the quarter related to the acquisitions of Acacia and IMImobile, which both closed during the quarter. As a reminder, these acquisitions were not factored into our Q3 revenue guide. We had strong order momentum in Q3, with total product orders up 10%. Looking at our geographies, the Americas were up 6%, EMEA was up 10% and APJC was up 31%. Total Emerging Markets were up 13%, with the BRICs plus Mexico up 31%. In our Customer segments, Service Provider was up 17%, Commercial was up 16%, Public Sector was up 11%. Enterprise was flat, which is a significant improvement from last quarter. Non-GAAP total gross margin came in at the high end of our guidance range at 66%, down 60 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 64.9%, down 90 basis points, and service gross margin was 68.7% down 20 basis points. The decrease in product gross margin was largely driven by ongoing costs related to the supply chain challenges, offset by positive product mix which includes some software benefit. Price erosion was relatively moderate and in-line with our historical range. On the supply chain front, we continue to manage through the constraints seen industry-wide and continue to incur additional costs. We are partnering with our key suppliers, leveraging our volume purchasing and expending supply commitments as we address the supply chain challenges which we expect will continue. The quarter did include an extra week, as we discussed on our last call. Consistent with our guidance for the quarter, the benefit to total revenue was approximately 3 points of growth. Total impact on our cost of sales and operating expenses was approximately $150 million. Operating cash flow was $3.9 billion, down 8%, driven by the timing of payments and restructuring costs. We expect operating cash flow to normalize for the full fiscal year. We ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $23.6 billion, down $7 billion sequentially, driven by $5.5 billion in payments for acquisitions, as well as 3 billion in repayments of our long-term debt. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter. It was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly dividend and $510 million of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we returned $6.7 billion to shareholders, which represents 64% of our free cash flow, and we have $8.7 billion in capacity remaining under our current share repurchase program authorization. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q3 we closed three acquisitions, Acacia Communications, IMImobile, and Dashbase. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we also successfully closed on our acquisition of Slido on May 4. These investments are consistent with our strategy of complementing our internal innovation in R&D with targeted M&A to allow us to further strengthen and differentiate our market position in our growth areas. To summarize, we had a great Q3. We executed well, with strong top line growth and profitability. We're seeing returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the continued shift to more software and subscriptions, delivering growth and driving shareholder value. Now, let's turn to our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21. This guidance is subject to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. Our financial guidance for Q4 is as follows : we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 6% to 8% year-on-year, reflecting again, the strong demand we're seeing. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 64% to 65%, reflecting the ongoing increase in supply chain costs we're incurring as we protect shipments to our customers. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 32% to 33%, and the non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 19%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.81 to $0.83. Looking ahead, we're excited to announce we will host a virtual Cisco Financial Analyst Day on Wednesday, September 15, 2021. We will post event details in the coming weeks and look forward to sharing more with you at that time. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Scott. Michelle, let's go ahead and begin the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs, you may go ahead. Rod Hall : Yes, guys, thanks for the question. I wanted to start off I guess with the margin guidance. And that's the thing most people are asking me about. And I heard, Scott, I heard you talking about the impact from increased costs. I guess maybe could you give us some more color on how sustainable those impacts are and also address the OpEx line? it looks like those costs are inflated too, I assume, for some of the same reasons. But just the sustainability of these cost pressures and these kinds of margins you're guiding for, as we look forward. Thanks. Scott Herren : Yes. Thanks, Rod. On starting with the gross margin, the impact you're seeing in the Q4 guide on gross margin is really driven by supply chain. It has a couple of elements to it. One is unit cost. So we've got and actually it was announced today from Gartner, we've got the number one supply chain team in the world, two years in a row. And that team has done a great job getting ahead of the issues that everyone in the industry is seeing. So with that, though, we've locked in both supply and pricing with some of the key component providers that we've got going ahead. That's what you see built into the margin guide and I think the supply chain issues will stay with us from what I can see at least through the end of this calendar year. On the OpEx side, it's a little bit different. When you look at the -- we're right on track, let me just start by saying, before you ask, we're right on track with the savings associated with the restructuring that we announced earlier this year, earlier this fiscal year. We said at the time we would reinvest some of that into the growth of the business overall, and that's what you see happening. So when you look at the year-on-year growth in OpEx, it's driven by the integration of the acquisitions that closed during the quarter, a little bit of a headwind from FX as the dollar has weakened and then the higher commissions given the robust strength of the top line. Commissions are up and reset at a variable comp plans. But that's what's driving it and I think the sustainability, to get to your point, is I expect to see some of these supply chain issues linger with us through the end of the calendar year, first half of our fiscal year. Chuck Robbins : Yes. Hey, Rod, this is Chuck. I just want to add a little color to that. And as we began to realize that we were going to have the incremental costs, we had to make some decisions, and I think obviously, we do believe these are temporary. We'll have to see how long they last, but based on that and based on the fact that we are seeing such momentum in the business right now, we decided to continue to invest in the business to drive the growth that we are feeling right now. And when you see the balance of the growth across all the businesses, you see the regional balance it was balanced across the technology areas. It was balanced across segments. And then, you think about that in the context of some of these real major trends that are occurring that we're on the front end of, like the 400 gig transition, like the success we're having in Webscale, the Service Provider 5G build-out, the hybrid work and return to office, we talked about Wi-Fi 6 leading to campus switching, which we're seeing play out now and the Security business had a record quarter at a time where most every customer is suggesting that they're going to be spending more over the next 12 months in cybersecurity. So, we feel like it was prudent to continue to invest to meet the demand and deal with some of the short-term pain and then we think we'll get to the other side of it. Rod Hall : Great, okay. Thanks a lot, appreciate it. Scott Herren : Thanks, Rod. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Rod. Next question, please? Operator : Samik Chatterjee from J.P. Morgan, you may go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Chuck, I guess, somewhat following up on Rod's question here, I think the macro expectation is that we will be going through a period of higher inflation and you're seeing that somewhat in the supply chain but also in other aspects as well. Can you just help us think through what are the levels that the company has as you navigate through that? And particularly, how are you trying to balance that against the raise that some of the customers might be pulling ahead orders or pulling ahead demand just to secure product from you? Chuck Robbins : Yes, a couple great questions. Number one, what we do know is that if we come to the conclusion that any of these cost increases or this inflation as you mentioned are going to be more sustained then we will look at strategic price increases where we have to. And that work's already underway. There's already some decisions that we've made, so we will do that. It's a pretty dynamic situation as you know. And then on the pull-ahead, this is a question that we've been asked. And while it's impossible to really quantify what that might be, it's going to be pretty obvious that if a customer has extended lead times, they're probably going to place orders sooner than they would. That just makes sense. But we also have proxies that we would be looking for to really reflect that being a major issue like order cancellations if they're placing these orders against multiple channels and then canceling when they get it out of one channel. We don't see that. You would see more of that pull-ahead from the Enterprise and obviously Commercial and Small Business, you probably wouldn't see as much and those were pretty significant growth engines for us this past quarter. So we don't see any glaring red flags, although we would certainly agree that there's probably some level of early ordering going on. Samik Chatterjee : Okay, thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Chuck. Next question? Operator : Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley, you may go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great, thanks. Appreciate the question. Where do you think customers are on return to work planning? Are your larger customers may be further along than smaller customers or vice versa? And then just what are you seeing from some of the spending from the impacted industries from last year? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Great question. So, first of all, I think it's the inverse. I think we're seeing the Small Businesses and the Commercial customers moving a little faster, although we saw Enterprise pick up in Asia and in Europe, and we've done a deep analysis with our team. The U.S. improved, and we would expect next quarter and then next fiscal year for U.S. Enterprise to actually improve significantly from where we are today. And I think on the industry front, we were doing the review in the U.S. and we've actually seen double-digit growth in hospitality, in healthcare, in retail. And we've even seen the cruise lines making significant purchases as they prepare to go back out. So, we think that that is definitely a sign that we're on the road to recovery. And I would say that the other thing I would highlight is, as our customers think about hybrid work and they think about the return to office, we've talked about the prevalence of Wi-Fi 6 we saw continued strength in Wi-Fi. And we said once that begins to happen, that we believe there would be a campus switching upgrade follow and the CAT 9K has had four quarters of increasing growth in double digits the last few quarters from a demand perspective, so we've seen that happen as well. So, I think that -- overall, I think it's happening as we thought it would and perhaps even at an accelerated pace. Meta Marshall : Great, thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Meta. Next question, please? Operator : Tal Liani from Bank of America, you may go ahead. Tal Liani : Hi, guys. I have two questions, related and not related. First question is the pricing environment. We see price increases across the board. We see component shortages. Does it impact pricing of your products? And is there any plan or have you already adjusted prices for that? That's number one. The second one, I'm trying to understand the year-over-year trends in the context of easy comps versus real growth. And I know it's hard to say, but it's hard to quantify, but can you at least qualitatively speak about the fact of when you grow 7% and we deduct the acquisition impact, etcetera, what's the impact of the environment really improving in your comments versus just easy comps because last year was so weak because of COVID? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Yes, Tal, it's great. I'll comment on the first one, I'll comment on both of them and then Scott can add on to it. So on the pricing front, as I said a few minutes ago, I think we have made some decisions on certain products that we will be making price increases on, and we're looking surgically at the rest of the portfolio based on where we have costs that we believe are going to be sustained. But you know, we're erring hard right now on taking care of our customers and trying to optimize our ability to deliver to them right now because we think that improves our relationships and it improves our position over the long term with these customers; so that's what we're doing. On the year-over-year trends, I think that what I would point to is the real thing that I think is substantive is the demand side of what we've seen, and -- because you're right. You can do some math that gets at the revenue in Q3, but I think that based on what we see and the demand that we see, we do believe this is certainly, it's a positively evolving marketplace for us and I think the work we've done over the last year, we pivoted our strategy a year ago based on what we thought would happen post-pandemic. The teams have been executing really hard, and it's great to see the customers embracing the solutions that we're delivering out there; so we feel like it's sustainable. Scott Herren : Yes. I think, Tal, when you look at the year-on-year, I think the context you need to put around that is the improving trend that we've seen. We've seen four to five now consecutive quarters of quarter-on-quarter improvement, and really, the improvements across-the-board. It's in each geo, and it's in each product line. So we're seeing continued improvement and that, obviously, bodes well for looking out at Q4 and into the future. I think the other thing that we've talked about the robust demand that we've had and you see the revenue that we printed in Q3. What you didn't see is we also built up a healthy backlog at this point. And so I think that coming into Q4, not only do we have a very high percentage of recurring revenue as, that we know will come into the revenue stream during Q4. We've got a sizable backlog at this point, of orders to fulfill, and we know exactly what's in the pipeline. So, really feel good about the sequential trend that we're seeing across the business. Chuck Robbins : Yes. I think, Tal, it's a really good point that Scott makes. There is a revenue headwind that we're facing based on the supply chain, so notwithstanding what's going on in the supply chain, our revenue guide would have been higher, which could have probably flowed through to improving EPS as well. So it's a complicated thing that we're navigating through right now. But notwithstanding that it's the best I've felt about the business and our momentum and where we are in quite a while. Tal Liani : Great, thank you. Marilyn Mora : Next question, please? Operator : Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer, you may go ahead sir. Ittai Kidron : Oh, thanks, a couple questions for me. Chuck, I do want to follow up again on the demand side. I'm trying to gauge how much of what you're seeing right now is things that were delayed during COVID that are being fulfilled now versus acceleration of future plans into now. I'm just trying to think of sort of what is a normalized demand pattern for you once the noise of COVID, for worse last year and for better right now, kind of goes away. Maybe you can help us think about that. And then for Scott on the growth guidance for next quarter, can you call out specifically the impact of the acquisitions? What is the growth guidance without Acacia, IMI, Dashbase and Slido that you just closed on? Chuck Robbins : Yes, Ittai. Thanks. So, I'll try to do what you -- I'll try to answer what you asked, but I think it's a difficult one to really be definitive about, but I think there's a couple of aspects going on. I certainly believe there are projects that customers put on hold that they're now accelerating now that they have better visibility into what the return looks like. I definitely think that's happening. I also think your second point is happening. I think that they're, every customer is looking at modernizing their infrastructure because no one wants to be caught flat-footed by the next crisis, and everyone has realized the power of technology during this time frame and so I think there's an element of increased investments that we'll see across all the technology areas as well as obviously cybersecurity, etcetera. But the other thing I think that's really important is that we've been investing for a long time against a lot of these big market transitions that are starting to come to life. You remember, Ittai, we didn't play in the Webscale space five years ago. We didn't play. And now, we're seeing that was almost a quarter of our Service Provider business again this quarter, and it's still growing robustly. I mean, it grew over 25% this quarter against a quarter a year ago that was in excess of 70% growth, so it's still accelerating. And then, you've got 5G that's starting to play out the way, as we've all been waiting for it to play out. You've got this return to office and hybrid work with Wi-Fi 6 and the campus upgrades that we've talked about. And you've got this cybersecurity concern that is only exacerbated by everything we see in the press by all the continuing attacks and at a time where we had record revenues. So, I think all of those things are playing into it, and that's what leads us to feel pretty good about where we are right now. Scott Herren : And Ittai, on your second question about the impact of acquisitions. We said in the opening commentary that for Q3, it was about 90 basis points of growth, and that was not part of our Q3 guide. They each closed during the quarter so we look ahead at Q4 of the revenue growth that we've let out there, about a point and a half is driven by the acquisitions, mostly driven by Acacia. Chuck Robbins : Two other things, Ittai, on that particular question that I wanted to point out if you don't mind. The first is we see a revenue headwind from the supply chain issue in Q4. As I said earlier, if we didn't have the supply chain challenges, we would have been guiding higher on revenue, which is reflected what Scott mentioned about the backlog coming into the quarter. The second thing is this business transformation that we have been working on for the last five or six years, if we go back to the first quarter I was CEO and then we look at the quarter that we're entering into, the recurring revenue that we're pulling off the balance sheet that we have visibility to today that will be part of Q4 revenue is up 64% during that time frame. So we have a lot more visibility, and it just says that the whole rationale for why we've been driving this business model transformation, which is a big complex change to get to, but that has helped us in a big way in allowing us to actually deliver the revenue we're talking about next quarter. So, the benefits that we believe were there for the business model, I think this is probably the quarter where we're feeling the positive impact of that more than any other quarter. Ittai Kidron : That's great, thanks. Appreciate it. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Ittai. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Ittai. Next question, please? Operator : Simon Leopold from Raymond James, you may go ahead. Simon Leopold : Thank you. Appreciate it. Marilyn Mora : Simon? Sounds like we lost you. Chuck Robbins : We lost you, Simon. Marilyn Mora : Are you there, Simon? Operator : We'll go to the next question. [Operator Instructions] Amit Daryanani from Evercore, you may go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question and a follow-up. Just when I think about your guide and the gross margin drop of 150 basis points, I'm curious would you attribute the entire drop due to supply chain issues or is there anything else at play as well? That's one. And then second question was really hoping you could unpack the Service Provider growth which sort of accelerated a fair amount as we just talk about the trends you're seeing in the traditional Service Provider versus the Webscale business and where that acceleration is coming from would be helpful. Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Scott, you want to take the gross margin? Scott Herren : Yes, I will. It is driven by supply chain and it comes in a couple of flavors. Having done the work that we've done to protect shipment to our customers, there are unit price increases, unit cost increases on certain components that's built into it. There's also increased expedite fees, again to ensure that we get the components in and we can get the product back out the door and a slight increase in freight. So it really is all tied to supply chain. Chuck Robbins : And then, Amit, on the Service Provider growth, I'm glad you asked the question because I should have pointed it out. We saw double-digit growth across all of the sub-segments of Service Provider, so Cable, Carrier as well as Webscale. So it was very balanced across the three and it's not one segment carrying it, which is why, another reason that we're optimistic. The demand side we saw was so consistent across all our customers and so consistent across geographies and so consistent across the product portfolio, but in the ESP space it was double-digit across all of those segments. Marilyn Mora : Next question, please? Operator : Simon Leopold from Raymond James, you may go ahead. Simon Leopold : Sorry about that. Can you hear me now? Chuck Robbins : Yes, we can. Simon Leopold : My AirPods decided they wanted to stop working. Sorry about that. So, I was looking to see if maybe you could help bridge the gross margin headwinds in terms of the supply chain in that we know there are multiple aspects. It's not just the chip shortages, but things like air freight and then having to add maybe extra hours and paying overtime when things come later because of the shortages. So if there was some way to maybe bridge the components that would help us understand how the recovery might manifest itself. Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Yes, Simon. When your AirPods went out, Amit was on the same wavelength as you and asked the exact same question. So I'll give the same answer. It really is kind of two or three aspects that are driving it, all related to supply chain. Unit costs are up and that's based on the work that our supply chain team has dong to ensure that we get supply and so that such we can deliver for our customers the gear they need to get from us. They've all got significant transformation underway as well within their shops to support the new hybrid work environment, and so we're working as hard as we can to make sure we can deliver the product to them. But unit costs are slightly higher and that's semis, that's memory and it's certain other smaller commodities across the board. The second is, freight costs are higher, and as freight costs go up, obviously that hits gross margin. And then finally, expedite fees as we're getting product in the door. So, it's all tied to various elements of supply chain. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Simon. Simon Leopold : Appreciate it. Sorry you had to repeat yourself. Chuck Robbins : No problem, that's okay. That's all right. Marilyn Mora : All right. Michelle, queue us up with the next question. Operator : Thank you. Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research, you may go ahead. Pierre Ferragu : Hey, guys, thank you for taking my question. I have two. A quick follow-up after that, if I may. The first one, so if I look at your software revenue sequentially, it went from $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion. So that's rounded number, but it suggests you have like a kind of mid-single-digit sequential growth in software, which is very exciting. Is that the kind of right run-rate level of growth we should expect for your software business? And then, Scott, just to confirm, given that move in mix, in revenue mix and product offering, in a situation in which the supply chain were not disrupted, we could have expected some tiny sequential improvement in gross margins, right? Scott Herren : Yes, that's right. Mix is definitely, as we continue to add more recurring revenue particularly around software, as you pointed out, but also our tech support services, those are higher gross margins. Those long term will be a tailwind to our gross margins. The supply chain issues obviously more than offset that. In terms of your question on software growth, the numbers that you're using are a little bit rounded, but you're on the right tread. We're seeing nice growth in software and in fact, mentioned that 81% now of that is driven by subscription and recurring revenue, so a 7-point improvement in the amount of that software revenue that's recurring. That is great news longer-term as you know, with recurring revenue particularly when it's ratable you see less of the impact upfront. So there's a bit of a bow wave, and you see it in the growth of our RPOs and the growth of our deferred revenue on product so each of those are growing. That's also a sign of the growth within our software product set. When you just do the quick math, right, we're now one of the biggest software companies in the world, right, north of $14 billion in software revenue. And I don't think anyone thinks of Cisco in those terms. Pierre Ferragu : Thanks. And a quick follow-up for you, Chuck, if I may. You have in your press release you're talking about the next uptake of your subscription base offering. So could you give us a sense of it almost sounds like you feel you are on an inflection point or on a turning point on that front. Are you expanding your portfolio in terms of software like subscription base offering at the moment? Or are you expecting the uptake of these products to reaccelerate on the back of the pandemic? What did you mean exactly? Chuck Robbins : Yes, so, Pierre, I think there's a couple things going on. Number one we have seen just over the last few years continued acceleration in our software business. Every acquisition we do, that's the business model. So from that perspective it comes in. From an organic perspective, we're building more software assets. We're delivering more Software Solutions. And then we're actually looking now, we announced Cisco Plus at Cisco Live, which is how do we deliver virtually anything we build as a service should our customers want to consume it that way. So we're just embarking on that, which is another big part of our portfolio, which will create more recurring revenue for the future, so that's what I'm talking about. Pierre Ferragu : Okay, that makes sense. Thank you very much. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Pierre. Next question? Operator : Paul Silverstein from Cowen, you may go ahead. Paul Silverstein : Appreciate you taking the questions. Two quick questions. One, Chuck, I think it's been a long time since you all have disclosed what the size of your various customer segments and given the impact or what I would expect would be the impact of U.S. Federal stimulus, what's going on Service Provider, Enterprise, the different trends, can update us on how big those sectors are including U.S. Federal? And then the other question would be your Services business. You had a great quarter. It was extremely strong, up 8%. Is that -- is there a one-off in that or is that indicative up from what it had been low single-digit growth? It was a very prominent number. Any insight you can share on what we should expect going forward and what's driving it? Chuck Robbins : Yes, Paul, I don't have the percentage. We haven't given that information out on the percentage of segments for a while. I would say if we could couch that until perhaps September when we do our Analyst Meeting unless you have. Scott Herren : No, the only thing I would add is when you compare us to some of our peers where we break out Enterprise versus Commercial many of them combine those two together. Chuck Robbins : Most of them do. Scott Herren : Yes. So just bear that in mind as you're trying to compare us across the board. Paul Silverstein : Scott, I am aware, but if I may, obviously, with the magnitude of the U.S. Federal stimulus that's already been passed and the various additional progress that's been proposed, not only will that impact the public sector but it also would impact Enterprise, not just for you but for a lot of folks. It would be great if you updated us at some point with those numbers. Scott Herren : Yes, that makes sense. I get it. Chuck Robbins : And what was the second question, Paul? Marilyn Mora : The services growth. Chuck Robbins : Oh, the services growth. Paul Silverstein : The services growth; what's driving it? Is it an anomaly? Is it the new norm? Chuck Robbins : Overall, obviously quite pleased with the progress on our services business. There is in Q3 though, remember there was an extra week. And so it's a lot of services, a lot of that is ratable. That extra week turns into an extra week of revenue during the quarter so there is a one-off anomaly that's driving that outsized growth in Q3. Scott Herren : Yes. And then, once you normalize that out, you should think about the same normal rates you've been seeing. Paul Silverstein : All right, I appreciate it. Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Thanks. Marilyn Mora : Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. Tim Long from Barclays, you may go ahead. Tim Long : Thank you. Two questions for me too, both on gross margins. Actually I'm just kidding. First one here. Can you just talk a little bit about kind of your visibility? So some of your peer companies and others in the industry, given what's gone on with lead times, you obviously have a revenue and a cost impact here. But what has that done to kind of how far out you can see and plan and kind of the whole backlog versus book and ship for the business for the next few quarters? And then, second, if you could just touch on the Cloud vertical. It sounded like it was pretty strong again. Could you just give us a little color of kind of what is driving that? I think there had been some campus strength with those customers, but can you talk to us a little bit about the breadth of product that's driving that? Is it a lot of 8-K, are you starting to see software and silicon starting to contribute a little bit? So any color there would be great. Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Yes, Tim. Thanks. I'll make one quick comment on the visibility thing, and then I'll let Scott comment and then I'll take the Cloud one. I would say that the thing that I will tell you is we're in the middle of Q3, I can tell you our supply chain team was a little, I guess, concerned about what they could see for the next two months at that time. And when we started building the guide and working through what we thought they could deliver and build in Q4, they had a reasonable degree of confidence. So what that says to me is they're getting better visibility. And so I think it's just going to improve from here. So that's what we've been dealing with the last couple months Scott, you want to add anything? Scott Herren : Yes. From a reported revenue standpoint, which I think is probably at least part of your question, Tim, we've got good visibility at this point, given the size of our backlog that we roll into Q4 with, as well as the amount of revenue that's now occurring that will come off the balance sheet. So you add those two together and then look at the -- we have a good feel obviously for what's in the pipeline at this point too. We have pretty good visibility at this point. Chuck Robbins : And then, on the Cloud vertical; I would say that one of the customers we have had a very strong sort of Enterprise Networking portfolio relationship with, but beyond that, all of it is really being driven by infrastructure going into their Cloud assets. And so we have sold significant amounts of 8-Ks into that infrastructure, but we have sold silicon, stand-alone as well. We have our software running on one of their pieces of hardware, and in some case, we have their software running on our switching hardware. And we're working on White Box ODM with a couple of them relative to our silicon. So, we have all the variations that we announced in December of 2019 we're actively involved in right now; and the good news is there's a lot of Systems desire as well. Tim Long : Okay, thank you. Chuck Robbins : Just as an add-on to that, last time, we talked about 400 gig, and there always seems to be a question about 400 gig. And our customer count on 400 gig went up by 50% during the quarter. So we did see a continued uptake on that technology, and that's super early, as you know. Tim Long : Great, thank you. Marilyn Mora : Next question, please? Operator : Jim Suva from Citigroup Investment Research, you may go ahead. James Suva : Thank you so much for all the details and clarification. I just had one question. Can you give us some commentary on your hyperscale traction? It appears Service Provider's bouncing back pretty strong. And for a while it seemed like the hyperscale wasn't quite as strong as you'd hoped and you were putting more efforts into it and it seems like now your commentary is quite a bit more positive. Is that some new product wins, some share gains, permanency and traction of it? But any commentary on that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Yes, Jim. So we've had six consecutive quarters of very strong double-digit growth, ranging from mid-teens to triple-digits. And so that's in the Webscale vertical, and it certainly has been share gains because we didn't have any presence before. So as I've joked on calls before, it's one of the few markets where we actually have the opportunity to go gain share, and so that's been positive. We've worked hard on these relationships, and so that has expanded. We had a two-day customer briefing with one of them two weeks ago and it was, that particular briefing was all about our Enterprise portfolio. So we're seeing both sides but we are definitely seeing success that I just mentioned with Tim's question around the Cloud vertical in the Cloud infrastructure. James Suva : Thank you so much. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Jim. And we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Jeff Kvaal from Wolfe Research, you may go ahead sir. Jeff Kvaal : Thank you. It was nicely said. My question is actually on the margin side. It sounds as though you are getting better visibility on the component availability. So I guess I'm wondering should we be expecting that the margin headwind would abate through the year? And then as part of that, has anything changed in terms of what you expect to happen to the margin structure over time as we get past these constraints? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Yes, Jeff. As we've talked about earlier, I think some of the supply chain issues we have that we're seeing certainly from a supply standpoint are going to be with us through the end of the calendar year. But there's no question we've also got some good tailwinds in the gross margin line. When you think of the amount of -- the faster growth rate of services and the ratability of that, which contributes significantly now to the revenue line, that's at a higher margin than our software business, which year-on-year grew at 13% and is now on a run-rate of about a $14 billion per year software business. That obviously comes at a higher margin too. So while we do have supply chain headwinds, we've also got some nice tailwinds that are coming in. Scott Herren : Okay. And then, the concept is that once we get past these fairly ephemeral, in the grand scheme of things, supply challenges, then we should expect the gross margins to reflect the mix shift software and drift higher. That's the right way to think about it. Jeff Kvaal : Yes. Okay, excellent. And then, I'm sorry, did you give us a number on how much you might have shipped had you not had supply chain constraints? Chuck Robbins : Yes. We talked about that in the last day or so. And it's really difficult to get a number. I'd say it'd been a point or two, I mean particularly in the guide front, I think it's a reasonable thing to think about. I mean, our guys were stressed, and in Q4, they have very little, they're committed to what they think they can build, but it's tough. It's tough right now. So you can extrapolate with the growth rate we saw on the product side and then with the corresponding guide that our backlog is certainly increasing, so if we had the capacity to ship, we would but we just don't have it. All right, let me just wrap up by first and foremost thanking all of you for spending time with us today, and, despite the predominant discussion point here, which has been around gross margins relative to the supply chain, I hope our confidence came across and that we feel really good about the portfolio. We feel really good about the reopening. We feel good about our teams, I'm really proud of what they've accomplished. Look, I'm really pleased that our customers are choosing to spend their dollars with us, as they come back. I think that's a great statement of confidence, and I think that it also proves that we are going to be critical to the rebound and the recovery and the return to office. So, thanks for being with us, and we look forward to spending time with you all. And I'm going to kick it back to Marilyn. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Chuck.

Chuck Robbins : Thank you, Marilyn. And good afternoon, everyone. I hope you're all remaining healthy and staying safe. Our team at Cisco ended fiscal 2021 with an incredibly strong finish. We had an outstanding Q4 performance and fiscal year revenue reflecting strength across our portfolio, customer segments, and geographies. Our product order growth was the highest we've seen in over a decade and we're continuing to see strong customer reception to the accelerated investments in software and subscriptions. This great momentum is reaffirming our position as the worldwide leader in technology that powers the internet and a digital enterprise.  As I think about our achievements over the past year, three things stand out to me : First, the exceptional execution of our teams. We achieved these results through the extraordinary efforts of our leadership team, our partners, and most importantly, our people around the world, who operated with incredible speed and at an unprecedented scale to deliver this growth. Second, our transformation and strategic investments are paying off. The benefits of our shift to software and subscriptions are clear and they are helping both Cisco and our customers move with greater speed and agility. And third, the power of our portfolio. The groundbreaking innovation we are investing in today will serve as the foundation for our customers' futures. These three factors position us exceptionally well for growth as we enter our next fiscal year, as evidenced by our results this quarter. We're more confident than ever that we are in a strong position to help our customers be successful. As we look forward, we are laser-focused on providing our customers the technologies they will need to successfully navigate highly dynamic environments at an incredibly rapid pace. With the rise of COVID variance and the inconsistent pace of vaccine deployment around the globe, organizations must be resilient and adaptable as we've seen how quickly the world around us can change. While this may impact certain short-term plans, like a return to the office for many, one thing is clear, there's tremendous demand for Cisco's technology. No matter how or when the global recovery takes shape, we are executing on our vision of rebuilding a better world, one that is digital, sustainable, inclusive, and highly secure. I believe we're at a pivotal moment in our Company's history as we have a massive opportunity to transform what has been the traditional office and define the future of hybrid work. As our customers look to create safer hybrid workplaces, as well as collaborative, and engaging experiences for their customers and employees, we believe they are becoming increasingly reliant on Cisco technologies to help them with their transformation and resiliency.  Enterprises are increasingly seeking digital and cloud-enabled services, which is driving demand for our solutions and leading to new and expansive market opportunities for Cisco. We're in a unique leadership position to build and deliver innovative cloud-to-edge infrastructure platforms that our customers need. With the depth and breadth of our hardware, software, silicon, and optics solutions, we are helping companies solve their biggest challenges. Whether it's adopting modern application architectures, shifting to hybrid work and hybrid cloud, securing their enterprise, or meeting their ESG goals, Cisco is helping our customers thrive in a hybrid world. These industry dynamics helped drive our strong fourth-quarter performance.  The momentum we saw in Q3 accelerated through Q4 as we delivered robust revenue growth, increased earnings, strong margins, and record operating cash flow. We also generated strong double-digit growth in product deferred revenue, reflecting the success of our transformation around driving subscriptions and recurring revenues which increases our visibility into future performance. We're seeing IT budgets grow as companies begin to implement their critical future plans and business confidence increases.  However, we do recognize that uncertainty remains around COVID-19, and we're closely monitoring the delta variant and its impact on customer spending. Right now, we are not seeing any additional impact on our business, aside from the components shortage we've been facing over the past several months. Moving to the performance of our customer segments. As I mentioned, we delivered the highest product order growth in over a decade with a growth of 31% driven by strength across all of our end markets. This outstanding performance is also up over 17% from our pre-COVID Q4 levels in the Fiscal year 2019. We saw double-digit growth in every one of our customer segments. This strength is being driven by stronger customer investment in substantial network upgrades to help modernize and secure their environment to support the new way of working. Specifically, in our enterprise business, we had the best quarter in terms of product orders in over a decade and saw a very strong order growth of 25%. We also had our third consecutive quarter of acceleration in our commercial Service Provider and public sector businesses, with all of these segments showing growth in excess of 20%. In our web-scale business, we saw increased momentum delivering record performance with over 160% order growth. And on a trailing four-quarter basis, orders grew over 80% due to customers adopting products across the portfolio and early traction of our 400-gig Solutions, a huge testament to the investments we have made in accelerating innovation and the differentiated value we're bringing to these customers from a product portfolio perspective, we also had a very balanced performance. As customers prepare for office re-openings and hybrid work, they are increasing their investment across our networking, Cloud Security, and Unified Communications portfolios.  In Q4, we saw double-digit revenue growth in campus switching, Catalyst 9000, high-end routing, wireless, and in our Zero Trust solutions, along with strength in our security endpoint portfolio. We also had a very strong adoption of our Acacia optical solutions driven by increasing customer demand for leading-edge technology to address their growing bandwidth requirements. The transformation of our business to more software and subscriptions continues to show tremendous progress, as we achieved over $4 billion in software revenue in Q4, an increase of 7% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year.  Within that, subscription revenue grew 9% in Q4 and 15% for the full fiscal year. For perspective, Software represented 31% of our business in Q4. And for the full year, when combined with our services business, they represent over 53% of revenue, clearly highlighting the success of our continued business transformation. In addition to delivering strong financial results, our innovation engine continues to accelerate. Over the last year, we introduced an impressive number of new capabilities across our entire portfolio, while also doubling down on more flexible consumption models, including our core networking capabilities as a service highlighted by the recent launch of Cisco Plus.  Our new Cisco Plus solutions deliver cross-portfolio technologies to help solve our customers' biggest needs with faster time-to-value network-as-a-service as-a-service offerings that deliver hybrid cloud technologies and will later expand to a broader catalog of services built and delivered with our partner ecosystem. Cisco Plus improved speed, agility, and scale with on-demand solutions that intelligently adapt to our customers' business needs. While still early days in its launch, Cisco Plus directly aligns with our transformation goals around driving more subscription-based recurring revenue via the cloud.  Our unique strengths improvement strategy gives us the confidence to move at a more accelerated pace. You will see us continue to invest in our key growth areas in technology shifts like hybrid cloud, hybrid work, 5G, Wi-Fi 6, Edge, security, and cloud-native architectures to extend our technology leadership positions. You will also see us deliver even more strategic offers to enable our customers to thrive in a Cloud-first digital world. These include full-stack observability to improve their digital experiences by providing visibility and insights across their entire technology stack and Secure Access Service Edge or SASE, designed to enable seamless secure access to applications anywhere their users work.  Given the momentum we're seeing in our business, we have more conviction than ever that we are investing in the right areas and will continue to extend our competitive advantages and drive growth. Before I turn it over to Scott for more details on the quarter and our expectations for the next Fiscal year, let me give you an update on the supply environment. While we're seeing increasing demand for our technology, we're also continuing to manage through the component shortage challenges that nearly every Company is experiencing our world-class supply chain team, as always, is doing an incredible job navigating this complex situation by working with our global suppliers to meet customer demand as quickly as possible.  Looking ahead, we expect the supply challenges and cost impacts to continue through at least the first half of our fiscal year and potentially into the second half. In summary, demand for our technology is very strong and our strategy is more relevant than ever. This allows us to deliver greater value to our customers, partners, and communities as we all adapt to new ways of living and working. I am very encouraged by the recovery trajectory across the board and with our momentum. I am confident in our strategy and investments. I feel great about the innovation we're driving in our portfolio, and I'm incredibly proud of what our teams and partners have achieved.  I look forward to building on these insights with a more comprehensive, deep dive on our multiyear vision and strategic growth drivers at our virtual Investor Day on September 15th and I hope you'll join us. Thank you again for your time. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for additional detail. Scott Herren : Thanks, Chuck. Our fourth quarter reflects a strong close to our fiscal year with significant momentum across our business. We saw robust customer demand, demonstrating the third consecutive increase in product order growth and solid execution by our teams. I'll provide some detail on our financial results for the quarter, then cover the full fiscal year, followed by our guidance. Q4 was a very strong quarter and a very dynamic environment. We executed exceptionally well, with greater than 30% product order growth year on year, and more than 17% order growth versus our pre-COVID Q4 fiscal 19 product bookings, driven by strength across our portfolio.  In fact, it was the strongest product order growth rate in over a decade. We also had strong results across revenue, net income, earnings per share, and as Chuck said earlier, record operating cash flows. Total revenue increased to 13.1 billion, up 8% year-over-year, coming in at the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. We saw strength in a number of product areas and across all geographies. Our business continues to recover well and build momentum with sequential revenue growth of 3%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.5%, up 50 basis points. Non-GAAP net income was 3.6 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.84. Both up 5% year-over-year and exceeding the high-end of our guidance range.  Now let me turn to provide more detail on our Q4 revenue. Total product revenue was 9.7 billion, up 10%. Service revenue was 3.4 billion, up 3%. infrastructure platforms performed very well with revenues up 13%. All businesses saw double-digit growth with the exception of the Data Center. Switching had strong growth driven by a double-digit increase in Campus Switching, led by our Catalyst 9K and Meraki Switching offerings. We also had solid growth in our Data Center Switching portfolio with the Nexus 9000 products. Routing grew driven by both the Service Provider and Enterprise markets as we saw strong adoption across our portfolio, including a robust uptake of our Cisco 8000 platform.  Wireless had a strong growth driven by the continued ramp of our WIFI 6 products and our Meraki wireless offerings. Data Center revenue declined driven primarily by servers as we expended -- experienced continued market contraction. Applications were down 1% driven by a slight decline in our collaboration portfolio. However, recurring subscription revenue within our WebEx suite grew 9% in Q4. We also saw solid growth in IoT software, AppDynamics, Cloud Contact Center, and our Cloud Calling platforms.  Security was up 1%. Our Cloud security and Zero Trust portfolios performed well with greater than 20% growth as we had continued momentum in our Duo and Umbrella offerings. Our Security recurring subscription revenue grew 13% in Q4 and 18% for the full fiscal year. In both applications and security, we're seeing strong revenue growth in the strategic areas that we and our customers are investing in. We continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving growth in subscriptions and recurring revenue. Software revenue was 4 billion, an increase of 6%, subscriptions were 81% of total software revenue up 3 points year-over-year. Software subscription revenue grew 9% in Q4 and 15% for the full Fiscal year.  As we continue to increase our software subscriptions, we're driving higher levels of recurring revenue. Additionally, the strength of our portfolio and transition to more software and services is driving growth in remaining performance obligations or RPO. At the end of Q4, RPO crossed the 30 billion marks at 30.9 billion up 9%. RPO for the product was up 18% and service was up 3%. Approximately 53% of the total RPO is short-term, meaning it will be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. As I mentioned, we had exceptionally strong order momentum in Q4 as total product orders were up 31% with strength across the business. Looking at our geographies, the Americas was up 34%, EMEA was up 24%, and APJC was up 29%. Total emerging markets were up 25% with the BRICs plus Mexico up 37%. In our customer segments, the commercial was up 41%, the service provider was up 40%, enterprise returned to growth, it was up 25% while the public sector was up 22%. Non-GAAP total gross margins came in at 65.6% up 60 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 65% up 180 basis points and Services gross margin was 67.4%, down 240 basis points, which was in line with our expectations as we do see variability from quarter to quarter. The increase in product gross margin was driven by productivity improvements from lower freight and other costs, partially offset by relatively modest price erosion.  As we discussed last quarter, we continue to manage through the supply chain constraints scene industry-wide due to component shortages. We've closely partnered with our key suppliers, leveraging our volume purchasing and extended supply commitments as we address the supply challenges and cost impacts, which we expect will continue at least through the first half of our fiscal year, and potentially into the second half. Our number one rank global supply chain team continues to perform at a world-class level. When you look at the impact of acquisitions on our Q4 results year-over-year, there was a positive 210 basis point impact on revenue and no material impact on our non-GAAP earnings per share. From a cash perspective, operating cash flow for the quarter was a record 4.5 billion up 18% year-over-year, driven by strong cash collections. We ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of 24.5 billion up approximately $900 million sequentially. In terms of capital allocation, we returned 2.4 billion to shareholders during the quarter. That was comprised of 1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and 791 million of share repurchases. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q4, we closed 5 acquisitions : Kenna Security, Socio Labs, Slido, Sedona Systems, and Involvio. These investments are consistent with our strategy of complementing our internal innovation and R&D with targeted M&A to allow us to further strengthen and differentiate our market position in our key growth areas. Turning to the full fiscal year results, overall, our financial results were solid in a very challenging global pandemic environment with strong operational execution. Revenue was 49.8 billion, up 1%. The total non-GAAP gross margin was 66.1%, up 10 basis points. And our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.5%, down 30 basis points. From a bottom-line perspective, our non-GAAP net income was flat at 13.6 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.22.  We delivered an operating cash flow of 15.5 billion, flat compared to fiscal '20. From a cap allocation perspective, we returned 9.1 billion in value to shareholders over the fiscal year, which represents 61% of our free cash flow. That was comprised of 6.2 billion in quarterly cash dividends and 2.9 billion of share repurchases. We also increased our dividend for the 10th consecutive year in fiscal 2021, reinforcing our commitment to return capital to our shareholders, and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. We remain firmly committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet to fuel our organic and inorganic growth initiatives, as well as continuing our cap allocation strategy of returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders annually.  To summarize, we had a great Q4 and a solid fiscal year, with strong operational execution. We're seeing returns on the investments we're making in innovation, and driving the continued shift to more software and subscriptions, driving more recurring revenue, delivering growth, and driving shareholder value. Now let me provide forward-looking guidance. We're pleased to initiate the additional practice of providing an annual outlook to complement our regular quarterly look ahead for the fiscal year 2022. The successful transformation we've been executing around driving a higher proportion of our revenues from subscriptions, recurring and deferred revenue, is affording us additional visibility into our outlook for future growth. Please note our guidance is subject to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier.  Our financial guidance for Q1 is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 7.5% to 9.5% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5%, reflecting the continuing increase in supply chain costs we are incurring as we protect shipments to our customers. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 31.5% to 32.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to range from $0.79 to $0.81. Our financial guidance for the full-year fiscal '22 is as follows.  We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 5% to 7% year-on-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to range from $3.38 to $3.45, also up 5% to 7% year-over-year. In both our Q1 and full-year outlook, we are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. Looking ahead, we're excited to host a Cisco virtual Investor Day on Wednesday, September 15th, 2021, which we will webcast live, and hope you can join us. I will now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Scott. Michelle, let's go ahead and queue up the Q&A line. Operator : Thank you. Samik Chatterjee from JP Morgan, you may go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Chuck, Scott, just wanted to get your thoughts on getting -- in terms of the timing of getting a full-year guide out here. I would think other companies would have said, with the supply chain uncertainty, \"This is probably not the right time to get a full-year guide out,\" so definitely appreciate the full-year guide. And I wanted to understand, what's providing that higher visibility? You mentioned the transformation, but also how are the orders feeding into that visibility, and what are you kind of baking in terms of the supply chain in that full-year guide? Overall, how much of -- what you're baking in terms of headwinds into that full-year guide from a supply chain perspective. Thank you. Scott Herren : Yeah, that's a great question, Samik. Thanks for that. It really is one of the benefits of the transformation we're making. As we move to more and more software and services and a recurring revenue base, we have greater visibility.  One of the stats that we just talked about is our remaining performance obligations of 30.9 billion of which 53% that will turn into revenue in the next 12 months. We also have a good feel for what other renewals are going to come up and what our renewal rate is as we work our way through this. So, we have a pretty good sense of a big chunk of our revenue and how it's going to grow. We also have a good view of pipeline and what that looks like ahead, and one of the things that I would say about that pipeline is it's one of the -- we've seen year-over-year growth in the pipeline for Q1 better than we've ever seen in the last several years.  So, we see good growth in the pipeline as well. So, it's when you add all that up, that's what gives us the confidence to give a full-year guide. What I would say is that -- to your question about supply chain and what's the assumption on supply chain, the way to think about that as that's the difference between the high-end and the low-end of the guide. We expect the supply chain to impact us through the first half of the year.  And then at the low-end of the guide, we think we continue to have supply-chain impacts through most of the second half as well, with some clear up at the end. At the high-end of the guide, we think that we've begun to clear up the supply chain issues, supply and demand come back more into balance earlier in the second half. That's why we gave the full-year guide. I think -- certainly, we have the confidence with the visibility we have, and what's baked into that based on some of the uncertainty. It's still out there with the supply chain. Samik Chatterjee : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Samik. We'll take the next question, please. Operator : Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley Investment Research, you may go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. Maybe coupling onto that question, just how should we think about kind of the incremental 150 basis point sequential gross margin decline in the guidance and just how much of that is incremental supply chain impact, and would you expect to abate that through either price changes or supply chain improvement to improve that throughout the year? Thanks. Scott Herren : Yeah. Thanks, Meta, for that. When you look at the Q4 gross margin, obviously it came in better than what we had expected and what we had guided to, and there was a really favorable product mix built into that, some of that being driven by a good quarter for software as you heard on the call earlier.  Looking ahead, we've taken several steps to ensure that we can continue to have supply and deliver products to our customers. They are in the midst of their own transformations, they're all in the midst of doing the things they have to do to adapt to a world that's not only a hybrid work world but one, with the rise of the delta variant, that -- it's added Scott Herren : complexity. It's not a, \"Hey, the world's going to go back to normal at some point.\" It's, \"I need to continue to have this flexibility ahead.\" We're trying to support that and at the same time, there are supply and demand imbalances and some of the key components around semiconductors and memory and some of the same things you hear from others of our peers.  That turns into higher component costs as we buy from those suppliers. We're also to ensure even greater supply going to brokers to get additional supply from versus what we can get directly from our suppliers. And in some cases, qualifying second sources where we have to. Each of those, obviously, drives costs and it takes a while for those costs -- We've been in that process through Q4, and we'll be in it through Q1.  It takes a while for those costs to flow through our standard costing system and show up in the cost of goods sold. There's a little bit of unfavorable product mix headwind as well in Q1 as we have a good sense of the products that don't have those same impacts that we will be able to ship, that are sitting in backlog, so that's what's driving that sequential change. As you know, we did put in place a price increase; very selective, very targeted, only on the products where we were seeing the higher component costs. That went into effect August 7th, but we always honor quotes that are out there for 30 days, beyond that price because it goes -- maybe those quotes were produced before the price increase was put in.  So, scroll 30 days ahead from August 7th before the first orders come in with those higher prices, and then it takes a while for those orders to come in, get built, and shipped back out to customers and for us to realize the benefit of that on the top line. Think of those price increases as being something that we'll feel more of the benefit of in Q2 and Q3 versus what we see in Q1. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. Marilyn Mora : Thank you. Next question, please? Operator : Paul Silverstein from Cowen, you may go ahead. Paul Silverstein : I appreciate Scott's pick-up on the previous two questions. If I look at your annual guidance, it's strong revenue, it's almost a billion above the consensus number. The EPS is more in line, it's slightly light but not meaningfully.  But the difference obviously is gross margin and or OpEx. I appreciate that COVID has elevated your cost structure, as well as all of your peers. Can you give us any granular insight in terms of translating the revenue upside that you're looking at that you're expecting relatively to the more modest EPS outlook for the year in terms of gross margin versus OpEx? Scott Herren : Yes. Paul, it really is gross margin driven. And there's still -- there continues to be uncertainty on when the supply and demand get back into balance on many of those components. That's why you see the range that we put out there at 5% to 7%, and that ripples through to the bottom line as well.  I think that the only other comment I'd add on that front, I don't want to get into parsing it down to the various elements, at least at this point, but there's still uncertainty, and given that uncertainty, and this being the first time we've given you annual guide, it's prudent. We're trying to be prudent with the guide we've put out there as well. Paul Silverstein : Scott, with respect to OPEX. It is your plan to grow OpEx more modestly than revenue? You're going to -- you're looking at some pretty healthy revenue growth this year. Would you restrain your Opex growth below revenue to try to drive some leverage? Scott Herren : Yeah. I'll start, and Chuck, you may want to add to this. The way that you see the guidance laid out, 5% to 7% growth on the top line and 5% to 7% growth on the bottom line, we are looking at balanced, profitable growth, and I think that's the way you should expect us to run the business going forward, is balanced profitable growth.  5% to 7% on both the top and bottom line is a pretty strong performance, certainly relative to where we've been over the last few years. And so again, I don't want to get into -- Paul, I know what you're poking at. I really don't want to get into parsing down the elements of that, but the core principle is balanced profitable growth. Chuck Robbins : Paul -- Paul Silverstein : Can I ask -- Chuck Robbins : Go ahead, Paul. Go ahead. Paul Silverstein : Just one last question on this. Is there any reason why your cost structure from a gross margin perspective -- we envision going back to the 21st Century and getting beyond COVID? Is there any reason why your gross margin structure would not go back to where it was if not better, I recognize you've got mixed in other factors that influence one way or the other from quarter to quarter, but as a general proposition, should we expect the gross margin structure will return to what it was pre-COVID? Scott Herren : That is our expectation, Paul. Over time, I mean, again, I don't want to predict that for this fiscal year, just given some of the uncertainties in the supply chain, but it is our expectation that it gets back there and over the longer term as we continue to build a bigger mix of software into our revenue stream, that should also provide a bit of a tailwind to our margins. Paul Silverstein : I appreciate it. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Paul. Michelle, next question. Operator : Aaron Breakers from Wells Fargo. You may go ahead. Aaron Breakers : Yes. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on a good quarter. I wanted to ask the supply chain question a little bit differently. As you see the order momentum in the pipeline build commentary that you laid out, obviously, is quite positive. How are you assessing the perishability of demand? Are you seeing any signs where customers might be double ordering, or how do you just think about that in the function of the guidance that you've laid out? Chuck Robbins : Aaron, this is Chuck Thank you for that. Look, we expected to be asked about pull-ahead. I think there's a couple of things that I would say, we obviously can't calculate that directly.  We've looked at several indicators; our pipeline analysis, channel orderings, our salesforce opportunity movement, order cancellation rates, future pipeline build, and we don't see any signs of ordering well ahead of needs other than lining up with what our lead times are. And we have customers that are large carriers, large telcos, Cloud players, who have 12, 18, to 24-month capacity plans.  And so, they look at our lead times and they are going to order into that based on what they have, but we would not say there was a significant amount of pull ahead of other than dealing with the lead times.  The other thing that I would just highlight is that Scott pointed out earlier, after the real strong order growth we saw in Q4, we're sitting with the best start from a forecast pipeline perspective that we've had in several years. That would lead us to believe that this is a trend that we should see to continue for a little while. Aaron Breakers : Great, thank you. Marilyn Mora : All right, great. Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. Tim Long from Barclays, you may go ahead. Tim Long : Thank you. Could you just dig into the software angle a little bit? Numbers seem pretty strong, yet the applications and security lines trail a little bit on the product side. So, could you just parse that through for us? And then, second, just did want to follow up on that cloud piece that was so strong in the quarter. Chuck, any other color you can give on that? It sounded pretty broad-based, but I'm assuming some of your peers also, to the last question, saw a little bit more advanced, longer lead time orders, or is there anything else in that huge cloud number? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Tim. So, on the Applications front, we expected that you guys might want to ask about that and there's a couple of things to keep in mind in both Applications and Security. The order rates were certainly higher than the revenue rates, so that's the first thing I would tell you. The recurring subscription portions within each of those businesses were also very positive. As Scott said, in Security within Web -- I mean, in collaboration within the applications WebEx suite, the recurring subscriptions within WebEx suite revenue was up 9% in Q4, 16% for the year. We had solid growth in IoT, [Indiscernible] Cloud Contact Center, and Cloud Calling.  What's also in there, if you will recall, is there are phones and handsets, and there's some on-prem software that's associated with collaboration. And some of those were impacted by the supply chain. But the future growth areas actually for us looked really good. On the security front, Cloud Security, Zero Trust over 20%. The Security recurring subscription revenue was up 13% in Q4, up 18% for the year so that was solid as well.  And again, our Next-Generation Firewall demand was really good but some of the legacy products in the supply chain created a little bit of a revenue headwind there. But again, orders were stronger than the revenues. We would expect those to normalize over the next few quarters. As we get to Web scale, this is I have to tell you that preparing for this call, I reflected over the last 5, 6 years of having this discussion.  And I always said that we would start talking about web-scale when it was meaningful, and I guess I can now declare it meaningful. We made multi-year investments building the Cisco 8000 with new silicon, optics, and software, and we had phenomenal growth. And it was a 160% order growth this quarter, over almost 30% order growth a year ago in the same quarter. And the customers are really adopting our entire portfolio, including the enterprise side, but over half of that business landed in their cloud infrastructure.  We also see 400G taking off, really, in a meaningful way, I'll give you a couple of stats on that because someone's probably going to ask it. In Q4, 400G ports, our orders were up 668%, and for the year, 400G port orders were up 831%. We have over 400 customers that have deployed and we've taken orders for almost 180,000 ports total. So, it's really moving forward, and I think those are the things that -- we won several franchises in the cloud Web scale space, we continue to do proof of concepts, we're in validation and certification stages in others. So, we always said that we missed the first transition with these players and that we wanted to be prepared for this next architectural transition and I think our teams have done a great job putting us in a good position. Tim Long : Okay, thank you very much for the color. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Tim. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead, sir. Rod Hall : Great. Thanks for the question. A lot of ports, Chuck. A lot of ports. So, I had two questions for you. One is regarding the order growth. I'm curious about linearity there. That last time we talked, the handle on that was back in 2010 when you guys are exiting the GSD, but it seems like those orders could accelerate from here, and I'm curious whether you think that's a possibility or how probable an acceleration is from that 31% growth rate? And then I wanted to come back to this pricing commentary, and I'm curious what the durability of these prices is. What your intention would be once the component cost, these underlying costs go down, will you flex these prices right back down again or do you expect them to sustain themselves a little bit longer? Just curious what your plan on pricing would be as these underlying costs change. Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Let me start and I'll let Scott comment on the pricing issue as well. You asked a couple of questions there, Rod. On linearity just to give you the quarter, it started hot and ended hot. It was from day one to the end, so this was not like we were 5% growth until the last month, and then it accelerated. It was pretty consistent throughout the entire quarter.  You mentioned the ability to accelerate. I certainly wouldn't expect 31% order growth to be the new standard, but I think that there are certainly going to be -- it just feels like our customers are dealing with -- they're coming out, they're making decisions about modernizing their infrastructure, and their technology assets to deal with this new hybrid work.  And I think now what they're seeing is, that with the Delta variant, they're understanding that this may not be a one -- this may not be one move back to the office. This is going to -- they have to -- they're going to have to be resilient, they're going to have to build adaptability in for future because we could have the next variant six months from now.  And I think that's what customers are thinking through right now. The comment I'd make on pricing and then I'll let Scott talk about the durability of them is, one thing that as we talk about gross margin in the quarter we just finished, the pricing element of gross margin was actually at the very low end of our normal range, which means we're holding pricing with our sales teams, which is a good sign right now. So once these things start flowing through, if that trend continues, then we would certainly see the favorable impact that we expect. Scott? Scott Herren : Yeah, I think that's right. I think, Rod, the other way that I would ask you to think about the price increases we just announced on August 7th, those are really -- they're not motivated by driving top line as much as they're motivated by offsetting some of the cost increases, we're seeing.  Now, there's a lag effect, right? It's going to take time before we see those prices show up actually in our revenue stream, but they are really motivated by that. And so, we'll continue to assess as we always do, if we need to make another price adjustment, up or down. We'll continue to make those assessments going forward.  Don't think about them as being motivated, though, by top-line drivers. It's really motivated by offsetting some of the higher costs that we're seeing. But the other thing I would just close on this one is that we have a price increase methodology that we deploy on a regular basis for different portfolios. We just don't talk about it on our earnings calls every time, but this is a muscle we have that we actually use on a fairly regular basis when the conditions warrant it. Rod Hall : Okay. Great. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead. Sami Badri : Thank you. My first question is on your gross margin s and just the cost of products and the question really is just around how much of these cost inputs can Cisco control versus how many of them are not controllable at all? So that's the first question. And then the second question is, going back to some of your wins with the Series 8000, how much of these wins are completely new deployments versus you going head-to-head with an incumbent or going head-to-head with other competing vendors for those deployments, right? Or existing replacement or new deployments, and that would be great. Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Sure. Sami, I'll start on the cost of goods sold. It's overwhelmingly driven by the component costs and the contract manufacturing costs to do the various levels of assembly inside there versus something that we have the ability to flux -- to flex up or down. I would think of that as being significantly driven by some of the factors that we've talked about with the imbalance of supply and demand.  And Sami, on your second question, it's really difficult to say which ones are new, which ones that we compete with an incumbent. But I will tell you we're in -- we're competing with incumbents on every one of them because even if it's a new architecture they are building, they have incumbents who are certainly competing with us. Chuck Robbins : These are all super competitive and our teams have built some great technology. And so, it's -- and the cloud providers, they like diversity in their supply chain. They like diversity from a supplier perspective, and one other data point I meant to give earlier when Tim asked about the cloud business that we gave on the call last time, I want to make sure we share with you again, Web scale comprised 30% of our Service Provider segment from an orders perspective for the quarter. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks. Chuck, next question? Operator : Simon Leopold from Raymond James, you may go ahead, sir. Simon Leopold : Thank you very much for taking the question. I think you've alluded to 31% order growth not being sustainable. Can you give us some idea of what you see as really the sustainable or more normalized level? And also, if you could comment on your purchase order commitment because I've assumed that the substantial commitments you've made help you lock in and secure pricing when you made those commitments and represents, I guess, a way of controlling the headwind as we think about the full-year model. I want to make sure I'm understanding that correctly. Thank you. Scott Herren : Sure. I'll start on the second part of that and then I'll let Chuck weigh in on the order growth. Clearly, as we locked in some of that -- some of the work that we did on supply and particularly going after components that are particularly at an imbalance between supply and demand, we locked in both. We looked at both for costs that would come in for that and what the committed delivery schedule was on those.  We have a good sense of that for a subset of our components. There's still going to be fluctuation in some areas, memory is a good example, there's going to continue to be fluctuation in pricing and we'll continue to monitor that.  You saw us -- you've seen us in the past, make price adjustments based on memory cost increases, and I would expect that to be kind of an ongoing process there. But for the ones that we locked in, which were the -- I think the ones that are -- that had the greatest imbalance and the highest demand, both for us and for our competitors, we locked in both from that standpoint. Chuck Robbins : Yes. And on the side of the order, that's a difficult question to answer. What I would say is that this is the first time we've given long-range guidance or annual guidance on both revenue and EPS. We have Investor Day coming up on the 15th where we're going to talk about the key growth drivers in our business and we're also going to begin to share new metrics that will give you a flavor of the business in a different way.  So, I think that's what as we spend time on that day, I think the drivers of growth will be clear to you, and I think that bookings will only be one metric that we'll look at, relative to future performance. Simon Leopold : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Next question, please. Operator : Fahad Najam from MKM Partners. You may go ahead, sir. Fahad Najam : Thank you very much for taking my question. In terms of the order strength, do you have any way of parsing out any double ordering or forward pull-in orders from your customers, and have you adjusted for that? And I have a follow-up. Scott Herren : So, Fahad, as I was saying earlier, what we've looked at is, we've compared a lot of the -- our pipeline pulls ahead activity, we've looked at our future pipeline, we looked at order cancellation rates, and we just don't see anything.  So based on what we know now, we certainly think customers are placing orders further in advance because of lead times, which is just logical, but that's basically -- when you see the order growth, we saw in Q4 and then you see the forecast pipeline that we see going forward, it would suggest that there's still a fair amount of demand out there.  Fahad, we're staying on top of that as much as possible as you can imagine, and Chuck talked earlier about some of the data points we're looking at to try to get a feel for it. Order cancellations would be one indication of double ordering from us and another party. Order cancellation rates have actually come down modestly. Return rates, looking at the pipeline and the pipeline growth, we're not seeing it at any material level. I think the other thing, the other data point we gave is the growth of commercial.  So, if you look at the orders, the overall order growth, Commercial is up 41%. And I think where you might expect to see some of what you're talking about is actually in the Enterprise segment or EPS. We saw significant growth in Commercials and I don't think you'd expect to see as much of that kind of a double ordering process happen in that customer size. Fahad Najam : I appreciate that. Chuck, if I could ask you big picture questions. Before COVID-19 happened, I think you had mentioned that for the first time, virtually every product line in Cisco's family of products had been repriced.  To the extent, how much of the strength you're seeing the function of the product refresh cycle that is taking place across all your product lines versus total new growth? For example, like Edge Cloud, which I think is going to be a totally new network of growth architecture that's never been deployed before, so it's like the new phase of growth. How much of the strength you're seeing in the function of this refresh versus a new phase of growth in [Indiscernible]? Chuck Robbins : What I would say is there are several transformations that are occurring or transitions that are occurring across our customer base that we're just well-positioned for. If you think about what's happened with 5G and WIFI 6, this whole move now to hybrid work, the whole re-architecting of infrastructure to support Hybrid Cloud, this 400 Gig transition that we spoke about earlier, these are all things that we have been working on our portfolio.  So, I think the refreshed portfolio and the new innovation that has been brought forward is just timely because we're on the front end of some of these big transitions that we've been talking about for several years. So, I think that's really what's driving it.  The teams have -- at the Investor and Analysts Day, on the 15th of September, we're going to have our engineering leaders talking about what all they've done, and what the future looks like, and what the innovation pipeline looks like. And I feel really good about what they've built, but we have a lot of plans for new technology and new capabilities. Fahad Najam : I appreciate the answer, thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Jim Suva from Citigroup Global Markets, you may go ahead, sir. Jim Suva : Thanks very much. It's Jim Suva. I had one question. The long-term full-year outlook of sales and EPS is greatly appreciated, and I noticed that's a big difference and shows a lot of conviction. But on the EPS, normally you also have some stock buyback going in. But some companies include stock buyback in their EPS guide, some don't.  So, what I'm wondering is, on your EPS guide, does it include some normal stock buyback? I know this year was different when you bought Acacia for about 4.5 billion and COVID, but I wondering, how we should think about that EPS. Does it include stock buyback or what are the components of the EPS growth that match sales growth? Scott Herren : Great question, Jim. It only assumes that our share buybacks offset dilution. So, think of that as you're doing your own modeling, think of the share count to be roughly flat to where it ends this year. Jim Suva : Got you. Thank you so much for the clarification. It's great to hear all the details. Scott Herren : Thanks, Jim. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Jim. Next question. Operator : Jeff Kvaal from Wolfe Research, you may go ahead. Jeff Kvaal : Thanks very much. I am hoping to get a little bit of clarification into the software growth trajectory. It sounds like it's a great year overall, and the fourth quarter maybe didn't close as well as you'd like, and if we can talk about the trajectory, we should expect for Software growth in 2022, that would be splendid. Chuck Robbins : I'll start with some color, and then, Scott, you can chime in. I think we continue to add more software capabilities across the portfolio. We continue to transition. We've, we've transitioned a lot of our portfolio to subscription-based even for the hardware side of the business. Most of the acquisitions that we do come in subscription or SaaS software businesses. So, we would expect to continue just this move towards it becoming a greater percentage of our portfolio.  In the next couple of years, we think we also will see some of the renewal volumes will start kicking in on top of it as well, but it's already -- the transformation has already made a big difference. Scott, and I we're looking at last quarter when we did guidance for Q4. having the software revenue that came off the balance sheet significantly altered positively what we were able to guide from a revenue perspective in Q4 versus what we would have done 5 or 6 years ago.  It was meaningful. And so, we're going to continue to invest in this capability, we are going to continue to drive software. It's a hugely important part of the business, the teams have done a great job, Scott? Scott Herren : Yeah. Jeff, what I'd say is at 4 billion of software revenue over the last 90 days, we're one of the biggest software companies in the world. I mean, annualize that or look at the trailing 12 months, makes us somewhere in the top 10 in software companies in the world. We posted 6% overall growth and 9% growth in subscriptions even off that base. So, I think the software business is actually doing quite well for us.  What's underneath your question is that what you saw on applications, I'll go back to what we said earlier, about what's happening in Applications. Underneath that, you got to remember that includes the entire collaboration portfolio, so not just the software pieces and not just the recurring software pieces, there are hardware elements there, there are some legacy on-prem elements there, both of those were headwinds.  In the subscription software revenue piece of both Applications and Security, we saw double-digit growth. We had nice growth year-on-year for the full year in both of those. So, I actually feel good about where we're headed on that. Jeff Kvaal : Great. And then a quick clarification. Do you all plan to update the annual guidance every quarter for us? Scott Herren : We will assess it every quarter and update it as needed. I -- the big variable in there, of course, is what happens with the supply chain and when do we start to see a little more balance come to supply and demand across some of our key components. And I think that will -- that will dictate when we've got a good view for updating. Jeff Kvaal : Thank you both very much. Scott Herren : Thanks, Jeff. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Jeff, and we've got time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Ben Bolan from Cleveland Research. You may go ahead, sir. Ben Bolan : Thanks for getting me in at the end. I also want to focus a little bit on software. A few specific items. First, I'm curious how you think about your average contract duration and what you're seeing on average invoice duration as you shift more to software and any high-level implications you see for cash flow over time? The second item is I'm curious if you've seen any trends with early renewals from the early DNA customers, what's happened at those renewals? And then the last piece, how do you think about longer-term, making sure you're driving good utilization and consumption of the software licenses within the customer base? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : You want to take the first? Scott Herren : Yeah, okay. You managed to get in three there, Ben, on the one-question limit. I'll talk a bit about duration first. You see in our remaining performance obligations, you see the nice growth, 30.9 billion in total RPO is a record for us. What I'd say is underneath there, the short-term is about 53% of that.  They're growing, somewhat balanced, slightly more growth in the long-term than in short term, but that's what you'd expect given that many of them -- remember the short term is just the next 12 months, so the first year, the long term is anything beyond that. So, it's not surprising to see long-term growth a little bit more.  We're not seeing a big change in duration overall. And maybe I'll go ahead and hit the last one, Chuck, and then leave the DNA question for you. As we look at the renewal rates and the actions we have to take, our renewal base is obviously growing and becoming much more important to us ahead. And obviously, renewals are dependent on adoption.  We've put in place very specific processes to understand where our customers are on usage and on adoption. And you've got to -- if you don't drive the adoption, you don't get the renewal. And so, we're attacking it at that level. I think the team's done a nice job getting some headlights on that, some early warning, and getting ahead of ensuring that we actually get the adoption we need. Chuck Robbins : Yeah, that's connected to the DNA renewal thing because we actually have Customer Service -- I mean, Customer Success Specialists that are in the field that are working with customers every day, we've got virtual teller inside the organization also doing Customer Success, so the adoption piece is really important.  As it relates to DNA, then -- we've had sort of a handful in the first half of this year of those renewals that will come through, there's a little bit more in the second half and then fiscal '23 is where it's actually a much more meaningful number.  And our teams have been working on the underlying processes, the metric. the process, the systems, measurements, and the engineering teams have been working really hard on continuing to evolve the offer to ensure that there's enough innovation going forward that will optimize our opportunity on the renewal side of it. It's a bit early and I'd say maybe the second half of next year we can get -- or this fiscal year, we can give you a little more on that. And then, into fiscal '23 is when it's a decent size number. Ben Bolan : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Great. Thanks, Ben, for the question. And Chuck will want to come with some closing remarks or I can close it up? Chuck Robbins : I'll close it now and head it to you. I'm really proud of our team. I'm really proud of the performance, and we're certainly pleased with the demand that we've seen. I'm super happy with the transformation, we believe our investments are paying off, our software business, the work we're doing with the web-scale and the cloud providers, and across the portfolio.  I think our technology will help our customers deal with this emerging focus on resiliency and agility and adaptability, and then most of all, I want to thank our teams for the incredible execution, not only in Q4 but over the last 12 to 18 months during a very complicated time. And I'd like to also just remind you and encourage you all to join us on September 15th for Investor Day. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Chuck. So, Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call which will reflect our fiscal 2022 first-quarter results, will be on Wednesday, November 17th, 2021 at 1 :30 PM Pacific Time, 4:30 PM Eastern Time.  Again, I'd like to remind the audience that in light of Regulation FD, Cisco's policy is not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. We will now plan to close the call. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact the Cisco Investor Relations group, and we thank you all very much for joining today's call. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's conference call. If you would like to listen to the call in its entirety, you may call 1800-388-4923.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Marilyn Mora : Welcome everyone to Cisco's First Quarter Fiscal 2022 Quarterly Earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO, and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. As a reminder, effective in Q1, we began reporting our revenue in the following categories : secure agile networks, hybrid work, end-to-end security, Internet for the future, optimized application experiences, other products, and services. As discussed during our Investor Day, and in our October 20th press release, this change better aligns our product categories with our strategic priorities. This change only impacts how we report revenue by product category as our reportable segments will continue to be based on geographies, which consists of the Americas, EMEA, and APJC. We included quarterly reclassified revenue amounts for the last 3 fiscal years on our website. Click on the Financial Information section of the website to access these documents. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be done on a year-over-year basis. Matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the second quarter and full year of Fiscal 2022. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties, including COVID-19, that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC.  Specifically, the most recent report on Form 10-K, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Marilyn. And good afternoon, everyone. We look forward to spending time with you today. First, I would like to thank those of you who joined us for our Investor Day in September, where we showcased the strong foundation, we've built for helping to generate long-term, profitable growth. We're striving to maximize value creation through our focus on higher concentrations of software and subscription-based revenue streams. This gives us, and you, greater visibility and predictability into our future growth. We also highlighted our unique portfolio of market-leading franchises, which are well-positioned to drive growth in highly attractive existing and expansion markets. Lastly, we showcased the depth of our leadership team and outline the next phase of our strategy.  Moving into fiscal year '22, we were also a great start with robust order growth of 33% and continued strong demand across our portfolio. Our teams are executing well, our ARR grew double-digits, and our momentum is accelerating, driven by digital transformation and cloud. Even with the ongoing supply constrained environment, we are solidly on track to deliver against our long-term financial targets by investing for growth while delivering breakthrough innovation. The past 18 to 24 months have no doubt accelerated the digital revolution we are all experiencing as technology is permanently changing nearly every aspect of our lives. The technology we build is powering the modern secure infrastructure that sits at the heart of this revolution, and Cisco is well-positioned to capture the opportunities ahead. Our customers ONE Digital and cloud enabled solutions that allow them to move with greater speed, agility, and efficiency. We're already seeing the positive impact of our investments to drive accelerated innovation across high-growth areas, including hybrid cloud, web scale, cloud security, 5G, Wi - Fi 6, 400-gig, and full-stack observability. A key trend in front of us is enabling employees to work from anywhere. And this is much broader than meetings. It's about the holistic capabilities to support a highly distributed workforce that require new infrastructure architectures, observability, and security. Many companies are in the process of defining their hybrid work strategy, which will be based on the technology we build across our networking, security, and collaboration portfolios. We're also leading the way with new innovation, including our recently expanded WebEx portfolio, purpose-built for inclusive experiences across hybrid work, workspaces, and events. Now I'd like to discuss our Q1 performance. Building on the momentum from last quarter, I'm proud to say we achieved another strong quarter in line with our expectations despite supply constraints, which I will discuss shortly. We delivered balanced revenue and non-GAAP EPS growth with healthy margins driven by a continued economic recovery, strong execution, and exceptional demand for our products.  We also generated a strong quarter of double-digit growth in ARR and RPO, reflecting the ongoing success of our transformation. We have continued to operate successfully in a very dynamic environment, staying nimble in order to navigate the evolving conditions related to the Delta variant, and global component shortages. Now let me discuss the performance of our customer market segments. Q1 marks the third consecutive quarter of accelerating order momentum with broad-based strength across our business. Every geographic region, and 3 of the 4 customer markets, grew product orders at 30% or higher.  We again experienced the strongest demand in over a decade as our customers increased their investments in digital transformation. In our enterprise and commercial businesses, we achieved our fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating order growth. We also saw a solid growth in public sector. Our service provider segment delivered its highest level of order growth in over 5 years with 66% growth as these customers address their growing bandwidth requirements. In our web scale business, our robust momentum continues. Our performance was once again a record with order growth of over 200%.  That's 120% growth on a trailing four quarter basis. We are very pleased with the early traction of our 400-gig Solutions, Cisco 8000 platform, Silicon One portfolio, and rapid growth in our Acacia portfolio of optical networking products. It's clear we are expanding our footprint as our cloud growth rate is outpacing our peers. We continue to invest in web skill innovations with differentiated customer value. Launching this quarter, the latest member of the Silicon One family, the 19.2 terabit P100 routing device. The 11th chip in the Silicon One family. In addition, Acacia marked a major milestone by unveiling the industry's first pluggable module, capable of delivering 1.2 terabit capacity on a single wavelength.  Our product revenue was up nearly $1 billion year-over-year, demonstrating the competitive advantages of our scale and reach, as well as our ongoing momentum. We saw a broad-based demand across the majority of our product portfolio. In addition, we continue to see steady progress in our business model transition. Our focus on subscriptions allows us to deliver innovation faster to our customers, while providing more predictability and visibility, leading to a more durable growth business over the long term. We delivered software revenue of $3.7 billion, with 80% sold as a subscription. Subscription revenue increased by 4% to nearly $5.5 billion, while ARR increased by 10% year-over-year to $21.6 billion. We saw strong product ARR growth of 21% and product RPO grew 18%, reflecting our rapid transformation to a software-led business model.  While our revenue growth was solid, it was impacted by the supply constraints which are affecting our technology peers, and nearly every other industry. Our product orders were extremely strong and balanced across our markets. But we are constrained in what we can build and ship to our customers. We have a world-class supply-chain team that works to deliver an incredibly high volume of products given our scale and reach. They continue to execute well in this highly fluid and complex environment. We have been taking multiple steps to mitigate the supply shortages and deliver products to our customers, including working closely with our key suppliers and contract manufacturers, paying significantly higher logistics costs to get the components where they are most needed, working on modifying our designs to utilize alternative suppliers where possible, and constantly optimizing our build and delivery plans.  We are doing this at a breadth and scale that is significantly greater than most in our industry. Of course, all of these steps, while necessary to maximize our production and delivery to customers, add to our cost structure. When combined with cost increases, we are seeing from many of our suppliers, these factors are putting pressure on our gross margins. While we've thoughtfully raised prices to offset this impact, the benefits are not immediate and will be recognized over the coming quarters. Our focus remains on our customers to ensure we provide them with the products they need as quickly as possible. Now, I would like to share the progress we're making on our ESG initiatives.  In September, we committed to being net 0 greenhouse gas emissions for Scope 1 and 2 by 2025 and net 0 for all emissions including Scope 3 by 2040. We believe we will do this by focusing on 4 areas : Building more efficient products, accelerating the use of renewable energy, embracing hybrid work, and investing in innovative carbon removal solutions. We believe we have a deep responsibility to use our industry leadership position and our innovation, to make the world a better place and look forward to continuing to do our part. In summary, I am very pleased with the start to our fiscal year. Our teams are executing on our strategy, while navigating a challenging operating environment and this is reflected in our Q1 results. Demand remains strong and with the momentum in our business transformation, we have set the stage for another year of accelerated growth in fiscal 2022.  Our performance is a testament to the power of our differentiated innovation, the strength of our end markets, and our team's commitment to excellence. As our customers accelerate their digital transformation and their adoption of hybrid cloud and hybrid work strategies, we believe we are uniquely positioned to capture the opportunities ahead. We will continue to strategically invest across our portfolio to drive growth and innovation, strengthen our competitive advantage, and position Cisco for success. And I continue to have great confidence in our future. I will now turn it over to Scott. Scott Herren : Thanks, Chuck. We started the fiscal year with a strong Q1 performance. We executed well resulting in another quarter of more than 30% product order growth, driven by strength across our portfolio and demonstrating continued robust demand for our products and services. We also had strong results across revenue, net income, and earnings per-share. Total revenue increased to $12.9 billion, up 8% year-over-year coming in line with our guidance range for the quarter. We saw strength in a number of product areas and across all geographies. Our business continues to execute well in this highly dynamic environment, but ongoing component supply constraints are impacting our ability to convert historically high demand into revenue as quickly as we'd like. Non-GAAP operating margin was 33.3%, up 60 basis points.  Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.82, both up 8% year-over-year, with non-GAAP EPS coming in above the high-end of our guidance range. Looking at our Q1 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $9.5 billion, up 11%. Service revenue was $3.4 billion, up 1%. Secure agile networks performed very well with revenues up 10%. Switching had strong growth driven by a double-digit increase in campus switching, led by our Catalyst 9000 and Meraki switching offerings. The enterprise routing portfolio had high single-digit growth driven by Edge and SD-WAN. Wireless had very strong double-digit increase driven by our Wi-Fi 6 products and Meraki wireless offerings. We had growth in data center switching and compute revenue declined slightly.  Hybrid work was down 7% overall, driven by revenue decreases in our perpetual calling, meetings, and Contact Center offerings. These were partially offset by the ramp of communication platform-as-a-service and growth in our collaboration devices. Within hybrid work, our SasS revenue continues to show growth of high single-digits driven by Cloud Calling and Contact Center. End-to-End Security was up 4%, driven by growth in our cloud-based solutions, also offset by declines in our perpetual and hardware offerings. Our Zero Trust portfolio performed well with double-digit growth, as we had continued momentum in our Duo offerings. We also saw good growth in Unified Threat Management. Here again, our subscription portfolio performed well growing 15%, driven by our Cloud Security and Zero Trust platforms. Internet for the Future was up 46%, driven in large part by the strength of our webscale customers.  We saw broad strength in the portfolio with growth in Cloud, growth in Core, with strength in both Cisco 8000 and NCS 5500, and growth in Edge with the ASR 9000. We also saw benefits from our acquisition of Acacia. Optimized application experiences were up 18%, driven by both ThousandEyes which grew triple-digits, and Intersight which grew in the strong double-digits. SaaS revenue for AppDynamics grew double-digits as its revenue shifted to a greater proportion from its cloud-delivered platform. Our transformation metrics we covered at Investor Day were solid, as we continue to shift our business to more software and subscriptions. Software revenue was $3.7 billion, an increase of 1%, with the product portion, up 3%. 80% of software revenue was subscription-based, which is up 2 percentage points year-over-year.  Total subscription revenue was $5.5 billion, an increase of 4%, with the product portion increasing at 7%. Total subscription revenue represented 43% of Cisco's total revenue. ARR, or annualized recurring revenue, was $21.6 billion, an increase of 10% with strong product ARR growth of 21%. And remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $30.1 billion, up 10%. Product RPO increased 18% and short-term RPO grew 9% to $15.9 billion. As you can see, we continue to make significant progress on the transformation to increased software and subscriptions. We continue to have exceptionally strong order momentum in Q1 with total product orders up 33%, as Chuck mentioned earlier, with strength across the business. Looking at our geographic segments. The Americas was up 31%, EMEA was up 36%, and APJC was up 39%. Total emerging markets were up 37%, with the BRICS plus Mexico, up 47%.  In our customer markets, service provider was up 66%, commercial was up 46%, Enterprise was up 30%, and public sector was up 10%. As you can see, it was broad strength across the business. From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margins came in at 64.5%, down 130 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 63.8%, down 150 basis points. And service gross margin was 66.5%, down 60 basis points. The decrease in product gross margin was primarily driven by higher costs from freight, expedite, and increased component costs related to the supply constraints. Pricing impact was relatively moderate and consistent with prior quarters, partially offset by positive product mix.  We continue to manage through the supply constraints seen industry-wide by us and our peers due to component shortages, which have resulted in extended lead times and higher costs for many of these components. We're partnering closely with our key suppliers, leveraging our volume purchasing and extended supply commitments as we address the supply challenges and cost impacts which we expect will continue into the second half of fiscal 2022. Our supply chain team continues to perform well at this very complex situation. We believe we're taking the right strategic actions with our suppliers and contract manufacturers to ensure we meet customer demand despite the potential risks associated with increasing our inventory and purchase commitments.  When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our Q1 results, there was an approximate 250 basis point positive impact on revenue and no material impact on our non-GAAP EPS, which is in line with our expectations. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $3.4 billion, down 16% year-over-year, driven by higher supplier-related payments and timing of other payments and collections. We ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $23.3 billion, down approximately $1.2 billion sequentially, primarily driven by $2 billion in scheduled repayments of our long-term debt. In terms of capital allocation, we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders during the quarter, it was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $256 million of share repurchases. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline.  During Q1, we closed the acquisition of EPSAGON and announced our intent to acquire Reflex. These investments are consistent with our strategy of complementing our internal innovation and R&D with targeted M&A to allow us to further strengthen and differentiate our market position in our key growth areas. To summarize, we had a strong Q1 in a complex, supply constrained environment. We executed well with strong top-line revenue and earnings per share as we delivered balanced, profitable growth. We continue to make great progress on our business model shift and are continuing to make the investments in innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities.  We're seeing progress as we drive the continued shift to more software and subscription revenue, delivering growth and driving shareholder value. Now let me provide our financial guidance for Q2 which is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 4.5% to 6.5% year-on-year. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5%, reflecting the continuing increase in supply chain costs we're incurring, as we protect shipments to our customers. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range from 32.5% to 33.5%. And non-GAAP earnings per-share is expected to range from $0.80 to $0.82. There is no change to our full-year fiscal '22 guidance. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 5% to 7% year-on-year, non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $3.38, $3.45, also up five to 7% year-over-year. In both our Q2 and full-year guidance, we are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Scott. Michelle, let's go ahead and queue up the Q&A. A - Michelle: Thank you. Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead. Sami Badri : Hi, thank you very much for the question. First question I had was regarding your price increases that you talked about incorporating into your price sheets. Would you say that 100% of the product orders recognized in the quarter reflected the higher price increases that you guys incorporated or were there prior contracts in place that honored prior price sheets for some of your key customers? Could you give us maybe an idea on mix and maybe a straightforward answer on that side? And then just a second question is it looks like public sector up 10% year-on-year. I think some of your peers have reported some very strong end-market public sector trends, some of them coming from the U.S. federal government. Could you just give us an update on what's going on there? Were there things that did not get past the finish line or any holdups, or any kind of key things you're seeing that's met with some resistance on deploying more public sector or federal government activity? Scott Herren : Sure. I'll start, Sammy, on the price increase question and then -- and I'll let Chuck on public sector. The price increase that we put in place really just became effective on the 1st of September. Most of what we shipped during the quarter, either came out of RPO, so prior sales that are sitting on the balance sheet and then accrued into our revenue. And we've talked about having $15.9 billion now of current RPO. So, none of that, of course, would have had the price increase built into it. And a lot of the hardware shipments came out of backlog during the quarter. And again, none of those would have include that price increase. I think even looking ahead, Sami, you got to think about that price increase having a bigger effect towards the second half of the year than it will have certainly during Q2. Think of that as more of a late Q3, Q4 by the time those price increases turn into orders, those orders work their way through the backlog, get built, and then delivered to customers. Chuck Robbins : And then Sami, thanks for the question. On the public sector situation, we saw -- if you look at our public sector performance on a global basis over the last couple years, it's been very consistent. And I think we've doubled that business since 2017 or something so it's been -- that's the federal business perhaps; our U.S. public sector, but the -- what we saw was we saw a lot of strength in E-Rate. We saw strength in state, local, and education. We saw strength on a Scott Herren : civilian side, and we had a few deals on the DoD side that pushed into Q2 from an order perspective, but it's still very strong and the teams are doing a really good job there. That's just a great business for us. Sami Badri : Thank you very much. Michelle: Thanks, Sami. Next question, please. Operator : Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. You may go ahead. Ittai Kidron : Thanks. Hey, guys. Chuck, I want to focus on the security business in fiscal '19, you grew 18%, that was down to 12% in '20, that was down to 7% to '21 and you are starting to year at 4% here and now. All at the same time, your large competitors like Palo Alto and the Fortinet, and even Check Point for that matter are seeing accelerating growth improving growth rates and growth rates in the tens, twenties and even thirties on a year-over-year basis. So maybe you can unpack this for me a little bit. I know you've been pleased with your security business, but it seems like it's kind of heading in the wrong direction growth-wise relative to what the peers are doing. Maybe you can go into a little bit depth into the transitions that are going within that portfolio. When do we see it turn around and perhaps Scott can comment on how much of that portfolio is perpetual in nature versus subscription in nature? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Ittai, it's a great question. So first of all, I will say that we have room to get better in security and teams are working hard on that. There's a lot of innovative work going on. And then you called out the primary issue that Scott referenced in his opening comments is the on - prem sort of perpetual stuff in decline and then the subscription-based businesses grew double-digits. Zero Trust, Unified Threat Management was good growth. And overall, the subscription portfolio grew 15%. So, it's really balancing that and there's a little impact in there, Ittai, from supply chain on our hardware-based network firewall business. So, I think it's a combination of, we've got some work do with which the teams are working on. And then the transition and a little bit of supply chain. But we would expect over the next 2 to 3 years for that business to continue to get better, and the teams are committed to make that happen. Scott Herren : And Ittai, to the second part of your question, we haven't actually broken that out for you, but I think the as we talked at our Investor Day back in September, the growth areas of all of our markets security and hybrid work included are more in the subscription side. That's where we focused our attention. That's where we're focused a lot of our innovation. And as Chuck said, the subscription piece of security grew at 15% during the quarter. So, I think as the -- as that becomes a more and more prominent part of our overall security product portfolio, that's where you'll begin to see more acceleration in the growth rates. Ittai Kidron : Maybe Scott can answer differently, is there a way to qualify to us where we are in this transition from perpetual to subscription, is that -- will that be a drag for a long time, or you think we're at the tail end of this transition? Scott Herren : Yeah. Again, I'd rather not get into trying to give you guidance at that level, all the way out through time, Ittai (ph). I do think the areas that we focused on, and the areas that we're investing in, are the high-growth areas. And that's why you're seeing that double-digit growth. That mix will continue to change. It was obviously positive during Q1, it was positive in the prior quarter in Q4; it'll continue to change. And again, as that piece becomes a bigger part of the overall portfolio, that's where you'll see it flip to a faster growth. Ittai Kidron : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : All right. Thanks for your time. Next question, please. Operator : Tim Long from Barclays, you may go ahead. Tim Long : Thank you. Maybe just to, if I could kind of related, on the software side a little bit decal on the growth rate. Maybe if you can talk a little bit about more broadly, the software solutions and how we can start to see growth accelerate there, I guess as we get through this transition a little further. And secondly, more granular, Chuck, maybe you can talk a little bit about renewals for Cat 9K. I think we're starting to come up against a period where we are going to see more of those. Any early indications there, and what do you think retention rates will look like, and do you think there's any software up sell opportunities as the bulk of the early customer base starts renewing? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : You want to take the first and I will take the second. Scott Herren : Yeah, sounds good. On the software revenue growth, as you said, it did slow a bit during the quarter and that's really again, the same effect that we talked about in the opening commentary. We had that transformation from selling more perpetual license to selling more as a subscription, and that's an area that we've put a lot of time and effort focusing on. So, it's that mix underneath the covers that's driving it where you'll see the revenue that's not yet recognized but the success of that transformation, is in two of the stats that we also gave you in the opening commentary. Product RPO, products remaining performance obligations, up 18%, and product ARR growing 21%. So, a lot of the software sales that we had in the quarter, are actually sitting there in RPO at this point and they'll get recognized over the future. So that's just creating an overall headwind to the reported revenue growth rate. Chuck Robbins : Just to add to that [Indiscernible], our perpetual software, as you would expect, is negative year-over-year. So that -- and then the ratable that gets recognized over 3, 4, 5 years is where we're shifting it too. On the renewals on the Cat 9K, what I would say is that it's still too early to tell, but I'll tell you that it's in line with our expectations and the last two quarters -- they're small numbers just to be clear. We're very early in this and the teams have been Scott Herren : Improving it. I will tell you that we've added some innovative value around this with like, the ThousandEyes capability that's been put into it now. So, the teams are working on it. We have a reasonable degree of confidence. If you look at net retention rates are clearly off-the-charts positive. But I think it's going to be into the second half and into fiscal '23 when we really see enough volume to have conviction that we've got the numbers where we need them to be. Tim Long : Thank you. Operator : Next question, please. Michelle: Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley, you may go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. Chuck, I wanted to ask a question just on your conversations with customers, and just as you guys on, and much of the industry tries to pass on price changes, just how that's impacting demand. Maybe particularly with service providers, who just have a little less budget flexibility. And then, maybe the second question, just currently, you guys are making a lot of efforts to reconfigure products or find alternative suppliers. Just how should we think of the timeline of some of those actions summing up and about to clear some of the backlog. Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Let me -- on your first question. I think it varies by customer. Most customers are very understanding. They are super frustrated with the lead times. We have -- where we have situations that we need to deal with specific customer issues around budgets, etc., our teams handle that specifically with the customers, but in general, I think that they understand and many of our customers are doing the same thing to their customers. So, this is a whole inflationary trend that we see across the entire economy. I would say that -- quick comment on -- before I hand it to Scott -- on the second part, we did talk about -- the first half of last quarter, we did see some deterioration in our supply chain component availability. And then we saw it stabilize in the second half. So that was good. And we're planning on seeing some slight improvement in Q3 and Q4. We don't expect a lot of it -- we expected to remain stabilized in Q2, and then we think we'll see some slight improvement in the second half of our fiscal year. That's our current belief based on what we know today. Scott, you want to talk a little bit about the second part? Scott Herren : Sure. And -- Chuck Robbins : When we begin -- Scott Herren : Yes, I think that's the $64,000 question. The complexity of answering that is, of course, it's not just one commodity that's constrained and you have to square the [Indiscernible] across all economies that are all constrained. And then you have to overlay on that the snarled logistics position that we find ourselves in. Really across all lanes, whether its ocean or air, or trucking. The layering on of both of those is what makes answering that question so complex. As Chuck said, we did see stabilization and some of the signs of stabilization that we saw during the quarter. We saw better visibility to components from some of our suppliers in terms of when they could deliver and the quantities. We saw fewer de -commits come in during the quarter, another sign of stabilization. And then memory costs are actually beginning, just beginning, but beginning to decline a bit, meaning that market's coming more into balance as well. So, we're seeing signs of stabilization, as we look ahead and look at Q2 guidance and what that means for the full year. Obviously, we're in a very strong position on RPO. That's going to accrete into the revenue stream in the second half of the year and we've got a backlog that provide s us great visibility into exactly what we need to build, so we can be a lot more targeted in what we need to go chase down to get that so feel confident in the position that we're in, both on the Q2 guide and the full-year guide, given what we see today. Chuck Robbins : The bad news is we've had obviously challenges getting things shipped to our customers. The good news is, is that our backlog is at an all-time high for our Company. It's never been higher. Meta Marshall : Great. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Next question, please. Operator : Simon Leopold from Raymond James. You may go ahead. Simon Leopold : Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to see if you could maybe quantify or even guess that, how much of the 33% order growth might reflect pull-in, basically customers placing orders ahead of your price increases. If there's any way you could adjust to that or normalize, and what do you expect in terms of the outlook for order trends? Do you forecast this, and I assume at some point, revenue growth and order growth should begin to converge somewhat? Scott Herren : I wish I could do what you ask because I would like to know that myself. I will tell you this. We clearly know -- call it pull-ahead, call it ordering against the reality of our lead times, but we clearly know that customers are ordering further out than they would normally. The large carriers, the cloud providers, where we had 200% growth. These are customers were doing deep forecasting and planning with. So, we know that they're ordering 2, 3, 4 quarters out to make sure that they have the stuff in the pipeline and the right sequence for delivery. So, we get that visibility, but then you look at a segment like commercial that grew 46%, and you tend not to see a lot.  You will see a little bit, some of the commercial customers are looking out. But many of them are ordering when they feel the need, and so it's a really hard question to answer. On your second one, I think that the only way I can answer that is to say, it actually is part of the first answer too, what we're watching real closely is we're watching cancellations, which we have not seen any change in our historic cancellation rates. In fact, it's lower. We watch pipeline growth, and I can tell you that our pipeline growth is probably as strong as it's ever been even beyond the quarter we just finished. So, we see continued demand and I think that from that perspective, the way we think about it is our very large customers, largest enterprises, cloud players, large carriers, those we know we have visibility, there's an aspect of ordering ahead from other customers, but I think the vast majority below that probably aren't. Simon Leopold : Is it fair to imagine that you were also surprised by the improvement in order growth versus the prior quarter? Was this a surprise to you as well? Chuck Robbins : Well, yes. And if you look at the compare from a year ago, the compare was actually tougher, so the momentum actually increased, if you look at it that way. But our teams have -- we talked about 6 years ago that we were going to do the work to try to get back into these franchises in the cloud players, and that's been a big -- that's a big, big success for us right now and that's certainly helpful. And then we've got all these other trends happening right now. You got 5G build-out, you've got Wi-Fi 6, you got every enterprise customer realizing that they're not going to get caught with the next crisis not having their technology modernized Our switching growth is at a rate that -- 2 years ago if I'd have told you we're going to be doing that or if you'd told me we were going to be doing that, we'd have both been crazy. So, it's -- so I think your point of at some point in the future, you would expect order rate and revenue, would they have to get in line? I think over a time period, yes; not necessarily in one quarter versus the other because of the transition in the business model. Because if you look at the RPO that we're pulling off the Balance Sheet every quarter, I go back and look at what that would've been 6 years ago. It wouldn't have been anywhere remotely close to what we are, so we would've been in a much more dire situation relative to supply chain and revenue right now if we hadn't been making the transition that we've been making. Scott Herren : Yeah. That $15.9 billion of just current RPO, meaning it's going to create into the revenue stream in the next 12 months gives us obviously, a fair amount of visibility there, Simon. The other thing I'd say to your point that I think is relevant on the strength of the order flow during the quarter is linearity was also good. It wasn't likely the quarter started off strong and got weaker as it went on. The linearity was good throughout the quarter, so we do enter the current quarter with some pretty good momentum on that front. It actually was the opposite, it strengthened. Chuck Robbins : Yes. Simon Leopold : Thank you very much for those insights. Appreciate it. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Simon. Michelle: Thanks Simon, next question. Operator : Paul Silverstein with Cowen, you may go ahead. Paul Silverstein : Thanks. Various on the previous question, and second, Scott, if you already answered this, I do apologize, I don't think I heard the response. But in quantifying how much revenue would have been, and what margins would have been bought for the supply chain constraints, did you give that number? If not, can you give us that number -- those numbers? Chuck Robbins : Well, we can't give you the number because it's impossible to calculate. But if you look at last quarter's product growth at 31, this quarter's product growth at 33, the RPO, they'll be pulled off the balance sheet [Indiscernible] meaningfully higher. There is -- it's the largest backlog we've had in the history of the Company. So, it's hard to say. But Scott, anything to add? Scott Herren : Just, Paul, the constraint obviously is component supply right now with back-to-back quarters of 31% product order growth in the Q4 that we closed and then 33% in the quarter that we just closed, Q1. Clearly the -- what the headwind that we're seeing to faster revenue growth is just component supply. That backlog will turn into revenue. It will just turn into revenue over time. So, quantifying that is -- it's going to show up in the revenue stream. Chuck Robbins : What I would say is that while short term this doesn't feel great, I think what we're seeing is the customers have decisions they're making right now, and they're choosing our technology across the board. They're choosing the innovation that our teams have built. And I think that's going to bode well, and that's a great indicator for us in the future. And I think the fact of the matter is, is with that RPO and the backlog that we have, that stuff's going to ship. So, there's going to be some short-term issues, but it's going to catch up. Paul Silverstein : And Chuck, the thought arises that you've got two different issues that are jamming revenue and margins are in our at least revenue, which is both a shift to software and RPO as well as the supply constraint -- supply chain constraints, which is making it difficult to decipher what should demand in terms of quantifying it. But I guess it's not really very insightful statement. Can I ask, you mentioned very strong backlog, and you tell us what the backlog growth was as well as what book-to-bill fall. Chuck Robbins : I'm not sure book-to-bill matters anymore. That mattered years ago when we were a hardware Company, and everything was sort of net 30. We haven't looked at that in ages. I'm sure it's on a spreadsheet somewhere from years ago, but I would say the backlog is -- Scott, how would you want to characterize it? I'll leave that with you. Scott Herren : Without saying the absolute number, Paul, I think look at the revenue growth rate -- the difference between the revenue growth rate in -- just in the last two quarters, in Q4 and in Q1 and you can get a sense of what's built up in that backlog. Chuck Robbins : It is -- we have great visibility to what we need to build and ship out, and that's why you see us taking the steps we're taking in terms of adding inventory, making some of the longer-term purchase commitments that you see show up in our filings. It's really trying and doing everything we can to try to support our customers and get that product out the door as quickly as possible. But you can get a sense of the building backlog just by looking at the delta between what's been showing up in bookings and what we're able to push out the door in revenue. Paul Silverstein : Chuck, are there any product markets where you're concerned about share loss not keeping up with market growth? Chuck Robbins : Yes. We worry about it every day, and so do our competitors. And so, it's everybody is trying to fulfill what customers need and I guess the silver lining is this is not necessarily unique to us, but it's certainly frustrating. Marilyn Mora : All right. Thanks, Paul. Paul Silverstein : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Next question. Operator : Amit Daryanani from Evercore. You may go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot, and thanks for taking my questions out. I think suppose one new your revenue guide for John Paul is obviously below the street was modeling. I'd love to get a sense on the guide that you gave, how does that stack up to what you thought John product could look like maybe 90 days ago. And to the extent you could talk about the decent ratio we're seeing from October to Jan on a year-over-year basis. Would that have occurred if you had no supply-chain issues? Scott Herren : There's no question that that Q2 guide is impacted by the supply chain -- the component supply issues that are putting a headwind on what we can get pushed out the door. What I'd say is we -- our full-year guide that we gave you last quarter of 5% to 7% growth on the top line, and 5% to 7% growth on the bottom line, giving another quarter of very strong demand growth and the backlog plus the buildup of RPO we have, we have pretty good visibility to what needs to get done to hit that and are still -- given everything we know, we're still quite confident in being able to hit those for the full year. So, the shape of the year may look a little bit different because of the supply issues, but the full year still feels like it's where it was 90 days ago. Amit Daryanani : Got it. And if I just follow-up, you had a really nice wind with Facebook on Silicon One condition I think recently. Could you just talk about as you think about Silicon One offering, where is this resonating with customers? And Chuck, I'd love to understand, what are the 2 or 3 reasons beyond this is alternated to what Broadcom that customers the gravitating Silicon One for? Chuck Robbins : I would say there's a couple of things. Number 1, the performance of the Silicon One architecture is pretty incredible. And in a world where sustainability is a massive issue for everyone, when you look at the performance to power consumption ratio, it leads the world and so when you look at the speed and the number of ports and the performance that we're able to deliver at the lower power consumption, it is super meaningful and so -- not only is it great technology, but it comes at a significantly lower power consumption, and I think those are couple of big reasons. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Next question, please. Operator : Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead. Rod Hall : Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I wanted to come back to the service provider orders. We would calculate that's the best number you've done on absolute orders and service provider in 10 years. It's an insanely good number. And I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what's in there. I know that you believe that orders are coming forward 3 or 4 quarters. I think like you said, Chuck, 2 to 4, but what is driving that? Can you dig into the products inside of that? And can you maybe link it back to some of these very large CapEx programs we've seen some of the hyper - scalers and so on, and how all this fits together for you from a product point of view in a market point of view, and I've got a follow-up. Chuck Robbins : Okay, Rod. Thank you. I think you're probably right on -- I don't know if it goes back 10 years. I have not looked at it, but it was significant, and I think it's a combination of what we talked about. For three years on this -- on these calls, we talked about when's 5G going to be real. And so, we see it real now. And so, you sell site routers that are backhaul. Routers are a big deal. Packet core is a big deal. You get into the cloud providers, and you have either standalone silicon, standalone software, or integrated systems and increasingly it's -- we're getting more integrated systems work which has been helpful. The Edge with the ASR 9K. The Cisco 8000 is being obviously super successful.  The NCS product line, optical, Acacia is doing very well. And so, all those technologies just line up. And I think that when you look at the -- I'd say I'd summarize it with 3 major trends, just us getting into the 400-gig build-out in the cloud. As the 5G build-out in the service provider space, and then a re-architecture that's happening in the service provider space to just basically flatten and simplify the whole routed optical network strategy that our teams have talked about. Those are the drivers. And you had a second question, Rod. Rod Hall : Yeah. I wanted to come back to the backlog and maybe see if Scott, if you have aged out at all. Could you give us any idea? I know it's within the RPO, but could you give us any idea on aging on that just so we could try to reconcile. Obviously, the stock's down, reason it probably down is because the growth rate here just doesn't match the word of growth, and people are going to try to reconcile that. I thought, well, maybe you could give us some aging that would help us to make some progress on that. So, I'm just curious if you can help with that. Thanks. Scott Herren : Rod, thanks for that question. This is something that our supply chain team is working day and night to try to resolve. We obviously can look at that and understand what's in the backlog quite well. What I'd say is what we're working through is really a prioritization mechanism on how we can get things shipped out that are going to make sense to our customers and get those out there as quickly as possible. So, there is some aging inside there, Rod. Rather than try to quantify that for you, what I'd say instead is it's something that we are -- our team is working night and day to try to resolve. Rod Hall : Okay. Great. Thank you. Scott Herren : By the way, if it's sitting in the backlog, obviously it's not an RPO yet. It's not an RPO, so it's incremental to RPO. Right. Rod Hall : Yeah, I misspoke. Sorry about that. Scott Herren : Yeah. Rod Hall : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : All right. Thanks, Rod. Next question. Operator : Matthew Niknam from Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead Matthew Niknam : Hey guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Just two if I could. First on gross margins, I think the guide for next quarter implies you're going to be down about 50 bytes at the midpoint, despite some of the seasonal lift you've typically seen in Fiscal 2Q. So, I'm just wondering, is it entirely worsening supply chain constraints or are there other factors to consider? And then secondly, I guess more broadly, is a question on capital allocation. At the Analyst Day, you talked about using the buyback -- to continue to use it to offset dilution from stock options, but you're also sitting on $23 billion in cash. Wondering if there are any updates you can share in terms of strategy here and on a related point, what you're seeing on the M&A front in terms of larger scale, more transformational opportunities. Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Okay. You snuck in 3 there, Matthew. But I'll start with the gross margin question. The guide that we gave for the quarter, at 63.5 to 64.5 is exactly the same guide that we gave you in Q1, and it's the exact same combination of effects. There are some competing factors inside there right on the -- within the gross margin. We've got price increases that will come online as the year goes on more toward the second half and really more toward the end of Q3 and into Q4, we'll start to see that will be a tailwind to gross margin. We've got the cost increases and within that it's not just component cost increases, which are a part of it. It's also logistics cost increases as we've talked about, and those have gone up across the board as well. So that's what's in the gross margin. It's strictly tied to the various elements of costs within our supply constraints that we're dealing with. On the cap allocation, which I think was your second question, our cap allocation policy is unchanged. It's exactly as we stated at Investor Day, which is, first and foremost, to support the growth of the business.  Beyond that, to obviously continue to protect the dividends through time, offset dilution of our equity plans, which is what you saw us do during the quarter we just closed, and then longer term, return excess cash in the most tax efficient way we can to our investors. So, we continually evaluate that. I will tell you it's an evaluation that is not just done once a quarter; it's an evaluation that we do continually on that front. The M&A question is one that probably doesn't pay to get too deep into. M&A has been a part of our strategy as a Company. Over time, we talked about a couple of acquisitions in the opening commentary. EPSAGON, which closed during the quarter and Replex, which we announced during the quarter, is not yet closed. You should continue to see us doing some of those more of the build-by type acquisitions. I think it helps us accelerate innovation. Longer term it's a space that has been part of our strategy for some time. Matthew Niknam : That's great. Thanks, Scott. Marilyn Mora : Let's go ahead and move to the next one. Operator : Tal Liani from Bank of America. You may go ahead. Tal Liani : Hi. Hopefully you can hear me. Chuck, I have a high-level question. If I analyze your growth, you grew $1 billion year-over-year. But when I look at the components, it all hardware. Switches and routers or Secure, Agile Networks is about 55% of it, and the rest of it is the optical stuff, the Internet for the future. And the question is twofold. Number one, strategically, what can you do to expedite the growth of your focus areas, meaning software recurring revenue, SASE anything that the other side of hardware. And the second question is, even if I look at the hardware side on these 2 areas, there was a major increase year-over-year in the growth rate. Meaning from -16 to +10, for example, in securing that John network, even higher on the optical side. So, what about sustainability, if that's the driver going forward, the hardware piece or the legacy pieces, how sustainable is the high growth we are seeing today versus a year-ago? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Tal. First of all, I think, when you look at the RPO numbers that Scott talked about, that would indicate that there's a significant portion of our revenue that we recognize each quarter that is not hardware. If you look at the RPO that we're going to recognize over the next 4 quarters and it will increase as we go through the year; it's sitting at close to $16 billion right now and so I think -- and you look at the product RPO growth in the quarter was up 18%, so I think that's actually being successful. I just think the hardware part of the business had suffered the most a year ago. And so, I think it's just coming back strong, and we're -- but I actually think that we're actually making great progress on the software side, so I'm not concerned about it. I obviously would like for it to go faster, but I think it's -- if I look at what we're pulling off the balance sheet today and revenue versus what we were 6 years ago, it's seriously meaningful. Tal Liani : And what about sustainability? Chuck Robbins : You see 1/12 of it in a quarter -- Tal Liani : A fraction of it. Chuck Robbins : -- a fraction of it in a given quarter. Tal Liani : Yeah. Thanks. And what about sustainability of these areas that are growing now? How sustainable is the high growth that we're seeing now? Scott Herren : We touched on -- I'll start, Chuck, and you can add color. We touched on that, Tal, at the -- at our Investor Day, where we talked about the long-term growth of the TAM. It's just on the markets we're playing in today, that that's where we're already selling or where we're investing in products. That's up to a $400 billion TAM by fiscal '25. And then within that, those markets are growing 5% to 7%, consistent with our own projected growth rates. Interestingly, when you peel that 5% to 7% back further and say, well, what's going to drive that? By far, if you recall, the fastest growth rate was in the subscription models, and that's what you see from us. You see product RPO growing 18%. You see product ARR growing 21%. You see us doing exactly what we said we were going to do, which is make that transformation to a more recurring revenue model. Those things are not necessarily immediately turning into reported revenues, which I think is the math you're trying to do. But you got to add to that, or you got to consider when you do that, the amount that we're building up in RPO and in ARR and I think that's what drives the growth longer term. Chuck Robbins : And, Tal, we're also -- if you think about the franchise wins that we're having in the cloud webscale players, those are like recurring revenue models because you're in until the next transition, just like we were out before, so that's another reason that -- if you look at software as a percentage of total revenue, as we continue to make progress there, I think software is going to grow and we hope to be growing both sides of it to be candid. Tal Liani : Got it. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Tal. Next question. Operator : Jim Suva from Citigroup. You may go ahead. Jim Suva : Thank you. And I just have one question and that is, can you give us some more details around your prepared comment where you mentioned about your integration and Acacia is going on really well, what are some examples or proof points or milestones or items that you can maybe help us as outsiders understand about how Acacia is fitting in with Cisco. Thank you. Chuck Robbins : It's a really good question, I think first of all, they are -- I think they are executing ahead of what we expected from a numbers perspective. So that's first and foremost. And then secondly, I think just the work the teams are doing to continue to deliver on the innovation, there's work going on between the silicon and optics teams today. We're winning new franchises. I just think, it's just been a great partnership since they've been onboard. Scott, anything to add. Scott Herren : No. Other than just reiterating what you said in the opening commentary which is, and this is a pretty major milestone for the industry, first pluggable module capable of delivering 1.2 terabyte capacity on a single wavelength. That's a sign of not just executing on the financial performance, but also continuing to innovate at the rate and pace that we'd expect from them. Michelle: All right. Thanks, Jim. We have time for 1 last question. Operator : Thank you. Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. You may go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Chuck, I guess just wanted to follow up, you have base strong order trends across all the customer verticals. But you did mention the impact that you're monitoring the Delta variant and the uncertainty around it, and we've heard the same from some of the channel partners in terms of a risk to monitor, particularly for the commercial space. Are you seeing anything weaken on the margin there or is there a bit more uncertainty and risk created because of it? And then as a quick follow-up for Scott. Scott, I do realize the supply chain constraints that you're highlighting here, but you're reiterating the full-year revenue guide of 5 to 7. Does the high-end look a bit more unreachable at this point, just given the supply constraints are bidding into the second half, which probably was not expected when you give that guidance earlier. Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Yes, Samik. My answer is pretty quick. We're not seeing any impact from it, but we're clearly monitoring it. We live in -- we are in such a dynamic world right now. And you see what's happening in some places in Europe, but we actually saw acceleration in the last 90 days. Scott Herren : Yeah, you pointed out commercial, Samik, in the question. And 1 of the data points that Chuck talked about earlier is commercial group. Product orders and commercial group, 46% during the quarter. So, we had really strong growth there. I think to your second question, it's so hard. I talked earlier about the complexity of answering that question, but I'll just repeat what we said earlier in the year that if the supply chain -- the component supply Chuck Robbins : constraints began to clear up earlier in the second half, we'll be toward the high end; if it's later in the second half, we'll be toward the low end. The real difficult question to answer is where in the second half do, we really see that starting to clear up. What we have seen is stabilization. It did deteriorate earlier in the first quarter. As the quarter went on, I mentioned earlier, we saw signs of stabilization and we also have great visibility coming from what's in RPO. It's going to creep into our revenue stream in the second half and knowing very clearly what's in the backlog, so we know exactly which components to go chase to build that out. So confident in the full year. The question of when this all clears up in the second half is really what's going to dictate whether we're more towards the high end or more towards the low end. Samik Chatterjee : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : All right. Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Alright. Let me let me just wrap up by thanking all of you for spending time with us today and just saying, I'm really proud of what the teams have accomplished. It's incredibly complex environment. When you look at -- we delivered 8% revenue growth, 8% non-GAAP EPS, all three geographies, product bookings over 30%. ARR growing to $21.6 billion double-digits, RPO at $30.1 billion double-digits. I really am just pleased with what the teams have done. It was truly a great quarter in a very complicated time. Large backlog in our history, it will ship and combine that with our RPO when we feel good about where we're headed, we will continue to plan and work hard on navigating these component issues and our supply chain team continues to work night and day to do that. We feel good still about our annual guidance and I have a lot of confidence about where we are with our innovation and with the Company in general. So, thanks for spending time with us, and we'll talk to you next time. Marilyn Mora : Thanks. Chuck, Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our Fiscal 2022 second-quarter results, will be on Wednesday, February 16th, 2022, at 1 :30 PM Pacific Time, 4:30 PM Eastern Time. This concludes today's call. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the Cisco Investor Relations group and we thank you very much for joining today.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Marilyn Mora : Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's second quarter fiscal 2022 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter and full year of fiscal 2022. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties, including COVID-19, that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Marilyn. I hope you all are remaining safe and healthy. After the solid results we delivered last year, 2022 is proving to be an even stronger year, fueled by exceptional demand for our solutions and the continued success of our transformation. In Q2, I'm thrilled to say that we delivered another great quarter with double-digit ARR growth and robust product orders, which fueled an all-time high backlog and a strong pipeline. These results underscore the increasing relevance and criticality of Cisco's innovation in the era of digital transformation and cloud and reinforces my confidence in our ability to deliver growth. We are focused on staying ahead of our customers' most pressing needs as they navigate a dynamic world. Our customers are moving faster than ever, driven by the move to hybrid work and hybrid cloud. This requires modernized infrastructure, new security architectures and accelerated digital transformation. The breadth of our innovative solutions and services at a global scale, combined with our increasing ability to deliver more flexible consumption offerings is driving even deeper partnerships with our customers across our entire portfolio. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes covering our results in more detail in what we are seeing in the market. We delivered solid top line growth combined with margins and earnings that exceeded the high ends of our guidance despite operating in a supply-constrained and inflationary environment. The robust demand we saw in Q1 continued into Q2, with product order growth of 33%. Our third consecutive quarter of order growth of 30% or higher with momentum once again across all geographic regions and customer markets. For example, in our enterprise business, we delivered 37% order growth, the highest in over 12 years as large customers prioritize investments to modernize their networks and enable new digital capabilities and resiliency. As more and more becomes digitized, we expect our momentum to continue. We believe the need for highly secure, seamless connectivity, hybrid cloud and hybrid work solutions, along with edge computing will drive growth for Cisco. The opportunity ahead of us is clear as demonstrated by our growing pipeline and record backlog, which more than doubled from a year ago and will convert into revenue in the coming quarters. In our web scale business, we delivered another incredible quarter. Our order growth was up more than 70% year-over-year, which is over 100% growth on a trailing four-quarter basis. We continue to see exceptional performance, driven by the rapid pace of adoption of our 400-gig solutions and our routed optical networking portfolio, which grew over 50%, fueled by the Cisco 8000 product line, Acacia and Silicon One. We're also seeing tremendous traction with ZR Optics as part of the routed optical network strategy. Our Optical Systems and Acacia businesses both saw significant double-digit growth, driven by our web scale customers. The innovations we've invested in over the last several years have positioned us well as the largest players in this space adopt next-generation technologies. Our customers are making strategic decisions on their future road map and recognize Cisco's unparalleled portfolio is critical to their strategies. We believe they are still in the early phases of their next-generation platform buying decisions and expect our momentum to continue. From a product revenue perspective, we delivered another strong and balanced quarter with 9% growth with broad-based demand across the majority of our product portfolio. This was led by increased customer spending to modernize their networks, securely connect their hybrid workforce and build out their 5G networks, all with a strong uptake of our subscription offerings. We continue to prioritize investments that will drive our long-term performance and capitalize on the mega trends in large growing markets, including cloud, full stack observability, 5G, 400-gig, WiFi 6 and security. Our expertise in these areas, along with the deep integration of hardware, software and silicon across our portfolio, differentiates us and sets us up to win. Our team continues to innovate at a speed and scale like never before. To help our customers build and deliver the best hybrid work experience, we recently introduced new breakthrough networking innovations, including Catalyst 9000 X switches built on Silicon One, the industry's first high-end WiFi 6E access points and an as-a-Service private 5G offering for the enterprise, enabling communication service providers to deliver cloud-based services to their customers. We are committed to also lead in a more sustainable way. An example of this is our Silicon One Catalyst 9000 X switches I just mentioned, which are approximately 40% more power efficient compared to prior versions. Building technologies in this way is key towards our goal to reduce our Scope 3 emissions to net-zero by 2040. I'm also proud of the progress of our business transformation to more software and subscription-based recurring revenue as we transition more of our business to the cloud. Annualized recurring revenue or ARR, of $21.9 billion was up 11%, with product ARR increasing by 20%. Product remaining performance obligations, or RPO, which is largely software revenue that is committed but not yet recognized, was up 16%. We remain one of the largest software companies in the world. In Q2, our software revenue grew by 6% to $3.8 billion. Total subscription revenue accelerated to $5.5 billion, up 7% year-over-year. It's important to note that both of these metrics continue to be negatively impacted by subscription software and service that is attached to hardware where the shipments are delayed due to the component situation. The strength in our software, RPO and ARR clearly demonstrate the value we are creating through our transformation and provides us a greater degree of visibility and predictability into our future growth. From a macro perspective, the component shortage continues to remain challenging. Our incredibly strong demand continues to outpace supply, expanding our backlog of products, software and services. Our supply chain team continues to take aggressive action through strong inventory positions, deepening supplier relationships, qualifying alternative components and increased use of expedited freight. There are still significant constraints with semiconductors, preventing us from completing manufacturing of some of our products, and that remains a headwind to revenue growth despite very strong demand. In addition, the constrained environment continues to drive up supply chain costs, which we have successfully passed through to help offset these increases. In summary, we continue to work through the impact of the pandemic and component shortages, and we've never felt better about the company, our position and our outlook for growth. Our Q2 results reflect healthy momentum, a clear vision and outstanding execution by our teams. Our innovation engine and pipeline have never been stronger, and we are rapidly transforming our business by accelerating our transition to more software and subscription offerings. I'm so proud of our teams and what they've accomplished during these very dynamic times. We are bringing industry-leading innovation to market and further enhancing our differentiated position across the portfolio by delivering flexible consumption models for our customers. I remain confident and optimistic about our future. Cisco is at the epicenter of massive shifts toward hybrid cloud, hybrid work and digital transformation which we believe creates momentum for our business and positions us well to capture the significant opportunities ahead. I'll now turn it over to Scott. Scott Herren : Thanks, Chuck. Q2 was a strong quarter across the business. We executed well, delivering our third consecutive quarter of more than 30% product order growth, driven by strength across our portfolio, including continued robust demand for our products and services, along with disciplined spend and supply chain management. Total revenue increased by $760 million to $12.7 billion, up 6% year-over-year, in line with our guidance range for the quarter. We saw strength in a number of product areas and across all of our geographies. Our business performed well in this highly dynamic and supply-constrained environment, which, as Chuck said, continues to hinder our ability to convert the significant demand we have into revenue. Overall profitability in Q2 was strong with non-GAAP operating margin of 34.3%, non-GAAP net income of $3.5 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.84 with non-GAAP earnings per share coming in above the high end of our guidance range. Looking at our Q2 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $9.4 billion, up 9%. Service revenue was $3.4 billion, down 1%, driven by delays in hardware support contracts related to the supply constraints. Within product revenue, Secure, Agile Networks performed well, with revenues up 7%. Switching had solid growth, driven by a double-digit increase in data center switching, driven by our Nexus 9000 products. Campus switching had solid growth, led by our Catalyst 9000 and Meraki switching offerings. Wireless had very strong double-digit increase driven by our WiFi 6 products and our Meraki wireless offerings. We also saw double-digit growth in compute revenue, driven by servers. Enterprise routing declined, primarily driven by access, slightly offset by strength in SD-WAN. Hybrid work, which is where we report just our collaboration portfolio, was down 9%, driven by declines in our collaboration devices and meetings offerings, partially offset by the continued ramp of our communication Platform-as-a-Service. Beginning next quarter, the name of this category will change from hybrid work to collaboration. There will not be any changes to the components within this category. End-to-end security grew 7%, with broad strength across most of the portfolio. Our Zero Trust portfolio performed well with double-digit growth driven by strong performance in our dual offerings. Our subscription portfolio continued to perform well, driven by cloud security and Zero Trust. Internet for the future was up 42%, driven in large part by the strength of our web scale customers. We saw broad strength in the portfolio with growth in edge, driven by double-digit growth from our ASR 9000 offerings and core with strength in Cisco 8000 and Optical. We also saw continued strong contribution from Acacia, our optical networking offerings. Optimized application experiences was up 12%, driven by double-digit growth in both ThousandEyes and Intersight. SaaS revenue for AppDynamics grew mid-single digits with the continued shift to its cloud-delivered platform. We continue to make progress on our transformation metrics as we shift our business to more software and subscriptions. Software revenue was $3.8 billion, an increase of 6% with the product portion up 9%. 80% of software revenue was subscription-based, which is up four percentage points year-over-year. Total subscription revenue was $5.5 billion, an increase of 7%. Total subscription revenue represented 44% of Cisco's total revenue. Annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, was $21.9 billion, an increase of 11%, with strong product ARR growth of 20%. And remaining performance obligations or RPO was $30.5 billion, up 8%. Product RPO increased 16%, service RPO increased 3%, and the total short-term RPO grew 8% to $16.3 billion. As a reminder, the short-term portion will convert to revenue over the next 12 months. Relative to acquisitions, there was an approximate 200 basis point year-over-year positive impact on Q2 revenue growth and no material impact on our non-GAAP EPS, which is in line with our expectations. We continue to have exceptionally strong order momentum in Q2. Total product orders grew 33%, with strength across the business. Looking at our geographic segments. The Americas was up 36% and EMEA and APJC were both up 30%. Total emerging markets were up 39%, with the BRICS plus Mexico up 48%. In our customer markets, service provider was up 42%, enterprise was up 37%, commercial was up 34% and public sector was up 20%. As you can see, it was broad strength across our geographies and customer markets. From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margin came at 65.5%, down 140 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 64.3%, down 230 basis points and service gross margin was 68.8%, up 90 basis points. The decrease in product gross margin was primarily driven by ongoing higher component costs related to supply constraints as well as higher freight and logistics costs. As we\u2019ve been discussing for several quarters, we continue to manage through the supply constraints seen industry-wide by us and our peers due to component shortages, which have resulted in extended lead times and higher supply costs. The situation remains challenging. We continue to partner closely with our key suppliers, leveraging our volume purchasing and extended supply commitments as we address the supply challenges and cost impacts, which we expect will continue into the second half of our fiscal 2022. As I mentioned, the component supply constraints also slow the conversion of our strong demand into revenue. This has resulted in a substantial increase and continued build in our backlog levels well beyond our normal historical levels. Additionally, the ongoing supply constraints have not only impacted our ability to ship hardware but also impacts our delivery of software, such as subscriptions that customers order with the hardware. That undelivered software is also included in backlog until the hardware ships which is when we begin to recognize the revenue. Of course, this impacts our software revenue growth and other related metrics. To give you a sense of scale of our backlog, our Q2 ending product backlog was more than $14 billion, an increase of more than 150% year-on-year. Within that amount, software backlog almost doubled to more than $2 billion. Keeping in mind that backlog is not included as part of our $38.5 billion in remaining performance obligations. We ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $21.1 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $2.5 billion, down 17% year-over-year, primarily driven by advanced payments to secure future supply. These advanced payments had a negative 17% year-over-year impact on operating cash flow. Additionally, we made a tax payment of approximately $100 million this quarter, which have been deferred as a result of the CARES Act. This payment had an additional negative 4% year-over-year impact on our operating cash flow. In terms of capital allocation, we returned $6.4 billion to shareholders during the quarter was comprised of $4.8 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for our quarterly cash dividend. Given the confidence we have in our business today and into the future, our Board has authorized an additional $15 billion for share repurchases, bringing the total to approximately $18 billion. We\u2019re also raising our dividend by $0.01 to $0.38 per quarter, which represents our 12th increase. Combination of our dividend increase, additional share repurchase authorization and higher share repurchases during the quarter demonstrates our commitment to returning excess capital to our shareholders and our confidence in the stability of our ongoing cash flows. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. We closed the acquisition of Replex in Q2 and Opsani in early Q3 to enhance our full stack observability offerings. These investments are consistent with our strategy of complementing our internal innovation in R&D with targeted M&A to allow us to further strengthen and differentiate our market position in our key growth areas. To summarize, we had another good quarter with robust product demand and solid execution in a complex supply-constrained environment. We continue to make progress on our business model shift and are making the investments in innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities and expanding addressable markets. We\u2019re seeing progress as we drive the continued shift to more software and subscription revenue delivering growth and driving shareholder value. Now let me provide our financial guidance for Q3. As a reminder, the third quarter of last year included an extra week, which was a benefit to total revenue of approximately 3 points of growth. The total impact on our cost of sales and operating expenses was approximately $150 million, and this translated into a $0.04 benefit to earnings per share in our Q3 of last year. For next quarter, we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 3% to 5%. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margins to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5%, reflecting the continuing increase in supply chain costs we\u2019re incurring as we protect shipments to our customers. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 32.5% to 33.5%, non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.85 to $0.87. For the full year of fiscal 2022, we are tightening the range as follows : we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 5.5% to 6.5% year-on-year, non-GAAP earnings per share is increasing to $3.41 to $3.46, up 5.9% to 7.5% year-on-year. In both our Q3 and full year guidance, we\u2019re assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. I\u2019ll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Scott. Michelle, let\u2019s go ahead and queue up the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. You may go ahead. Ittai Kidron : Thanks. Guys, nice to see the good results. I want to dig into the supply chain a little bit Chuck and Scott. Maybe you can talk about, just kind of quarter-over-quarter, have things gotten a little bit worse, a little bit better? And is there any timetable in mind where you think we could see a material improvement? And maybe on the back of that, Scott, when we see this improvement should we just expect like a period of I don\u2019t know, two, three quarters where you really have outsized growth as you fulfill this unusual backlog? I\u2019m just trying to understand the scenario here of how all of this gets unwounded? Chuck Robbins : Yes. Ittai, thanks for the question. I\u2019ll start and then Scott can jump in. I would say during the quarter, supply chain didn\u2019t get materially worse and didn\u2019t really get materially better. It was pretty consistent. There were gives and takes throughout the quarter, but I think at a macro level, that\u2019s where I\u2019d characterize it. They were a little bit towards the end some Omicron effect with people being sick and not being able to show up in factories and some of the logistics issues that are well documented. But in general, that\u2019s what we saw. We don\u2019t have \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say we have a great timeline for you as to when things begin to improve. All we know now is we expect this to be with us through the second half of our year. Scott, would you add? Scott Herren : Yes. No, I think that\u2019s right. That\u2019s in sync with our expectations. And Ittai to your question on how does this unwind, it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t believe it unwinds in a lumpy fashion. I think it\u2019ll unwind as supply and demand get more in balance. And I think that will just happen gradually over the course of the next few quarters. So I\u2019m not expecting a significant bump in any given quarter. I think the supply frees up with $14 billion of backlog, we\u2019ve got plenty of demand to go off and fulfill. It\u2019s really a question of when does that supply free up. And as it does free up, I think it will happen gradually over time. Ittai Kidron : Got it. Maybe, Scott, just to clarify this last point, is there any way for you to know how much of this backlog is double ordering? I don\u2019t know what it means from a customer standpoint that you have all this backlog are customers really waiting for a long time to product? And what is the risk you have some kind of double order elements in these figures? Chuck Robbins : Ittai, that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been alert to and watching for since we began building the backlog after three consecutive quarters of demand growth in the 30% range and revenue growth only in the 6% to 8% range. We\u2019ve been building substantial backlog, and so we\u2019ve been looking to that. I think it\u2019s clear that customers are responding to our lead times, and our lead times have extended as the lead times for the components have extended. So there\u2019s I\u2019d say, some extension in there. But I think what we\u2019re seeing is real demand. I think it\u2019s a combination of pent-up demand from products that didn\u2019t get done during the pandemic. I think it\u2019s the leading edge of several of these trends that we\u2019ve talked about that we\u2019re investing into. And when we look at things like if there was double ordering, you probably wouldn\u2019t see that as much in the commercial and small customers, and we\u2019re still seeing strong growth in that segment. You probably also would see the pipeline build begin to slow down and we\u2019re not seeing that either. Our pipeline is quite robust at this point. So we\u2019re looking for proxies to try to understand that better. We\u2019re not seeing anything at this point that would indicate there\u2019s double ordering in there. Ittai Kidron : Excellent. Thank you so much. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Ittai. Next question, please. Operator : Paul Silverstein from Cowen. You may go ahead sir. Paul Silverstein : Thanks, guys. I guess, is there anything wrong with the following logic with respect to your elevated costs? At some point, logistics freight costs are going to return to normal, if not, entirely back to where they were a year, year and half ago, largely. And as far as the stickier component and semiconductor costs, to the extent they don\u2019t revert, your price increases eventually over the next three to four quarters as you burn off backlog that they will offset, if not in full then in large measure those elevated costs. Before I ask the follow-up, is that \u2013 is there anything wrong with that logic? Chuck Robbins : I think, Paul, there\u2019s nothing wrong with the logic. I think the expectations that I would give you are the same that I gave you last quarter. As I think about gross margin through the end of this fiscal year, I think it stays in the range we\u2019re in, in the 64% to 65% range through the end of the year. Beyond that, as you said, and I hope you\u2019re right that logistics costs begin to return to something that\u2019s more normal. Obviously, the price increases that we put in place, we\u2019ve talked about this previously. We\u2019re not seeing much benefit from that today. Because the price increase goes in, there\u2019s offsets between the time we started and it gets out to the field. The field then has to take those prices sell it to customers. Those orders have to come in into the backlog and then get fulfilled out of the backlog before we finally get the revenue credit for those price increases. And I think that we\u2019ll will begin to see benefit from those price increases toward the end of this quarter and more into Q4. But my expectation on gross margins at this point is that they stay in the range that we\u2019re in right now in the 64% to 65% range through the end of the year. Paul Silverstein : Got it. Chuck, on the revenue side, this is the best demand environment across enterprise, carrier and web scale I\u2019ve seen in 26 years covering the seven. And you\u2019d have to go back to the late \u201890s. And of course, that proved to be a bubble. We see your growth \u2013 the growth of your peers, Arista, Juniper, Extreme, F5 et cetera, how much of what\u2019s going on is pure market growth? How much of this has improved execution on the part of Cisco? Chuck Robbins : That\u2019s a really good question. And I would say that it is definitely a combination of both. The markets are certainly robust as you called out with seeing some of our peers who are having solid results as well. But then when you look at \u2013 when I look at the order growth rates in certain segments of our business, certain technology areas, I can tell you we\u2019re gaining share. I mean web scale, obviously, we\u2019re executing incredibly well because we didn\u2019t exist there just a couple of years ago. And in some of our technology areas like WiFi, I mean, the growth rates on the order side, even campus switching to gross on the order side. I think that \u2013 I think there\u2019s a lot of really good execution. I think our portfolio is in great shape. And you have to remember, we\u2019re on the front end of these multiyear trends that are really in our favor, whether it\u2019s 5G, whether it\u2019s 400 gig, WiFi 6, hybrid cloud, hybrid work, edge compute. I mean these are all technology areas and transitions that are positive for us. So those are somewhat market-related, but I think our portfolio is well positioned for those transitions. Paul Silverstein : Appreciate it. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Chuck. Next question. Operator : Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead sir. Sami Badri : Hi. Thank you very much. So I got two hard questions for you guys. I\u2019ll keep this like a one short, but here\u2019s the first one. So I want to congratulate you guys on the 30%-plus product order growth. And I think what a lot of us really want to know is what is the right normalized growth rate? Or when do you see the normalized growth rate finally starting to flow through your numbers? And we look at the 30% and think this is a thematic trend. But at some point, needs to come back down a little bit. When do you see the normalization of that product corridor growth to actually happen? So that's the first question. The second question is a $20 billion question. Are you guys buying Splunk? And if not, what have been the internal considerations for not doing the deal? Chuck Robbins : So let me answer, I guess, both of them. So the \u2013 on the first one, I think that next quarter, Q3, the compares definitely get tougher from a year ago, particularly because we had an extra week of order as well. And then in Q4, obviously, that was the first quarter that we experienced a 30% plus quarter from last fiscal year. So certainly, those will be good quarters for us to sort of see a litmus test on your question. Until then, I'm not sure I have a direct answer for you, but certainly, the math will get tougher here in the next couple of quarters. On your second question, first of all, we don't comment on rumors and speculations or stories. What I will tell you is that we are constantly evaluating potential opportunities. Scott and I were talking. We think for every deal we do, we probably look at 10 to 15 companies. We base our decisions on, first and foremost, strategic fit; secondly, cultural fit and equally as important, the financial and the valuation fit. And we are always disciplined and we continue to focus on both inorganic and organic opportunities. But I will tell you that you should expect us to continue to be very, very disciplined as we go forward as well. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Next question please. Operator : Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead. Rod Hall : Great, thanks guys. I wanted to come back to gross margins for the quarter. You guys substantially beat the top end of your guidance range. And I wanted to see if you could just comment on what were the positive surprises within that gross margin line? And then my second question, maybe kind of a non-sequitur, but I was really surprised, Chuck, on the public sector orders. Those were really strong. And I wonder if you could maybe dig into that a little bit and comment on some of the dynamics there in the public sector? Thanks. Scott Herren : I'll take the first one. On the gross margin, Rod, it really came down to product mix that we had the components for that we could build and ship out during Q2. As I said earlier, our expectations on gross margin for the year are unchanged. And we had favorable product mix in Q2 that drove us above as I'm sure you're aware, above the high end of our guidance range. I think it's a bit of a headwind for us as we look at gross margins in Q3, but it equals out for the year. And so our expectations for the full-year on gross margin are unchanged. Rod Hall : Scott, can you comment on specifically what types of products mix in positively there? Just give us a little more color? Scott Herren : It's always a mix. When you go across product lines and across customer size, both of those things have an effect. Rather than kind of go through and parse product by product, it's \u2013 we had a quarter where the supply we had just allowed us to ship higher-margin product. And again, given the visibility we have with $314 billion of backlog, we have pretty good visibility into what we need to build and a pretty good feel for what that's going to look like in the quarters ahead. So I feel confident that we're going to stay in this range through the end of the year. Chuck Robbins : And on the public sector question, I think it's a good catch on your part, because a lot of people look at the 20% and see it as being below the other customer markets in and would look at that negatively. But the reality is, it's been the most consistent for the last couple of years. And we saw broad-based strength. And whether it was in our government business, which has been, I think, we've had \u2013 so I'm looking at some data here, six consecutive quarters of positive growth and three out of the last four strong double-digit growth, if you look at education, we've had five straight quarters or six straight quarters there as well and it's been particularly strong in the last five quarters. And so it was very broad-based across the public sector. Rod Hall : Great. Okay, thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Rod. Next question. Operator : Tim Long from Barclays. You may go ahead. Tim Long : Thank you. Yes, I just wanted to ask on the software side, decent year-over-year growth in the quarter. I understand it's still being hampered a little bit. But maybe just talk a little bit, Chuck, about when you think we'll start to see that accelerate a little bit more than the overall revenues? Is it Cat 9K? Is it some other products moving to more software as a recovery in some of the other businesses? And then the follow-up is on the cloud business. You talked about the strong orders again. Could you just give us a little color kind of what's driving that? And then more than just product basis are you seeing competitive wins, new use cases, new customers? What's really driving that 70% year-over-year and 100% over the last four quarters? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : I'm pulling out some data here. So Tim, on the first one, on the software front, I think you have a really good question. I think Scott called out in his section that our product software revenue growth was 9%. The thing \u2013 you got to get behind that to understand what's going on. And our old perpetual software, which we've been in transition from two subscriptions, perpetual was down 12% and subscription was up 17%. So the transition is actually happening the way we expect it. That's the reason you're seeing some of that, because the subscription stuff, obviously, is recognized over time, and you're taking a 12% hit on a onetime piece of software from the way we used to sell it. So you've got that dynamic that just has to continue to play out. You have the renewals that you mentioned starting to come through on some of the D&A stuff in earnest in 2023 and then 2024, 2025 beginning to ramp. And then you've got over $2 billion of software sitting in backlog that is not an RPO yet because it's connected to a piece of hardware that hasn't shipped. And we recognize a bit of that upfront and then the rest over time. So we've got all of those variables in play right now. All that being said, I think you should expect \u2013 when we get to a normalized world, I would expect that once we get this supply chain in the backlog, clearly in a normal world, I would expect you would see software growth, revenue growth growing faster. But right now, with our backlog so big, that may not happen for several quarters. Scott Herren : Yes. That $2 billion of software, it's a little bit more than $2 billion sitting in our backlog right now. That's almost double where it was just a year ago, right? So there's always some that will sit in backlog, but it's almost double. And of course, most of that software is recognized ratably. So the ramp, once we can get it cleared out of the backlog and shipped, we're still going to have a ratable ramp on that. So longer term, if you remember what we said in September, we said the recurring revenue parts of our product business, we expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 15% to 17%. That's what we just put up, all right? The product subscription piece in our software business grew 17% in the quarter. So I think we're right on track in that space. Chuck Robbins : I'm trying to find the breakdown of the different franchises in, let\u2019s give where was that? Do you remember? Marilyn Mora : Yes, let me get it for you. Chuck Robbins : Okay. On the cloud side, I think I'd just \u2013 no, I don't have it in front of me. On the cloud side, here's what I would tell you is that, we are winning \u2013 continuing to win new use cases around with our integrated systems, the Silicon One systems as well as we have one use cases where they're simply buying our hardware, meaning a switch that they're running their operating system on. We have certain customers that are running multiple consumption models where one may be buying silicon and they also buy the hardware switch, one may be buying an integrated system and silicon. And so it's a variation of all of those, and we are winning new competitive use cases, and I don't think that's not what I'll look for. Okay. So it's a \u2013 sorry, I was just \u2013 Marilyn was trying to find it, but I was going to tell you, a number of customers and what \u2013 which \u2013 how many franchises we want in. I don't have that in front of me right now, and we'll try to get that. But in general, we are definitely winning new use cases. Tim Long : Okay. Great. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Next question please. Operator : David Vogt from UBS. You may go ahead. David Vogt : Great guys, thanks for taking my question. I just want to go back to capital allocation for a second. Over the last five years, you've been pretty consistent in deploying free cash flow to dividends, buybacks, although that materially correlated in the quarter and acquisitions. Can you kind of expand on your philosophy over the next several years with respect to potential uses going forward given the recent increase in the buyback today? And has your position around leverage and the use of leverage changed? And ultimately, what amount of cash flow would you be comfortable with on the balance sheet to run the business given the order strength that you're seeing, the working capital needs and supply chain uncertainty? Scott Herren : There's a lot in there, David. What I'd start by saying is the buyback that you saw, the additional buyback that you saw in Q2 and the add to our outstanding authorization to take it up to just short of $18 billion and the $0.01 increase in dividend, those are all signs of the confidence we have in our business and the growth we see ahead. So 2018, we have returned, as you alluded to, we've returned $76 billion in capital to shareholders just as 2018. There's no change in our overall cap allocation policy to answer that question for you. It starts with, first and foremost, supporting the growth of the business. through both organic and inorganic means. Obviously, we'll support the dividend. We'll, at a minimum, offset the dilution of our equity plans and beyond that, return the excess to shareholders as you saw us just do. There's no change in our overall policy. In terms of working capital, we've got \u2013 I would wager to say the strongest balance sheet in the industry. Certainly amongst our peers, we've got the strongest balance sheet out there. I don't feel like we're constrained at all by the amount of cash we have to keep on the balance sheet to support operations. David Vogt : Maybe just as a quick follow-up to that, along the same lines. Obviously, you talked about culture, tech-fit and ultimately, making it work financially if there is an M&A opportunity on the horizon, I think historically, you haven't really used your balance sheet as aggressively using leverage to do a transaction. I mean, does that fit with how you're thinking about the business going forward? Is that a consideration? Or should we expect to be in sort of the same ranges from a leverage perspective, whether it's measured on gross or net debt perspective or cash perspective in your case? Scott Herren : Yes, I don't actually think of it in those terms as it relates to M&A. It's more back to what Chuck said earlier, is it a strategic fit? Is a cultural fit? Does the valuation makes sense? Those are the kind of considerations that come into play as we're thinking about M&A versus what's the strength of the balance sheet. Again, I would stack our balance sheet up against anyone. David Vogt : Great, thanks Scott. Chuck Robbins : I want to jump back in real quick and answer \u2013 give Tim the double click that I was looking for on the use cases. So we have five players who use \u2013 our customers who use Silicon One and Cisco 8000 systems. We have two that use Silicon One with the 8000 series routers with their own operating systems. We have two that use Silicon One embedded in their own white box hardware. And we have three that use at least two of the flexible consumption modes simultaneously. So that's the data that I was trying to get to you Tim. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Chuck. Next question. Operator : Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great, thanks. Maybe just a question on passing through pricing to customers. Just what those conversations are like maybe by category of customer? And just whether you're seeing larger orders in the attempt to kind of offset some of those pricing increases? And then maybe a second question for you, Chuck. Just as you're starting to see customers move towards more architecture modernization versus just kind of catch-up spend. Maybe more specifically, by enterprises, are there \u2013 what are some of the strongest themes that you're seeing in terms of that modernization? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Yes. Thanks, Meta. So I think that clearly, we have customers who are definitely trying to buy ahead of price increases. And the conversations are, they've gone from, I'd say, being generally understanding to being a little more frustrated, primarily because of the length of time it's taken to get the product. And so they're running out of patience as we all are, but everybody generally understands. Because candidly, most of our customers are probably doing the same thing to their customers in whatever business they're in, in general, given the inflationary pressure that we see everywhere. So that\u2019s the first one. And the second one on the architectural transformations that we see out there, there\u2019s a massive one that is really being driven by hybrid work. So rearchitecting your entire network infrastructure to deal with distributed applications, distributed users, distributed data, a new security architecture to accommodate it. That\u2019s one. Obviously, within that is hybrid cloud, where you have applications running in multiple cloud providers as well as in private data centers. I mean, the demand we saw for our data center switching portfolio was extremely strong in addition to UCS, which tells me that customers are still investing in private data centers as well. So that creates traffic patterns that are not aligned with the architectures that our customers built over the last 15 years. So that\u2019s the first one. And then there are these transitions that I talked about earlier. You\u2019ve got customers upgrading to 400 gig. We\u2019re almost at 700 customers now who have 400-gig ports. We\u2019ve now taken orders for 737,000 ports. We had 200-plus thousand ports booked in the quarter, which is almost 1,500% growth. So we \u2013 400 gig is certainly taken off. The WiFi 6 transition has been pretty significant. And those are just some of the things we see. And then in the service provider space, you see 400 gig, you see 5G transition and you see them building out enterprise services based on 5G. So those are some of the major transitions that we see. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. Marilyn Mora : Next question, please. Operator : James Suva from Citigroup. You may go ahead. James Suva : Thank you. Scott, you had mentioned margins, and I think you\u2019d mentioned at this level through the rest of the year. I did want to \u2013 I just want to qualify, was that for the calendar year or fiscal year? And a little bit of color because my understanding is as you put through product price increases, customers who may have already booked things prior to those increases will still get the product, but you\u2019re still paying higher shipping costs and potentially component costs. So I wonder if in the second half of calendar year 2023, if actually margins could expand or maybe they just offset each other? Thank you. Scott Herren : Yes. I think you\u2019re thinking about it the right way, Jim. It\u2019s not a \u2013 most \u2013 a lot of what we have in the backlog of our products that were ordered pre the price increase, certainly the latest round of price increases. Logistics costs are still with us. But as I said earlier, I think that if you remember, we\u2019ve had a couple of rounds of price increases, and I think we begin to see the benefit of that first one toward the end of Q3 and expect to see it again in Q4. With the level of visibility we have, both $16 billion of short-term RPO, $30 billion of total RPO and add to that $14 billion of backlog, we have better visibility than we\u2019ve ever had as I look ahead. So feel good that the gross margins will stay in that 64% to 65% range through the second half. And that is of the fiscal year is what I\u2019m talking about, the second half of our fiscal year. James Suva : Thank you so much for the details and congratulations. Chuck Robbins : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Jim. Next question? Operator : Tal Liani from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Tal Liani : Hi, guys. I have questions on two of your segments. The first one is on security. Your trends are kind of not correlated with the industry trends. First, the previous two quarters, you slowed down materially, but now you\u2019re accelerating again, and there was acceleration over the last two quarters. Can you explain why you\u2019re seeing these trends? Why we see acceleration as much as why we saw deceleration before? And second is the service revenues. This is the fourth quarter of deceleration. We got to negative territories for growth now. Can you speak \u2013 can you also explain services? And how should we model it going forward? Chuck Robbins : Yes, Tal, thanks for the question. I\u2019ll take security, and I\u2019ll let Scott talk about services because I know he did some work on that. On the security front, I would say that we have strength in several areas of that portfolio, particularly a lot of the SaaS elements that we have in the portfolio. We do have some supply chain issues that are continuing with the firewalls. But again, the SaaS and software components grew at a healthy rate. The teams are working on a next-generation strategy right now. And I feel confident that over the next 12 months to 18 months, you should continue to see improvement in that business, but we also need to get supply chain issues still with on the firewall front. Scott, do you want to talk about services? Scott Herren : Yes, Tal, on the services piece, what you have to bear in mind is two things. Most of that\u2019s ratable. And most of that is the support services we sell attached to hardware. And so there\u2019s always a lag, right? When you build up a big ratable revenue base, it takes time to build it up. So it takes it a while to ramp up to speed, but it also takes time for it to come back down. And if you look at our product revenue rates go back 12, 18 months during the midst of the pandemic, of course, our product growth rates were quite low. And the echo effect of that is, we sold fewer services contracts, and we\u2019re selling less revenue. It takes time for that to show up in the revenue stream because so much of that is ratable and it builds up in deferred revenue and bleeds out over time. So what we\u2019re dealing with now is just the tail of the services that would have been attached to the hardware at a time when hardware sales, if you go back 12 to 18 months ago, we\u2019re fairly low. The flip side is, look at the growth of our RPO at $30.5 billion, growing 8%. Obviously, the ratable services fit inside there and the short term at $16.3 billion, growing 8% gives you a sense of what the path ahead looks that\u2019s both services and software, but it gives you a sense of what the path ahead looks like. Tal Liani : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Tal. Next question? Operator : Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Please go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Yes, thanks for taking my question. I guess the first one I have is really on the campus side \u2013 on the campus solutions side. And I\u2019m not under sense of how do you think that segment or product portfolio stacks up as we go through the rest of the year and we get back to some form of hybrid work. And also on campus, I think a lot of your peers is not every one of your peers has talked about picking up market share. You have the dominant position there. I\u2019d love to understand what you see in the marketplace and what your ability to defend share given everyone\u2019s talking about it? Chuck Robbins : Yes. Amit, I could not understand the first part of your question. Would you like repeat that one? Amit Daryanani : Yes. Chuck, I was just trying to understand, on the campus side, how do you think that segment stacks up for the year as we go back into some form of hybrid work? And then competitively, a lot of your peers have talked about picking up share. So how do you see the market share dynamic play out? Chuck Robbins : Got it. Okay. So what we believe we\u2019re seeing is this pure modernization that\u2019s occurring. We see densification of WiFi networks, in particular. So we\u2019re seeing more and more access points per workspace than what was pre-COVID to just ensure reliability, which then falls through to requiring a more robust switching infrastructure to support it. We believe customers are preparing for putting more and more video units into conference rooms, which will be hardwired, which drives more switch ports. We have more security cameras that are IP base that are going in. IoT is beginning to expand connecting building automation systems and all of those things just require an incredibly robust and resilient campus network. So we think that\u2019s what\u2019s going on. And on the second question, market share is a funny thing, and it\u2019s certainly \u2013 it\u2019s obviously based on revenue. And I can tell you that based on the growth rates from an orders perspective and how much of that is sitting in our backlog, I\u2019m not concerned. We \u2013 I cannot imagine that the market is growing faster than the order growth that we\u2019ve seen over the last three quarters. It\u2019s \u2013 just revenue. Amit Daryanani : Fair enough. And Chuck, if I could just ask you a quick one. What scenario would it take for Cisco to start being buyback about just offsetting dilution? And maybe the inverse midcaps  this is the question, how much cash is too much on your book that you may have to do more aggressive buybacks? Scott Herren : Yes. Amit, I mean, you saw we went pretty aggressive into the buyback during Q2 at $4.8 billion in the quarter. That\u2019s obviously well beyond what\u2019s required just to offset dilution. And I think, historically, if you look back, you\u2019ll see we\u2019ve been pretty aggressive on share buybacks over the last several years with the dividend and share buybacks returning $76 billion since 2018. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a change in stance or a change in demeanor as we look at that. We\u2019re constantly evaluating where we are from a cash standpoint, what our needs are. I told you the priority of our capital allocation policy has not changed. Both the growth of the business organically and organically first. The dividend, anti-dilution and beyond that, we\u2019ll return cash to shareholders. So I think that\u2019s the way you need to think about it going forward. There\u2019s no real change in policy, but you saw us get pretty aggressive in the first half of Q2. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Thank you and congrats in the quarter. Chuck Robbins : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Next question? Operator : Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Thanks for taking my questions. I had two quick ones. Chuck, you talked about the strength that you\u2019re seeing with web-scale customers within the service provider customer segment. Maybe if you can give us some details about what you\u2019re seeing from telcos and cable and though strand as well what visibility they are providing you at this point? And then from my follow-up, I just want to go back to orders again and your enterprise orders did at straight from 30% to I think 37% from first quarter to second. Is there a composition of all the orders that\u2019s driving that acceleration? Or are you seeing an underlying acceleration? Can you just kind of help us think through that? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Yes, Samik. So on the service provider space, I\u2019d say just to give you a general sense, I gave you the web-scale numbers at over 70%. I\u2019d say \u2013 and the overall service provider segment was 42%. And cable is roughly flattish, give or take a point or two. And the telco space was incredibly strong, incredibly strong for us. So both the web-scale and the telco space were the key contributors to that 42%. And then on the second question, \u2013 what was the second question? Marilyn Mora : Enterprise growth. Chuck Robbins : Enterprise growth. Thank you. Yes, when you look at it across \u2013 I mean, whether you look at it across the geographies or you look at across \u2013 generally across our product portfolio, or even across verticals, it was just super consistent. I mean it was \u2013 every customer seems to be moving right now. And so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s not one specific thing to call out. It was pretty broad-based. Marilyn Mora : And I think that was our last question for the call. And Chuck, do you want to close with some closing remarks? Chuck Robbins : Yes, I do, Marilyn. Thank you. First of all, I\u2019m proud of what we were able to accomplish in Q2 despite the ongoing component demands or component dynamics, the product order growth, the revenue, the EPS, the ARR growth, the RPO growth, the balanced growth across the world. Really pleased with our continued success in web-scale and just happy that our customers are choosing our technology as they continue down this digital transformation path. I think it speaks to the relevance and criticality of what we\u2019re building and what our teams have built \u2013 and I want to just take a minute to thank all the Cisco employees because it\u2019s been an incredibly difficult couple of years. I think the team has showed a great deal of resiliency, delivered breakthrough innovation and really doing everything we can to take care of our customers. So \u2013 thanks for spending time with us today, and we\u2019ll talk to you next time. Marilyn Mora : Great. Thanks, Chuck.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Marilyn Mora : Welcome everyone to Cisco's third quarter fiscal 2022 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the investor relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the financial information section of our investor relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be done on a year-over-year basis. Please note, included in the materials that accompany this call is a slide which summarizes the impacts from the war in Ukraine and the extra week in Q3 fiscal 2021. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2022. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties, including COVID-19, that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone. When we spoke with you back in February, we entered Q3 in the second half of our fiscal year with optimism despite the supply and component challenges and other headwinds impacting us and many of our peers. Many of those factors that fueled that optimism remain unchanged today. We continue to see strong demand resulting in record backlog, our business transformation is progressing well and our differentiated innovation across our portfolio is helping our customers embrace and adopt the multiple technology transitions happening. However, there were two unanticipated events since our last earnings call, which impacted our Q3 revenue performance. The first is the war in Ukraine. This resulted in us ceasing operations in Russia and Belarus and had a corresponding revenue impact, which Scott will discuss. The second relates to COVID related lockdowns in China, which began in late March. These lockdowns resulted in an even more severe shortage of certain critical components. This in turn prevented us from shipping products to customers at the levels we originally anticipated heading into Q3. Our Q4 guidance incorporates a wider than usual range, taking into account the revenue impact of the war in Ukraine and the continuing uncertainty related to the China COVID lockdowns. Given this uncertainty, we're being practical about the current environment and erring on the side of caution in terms of our outlook, taking it one quarter at a time. We believe that our revenue performance in the upcoming quarters is less dependent on demand and more dependent on the supply availability in this increasingly complex environment. While certain aspects of the current situation are largely out of our control, our teams have been working on several mitigation actions to help alleviate many of the component issues that we've been facing. We believe that we will begin to see the benefits of these actions in the first half of next fiscal year. Now let me talk more specifically about our third quarter performance. As I just mentioned, many of the positives we've discussed over the past few quarters remain, resulting in continued solid demand for our solutions. Total product orders grew 8% year-over-year leading to yet another record backlog of well over $15 billion, up 10% sequentially and up 130% year-over-year. This momentum reaffirms the critical role we play in our customers' futures. Our business transformation also progressed nicely. In Q3, we saw ARR growth of 11%, ending the quarter at over $22 billion, and product ARR growth of 18%. We also exited the quarter with over $30 billion in remaining performance obligations or RPO. We also delivered non-GAAP EPS at the high end of our guidance range. This was driven by effective pricing actions and spending discipline, all of which allowed us to offset lower volumes and deliver both gross and operating margins above the high end of our guidance range and deliver on our bottom-line profitability target for the quarter. I want to reiterate what I said earlier. The fundamental drivers across our business are strong. While we are facing some short-term challenges, it does not change our long-term outlook, our alignment to our customers' most critical challenges or our belief in the tremendous opportunities in front of us. Last week, we hosted our Global Customer Advisory Board meeting where we met with close to 100 customers. And they consistently shared that technology is at the heart of their strategy and has become even more important to everything they do. This driving not just their strategies, but also their overall business transformation. The technology they're adopting from Cisco is driving their business agility, allowing them to move with greater speed and empowering them to deliver differentiated experiences for their customers. Now I'd like to touch on some highlights from the quarter. We continue to see strong demand in several areas of our business. Our web-scale business remains strong as we continue to help these customers build their capabilities to connect and serve their customers and end users at scale from the data center to the edge. This is leading to continued strength in orders, which grew over 50% and on a trailing four-quarter basis, we had over 100% growth. This marks our ninth consecutive quarter of solid demand as we are winning new franchises, expanding our design wins and taking share in web scale. I remain incredibly proud of the progress we've made in the momentum we have in this space. We are also extremely pleased with the traction of our 400 gig solutions, including the Cisco 8,000, which is the fastest growing SP routing platform in Cisco's history. In addition, our Silicon One portfolio, ZR and ZR plus optics and our Acacia portfolio of optical networking products also continue to perform well. From a product revenue perspective, our performance was led by solid demand across a majority of our portfolio, including switching, SP routing, wireless, security and SD WAN. Our performance in these areas reflecting ongoing investments that our customers are making to rapidly digitize their organizations to deliver differentiated experiences. Looking forward, the shift to hybrid cloud, 5G, 400 gig, IoT, hybrid work and the explosion of applications are driving the increased need for next generation networking, connectivity, security, and observability solutions. Cisco is well positioned to deliver for our customers with our end-to-end platforms and solutions. I'm also very proud of our pace of innovation. During the quarter, Cisco announced new innovations across our networking and cloud portfolios along with technologies to enhance experiences and hybrid work environments. We also introduced our new predictive networks to help organizations learn, predict and avoid network disruptions. We have even more innovation, which we'll announce at RSA and our own Cisco Live event in June. In addition to our deep passion for innovation, all of us at Cisco believe we have a unique opportunity to help make the world a better place through both the technology we build and the purpose we rally around to power an inclusive future for all. I believe this intersection of technology and purpose is why we were named the number one Best Company to Work For in the U.S. by Fortune and Great Place to Work for the second year in a row. In summary, while the quarter clearly did not play out as expected, demand remains solid and the fundamentals of our business are strong. We remain focused on executing against the strategy we laid out at our Investor Day. We will also continue to be resolute in our focus to transform our business for more predictability and agility while bringing to market a robust pipeline of innovation. We remain confident in our long-term growth and the opportunities that we have in front of us. I want to thank our teams around the world for all that they do, executing with dedication, focus and excellence in an incredibly dynamic environment. They continue to focus on our customers with unparalleled innovation, resiliency and determination. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Scott. Scott Herren : Thanks, Chuck. We saw solid growth in product orders, net income and earnings per share despite the challenges Chuck just outlined. Product order growth was driven by strength across most of our portfolio while disciplined spend and supply chain management drove our profitability. Total revenue was $12.8 billion, flat year-over-year. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 34.7%, up 110 basis points coming in above the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP net income was $3.6 billion, up 3% and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.87, up 5%, coming in at the high end of our guidance range. In March, we stopped business operations in both Russia and Belarus, which had a negative impact to revenue of approximately $200 million or two percentage points of growth. Historically, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine collectively have represented approximately 1% of our total revenue. The impact this quarter was a bit higher than our historical run rate due to additional charges to revenue we recorded for uncollectible receivables and other items. And as a reminder, Q3 of last year included an extra week, which was a benefit of total revenue in Q3 of '21 of approximately three full percentage points of growth. On a combined basis, the impact of the year-over-year total revenue growth rate for the extra week and the war in Ukraine was approximately five percentage points. Looking at our Q3 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $9.4 billion, up 3%. Service revenue was $3.4 billion, down 8%, driven by the extra week in the prior year and the war in Ukraine, which combined, impacted our growth by approximately 8 percentage points. Within product revenue, Secure, Agile Networks was solid with revenues up 4%, switching grew driven by strength in data center switching with our Nexus 9000 products, campus switching growth was led by our Catalyst 9000 and Meraki switching offerings. Wireless had a double-digit increase driven by broad-based strength across our portfolio, including our WiFi-6 products and Meraki wireless offerings. We also had solid growth in Servers. Enterprise routing declined primarily driven by Edge and Access was slightly offset by strength in SD-WAN. Internet for the Future was up 6%, driven by strength in Acacia, optical, optics and core networking products including double-digit growth in the Cisco 8000. Collaboration was down 7%, driven by declines in our meetings, calling and contact center offerings, partially offset by the continued ramp of our communication platform-as-a-service. End-to-End Security grew 7% with broad strength across most of the portfolio. Our Zero Trust portfolio performed well with double-digit growth driven by strong performance in our Duo offering. Optimized Application Experiences was up 8%, driven by double-digit growth in both of our SaaS based offerings ThousandEyes and Intersight. We continue to make progress on our transformation metrics as we shift our business to more subscriptions and software. Total software revenue was $3.7 billion, a decrease of 3% with the product portion down 1%. Total software revenue growth would have been 5 points higher excluding the combined negative impact of the extra week in the prior year and the war in Ukraine. 83% of software revenue was subscription-based, which is up one percentage point year-on-year. Total subscription revenue was $5.5 billion, a decrease of 4%. Total subscription revenue would have been 7 points higher, excluding the combined negative impact of the extra week in the prior year and the war in Ukraine. Total subscription revenue represented 43% of Cisco's total revenue. Annualized recurring revenue or ARR was $22.4 billion, an increase of 11% with strong product ARR growth of 18%. And remaining performance obligations or RPO was $30.2 billion, up 7%. Product RPO increased 13%, service RPO increased 3%, and the total short term RPO grew 9% to $16.2 billion. We had solid product order growth in Q3 of 8% with strength across most of the business. Looking at our geographic segments, the Americas was up 9%, EMEA up 4%, and APJC up 11%. In our customer markets, commercial was up 19%, service provider was up 8%, public sector was up 4%, and enterprise was flat. From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margin came in above the high end of our guidance range at 65.3%, down 70 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 64.1%, down 80 basis points and service gross margin was 68.9%, up 20 basis points. The decrease in product gross margin was primarily driven by ongoing higher component costs related to supply constraints as well as higher freight and logistics costs, partially offset by strong positive pricing impact. We continue to manage through the supply constraints seen industrywide by us and our peers. To give a sense of scale of the shortages, we currently see constraints in Q4 on roughly 350 critical components, out of a total of 41,000 unique component part numbers. Our supply chain team is aggressively pursuing multiple options to close those shortages. Given our solid product orders, we once again saw a significant increase in our backlog levels for both hardware and software well beyond our normal historical levels. As Chuck said, our ending product backlog grew to well over $15 billion and software backlog grew to more than $2 billion, both up 10% sequentially. And just a reminder, backlog is not included as part of our $30.2 billion and remaining performance obligations. We ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $20.1 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $3.7 billion, down 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by advanced payments to secure future supply. These advanced payments had a negative 9 percentage point year-on-year impact on Q3 operating cash flow. In terms of capital allocation, we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders during the quarter, that was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and approximately $250 million of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have returned a total of approximately $10 billion in value to our shareholders via cash dividends and stock repurchases and more than $17 billion available under our Board stock repurchase authorization. To summarize, we're navigating the highly complex environment while continuing to make progress on our business model shift and making strategic investments in innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities and expanding addressable markets. Now let me provide our financial guidance for Q4. In terms of supply, we expect the challenges we experienced in Q3 to continue into Q4. For next quarter, we expect revenue growth to be in the range of minus 1% to minus 5.5%. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 64% to 65%. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 31.5% to 33.5% and non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.76 to $0.84. For the full year fiscal '22, guidance is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 2% to 3% year-on-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.29 to $3.37, up 2% to 5% year-on-year. In both our Q4 and full year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Scott. Michelle, let's go ahead and queue up the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley Investment Research. You may go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great, thanks. Maybe Chuck, if you could just kind of give us sense and what you're seeing in macro from your customers? I know that the enterprise orders were flat year-over-year. Just -- are you seeing any change in their behavior either just given what's happening in overall macro conditions or just currency and inflation would be helpful? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Yes, Meta. Thank you. So on the demand issue, I'd point out a few things. Number one, without a 2-percentage point of orders that we de-booked relative to Russia and Belarus, we grew 10% against a year ago growth of 10%. So we feel good about that. Our customers are not signaling any real shift at this point. We're not hearing that from them. Again, we had our global customer advisory board just a couple of weeks ago where we had 100 of our biggest customers and they were all talking about projects in the strategic nature of everything they're trying to accomplish. The last thing I would point out is on the enterprise side, last quarter we grew 37%. Just to keep in mind the way we define enterprise is a finite list of named customers. So it tends to be more lumpy. If I look at how the industry defines enterprise, that would reflect a combination of our enterprise and our commercial business. So for comparisons to what we're hearing in the marketplace, I thought we would give you that combined number. If you combine enterprise and commercial together, we grew 9%, but without the Russia impact, we actually grew 12% and on a trailing 12 months basis it grew 28%. So we are still comfortable with the demand signals that we're seeing and our customers aren't telling us anything differently right now. Meta Marshall : Great, thanks. I'll pass it on. Marilyn Mora : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. You may go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess Chuck, on the demand question again, just you're guiding to the fiscal fourth quarter to be now almost sort of similar to what the third quarter is or even down a bit, which is, if I go back historically, has never really -- I don't see many instances of that. I mean is that really a reflection of the supply environment or are there any other sort of aspects of demand stemming from the geopolitical sort of situation here that's impacting that? And when do we sort of start to see you sort of cycle past some of that? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Yes. Samik, it's a great question. So let me start with just the basic answer is there is no reflection of demand issue in our Q4 guide, that has nothing to do with the Q4 guide. Let me try to describe how we got to that. I think it's important for everybody to understand. When we look at our Q3 results, we had -- from a revenue perspective, we had $200 million impact from us ceasing operations in Russia and corresponding revenue write-downs that occurred. Those were one-time. We then had, if you recall, our quarter ends at the end of April. Most of what you've heard from others, they are quarters into the end of March. So we experienced an entire quarter of the China lockdowns. In Shanghai, it was from March 27 until today. Shenzhen shut down, but again it opened up a week later, so we're talking really about the Shanghai situation. So we had $200 million from Russia and then we had $300 million that was completely attributed to our inability to get power supplies out of China. That's the simplicity of what caused the problem. As an example, we had 11,000 PCB assemblies built, we couldn't get power supplies for because of the lockdown. That's a simple fact of what happened in Q3. When we look at Q4 and you think about the Shanghai lockdown and what we've heard because in Shanghai, there are lots of components that go into our power supplies. So we're not able to get those components. Shanghai now is saying they're going to open up June 1. We don't know exactly what that means and what that means to when that implies that we would start getting any supply out. And correspondingly we believe when they open up and when they do allow transportation logistics to start up, we believe there is going to be a high degree of congestion. We believe that there is going to be lots of competition for ports capacity, airport capacity. And we just believe that that combined with the inbound efforts, trying to get raw materials back into the country, et cetera, we just believe that it's going to be impossible for us to catch up on this issue in Q4, which is what led to the guidance in Q4. So even though these top line numbers don't look good, it's very simple explanation as to what occurred. So then the follow-on part of your question is, when do we think this gets better. Well, if we make the assumption that China does begin to open up and we do begin to get more natural flow of the power supplies. We also have had our teams over the last six to nine months have been working on a lot of mitigating actions, redesigning 100 products, over 100 products to give us component diversity, we believe that a combination of those starting in our Q1 and in the first half of our year will start to see the benefit of that. So, that's when we expect to see it improve to some extent. We need to get through the next 90 days, but I'm just being as transparent as I can about what we see and when we think some of that improvement will occur. Samik Chatterjee : Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Samik. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. You may go ahead, sir. Ittai Kidron : Thanks. Hi, guys. I guess I want to dig into that a little bit, Chuck, on the supply chain. You seem to be much more impacted than some of your peers in the industry. So I'm just trying to gauge whether you have an unusually high exposure to China that others do not. Is there any color you can give us on what percentage of your components come from China and why is it that you stand out relative to a couple others? And I understand that you had in April quarter, some of them had in March, but they did report mid late April and none of them have signaled anything. And so clearly, they've seen what's happening in April and they haven't said anything. And then I guess as a second part of this, just thinking kind of longer term, just given the challenges to a geopolitically Ukraine, Russia and the risks that are associated with China on a geopolitical standpoint, but also clearly in their COVID policy, is there any some sort of a long-term planning that disconnects you from China as a source for components longer term? Chuck Robbins : Yes, Ittai, thank you. Both good questions. I think on the first one, I think that the biggest differentiation was April. I have spoken to peers who are feeling the same thing we are that we are reporting the full month of impact and it wasn't April issue for us. So now on a normalized basis for that question across the portfolio, all of us design products with different components in. So there is opportunity for us to have a unique issue with one component that we may have designed into a product or we may have an unique advantage because we designed a certain component into a product. And those are the areas where I talked about we're redesigning where we have unique problems or just problems in general, though others may have the same problems. So we think that the exposure in general was because of the month of April. Also we do massive volumes. And in general, you would think that's a huge advantage, but just to put it in perspective, we shipped more revenue in the last week of our quarter than many of our competitors that you're referencing shipped in their entire quarter. So it's just an issue that it shows up in a bigger number for us than it would. If they have the same problem, it might be a $20 million impact for us, it might be a $200 million -- $400 million impact. So that's the first one. The second one what I would say is that we are constantly evaluating our global supply chain. And so it's not about one country, it's about resilience. And the way we've designed supply chains over the last 15-20 years as an industry, I think we all realize we're evolving that now at the same time that we're triaging all of the current issues that we have. So our teams have a dual challenge. But we are constantly driving geographic resilience. The example I would give is that we -- before COVID we had regional redundancy built in, we did not have a plan for a country to shut down. And so it takes time to go out and create that geographic resilience, but our teams are working on all of those kinds of things right now, so they will continue to do that Ittai. Ittai Kidron : Okay, thanks. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Ittai. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may go ahead, sir. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. Hopefully, I'll make sense here, but I want to give this a shot. Your gross margin looked relatively resilient in the quarter and the outlook and your revenue was like we've seen the opposite from some of your peers. And I'm wondering if part of the issue is the usage of brokers in paying very high fees for parts in the -- I guess, secondary or tertiary markets, is that something you didn't do and that prevented you from reaching revenue, but allowed you to have a better gross margin? I'm just trying to understand some of your practices relative to your peers that allowed you have a good gross margin, but the lighter sales. Is that it will make sense? Chuck Robbins : Yes. It absolutely does, Simon. Let me start and then I'll kick it to Scott to talk a little bit about it. So, first and foremost, we are incredibly active purchasers in the broker market. And you can imagine, with our buying power, they call us first. And so -- no, that has nothing to do with it. In fact, we've spent a lot of time with our supply chain team who had given us examples of where they've bought product in the broker market recently. So I don't think that's it. But Scott can explain what did happen there. Scott Herren : Yes, it's a great question, Simon. What I'd add is, if you recall, we did two price increases this year. The first one enrolled in right about the end of the calendar year and the second one at the beginning of our second quarter. And we said at the time that we thought -- you continue to ask like what are those price increases, when they are going to show up in the top line? And we said we thought we would begin to see the benefit of those toward the end of the third quarter, which is the quarter we just closed and that's exactly what happened. So while the unit shipments in the quarter were off because of the issues that we've talked about with the supply chain with the component supply, the -- we were able to offset that with pretty strong pricing. In fact, the list -- we published this in our Q, so you'll see it there, but our pricing was up about 160 basis points in Q3. So while we do have a unit impact from the component supply, it was offset by some of the things that we're doing in the -- we are beginning to realize on the price front. We are actively pursuing every avenue. It's got to be a qualified vendor and so we're working to qualify different sources at the same time. We are actively pursuing that whether it's through a broker, obviously directly from the vendor, but through a broker, distributor, we're pursuing all those channels and that is creating a bit of a headwind to us. Simon Leopold : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Michelle, next question please. Operator : Thank you. Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead. Sami Badri : Hi, thank you. First one is a clarification on the product order growth number that was reported at 8%. Could you give us an idea on how much price increases contributed to the product order growth number? That's the first question. And then just a second question is, we're just trying to piece together and explain even after accounting for the Russia, Ukraine contribution, why enterprise would grow 0% versus some of your peers that are reporting far greater reports and trends in specifically enterprise? Could we just try to maybe triangulate a little bit more about what's going on there? Chuck Robbins : Okay. First, I'll let Scott add on the price increase in a moment, but first of all, the price increase really did not have significant impact on our growth. We only passthrough pricing at the time that was offsetting our incremental cost. And to be honest, we've incurred more cost since then. So we were at a place right now where we have not even passed through all the costs that we have incurred. We're getting price increases all the time now. So that's the first answer. On the second one, the easiest thing for me to tell you is what I said earlier that the way our peers view and report and the industry views and reports enterprise would be the combination of our enterprise and commercial business which last quarter would have grown 9% and would have grown 12% without -- or it grew 9%, but would have been 12% without Russia. So if you think about the size of that those two businesses combined growing 9%, I'm pretty comfortable that the demand is still there. And if you look at our commercial business, which usually is the leading indicator of a shift of demand momentum, they grew 19% in the quarter. So I'm not concerned. Scott Herren : Yes. And Sami to the first part of your question, the 160 basis point impact that we saw in Q3 from pricing is a revenue statement. Obviously to go from bookings to revenue, it first has to flow through the backlog and then get realized. So the impact on bookings while we haven't quantified, it would be a little bit higher than that 160 basis points. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead, sir. Rod Hall : Yes, hi, thanks for the question. I guess, I want to come back because I think the main investor question coming out of this will be these product orders, Chuck. And I know you're saying that combined that a -- I heard all the things that you said there. I think that if you look at the sequential movement on those, it's quite a bit below normal seasonality. Even if you give the 10% growth on a year over year basis on the product orders, you're still down mid-single digits sequentially and that's way below normal seasonality. But we know that we're coming off historic highs on these product orders. So I guess what I'm wondering is if you can give us any idea on trajectory on product orders as we head into next quarter? Because I could see a scenario where product orders declined to kind of 2019 July levels in which case you'd be down double digits, but you'd still be in good product order territory. If that makes any sense. So I'm hoping maybe you could just give us a little bit more color on what you think that trajectory looks like and how those orders are normalizing over time? And then maybe I have a follow-up. I mean that's kind of a long question. Thanks. Chuck Robbins : I got you Rod and you're actually thinking about the right way. You think about exactly the way I'm thinking about it. So first thing I'll say is that I think any seasonality right now is out the window with the current situation and with what we've seen with the order demand. We were doing 18-month planning with certain customers. And if they placed 18 months' worth of orders last quarter and now they're going to pause and we may be doing it with three fewer customers this quarter. So I mean it's just -- it's a very difficult thing to get your head around. So there's two things that I look at. Number one, what is our quarterly growth rate vis-a-vis a year ago to see because I think about momentum of demand from one quarter to the next sort of -- you have to look at that delta, right. Because if you grow 30% on 1% and then you grew 30% on 15%, then that would be declining demand momentum. That's the way I think about the math, right. So that's one thing we watch for. But the second thing is I think to your point I've been talking to the team about it, when we start comparing against these 30% quarters, I think we have to go back two years and get a real assessment because those numbers we know had pull ahead in. We don't know how much as we've talked about, but I think you're right. We have to sort of doing analysis from two years back to really feel like what do we really seeing right now and that's -- it's going to be a difficult thing for us to navigate because the historical way we've looked at these metrics just won't apply right now. And I think once we cycle through a year, another four quarters of the stuff, maybe we get to normalized -- a normalized view. As I've said, we're going to go through a phase where our order demand growth will be lagging our revenue growth and then hopefully we'll get to a point where those two will get back into more of a predictive model and we just got to get there. Rod Hall : Okay, that's great. And I guess, Chuck, on that subject, I know you talked to a lot of CIOs, CEOs, what are people thinking now? I mean it seems like everywhere you look there is bad news and it's hard to believe people are feeling like they want to spend a lot of money, but I'm curious -- yet the demand still seems pretty good, so I'm just curious what you're hearing from people, how the tone of conversations is going? Chuck Robbins : I think COVID changed everything about how our customers think about technology. I think that pre-COVID a lot of customers when they went to slow spending, they would stop spending on technology. And I think COVID had them feel the impact of those decisions. And they're not -- they're going to be very prudent about stopping key projects that are giving them customer differentiation capabilities or modernization of their infrastructure or supporting hybrid work or making sure they're not falling behind their competitors. I mean, it's just a different day to day relative to what CEOs, the public sector leaders, how they think about technology and the importance of it. Even though they thought it, it was really important three years ago, their understanding of today is much different. And so I'm not saying they won't make those decisions. I just think there is a higher bar for them to make those decisions. Rod Hall : Great, thank you very much. Marilyn Mora : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Tal Liani from Bank of America. You may go ahead, sir. Tal Liani : I have -- I still have difficulties to model next year because we still didn't even start comparing the high growth rates of orders. This is we're still comparing 10% to 10% of last year. Next quarter, you're getting to 30%. And you have multiple quarters of 30%. At that point of time, revenue growth should accelerate just because of supply chain starts -- supposed to get better somewhere or your actions, but we are seeing order growth decelerating instead of accelerating. Should we -- when we look at the next few quarters, could there be a combination of both order growth going down materially, maybe even to negative levels at the same time also revenue growth being negative. I mean, I'm trying to understand how to think about the next few quarters. Thanks. Chuck Robbins : You want to take it, Scott? Scott Herren : Yes, Tal, I think the way to think about it is back to one of the statistics that we gave you first time last quarter and then again this quarter. We've got backlog now greater than $15 billion in product. And within that, more than $2 billion of software sitting in backlog. You add that to the $30 billion plus of RPO we've got and we're sitting on about $45 billion of sales we've transacted that have not yet accreted to the revenue line. So I think it for as you think about the way you want to model out next year, you need to think about the rate and pace of revenue growth being dependent on supply versus being dependent on in quarter bookings growth. And that's certainly the way I think about it. Tal Liani : And when you think about the order trends, I mean order is dollars, but not all the product has the same trends. There are some of the products that are very big in terms of contribution like service provider side, et cetera. I have to guess that the trends there are better than the trends in the enterprise, et cetera. So does it mean the order numbers that you provide, can you dig in a little bit deeper below just a single number for orders and tell us the areas where order growth is better and the areas where order growth is actually worse? Scott Herren : Yes, I think some of that is available in the slides that we'll put up online. It may also be in the press release. We talked about enterprise. Enterprise orders were flat for the quarter, but then you have to normalize in the impact of the Russia and Belarus, the decision to stop operations in Russia and Belarus, that would take it up to 3% growth in orders. That's following a quarter where enterprise grew 37% and the quarter before that it grew 30%. So with these -- the way we define enterprise, as Chuck talked about, it's our biggest customers. And that business by definition is going to be a bit lumpy. But on a trailing 12 months, it's actually quite strong. We continue to see nice growth in SP, particularly in web scale. We gave you some of those stats during the call as well. Those are doing well. Public sector continues to hold up. Public sector demand has continued to be fine for us. And commercial, you remember we talked about this when we first went into the pandemic that we saw commercial tip down before the rest of the sales tip down. And then as things begin to recover in late fiscal '20, we saw commercial tip up. It tends to be a leading indicator for us. And commercial growth product, order growth was up 19% last quarter. So we're not seeing -- if that's the leading indicator and it certainly has been for us, we're not seeing any weakness in demand at this point. Tal Liani : Got it. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Tal. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Paul Silverstein with Cowen. You may go ahead, sir. Paul Silverstein : Guys, if I could ask for two clarifications. First of I think I heard you say the $300 million kind of what's showing high revenue impact in Q3. I didn't hear you say what's the expected revenue impact is in Q4. Can you share that list? Chuck Robbins : Hi, Paul. Thanks. Yes, we had -- in Q3, it was very simple for us to articulate it because we know exactly what we were expecting and everything else. We don't have the ability in Q4 to understand when they're really going to open up and how much we're going to get, et cetera, which caused us to create the range we did. And just -- we're just being realistic about what we believe we'll be able to get out the door, but to actually peg it to power supplies, in particular, is pretty difficult. But I mean most of the issues that we see right now, the concerning area right now is really getting that open -- getting China opened up again, getting the stuff shipping and we need to see that. So Scott, you want to add something? Scott Herren : Yes, what I'd add to that is we give the example of power supplies because that was a constraint in Q3 and part of the issue that we had in Q3 is that constraint came up very late in the quarter, right. When Shanghai went into lockdown, we didn't immediately see that hit. It hit more towards the second half of April which, of course, was within our quarter. It wasn't within the quarter of many of our peers. And there was just no time to recover from that, but I don't want you to oversimplify and I hope I'm not leading into that. It's not just power supplies. We've got issues in a number of different areas. I tried to give you a sense of scale because I know it's 41,000 unique components what we said is about 350 have potential supply concerns right now. We're working those every day and every day some of them get resolved and then every day a couple more will come on to that list. So it's not -- unfortunately, it would be convenient if it was just one or two things and we could say here's exactly what those are. It is a very dynamic situation. And what we're trying to do if you zoom up a level and say, we're not assuming it gets better or worse as we scroll through Q4 and that's what's built into the guide. Paul Silverstein : But Chuck and Scott the obvious question is to that statement of the $1 billion, $1 billion plus shortfall in guidance rolled to Street expectations, is that all the lack visibility you have, the concern -- the understandable concern we have with respect to supply? Is that all in the supply portion of the equation? Going back to all the many questions have been asked about your order book to slowdown in orders and the quality of demand, is any of that shortfall in your guidance to be a concern about demand or is that all on the supply side of the equation? Scott Herren : Zero. There is no demand impact our Q4 guide. Paul Silverstein : It's a 100% supply. Scott Herren : 100% supply. Paul Silverstein : One other quick clarification on this topic. If we look at the linearity of your order book. I know, normally we talk about linearity of revenue. But if you look at the linearity of your orders during the quarter, post the quarter, up to this call, what do we see? Scott Herren : It was normal, very normal. Paul Silverstein : So you've seen no degradation at all? Scott Herren : No. Chuck Robbins : Q3 was right in line with normal pattern. And I think Paul, the thing to remember is, yes, we're a little skewed because we had three quarters of 30%. If we went back a year and a half and I said we're going to grow 10% product orders on top of a 10% quarter from a year ago, we would have been quite happy with it. We're just worried about it because it's fallen 330s when there was a lot of planned purchase built into. So we will tell you. Obviously next quarter we'll have an update, but right now, it doesn't feel like there's any significant shift. Paul Silverstein : And Chuck a cynic would say you didn't see anything last quarter relative to you're talking. I understand the last quarter about three straight quarters of 30 plus percent growth. You don't advertise, advise about any expected slowdown or looking at any slowdown and now the tune is changed. I'm just playing devil's advocate here obviously, but -- Chuck Robbins : Paul, that's fine. But we never have any commentary about future bookings expectations. Paul Silverstein : Okay. I'll pass it on. I appreciate it. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Paul. Next question. Operator : Thank you. David Vogt from UBS. You may go ahead, sir. David Vogt : Great. Thanks everyone for taking the time to taking my question. I just had a follow-up on backlog and near term RPO. If I'm not mistaken, I think your near term RPO is flat sequentially at roughly $16.2 billion, $16.3 billion. And if I tack on sort of a $1 billion increase quarter-over-quarter in your backlog, given sort of the supply chain constraints that you've articulated and maybe what some of your peers are saying, I mean, I guess I'm trying to triangulate on what the revenue trajectory looks like as we go into next year? I mean you mentioned Chuck that there is seasonality out of the window, but within the realm of possibility that we could start the year, next year and the first half at sort of a run rate on where we are today as we exit this year. I mean is that a realistic probability given on how revenue kind of flows through? And then I have a quick clarification follow-up. Chuck Robbins : Sure. On the RPO that we talked about, you got the number right, $16.2 billion of short-term RPO, which is up 9%. And so short term by definition means that accretes into the revenue stream in the next 12 months. That growing by 9% is a pretty good leading indicator of at least what that piece of -- how that piece of our business looks as we go into Q4 and then we'll give you an update on how short-term RPO growth looks at the end of Q4 and you can get a sense of it in the end of fiscal '23. David Vogt : Great. And then maybe just as a follow-up. When you think about where backlog peaks and where maybe purchase order commitments on year end peaks, obviously in our supply chains kind of for a lot of -- sort of the calculation of the window, but as you look at your order book and what you see from a demand perspective from your customers, how would you sort of handicap where we think we reach that sort of peak commitment from your perspective to make sure that you have the appropriate components and parts to meet the demand longer term? Right? We're talking about as order growth decelerates from 8% in this quarter and ultimately could decelerate a little bit further, are we a little bit closer to peak on both of those metrics than maybe we thought a quarter or two ago? Scott Herren : Yes, there is kind of two angles to that David that I'll try to touch on. One is the, when does the backlog itself peak and while we don't forecast that, it would not surprise me to see it grow again in Q4. On the second piece in terms of purchase commitments you saw they were up pretty substantially again in Q3, I guess, back to the earlier question of as our supply chain team not being aggressive enough in pursuing parts, purchase commitments now set at a pretty high level and inventory sits at a pretty high level. And that's so that as we clear the supply constraints on a few critical components, we can actually quickly convert that into finished goods product and get it in the hands of our customers who want those products. So is the peak now, is the peak in Q4, Q1, really a lot depends on the fluidity of availability of these critical components that we're chasing down? David Vogt : Thanks, Scott. Scott Herren : I hope that makes sense to you. We were sitting on both a record backlog and record inventory, which seems like it's in contrast with one another. But it's not, right. We're holding onto the parts that we've got and we just have to get the remainder to square the sets and get those built out the door. David Vogt : Yes. No, that makes sense. We're trying to understand sort of your cash flow conversion, so that's helpful. Thanks. Marilyn Mora : All right. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Pierre Ferragu, you may go ahead from New Street Research. Ben Harwood : Hi, thanks for taking the question. This is Ben Harwood standing in for Pierre. We had a couple of questions. So firstly, you talked about most of your issues arising in April. So the full cost was around 4%, 5% below expectations. Does this mean productivity was around 10%, 15% below your expectations? And then secondly, what happens to this demand economy in the third and fourth quarter? Do you think it spills over into 2023 and then what would give you confidence on that? And then what kind of timeframe should we expect that lost demand to be met? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : You want to take it, Scott? Scott Herren : Yes. Ben on the first part of your question, I didn't exactly follow your math, but relative to expectations we talked about, yes, in the month of April, we talked about the -- obviously the decision we made to stop operations in Russia, Belarus, had a $200 million impact of the quarter. Most of that was -- it was two months of revenue that we had to forego and there were some receivables we had to write off within that. On the supply chain side, we would have made up the remainder of that delta to our expectations for the quarter. I hope that answers your question. I'm not quite sure I followed what you were trying to get at with that. Ben Harwood : I was just saying that the amount that we said we missed by, if you look at what we would have expected in April from a linearity perspective, it was a certain percentage of it. So it's just a mathematical issue, probably correct, but we didn't check. Scott Herren : Yes. I don't actually think about it in those terms. Ben Harwood : I don't either. Scott Herren : But yes, again if that didn't answer your question, Ben, we can follow-up afterwards. Ben Harwood : Okay. Marilyn Mora : All right, thanks, Ben. Ben Harwood : Okay. He asked a second one, too, about the backlog rolling over into '23. Chuck Robbins : Yes, I mean with the backlog. So a couple of things. I think what you may be trying to get out on the backlog question is the durability of that backlog. And there is -- this is something that obviously we've been tracking very closely. What I'd say on order cancellations is they continue to run at a rate that is actually below where it was pre-pandemic. So we're not seeing any cancellations there. We continue to see very strong pipeline and pipeline build, which is something else that I think you would expect to see weaken if there was softening demand. As we look at kind of further out with what's sitting in the backlog, we've also put in place a policy change that says those orders are non-cancelable with all orders are non-cancelable within 45 days of the committed ship date. That just went into place in the beginning of February. So orders that we've received since then within 45 days of shipment are non-cancelable. And for our biggest customers, we've been working with them on a bespoke basis to put in place agreements where we will guarantee supply, but they guarantee that those orders will not be rescheduled or canceled. So feel good about the durability of the backlog we've got. Ben Harwood : Okay. Marilyn Mora : Thank you. Next question. Operator : Tim Long with Barclays. You may go ahead, sir. Tim Long : Thank you. Two if I could as well. First, Chuck, the gross margins we talked about was good. A lot of that was pricing. It seems like you guys are in a strong pricing position now. If you look out a few quarters if and when things normalize, do you think pricing pressure remains or do you think that's something that will be a give back to the industry or to the customers. So is that sustainable from a margin standpoint? And second, I was hoping you could dig into software more? I heard a lot of that kind of unique one-time factors in there, but still even ex those, probably not great growth when you look at the software opportunities ahead of Cisco. Could you just give us the things to watch over the next few quarters that could start to reaccelerate growth in that software line? Chuck Robbins : Yes. So, Tim, on the first one -- thanks for the questions, by the way. On the first one, I think that as we see if we see reductions in our input costs over time, then we will take into consideration whether we pass those through to the customers. The reality is as we've taken on so many input costs increases that we haven't passed onto customers that will look at it holistically at the time where that stuff begins to occur is what I would tell you. I'm glad you asked on the software growth because I think it's something that we want to explain. So it's a little difficult to understand completely and we have a really interesting quarter because the extra week a year ago in the Russia situation and the supply chain situation. So let me try to take you through what's going on in software. If you start with the fact that we have well over $2 billion of software in backlog that is connected to a piece of hardware that we will not begin recognizing the revenue until the hardware ships. So -- and that's up $1 billion year-over-year. So there is a large component of software that we're not recognizing right now that we would in normal times. So it's the first piece. And then if you take into consideration the extra week from a year ago where we do ratable recognition of revenue on a daily basis, we had an extra week. And then you take the software that we wrote down -- software revenue that we wrote down as a result of ceasing operations in Russia. So those three -- the first one is hard to put a number on, but assume it's reasonable. The Russia and the extra quarter was a 5-point headwind to our software growth. So I know it's a little complicated, but I wanted to make sure you understood that. So I would expect this stuff to normalize back particularly without the Russia and the extra week impact. And then when supply chain starts to clear, then we'll start to see those normalized growth rates that we would expect, so hopefully that wasn't too complicated. Tim Long : Yes. Just curious any other standalone software or 9000 upgrades? What are the kinds of things outside of the macro related that could really help? Chuck Robbins : Yes. The renewal stuff in '23, it could be helpful. We are continuing to make progress on that across the portfolio. I mean, we've got subscriptions running on switching on routing, enterprise routing, on enterprise wireless. We've even built some subscriptions into our mass scale infrastructure group. We've got subscriptions now in our data center networking group. So they'll sort layering in over the next few years. Tim Long : Okay, thank you. Marilyn Mora : Okay. It looks like we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Amit Daryanani from Evercore. You may go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. A lot of snuck in here out. I guess I would be the dead horse in China supply chain issues. And maybe to the answer from the perspective of the billion-dollar shortfall, I know it's supply chain, not just China, if you have in July. A, what's the conviction that there is no share loss happening? Because your peers might be one month after that sounded much better for your conviction that others were not able to get the power, analog product that you were not and they were able to get the demand. So A, could you just talk about conviction, you are not having share loss? And then B, China has had no COVID cases in Shanghai for a few days now. So assuming they open up in June, does that imply that you could be perhaps at the higher end of your guide and things get better in Q1? Or just what are you embedding from a Shanghai recovery in your fiscal Q4 guidance? Chuck Robbins : Okay. So first of all I think market share is incredibly difficult thing to assess right now because of the backlog situation, supply chain situations and we have a complex portfolio. So are we losing share in somewhere? I suspect there is somewhere that we are losing share. But in our core markets, I actually feel really good about how we're performing and the demand that we've seen in whether it's WiFi or switching or particularly in SP routing and in the web scale space and other areas. So I don't think there is a widespread problem of share, but I'm sure there are pockets that we -- our teams are working on improving. So that's the first piece. Amit, on the China thing, let me -- what we've built into the guide is just a whole lot of uncertainty right now. Because we recognize that when they do open up, first of all, we don't know what that means. We don't know what open up means. Does it mean that they're going to slowly open grocery stores and salons and things of that nature and that the logistics side of it or do they open up the logistics all day one? What does it mean about the capacity of resources they have for the logistics side? But our concern is that every company there is going to be trying to ship out? In some cases, many of the factories have been approved to keep working and their workers have been working in dormitories. So they have components or ready to ship product that is sitting on the floor and it's all going to raise for the ports. It's all going to compete for the airports. And we know there's lower air traffic capacity right now for us to leverage. So we're concerned about how long it takes to clear that up, which is reflected in the guide. We also think that once it gets into their ports and it starts coming in the U.S., we have the risk of seeing what we saw in LA several months ago. So those are all just the unknowns about what does opening up look like and what's the timeframe for recovery that led us to the cautious guide that we put out there. And I would just remind you that it's not just Shanghai. I think as of the last article I read, there were like 45 cities that were in lockdown and it was over a quarter of the population of China. So it's broader. But that's how we're thinking about it and we just have to wait and see how it unwinds. Amit Daryanani : Fair enough. Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thank you, Amit. Chuck, I'm going to turn it over to you for some closing remarks. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Marilyn. So first of all, I want to thank everybody for spending time with us and diving into this the complex situation that we face. It's clearly a dynamic and challenging environment. We clearly faced unanticipated events during Q3 with the COVID lockdowns and the war in Ukraine. We think the short-term challenges that we will manage through, our teams have been working really hard on these mitigation actions that we believe will begin to benefit us in the first half of our next fiscal year, which is good. We're successfully realizing price increases, which is good. And also in Q3, even though we had a miss on the top line, I just want to point out that it was a record EPS quarter for us as a company. And at the low point of our guidance for Q4, we will deliver record EPS for the full year. So while the topline is disappointing, we have navigated this complex year and actually will deliver solid EPS when we're done. The fundamentals are strong a lot, still in our favor. Demand, business transformation is working, the technology transitions and the number that we're participating in. We have great teams around the world and that leads me to have a high degree of confidence despite the short-term challenges that we face. So thank you all for spending time with us and we look forward to connecting with you next quarter. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Chuck. And I'll just wrap it up by saying Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 results will be on Wednesday, August 17, 2022, at 1 :30 PM Pacific Time, 4:30 PM Eastern Time.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Marilyn Mora : Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's fourth quarter fiscal 2022 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be done on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2023. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck. Chuck Robbins : Thank you, Marilyn, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'm very proud to share that we had a strong end to our fiscal year in the midst of an incredibly dynamic environment. In fact, we set several records with our performance this year. Let me first touch on those. For the full year of fiscal 22, we delivered record non-GAAP EPS of $3.36. Record product orders, which fueled our backlog to the highest level ever recorded, as well as our second strongest year of revenue in the history of the company at $51.6 billion. We continue to see strong customer adoption of our software and subscriptions, driven by the targeted investments we've been making. We also had record net income, which reflects our operating discipline, despite external challenges, including supply chain and inflation. Our ongoing business transformation continues to show progress across our KPIs, with annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, and remaining performance obligations, or RPO, both setting record highs. These important metrics illustrate the increasing recurring nature of our revenue streams. This, combined with our record backlog, provides us with enhanced visibility into our business looking forward. While this was certainly a complex year, we executed well. I want to thank our teams for their perseverance, determination and unwavering commitment to our customers and our partners. Our team's commitment to accelerated innovation has put us in a unique position of strength for fiscal 2023 and over the long term. Now, I want to be clear on our outlook for fiscal 2023. We expect strong performance across our portfolio, driven by our continued focus on innovation and easing of supply constraints to drive solid top line growth and profitability. While we anticipated some moderation from the unprecedented product order growth of last year, demand signals remain solid. We do expect to continue to experience higher costs in the short term, driven primarily by higher component, freight and logistics costs, which is reflected in our Q1 guide. However, as you'll see in our annual guidance, we expect this margin pressure to begin to ease as the year progresses. Long term, there are many multi-year growth opportunities ahead of us, that gives me confidence in our future. There are currently more technology transitions occurring concurrently than I've seen in 20 years. Long-term megatrends like hybrid cloud, hybrid work, security, IoT, 400 gig and beyond, 5G and Wi-Fi 6 as well as the move towards application observability will likely provide tailwinds to our growth. With our portfolio in such a strong position to help our customers, I'm quite optimistic about what's ahead. Before we discuss the quarter in detail, I want to provide some additional color on the supply situation and how we continue to build greater resiliency. After a challenging April due to the COVID-related shutdowns in Shanghai, and the impact on semiconductor and power supplies, overall supply constraints began to ease slightly at the back half of the fourth quarter and continuing into the start of Q1. While the component supply headwinds remain, they have begun to show early signs of easing. The decisions we made and the multiple actions we have taken over the past two years are helping to improve our resiliency and will help offset cost inflation. These include adding new suppliers, leveraging alternative suppliers, redesigning hundreds of products to use alternative components with similar capability and targeted price increases, all of which position us for the future. These actions along with the tremendous efforts by our supply chain team and the investments we've made in building capacity to meet growth have the potential to drive momentum into fiscal 2023. Moving to performance highlights in the quarter. We delivered revenue above the high end of our guidance range, and non-GAAP EPS came in at the high end of our guidance range. We achieved healthy operating margins and generated solid cash flow and returned nearly $4 billion to Cisco stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases. With annual product order growth of 14% for the fiscal year, we exited the year with record product backlog. In addition, our RPO totaled more than $31 billion, and when combined with low cancellation rates, which remain below pre-pandemic levels, this sets the stage for increased visibility and strong revenue growth as we head into fiscal 2023. In terms of our product orders this quarter, we delivered the second highest orders in absolute dollars in the history of the company. It was second only to our performance in Q4 of fiscal 2021 and on a sequential basis it was up greater than 15% with strong growth in enterprise, commercial and public sector. From an annual growth rate perspective, we clearly faced some very tough comparisons from the record orders we saw in Q4 last year, where we had over 30% growth. Based on that, the year-over-year decline was not a surprise nor is it concerning. It's important to keep in mind that in the near term, the rate and pace of our revenue growth is much more a function of component availability than on our quarterly product order growth. With RPO of over $31 billion, almost $17 billion of which will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months and a record backlog, we have great top line visibility. Thanks to the relentless effort of our entire organization, the business remains stronger than before the pandemic. From a demand perspective, we continue to experience solid customer activity beyond our ability to deliver as is reflected in the growth of our backlog that we saw throughout the quarter. While our business is not immune to macro trends, we will remain disciplined in our operations, while benefiting from robust multiyear investment trends and the technology transitions I mentioned earlier. Our innovation is helping our customers and partners navigate an increasing amount of complexity, and there is a greater sense of urgency to leverage leading-edge technologies to deliver on their strategic objectives. This is leading them to consistently look to Cisco and our unique and differentiated innovation to help them advance their most pressing business priorities. We recently held our Cisco Live customer event in-person for the first time in three years and had over 15,000 in attendance, including thousands of our largest customers and many more participating virtually. Our discussions with them focused on strategic projects, supply assurance and the critical role Cisco can play to support their long-term technology road maps. They did not indicate any fundamental shift in their commitment to technology investments. Regardless of what the coming quarters may bring, we have a proven track record of being able to adjust in difficult environments. Our value proposition to our customers remains as strong as ever. In our web scale business, we continue to see momentum even as the business becomes larger, as product orders were up more than 50% on a trailing four-quarter basis. We see significant opportunity ahead as these customers build out massively scalable cloud networks and increasingly turn to Cisco to help them meet accelerating demand for cloud services. Our leadership in silicon, optics, software and systems enables us to win as hyperscalers value industry-leading performance and innovation. We are expanding our footprint, driven by data center build-outs with our Silicon One-based Cisco 8000 routers, the fastest-growing platforms in Cisco's history. Together with optics from Acacia, we have a strong foundation for 400-gig and beyond to rearchitect the Internet with routed optical networking. In addition, we recently booked and shipped our first 800-gig systems to one of our web scale customers. On the IoT front, we also now have more than 200 million connected things on our cloud platform with growth driven by connected car. We finished fiscal 2022 with product orders in excess of $1 billion and growing double digits. We continue to make progress on our transformation to more software and subscription-based recurring revenue. ARR of approximately $23 billion was up 8% with product ARR increasing by 13%. We had strong subscription revenue this quarter, driven by our growing portfolio of recurring offers. While our software revenue was down slightly, once supply constraints improve and we begin to increase product shipments, we expect to see an improvement in software, subscription and services that are attached to hardware products in our backlog. The investments we've made in innovation are paying off as our competitive position is very strong. In Q4, we introduced several new cloud delivered innovations across our portfolio to help organizations drive productivity and resiliency. We launched Nexus Cloud, a platform to help our customers deploy, manage and operate their data center networks from the cloud. In addition, we introduced Calisti and Panoptica, two new cloud native API-first tools for faster and better application development. We also announced AppDynamics Cloud, a next-generation version of our observability platform for cloud native applications. In addition, we shared our strategy to help our customers connect their entire security architecture with our new platform, Cisco Security Cloud, which will be a game changer for them as they look to secure their multi-cloud environments with a single cloud-delivered security platform. This is just one part of our broader security innovation cycle. Building on the double-digit growth we saw in security this quarter, we are investing across our security business, focusing on cloud based offerings, best-in-class AI driven threat detection and end-to-end security architectures. These innovations position us well for leadership in the security market. In summary, we executed well on our strategy and transformation during what remains a very dynamic time. This led to a strong close to our fiscal year, setting several records across our business, thanks to the solid execution from our teams, our market-leading innovation and our continued growth of recurring revenue. We also took decisive actions to help offset inflation and build resiliency in our supply chain, while investing in our business to position us well for long-term growth. The power of our technology continues to be a critical driver of economic growth and productivity. Our results and outlook demonstrate the critical role that Cisco plays as a leader in bringing innovative technology solutions to customers today and into the future. As we move into fiscal 2023, we remain guided by our purpose-led culture and deeply committed to delivering value for our customers, partners and investors, as well as continuing to be an amazing place to work for our employees. I will now turn it over to Scott. Scott Herren : Thanks, Chuck. I'll first provide some detail on our financial results for the quarter, then cover the full fiscal year, followed by our guidance. Our overall Q4 results reflect strong execution in an environment with continuing supply constraints. And as Chuck mentioned, increased costs reflected in our gross margins. We're very pleased that our shipment levels were above our expectations and that total revenue of $13.1 billion exceeded the high end of our guidance range, as we saw improvement in supply as a direct result of the numerous actions we've taken over multiple quarters. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 32.4%, down 110 basis points and in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP net income was $3.4 billion, down 3% and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.83, coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Looking at our Q4 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $9.7 billion, and service revenue was $3.4 billion both flat year-over-year. Within product revenue, Secure, Agile Networks was down 1%. Switching declined in both data center and campus driven by supply constraints. We saw growth in our Catalyst 9000, Nexus 9000 and Meraki switching offerings. Enterprise routing decline primarily driven by Edge and SD-WAN offset by strength in access. Wireless had strong growth, driven primarily by our Meraki wireless offerings. We also had double-digit growth in servers. Internet for the future was down 10% with strength in web scale revenue, offset by declines in cable, edge and optical. Collaboration was up 2%, driven by growth in collaboration devices, partially offset by declines in our meetings and calling offerings. End-to-end security had record revenue with strong growth of 20%, driven by strength across the entire portfolio. Our Zero Trust portfolio continues to perform well, driven by strong performance in our dual offering. Optimized application experiences had solid growth of 8%, driven by double-digit growth in our SaaS-based offering, ThousandEyes. We continue to make progress on our transformation metrics, as we shift our business to more software and subscriptions. We saw strong performance in our ARR of $22.9 billion, an increase of 8% with product ARR growth of 13% driven by several large software transactions closing during the quarter. Total software revenue was $3.9 billion, a decrease of 2% with software subscription revenue up 1%. Bear in mind, we continue to have well over $2 billion of software orders in our product backlog. 83% of the software revenue was subscription based, which is up 2 percentage points year-over-year. Total subscription revenue was $5.8 billion, an increase of 2%. Total subscription revenue represented 44% of Cisco's total revenue. And RPO was $31.5 billion, up 2%, product RPO increased 6%. Service RPO decreased 1%, and our total short-term RPO grew 4% to $16.9 billion. Total product orders in Q4 were the second highest in our history. While product orders were down 6% for the quarter, it's important to keep in mind that the compare against 31% growth a year ago, which was the highest product orders in our history. On a sequential basis, product order growth was up over 15%, with double-digit growth in enterprise, commercial and public sector. Looking at our geographic segments year-over-year. The Americas was down 9%, EMEA down 4%, and APJC up 1%. In our customer markets, Enterprise was down 15%, Public Sector was down 3%, Service Provider was down 7% and commercial was up 1%. From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margin came in at 63.3% and down 230 basis points year-on-year. Product gross margin was 61.3%, down 370 basis points, and service gross margin was 69%, up 160 basis points. In our product gross margin, higher component and commodity costs, as well as higher freight and logistics related to supply constraints, were the predominant drivers of lower-than-expected margins. We saw increased benefits from the pricing actions we have taken, as well as for mix. Once again, we had a significant increase in our backlog levels for both hardware and software, well beyond our normal historical levels. As Chuck said, our ending product backlog was a record for the year. And just a reminder, backlog is not included as part of the $31.5 billion in remaining performance obligations. It's important to note that the combined total of our backlog and RPO gives us great visibility into our fiscal 2023 top line growth. We ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $19.3 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $3.7 billion, down 18% year-over-year, primarily driven by advanced payments and inventory purchases to secure future supply. In capital allocation, we returned $4 billion to shareholders during the quarter, was comprised of $2.4 billion of share repurchases and $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend. Turning to the full fiscal year results. Overall, our financial results were solid in a year where we faced significant supply constraints, rising component and related costs and the war in Ukraine. Our financial performance was highlighted by strong demand, with product order growth of 14%, including two quarters of truly impressive 33% growth, though our performance was clearly impacted by the supply constraints. Revenue was $51.6 billion, up 3%, while non-GAAP earnings per share were up 4%, at $3.36. In terms of our software metrics, total software revenue was flat, at $15.1 billion, with the product portion up 2%, 81% of software revenue was subscription-based, which is up 2 percentage points year-on-year. Total subscription revenue was $22.4 billion, an increase of 2% and total subscription revenue represented 43% of Cisco's total revenue. Total non-GAAP gross margin was 64.6%, down 150 basis points and our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.6%, up 10 basis points. On the bottom line, non-GAAP net income was $14.1 billion, up 3%. We delivered operating cash flow of $13.2 billion, down 14% compared to fiscal 2021, driven primarily by advanced payments for inventory purchases to secure component supply. While these payments had a negative impact on full year operating cash flow, these and our other related actions helped to improve the supply situation in Q4 and future quarters. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned approximately $14 billion in value to our shareholders via cash dividends and stock repurchases, representing 109% of our free cash flow. This was comprised of $7.7 billion of share repurchases and $6.2 billion in quarterly cash dividends. We also increased our dividend for the 11th consecutive year in fiscal 2022, reinforcing our commitment to returning excess capital to our shareholders, and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. Our strong balance sheet and overall financial position is clearly a competitive advantage in tough environments. To summarize, we executed well in Q4 and had a solid fiscal year and a high complex environment, while continuing to make progress in our business model shift, and making strategic investment and innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities and expanding addressable markets. The demand for our products and services are strong as we drive innovation through continued investment and the shift to more recurring revenue delivering growth and driving shareholder value. Turning to our financial guidance for Q1, we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 2% to 4%. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 63% to 64%. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 31.5% to 32.5%, and non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.82 to $0.84. For fiscal 2023, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 6% year-on-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.49 to $3.56, also up 4% to 6% year-on-year. In both our Q1 and full year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn, so we can move into the Q&A. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Scott. Michelle, let's go ahead and queue up the list of Q&A. Operator : Thank you. Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead. Sami Badri : Hi. Thank you. I actually had two questions. First thing is for fiscal year 2023 your revenue growth expectations came in a bit stronger than most Street expectations. And maybe you could just walk us through the composition of the segment and what's driving the strength and maybe which segments may potentially lag some of the stronger segments? And then my other question is, maybe you could just give us some color on the composition of gross margin regarding pricing and productivity in fiscal 4Q of 2022, that would be helpful. Scott Herren : Yeah. Thanks, Sami. As we look at the forecast that we've given you for fiscal 2023, balance growth again, 4% to 6% growth on the top line, 4% to 6% growth on the bottom line. When you start to peel that back, of course, we don't guide at that level, what we have seen, as you'd expect, is, again, nice demand, as Chuck talked about on the call, through the end of the fourth quarter, but a little bit different by industry vertical. Retail, not surprisingly, under a little bit of pressure. Financial services under a little bit of pressure. Pretty much strength across most of the rest of the sector, a little bit of pressure in health care as well. So that's \u2013 as we roll into fiscal 2023, that's what we're seeing kind of vertical by vertical. We saw good double-digit growth sequentially, again, Q3 to Q4, because the year-on-year compares are quite difficult with that 31% growth we had a year ago, but good sequential growth, if you look at it by customer market in both enterprise, public sector and commercial. So again, seeing pretty balanced growth across the board and that's our expectation as we roll into fiscal 2023. On the gross margin question, we are getting a benefit from price. One of the things that we've talked about, though, is there's a lag between the price increases that we put in place and what we see actually showing up in reported revenues. And I know, you know, this from prior quarters, Sami, we saw some of that benefit in Q4, and you'll see this in our filings in our 10-Q \u2013 our 10-K filing for the end of the quarter. It's about 1%, up year-on-year gross margin driven by price and then, of course, the offset coming from higher cost, both component costs and freight and logistics. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Next question, please. Operator : Tim Long with Barclays. You may go ahead. Tim Long : Thank you. Just wanted to ask on maybe two quick ones. One on the software business. Chuck, you talked about kind of flattish performance, but still have carrying a lot of backlog there. That's been a case for a few quarters here. So maybe you could just talk a little bit about what you think it's going to get taken to get this business moving a little bit more aggressively towards that software model. And then I did want to follow-up on the cloud vertical, still running really strong orders there. Can you talk a little bit about is the breadth of portfolio shipping into that growing? I know the 8-K is strong, but any other highlights of strength there that would be great? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Tim. So let's start with the software. And you're right, the software is flattish. There's two things that I would point out. We have -- we, obviously, have been transitioning from perpetual software model, which is in decline, and that's by design. We want to decline our perpetual software and increase our subscription software. And the way I think about it is, our perpetual was down roughly 14% during the quarter. And we also, as Scott said, have over $2 billion, and it's actually a higher number exiting Q4 than it was in Q3 of software in backlog, as you said, connected to hardware. So those are two contributing factors, which is why we really should be thinking about the ARR situation because that's reflective of the ACV that we basically had exiting the quarter. And it's -- so that's an indicator of future software revenue. So we're comfortable with it. And I think once we get through some of the supply chain stuff that we'll start to see that be a little more reflective of what we've been planning on. On the cloud vertical, we continue to win new insertions. That business is approaching 3 billion annually now after just two or three short years ago, it was pretty close to nothing. And so the teams have done a fantastic job. It is, obviously, over the last four quarters, it's grown 50%. From a revenue perspective, it's very supply chain dependent. So I wouldn't get too wrapped up about the revenue versus the orders right now. I think we'll work our way through that over the next four to five quarters. But overall, really pleased with where we are. Tim Long : Okay. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Tim. Next question, please. Operator : Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead, sir. Rod Hall : Yeah. Hey guys, thanks for the question. I guess, I wanted to dig into this order growth a little bit. Obviously, very strong numbers there, but somewhat inconsistent with the way that we would have expected them to come out? And I just wanted -- and the thing that's inconsistent is you guys are saying up over 15% in the quarter, but then down 6% on a year-over-year basis, we would have calculated closer to flat, like minus 1. So we're just curious whether there was any restatement of the July quarter last year. You guys had called out 31% order growth there or anything else going on with the dynamics of these orders that might help us to understand that discrepancy at least in our numbers. And then I've got a follow-up. Chuck Robbins : Yes, Rod, I saw some folks who thought we would be down 15%. So I think it's just different ways of modeling. When we were thinking about this question, and we obviously know that 31% and then in Q1, we're comparing is 33%. We were trying to find other ways to look at the business to indicate the reality of the demand signal. So let me just give you a few of those characteristics. First of all, from a product order perspective, as I said, it was the second highest in history, which would be only eclipsed by Q4 a year ago, and it grew 15%. And on a sequential basis, that's actually in range with our historicals. If you go back to -- if you take out last year, which was an abnormal sequential then it's very much in line, it's in the range of what we've seen for the last 10 years, the 15%. You had enterprise, public sector and commercial, all growing in solid double-digits on a sequential basis, and again, growing sequentially off our largest third quarter product bookings ever. We also have continued growth in the pipeline. As we exited Q4, we saw very good growth in pipeline, which is a good indicator of going forward. And the final thing I would tell you is that if you -- the way our sales teams forecasted the quarter at the beginning of month three, they revised their forecast for the quarter, and they finished stronger than they thought they would, and we had strength as we exited the quarter. And so linearity was solid. And so we just haven't seen anything that would indicate a significant shift in the demand signal from our customers. Scott Herren : Yes, Rod, so there was not - to be clear on your question, there was no change in the way we report year-on-year. It's exactly the same. The only other thing that I would add, too, to the comments that Chuck just made, linearity in the quarter was quite strong. In fact, the last week of the quarter was actually the same size as it had been in the prior year and the month-to-month linearity was exactly in line with last year and with prior year's expectations. So we saw strength right through the end of Q4. Rod Hall : Got you. Okay. And I -- just as a follow-up, can I ask you guys on inventory? I know inventories moved up quite a bit again. Do you think inventory starts to come down next quarter, or just curious kind of where we are in that ebb and flow of inventory given the supply shortages and so on? Scott Herren : Yes. What's sitting in inventory, Rod, is the rest of the parts that aren't under constraint, so that as the ones that are constrained free up, of course, we can square the set and get the product shipped out the door to our customers. So it is growing. It's up about $1 billion year-on-year, sitting at $2.5 billion. Our advanced payments are up as well. Both of those are a bit of a headwind to cash flows, as you saw. But yes, it's much more a statement of making sure we've got everything we need, so that as those constrained parts clear up, which we saw a little bit of that towards the end of Q4, we can square the sets and get it out the door and in the hands of our customers. Rod Hall : Okay. Great. Appreciate it guys. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : All right. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Amit Daryanani from Evercore. You may go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Yes. Thanks for the taking my question. I have two as well. The question I have is just on gross margins or maybe when I think about the EPS guide of 4% to 6% for fiscal 2023. How are you thinking about gross margins in that backdrop? And then are buybacks embedded in that guide as well? Scott Herren : Yes. So there's no added buyback in there. We've talked about our cap allocation policy. Our share buybacks have both a systemic component to it that's just offsetting the shares that we issued through our equity plans and an opportunistic component. On the -- what's our expectation on gross margin through the year. Of course, we don't guide that for the full year, Amit. But what I'd say is, my expectation is, as we go through the year and we can work through the backlog, we'll begin to ship out of that backlog more and more orders that actually reflect the price increases that we put in place last year. And as we do, of course, that will be a tailwind to margins throughout the year. So I would see margins going up as much as 50 basis points, between our first quarter guide and where we end the year. Amit Daryanani : And then, if I could just follow up, there\u2019s been a firm amount of fear that higher interest rates looks like impact enterprise spending across the board, your print, your guide doesn\u2019t seem to suggest you\u2019re seeing any signs of that. But, I\u2019d love to get your perspective. What are you hearing from your customers as the macroenvironment is changing? And really related to that, are you seeing any shift in how they procure or what they want to buy from you as the macroenvironment changes? Chuck Robbins : Yes, it's a good question. And we -- what I would say is that, we are not immune to any significant change in the macro that would result in enterprise spending shifting up. My comments are just that, we haven't seen a material demand signal change as we've entered into Q1. So that's where we are. I think on last call, I believe, I talked a lot about how I believe that post pandemic, the view of technology by our customers is much different than it would have been seven, eight, nine years ago there. I think if you ask our customers if they would pause spending during a crisis, they would probably respond, when is there not going to be a crisis, given what we've dealt with the last three years. And so, in general, we don't hear a lot of difference, relative to your question around have we seen any different buying behavior or what are they trying to buy from us. In some cases, customers are looking for a little shorter ROI, so that affects how they think about what products they're buying in these kinds of times. In some cases, customers are looking ahead to lead times to fiscal 2023 budgets and trying to better understand what their budgets are going to look like, because the shipments and the payments would be in the 2023 time frame. But other than that, we're not seeing anything significantly different. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Thank you. Congrats on a nice print. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Amit. Scott Herren : Thanks, Amit. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Amit. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley Investment Research. You may go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. A couple of questions for me. Maybe, just on kind of increasing supply availability, I just wanted to get a sense of how much of that do you feel like is just some of these lagging edge components are starting to become more available? And how much of that is a result of kind of redesigns that you've done over the course of the year that have just kind of given you more optionality? And then, maybe, just a second question for you, Chuck. Just as we've seen, kind of, evaluation, correction on a lot of kind of the software space, like, how does that change your view of strategic activity? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Meta. So on the first one, I'd say, that it's a combination of both of those. We -- as we said earlier, we saw increased volumes in the broker network during the quarter, which candidly was an opportunity we took advantage of, which is why you saw the higher top line, we were able to get more products shipped to our customers, which we obviously were very happy about, but we had to pay more for those components, and we think that will continue probably over the next 60 to 90 days. And then, we think, some of those purchases will begin to become available from the same suppliers that have put the excess inventory into the marketplace. At the same time, we have \u2013 and I think I said this on our last call, we've had hundreds of product design \u2013 redesigns going on. And two of our high volume products that also have good margins will begin to ship in the redesigned space sort of towards the latter into Q1, and then into the balance of the year, which we think will be helpful as well. So it's a combination of both of those things. And that's what gives us a little bit of optimism that things will continue to improve during the year. On the second question, on the valuations, I've had this one a few times, and I've been asked, if our M&A strategy has changed because of the valuations. And I've said that, our strategy hasn't changed, but the openness to talk to us from some of the \u2013 the companies that thought they had different strategic exits might have changed. And so we haven't changed our strategy. We just think that, it potentially creates more opportunity for us with companies that might not have been willing because they thought there was a high-flying IPO, ahead of them that they may not believe is the case right now. And the market is obviously taking a much different view on profitability versus just growth. Meta Marshall : Perfect. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Chuck. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Tal Liani with Bank of America Securities. You may go ahead. Tal Liani : Hi, guys. I'm trying to distinguish between the growth next year, which is probably a function of better supplies and backlog, very high backlog in between the spending environment, and you started touching on it when we asked about the enterprise. So let me maybe expand the question about the environment. When you go through your various, what you call, use of coal theaters and you go through cloud and service providers and enterprise, et cetera. Can you take us through your expectations for the spending environment and maybe how long it takes to close deals versus before when you look into the next few quarters? I'm trying to understand, if the environment as you see it today, whether it deteriorates or not at all, or which are the areas where we see a slowdown or not? And I have a second question, just if you can touch on security. Security was good again. It was good, actually much better, and there is improvement throughout the quarter, if you can touch on your position in security? Chuck Robbins : Great. Thanks, Tal. So we \u2013 I think Scott has touched on it that, the revenue for fiscal year 2023 is much more a byproduct of component availability than it necessarily is connected to demand. But I will tell you that, our current models would have us exiting fiscal 2023 with roughly the same backlog as we're entering FY 2023. And so \u2013 and then as you look at the different segments that you've described, we had small business growth in Q4. I think it was double digits on a global basis, which is a good sign that that's continuing to grow. And then when we dissect it, commercial grew 39% a year ago. So sequentially in double digits, Enterprise was up in the mid-20s last year. So, sequentially growing in high double digits. Those are good signs for us. And then the pipeline growth that, we've seen as we exited the quarter just says that, there's still a lot out there. And so right now, we're modeling for just the things to continue as we see them and taking into consideration as you ask me to go around the regions, I think Asia and Europe, we had conversations with our team this week and they seem to -- they continue to be reasonably optimistic as we are in the Americas. And so it was a pretty consistent story. Scott? Scott Herren : Yeah. Probably the only thing I'd add is as you look at that 4% to 6% growth that we've forecasted now for fiscal 2023, it is absolutely supply constrained. So while the supply situation we saw late in our fourth quarter that we just closed, there were some easing. Easing doesn't mean it's over. We're going to have supply constraints throughout fiscal 2023 and just a few areas were it not for those, we would be growing much more quickly. It's not a case of demand. We're not demand constrained. We were supply constrained in fiscal 2023. Tal Liani : And when it comes to your answer about service providers and cloud, same as the answer for the enterprise, meaning you don't expect much of a change as of now in the environment? Chuck Robbins : No, we don't see anything. What I would tell you about the service provider business is that because of the long lead times, we started a process of doing long-term planning with them that I've talked about before. And so we actually have deferred bookings that don't show up anywhere right now, approaching $0.5 billion, that because they're outside of our standard shipment window when they would like to get those. So we've got orders out quarters from now from them that are all non-cancelable because of the contracts that we've done. So we feel good about that momentum. We think that those customers will continue to spend in all of the trends that we've talked about. And given that we just shipped our first 800-gig system to one of the web scale players, we can continue to see them take advantage of these higher speed platforms. Tal Liani : Greta. Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Now, Tal, you also asked about security? Tal Liani : Yes, I did. Chuck Robbins : So we saw -- I think Scott mentioned this in his -- we had some really good growth and some backlog movement, to be honest, on the firewall side. So we had a really solid quarter on shipments from a firewall perspective. But we also had strength in our endpoint business. We had strengthened our Zero Trust business. And we're continuing to -- that is the number one investment area for the company this year, and it is -- we're continuing to drive, I think, greater innovation there and evolve that portfolio as we've described strategically. So I think we'll just continue to see improvement. But this quarter did get a boost from us clearing some backlog in the firewall space. Tal Liani : Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Thanks. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Tal. Next question. Operator : Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on the good execution this quarter. I guess, I wanted to dive into the order numbers a bit here. And historically, you've talked about SMB or commercial being a bit more of a leading indicator into enterprise trends. But when you look at the order trends right now, it does seem like you're seeing a bit more of a volatility around the enterprise orders related to the commercial segment. And so I wanted to see if there's anything that you can help us in terms of thinking about the trends we're seeing there? And just a second one there is collaboration and it seems like a very tough group turnaround collaboration results in. So how should we think about sustainability of the growth here for collaboration? Chuck Robbins : Yeah, Samik, thank you. I'll comment on -- the small business was again strong, as I spoke about just a moment ago. I think it's really important when you have these abnormal year-over-year comparisons for us to find other ways to assess the strength, which is why we looked at the sequential growth. And sequentially, they're both up in double-digits, both commercial and enterprise, which against a very large quarter, a quarter ago. And so we're comfortable right now that they're moving as they should be. Candidly, for commercial to grow at all after the extreme growth that we had a year ago was actually quite positive. So I actually view that favorably given the strength that they showed a year ago, it was probably the highest growth rate we've had in forever in that space or at least in the last 10 years. So overall, I think we don't see any sort of significant demand shift, as I said earlier. On the collab front, it's a little bit like the security message that I gave a few minutes ago. We had a -- we did clear a lot of device business in the backlog. So the growth, as Scott said in his opening comments, was driven largely by the device business and offset by some declines we had in meetings and calling. But I will say that the teams are working really hard on the meetings and calling side. Those have been strong. The calling side has been strong for us in the past few quarters. The product portfolio is in really good shape. The Net Promoter Score for our meetings platform is now 64 and that was 1 million customer responses. So it's a huge -- it's a hugely improved experience. And this year, the teams are really focused on trying to get that back to growth. But we've got a lot of work to do. Samik Chatterjee : Yes. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. Marilyn Mora : Next question, please. Operator : Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. You may go ahead. Ittai Kidron : Thanks. A couple from me. Maybe first on the supply chain. I just want to make sure I understand your expectations for component availability, and maybe you could talk about price changes of components. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re assuming any changes in pricing. Is that correct? And if there will be a change in pricing, what are the odds that you actually take down the prices of your products? Scott Herren : Yes. This -- I'll start, Chuck, and if you want to jump in, let's do that. From a component availability standpoint, Ittai, that's been the most fluid area of our forecast over the last several quarters. And as we look ahead, we did see signs of stability during Q4. And as I said, in the late in Q4 that we just closed, we actually saw some improvement. The way that improvement showed up was availability of some of the constrained parts that we have been chasing in the broker network. And obviously, when you buy from the broker network, you pay a premium for those. And you see that reflected in the gross margins. I think there'll still be some of that in Q1. You see that reflected in our gross margin guide in Q1. And then it gets better as the year goes on, not because -- I'm not assuming any price declines or any cost declines coming from our suppliers. I think the -- I don't see them lining up to come back and say, hey, good news, Scott and Chuck. We're going to charge you less for the component parts. There may be some benefit in freight and logistics. We'll see, as commercial airlift comes back online. I think the benefits we'll get will be much more from shipping more out of our backlog that are orders that were received after we did the price increases last year. Ittai Kidron : So as I think about your fiscal year, fiscal 2023 on guidance, what is the underlying assumption regarding volume component availability exiting fiscal 2023? How much better are you expecting it to be in your guidance? What's embedded there? Scott Herren : Yes. Again, our guidance assumes that we continue to be supply constrained through the year. As I said, if we could get more supply, we would be growing more quickly in fiscal 2023. So we'll continue to be supply constrained. Our modeling shows that our backlog, as we exit fiscal 2023, Chuck touched on this earlier, that we think the dollar value, obviously, it's not the same orders, but the dollar value is roughly unchanged from the dollar value we roll into fiscal 2023 with. So I think we'll continue to face component availability headwinds throughout the year. Ittai Kidron : Would you expect your order growth in fiscal 2023 to exceed your 4% to 6% top line guidance? Scott Herren : Yes. We don't forecast order growth, as you know, Ittai. So that's not one that I want to jump into at this point. I think the -- probably the key takeaway would be, we're not demand constrained. We're supply constrained, as you look at 2023. Ittai Kidron : Okay. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Ittai. Scott Herren : Thanks, Ittai. Marilyn Mora : Next question? Operator : Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Your may go ahead. Paul Silverstein : Thank you. I know my questions have been touched on previous comments and responses, Chuck. But I want to ask you anyway, there are big picture questions, one on revenue, one on margins. The first one, from your comments and the comments of your peers about networking, it looks like networking demand is in the best shape it's been in since the bubble of the late '90s? And that, of course was a bubble. But its -- the supply constraints, it\u2019s making it hard to discern what\u2019s going on from a competitive landscape standpoint. And I'm sure you guys are aware, I know it's come up in previous calls, but there's a sense, I think, created by your competitors, rightly or wrongly, but I want to let you respond that, in campus enterprise in particular, which is still core to what you all do, that you've got competitive pressures. Any thoughts you can share on what you're seeing in your campus enterprise business, both on the wireline switching and on the wireless LAN side, you clearly talked about strength from an order perspective, but I want to let you respond. And then I've got a question on margins. Chuck Robbins : Okay. First of all, I think, market share is a very difficult thing to assess right now, to your point, because of everything sitting in the backlog. I do believe that Q4 was the second largest Cat 9000 shipment quarter in the history of the product. So that would indicate that it's strong. And I think as we continue to clear our backlog or work through it, not clear it, but as we work through our backlog, you'll see some share come out. But I would encourage you to look at market share over a trending quarter time frame as opposed to a point in time because you just never know. We've got some products that we've been redesigning that we have backlog that we'll begin to ship and mass that will actually flip market share numbers pretty significantly. And my competitor is going to be telling you exactly what I'm telling you right now. So it's something you just got to watch over time. And so, I'm not -- I mean, clearly, we have competition in the campus. We have very strong competition, we always have. And -- but given the volume of the products that we're shipping right now, I don't feel like we're losing significant share. Paul Silverstein : Okay. And also from a big picture perspective, once upon a time, networking in general, and Cisco, in particular, was the canary in the coal mine. When there was a macro downturn, you guys were the first to see it, networking was the easiest thing to push off, everyone let their networks run hotter with the enterprise carriers, et cetera, that seems to flip where networking is actually not seeing weakness that other technology product markets are seeing. I just want to make sure that I've got that construct right. And the real question though on the margin side, you all were at record or near record gross and operating margin levels going into the pandemic before input costs, I see semis freight, which is, et cetera, spikes. Any thoughts on where you can get \u2013 where the long-term model can get back to once supply chain normalizes. I assume that, freight and logistics mix and pricing will go back to pre-pandemic levels, it will help you and others out. But I also assume that, the increase in semi IC input costs are not going back to where they were, you'll be able to offset some but probably not all of that with your price increases. Let me let you respond. Chuck Robbins : Yeah. So let me take the networking \u2013 the resilience of the networking market first. And then, Scott, you can take the margin question. So Paul, the \u2013 I think you're right. And I've said this repeatedly, I think what what's driven this is there are two things. Number one, the pandemic revealed the impact of not keeping your core infrastructure technology up to speed. Customers struggled, and I think it made them realize that they had a lot of tech debt that needed to be dealt with. And they don't want to get in that position again. So that's the first thing. But the second thing is all of these mega trends that I mentioned in my opening comments, I mean, these customers are re-architecting their entire infrastructure for the first time in years to deal with hybrid cloud and to deal with, all of the mobile workers. We see IoT exploding. You see, all of the climate activity is going to be a tailwind to our business, because you have to connect all these industrial systems, to be able to control them. You've got to shift to 400 gig. I mean, let me just \u2013 I'll give you a data point, 400 gig ports we're up almost 700% year-over-year for us. We've got over 1,000 customers now that have bought 400 gig and we shipped our first 800 gig. So it's just \u2013 all these trends continue, you got 5G, you've got WiFi-6. You've got this application observability, the re-architecture of applications. So I think it's a combination of the realization of the pandemic brought on around technology debt and never letting them get to that point and then these mega trends that are going on. And Scott, do you want to take the gross margin question? Scott Herren : Yeah. I think, Paul, on the gross margin question, I think you nailed the trends. I don't expect input costs, particularly around semis to come down. I look forward to the day that I come to the office and there's a message from our semiconductor suppliers saying, hey, good news, your price is going down. I just don't see that happening. Price will offset part of it. I think you got that part right, too. I think the other \u2013 the only thing I would add that probably in your thinking, but you didn't say it, so I will. Over the longer term, as we mix more software in, that will be a tailwind at the gross margin line. So just add that to your thinking, and I think you've got it nailed. Paul Silverstein : Scott, can you go back to that record level? Scott Herren : I don't want to get into forecasting the longer term at that level of granularity right now, Paul. Paul Silverstein : I appreciate. Thanks, guys. Scott Herren : Okay. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Paul. Next question. Operator : Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. You may go ahead. Ben Bollin : Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. The first one, you talked about backlog expected to sustain at current levels exiting fiscal 2023. I think you said software backlog was north of $2 billion again in the quarter, but what was the product backlog? Where did that finish the quarter? Chuck Robbins : Yeah. We didn't give that stat and that's not one that I want to start giving every quarter. Ben, what we did say qualitatively is it grew again. And what I'll tell you is, it was up actually up triple digits again on a year-on-year basis. The overall backlog, software backlog is a pretty significant headwind to our software growth it's well north of the $2 billion that we talked about. Ben Bollin : Okay. And then one other item. I'm not asking for a forecast on RPO. I guess, that's a precursor to asking for one. But when you think about RPO in the concept of the broader 4% to 6% rev guide for the year, is the assumption as you shift more to software that RPO should consistently outperform your top line growth? How do you think about the relationship for those two metrics longer term? Scott Herren : Yeah. There's a couple of dynamics going on in RPO. So I'd say, in general, you're right, obviously, duration has an effect on RPO as well, but it varies a bit by product line. So for the quarter, we just announced the 6% product RPO growth. We had double-digit product RPO growth in secure Agile Networks, an optimized app experiences and in security, almost forgot. And we had high single-digit growth in Internet for the future. I'd say that the headwind there, of course, is collab from an RPO standpoint. So longer term, I think you'd expect those dynamics to continue. And as we turn around the go-to-market and the sales side of collab, that will flip from being a headwind to more of a tailwind on product RPO growth. Ben Bollin : Thanks Scott. Marilyn Mora : Okay. We have time for one more question. Operator : Simon Leopold from Raymond James. You may go ahead, sir. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I've got one sort of short term and one longer term. On the short-term side, we heard some anecdotes that some multi-product projects have been split up because of the supply chain constraints. And I want to get a sense of whether or not that's something that's happening as a way for you to work around some of the bottlenecks and to get some projects out the door that might not have and how that might factor into the numbers. And in terms of the longer term, Todd Nightingale had made a comment in a meeting about Cisco no longer managing to the org chart. And I wanted to see if maybe Chuck, you can elaborate on what the implications are by that particular statement? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : So Simon, if I could ask you to clarify for me is on the short-term question, I didn't quite understand. You're saying that we are breaking up orders or we're asking customers, or customers are making that decision, or what exactly was the question? Simon Leopold : Yeah. So, I'm not 100% sure, but I think it's customers asking to break apart some larger projects where they're buying a multitude of components from Cisco and essentially saying, let's not wait for the components you can't get. Ship me what you can, I'll get the other stuff elsewhere. I've heard these as anecdotes, and I'm trying to understand how substantive it is? Chuck Robbins : Yeah. I have not heard any discussion on that particular topic, but it wouldn't surprise me. I mean, if I was a customer and if I had a project that I could actually drive some constructive ROI by doing part of it, then I would split it up to try to get the part that I could get, for sure. I'll tell you what we are seeing, we are -- we have customers are being really good with us about telling us what they desperately need and what they're okay waiting for. They've been really great about saying, look, I'm not going to come tell you this guy is falling and tell you, I need everything in backlog tomorrow. But here's what I really need, here's what I need this time. Here's what I need this time. And so we've been working through that a lot with customers and that may be a variation of what you've heard. So that's the only thing that I can think of. On the Todd comment on the org chart, I think the comment is we don't want to ship our org chart. And we talked at Cisco Live about a huge number of `cross-business unit technology combinations that we were delivering. I'll give you a couple of examples, but this is what he's talking about. Like our Secure Connects plus that we started shipping includes SD-WAN technology from the enterprise networking team and cloud security from the security team brought together in a managed as-a-service offer for customers. There's integration going on between AppDynamics and ThousandEyes that actually will be bidirectional intelligence. It will flow between those two. You've got AppDynamics doing the same thing with Talos and other aspects of the security portfolio for that exact reason. You've got -- before Jonathan took on all of the portfolio that Todd had and his own, there was a lot of work Todd was doing with Jonathan's team around private 5G and how do we build private 5G services through a combination of those. So that's what Todd is talking about. I think the teams have done a good job of really leading with what the customer needs and not building from the way the org chart is built. And that's what he's talking about. Simon Leopold : Great. Thanks for that clarification. Chuck Robbins : Okay. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Simon. Chuck Robbins : Good. All right. Well, thank you all. Before we wrap, I want to make a few closing comments. I just first want to say, I'm really proud of what our teams have achieved. It's obviously a very dynamic environment, and the teams have really shown great execution and great focus. We did have tough compares, and so we worked really hard to try to give you a different way of looking at the demand, and we'll just -- we'll let you know if we see anything change when we come back together in the next call. But right now, demand remains solid. I think customers really do understand the value that technology brings to their strategy. I also appreciate what our supply chain teams have achieved, and we're encouraged by what we're seeing and how that supply, hopefully, will continue to ease throughout the year. The business model transition is really helping us, give you more visibility and predictability. And I'm also proud of how our team has rallied around our purpose. Just a couple of comments. This year, we set another a record, a record high number of employees who were given back into their communities. Our Net Zero by 2024 target and near-term targets were just approved by the science-based targets initiative under its Net Zero standard. So we're not only committed to our own goals, but also building technology that helps our customers meet their own goals. Lastly, we've been named the number one Great Place to Work in 20 countries around the world. And on any day, I will be proud of that, but this is super important right now given the competition for talent around the world, and it really does make a difference when we're trying to hire new talent into the organization. It really makes us more resilient than ever, and I think we're well positioned for long-term growth, and I want to thank all of you for spending time with us today. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Chuck. So I'll go ahead and close out the call. Cisco is the next quarterly earnings call, which will reflect our fiscal year 2023 first quarter results, will be on Wednesday, November 16, 2022 at 1 :30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to Cisco's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Marilyn Mora : Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. As is customary in Q1, we have made certain reclassifications to prior period amounts to conform to the current period's presentation. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis.  The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the second quarter and full year of fiscal 2023. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Form 10-K, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck. Charles Robbins : Thank you, Marilyn, and thank you all for joining us today. We are off to a good start in fiscal 2023, delivering strong results, exceeding the top end of our guidance range for both revenue and non-GAAP EPS. We delivered the largest quarterly revenue in our history, driven by excellent execution and the actions our team took to remediate our supply challenges. Given these results, along with the strength of our orders, our visibility, and easing supply constraints, we are raising our full year outlook, which Scott will cover later.  While we are proactively managing through an evolving and complex market environment, we remain intensely focused on executing on our strategy, including our transition to more software and subscription-based recurring revenue. We achieved software revenue growth of 5% year-over-year, and software subscription revenue grew 11%. The easing of supply constraints and our ability to deliver hardware is now releasing software subscriptions that were sitting in backlog connecting to unshipped hardware. Our success is also reflected in our ARR, which exceeded $23 billion, increasing 7%, with product ARR growing 12%. We also ended the quarter with RPO of nearly $31 billion, up 3% year-over-year with product RPO up 5%. Over $16 billion of the RPO will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months with a backlog that remains elevated at near-record levels. These metrics give us increased visibility and predictability and provide additional confidence in our ability to perform through the current market cycle. It also underscores our unique position, helping customers become more agile and resilient as they continue to navigate a complex set of challenges. As I've done in the past, I'd like to provide an update on supply chain before discussing our Q1 results. Like you've heard from others in the industry, we are encouraged by what we are seeing with modest improvement in certain component availability as shortages continue to ease from last quarter. The redesign of many of our products has also helped bring supply stability and more resiliency. Over the last few quarters, you've heard me talk about the actions we've taken to navigate supply constraints. These actions are paying off and are contributing to our results. We now have greater visibility in the ramp of our customer product deliveries, which in turn gives us greater confidence in our fiscal 2023 outlook.  Now moving to performance highlights in the quarter. We delivered revenues of $13.6 billion, up 6%, and non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.86, our second highest quarterly non-GAAP EPS in the history of the company. We also generated $4 billion in operating cash flow and returned over $2 billion to our shareholders. These metrics show we remain committed to operating discipline and our balanced capital allocation priorities. We are continuing to invest in our long-term growth opportunities while also returning capital to shareholders.  In terms of our product orders in the quarter, it's important to note that the year-over-year comparison is against an unusually strong period of 34% growth in Q1 of fiscal year '22. From a geographic perspective, we saw some emerging cautiousness in Europe. This is driven by a dramatic increase in energy costs and market volatility, which is leading customers to assess their overall spend. However, this also presents an opportunity for us as our technologies like, IoT, Silicon One and power over ethernet drive a significant reduction in power consumption. To provide a normalized perspective, our Q4 to Q1 sequential growth was just slightly below the normal range over the last 6 years. It's also important to note that this was the second highest Q1 orders in the history of the company. We have strong product revenue momentum in key parts of our business, including Secure Agile Networks, Security and Optimized Application Experiences. We also saw record performance from a number of products, including the Catalyst 9000 family, Cisco 8000, Wireless, Meraki, ThousandEyes and Duo. Networking is becoming increasingly critical to every organization, led by digital transformation, hybrid cloud, AI and ML workloads. This is driving demand for our technologies. As we've discussed, there are also tailwinds to our business, such as hybrid work, 400 gig and beyond, 5G, WiFi 6, security and full stack observability. We believe these broader technology transitions will require every customer to rearchitect their network infrastructure and, in turn, fuel long-term growth across our portfolio.  As I speak with customers, they tell me that, while they're closely watching the economy, they remain focused on making the right investments across their business to increase their agility and drive greater innovation and productivity. In our web-scale business, demand remains solid, driven by their growing investments with Cisco to build out AI fabric and massively scalable cloud networks. Once again, we saw strong momentum with our Silicon One-based Cisco 8000 routers. We are experiencing robust demand for our 400 gig products and now have nearly 1,200 customers. On a trailing 12-month basis, web-scale orders were up double digits or greater for the eighth consecutive quarter. Network capacity and demand continues to increase, driven by 5G, IoT, pervasive video and other technology trends I've mentioned earlier. With our commitment to powering next-generation networks while also driving sustainability, we launched new 800 gig switching platforms built on our Silicon One G100 chip to help meet customers' demand for more programmability, bandwidth and energy efficiency. Let me now touch on our innovation, as I'm incredibly proud of how our teams have come together to deliver market-leading solutions for our customers. Security and hybrid work are now more critical than ever. We continue to extend our capabilities to enable customers to work more securely anywhere while reducing cost and complexity. In security, we introduced new data loss prevention, firewall and Zero Trust capabilities across our portfolio. And in collaboration, we announced more than 40 new innovations to power hybrid work and deliver exceptional customer experiences. We're also committed to giving our customers more choice. An example of this is our partnership with Microsoft to bring Microsoft teams to Cisco meeting room devices. By doing this, we are driving interoperability and demonstrating our openness to meet our customers' need and provide greater flexibility.  To wrap up, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth. The strength of orders, increased visibility and easing supply situation provides us with enhanced visibility and predictability, which underpins the confidence we have in our business and our increased outlook for the year. Our performance this quarter is a testament to our innovation and execution to support our customers during these complex times. Additionally, it reinforces Cisco's strength, durability and discipline in how we manage the business while investing to capture the multiyear growth opportunities ahead. Our portfolio is in great shape, and our business model is resilient with 43% of our revenue now recurring, which is very important as we navigate the current macro environment. The hard work and dedicated commitment of our leadership team and employees over the last few years to transform our business model is reflected in the performance we delivered this quarter. Combined with the strength of our balance sheet and our position in the market, we have an excellent foundation for delivering long-term results. I will now turn it over to Scott. Richard Herren : Thanks, Chuck. We started the fiscal year with a strong Q1, reflecting solid execution and disciplined management. We had record total revenue of $13.6 billion, exceeding the high end of our guidance range, driven by product shipment levels above our expectations and continued improvements in component supply.  Non-GAAP operating margin was 31.8%, down 150 basis points, in line with our guidance range, primarily driven by higher component costs as well as logistics costs related to supply constraints. Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion, up 2%, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.86, up 5%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range.  Looking at our Q1 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $10.2 billion, up 8%, and service revenue was flat at $3.4 billion. Within product revenue, Secure Agile Networks performed well, up 12%. Switching revenue grew with double-digit growth in campus switching, driven by growth in our Catalyst 9000 and Meraki offerings. While data center switching modestly declined, we saw solid growth in our Nexus 9000 offering. Enterprise routing declined primarily from the product transition to our Catalyst 8000 series routers along with constrained supply. Wireless had very strong double-digit growth driven primarily by our WiFi 6 products and Meraki wireless offering.  Internet for the Future was down 5%, driven by declines in Cable, Optical and Edge. We saw growth in our Cisco 8000 offering and strong double-digit growth in web scale. Collaboration was down 2%, driven by a decline in meetings, partially offset by growth in calling. End-to-end security was up 9%, driven by unified threat management and Zero Trust offerings. Our Zero Trust portfolio continues to perform well, driven by strong performance in our Duo offering. Optimized application experiences was up 7%, driven by double-digit growth in our SaaS-based offering, ThousandEyes.  We continue to make progress on our transformation metrics as we shift our business to more software and subscriptions. We saw strong performance in our ARR of $23.2 billion, which increased 7% with product ARR growth of 12%. Total software revenue was $3.9 billion, an increase of 5%, with software subscription revenue up 11%. 85% of the software revenue was subscription based, which is up 5 percentage points year-over-year. We continue to have over $2 billion of software orders in our product backlog.  Total subscription revenue was $5.9 billion, an increase of 6%. Total subscription revenue represented 43% of Cisco's total revenue. And RPO was up -- was $30.9 billion, up 3%. Product RPO increased 5%, and service RPO increased 1%. Total short-term RPO grew to $16.4 billion.  In terms of orders in Q1, we had the second highest Q1 orders in our history. Although product orders were down 14% for the quarter, it's important to keep in mind that they compare against 34% growth from a year ago. We continue to have low cancellation rates, which remain below prepandemic levels. Looking at our geographic segments year-on-year. The Americas was down 10%. EMEA was down 23% and APJC down 10%. In our customer markets, service provider was down 23%, commercial was down 14%, Enterprise was down 13% and public sector was down 7%. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in within our guidance range at 63%, down 150 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 61%, down 280 basis points, and service gross margin was 68.8%, up 230 basis points. In our product gross margin, the decrease was primarily driven by both component costs as well as higher freight and logistics costs related to supply constraint. This was partially offset by strong positive pricing impact as a result of the actions we took in the prior year as well as some benefit from product mix. Backlog levels for both our hardware and software continue to far exceed historical levels. As we navigated a complex supply environment, we were able to increase our shipments this quarter, resulting in about a 10% decrease in total backlog sequentially, which remains at the second highest level we've seen. Just a reminder, backlog is not included as part of our $30.9 billion in remaining performance obligations. Combined, our significant backlog and RPO continued to provide great visibility for our top line. Shifting to the balance sheet. We ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $19.8 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $4 billion, up 16% year-over-year.  In capital allocation, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and approximately $500 million of share repurchases. All of this is in line with our long-term objective of returning a minimum of 50% of free cash flow annually to our shareholders. We also ended the quarter with $14.7 billion in stock repurchase authorization. To summarize, we executed well in Q1 in a highly complex environment, delivering better-than-expected top line growth and non-GAAP profitability. We continue to make progress on our business model shift to more recurring revenue while making strategic investments in innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities. Consistent with that objective, we announced some restructuring actions focused on prioritizing our investments across our highest growth opportunities and rightsizing our real estate footprint to help maximize long-term value for our shareholders.  Turning to our financial guidance for Q2. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 4.5% to 6.5%. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margins to be in the range of 63% to 64%. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 31.5% to 32.5%. And non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.84 to $0.86.  For fiscal year '23, our guidance is, we are raising our expectations for revenue growth to be in the range of 4.5% to 6.5% year-on-year. This is up from the prior range of 4% to 6% growth. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.51 to $3.58, also up 4.5% to 6.5% year-on-year. In both our Q2 and full year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. Our Q2 guidance reflects the increased visibility we have from our significant backlog and the RPO we have built up with our business model transformation as well as the easing of supply constraints. The full year guidance rolls forward our Q1 overperformance with a prudent view of the remainder of the year.  I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Scott. Michelle, let's go ahead and queue up the Q&A. Operator : Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Meta Marshall : Congrats on the quarter. Chuck, I was just wondering if you could dive a little bit into -- more into kind of the commentary that you gave about Europe and just also kind of what you're seeing in terms of level of activity or level of approvals needed within the U.S., that would be helpful. Charles Robbins : Thanks, Meta. Yes, we saw -- Europe is obviously being impacted by the energy costs. And I think that's just forcing companies to take a look at their P&L as you would have to and where they spend their dollars. And we continue to see it not be quite as cold there. We had conversations with some of our team members this week, which is a positive sign. But the other thing that I called out that I think is an important one is that customers are trying to solve this energy cost issue in a very aggressive way. And we have several technology areas that can help them do that, including our Silicon One technology, which powers their networks at much lower power consumption. You've got IoT where we can connect these energy systems and make them more efficient as well as Power-Over-Ethernet, which actually just reduces the power footprint for our customers. So it does also create some opportunity.  I'd say if I go to Asia real quick, you've got -- Asia was actually pretty resilient. They're clearly aware of the economic situation that's going on, but we had 5 regions last quarter that were positive after big positives a year ago, including India, which grew significantly after significant growth the prior year. So that was a good sign. So Asia's pretty resilient, it feels like right now.  And then in the Americas, I'd say it's a little mixed. We have some customers who are powering forward and other customers who are taking a little cautious outlook. We think by December, we'll have better visibility to the 2023 budgets, which will be helpful. And to your question about more signatures, we have seen -- our customers have implemented greater signature requirements. But by and large, the deals that we have going are getting signed. They're just taking a little bit longer than we'd expect. Operator : Tal Liani from Bank of America. Tal Liani : Great quarter, and I see that the numbers are going up, but the question is how much of it is backlog flush and how much of it is the environment? Meaning, I look at your product growth -- product orders. It's down 14%. Last quarter, it's down 6%. And the question is how is the environment itself? Is the environment weakening from an orders bookings, backlog? Is the environment weakening and what we're seeing is acceleration because of supply constraints that are easing? Or is the environment holding up? And maybe you can refer to some kind of -- some of your big product categories to see how the trends are. Charles Robbins : Yes. Thanks, Tal. So this is a question we expected, so I'm going to give you a little more detail than I probably normally would. First off, the 2 quarters we just finished and the next quarter, we have massive year-over-year comparisons from prior year. So as we discussed last time, we think it's more important to look at sequential growth as an indicator. And as I said, we were slightly below our historic quarter-to-quarter range, roughly 1%. So it wasn't significant, not completely out of line, certainly a little lighter than we would expect normally but not significant. Enterprise and commercial on a global basis were both within the normal sequential range. Public sector was slightly out of range, and service provider's just lumpy. So the sequential reflection on service provider is not really valid. So demand was not -- it didn't fall off a cliff by any stretch. In fact, U.S. enterprise, after a upper 20s growth in the prior year, they actually posted low single-digit positive growth again. So that was a positive sign. Our order linearity within the quarter was in line. And remember, it was our second largest Q1 orders ever. So only -- the only quarter that was bigger was the quarter a year ago. So that's positive.  Now what you're trying to get at, and I think everybody is trying to get at is, is this year being driven by backlog? And then as we go beyond that, everything falls apart. So let me give you some data points on this. Even if our orders are down 10% this year, which is not our forecast, we will still -- we project today that we will end the fiscal year with 2 to 3x our historic year-end normal backlog. That normal backlog is typically $4 billion to $5 billion. So I'm giving you actual numbers here. And then when you couple that with 43% of our revenue now coming from recurring, which is reflected in our RPO, that's what gives us a high degree of confidence and a high degree of visibility in the near term. So hopefully, that helps you as I answer your question, Tal. Operator : David Vogt from UBS. David Vogt : Chuck, maybe just as a point of clarification, you talked about the sequential decline. It was a little bit worse than seasonal. But you took down backlog by about 10%, looks like quarter-over-quarter. Can you just kind of help square those numbers because that sounds -- if I just say that you did about 13.1% last year in the fourth quarter, you'd be a little bit below [Technical Difficulty]. Marilyn Mora : David, I think we may have lost you. David Vogt : Can you guys hear me? Marilyn Mora : Now we can. David Vogt : Just can you help square the backlog versus the sequential commentary? If I look at your quarter-over-quarter backlog commentary, that was slightly below seasonal, but it sounds like you took down backlog by about 10%. So it seems like there's about $600 million or $700 million of revenue that we're [indiscernible] to kind of triangulate on. So if you can kind of talk just walk through that, that would be helpful. Richard Herren : Sure. Yes. The backlog came down about 10%, leaving us with an ending backlog at the end of Q1 that was the second highest in our history and higher than what we had seen at the end of Q3. So we took a spike up a little more than 10% in Q4 and came back down in Q1. What Chuck was talking about on the sequentials is really about the overall product bookings that came in versus where we're standing in backlog. So the flow-through of orders come in, drop in the backlog, that backlog then converts into revenue. The way you got to think about it is less about does the change in backlog convert to revenue growth and more of does the change in backlog convert to build. Charles Robbins : And remember, bookings contribute to both backlog and RPO. David Vogt : Got it. And maybe just one final thing on profitability. When software comes out of backlog, I would imagine that would have been a tailwind for gross margins in the quarter. Can you kind of quantify what that might have been in the quarter, given obviously, there's some supply chain pressure and logistics pressures on margin? Richard Herren : Yes, you said it right. Longer term, the software component continuing to grow and us being able to ship that out of backlog will be a tailwind to margins. Right now, what we're shipping out of backlog is still a lot of aged product. We made great progress, by the way, on our aged backlog during the quarter, but a lot of what we're shipping out still is orders that were received prior to the price increases. So you see 2 things happening at once. You see the higher cost and the revenue is tied to pre-price-increase sales at the same -- which obviously is a headwind to margins. At the same time, we see more software being shipped out, which is a tailwind. The net is it continues to be a pretty significant headwind. 61% product gross margin in the quarter, in line with what we had seen in Q4.  The good news is we made good progress on shipping out a lot of that aged backlog. There's still a little bit more to get out in Q2. And so I expect by the end of the year, margins to expand from where they are now, product margins to expand 50 to 75 basis points. Operator : Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Ittai Kidron : Nice results. Chuck, I want to go back to your answer to Tal's question. It's very clear that with orders down and your ability to fulfill now much more enhanced that the backlog over the next few quarters will just continue to decline. So help us get our hands around what would be a level of decline that would make you worry versus a level of decline that you'd think as a normal pace in going back to historical normal levels. What would be the line in the sand would you say where you would say, more than this, we probably have an issue, but if it's around X, then it's perfectly normal and reasonable that, that will happen over the next 12, 18 months? Charles Robbins : Yes, Ittai. We've actually modeled out various bookings scenarios for the year, and it would have to be significantly worse than what I told you for it to be concerning. Scott, do you have any other comments? Richard Herren : No. I think what you're trying to get at is when do we get back to more seasonal patterns, right? Obviously, seasonality went out the window, both going into the pandemic and then coming out of it with those 3 consecutive quarters of north of 30% growth. We are beginning to see signs of normal seasonality returning. It's going to be a little complex to see, though, because, as supply constraints loosen up, we'll be able to reduce lead times. We've already done that for a handful of product lines. And as we do that, of course, that will have an effect on just the current period bookings. So it's going to be a little bit difficult for you to spot those trends over the next few quarters as lead times normalize. Operator : Tim Long from Barclays. Timothy Long : Two quick ones, if I could. Maybe, Chuck, on the cloud vertical, could you talk a little bit -- still talking double-digit orders there, could you kind of just parse out the deceleration in terms of maybe just normalization of extra quarters of ordering verse potential for -- there's been a lot of talk of normalization of spend by the cloud players next year, if you could kind of parse those 2 out. And then on the software side, just curious if you can update us. It sounds like a lot of hardware converted, which helped. Could you talk a little bit about kind of 9K renewals and maybe any of the other standalone software offerings that you think could also help that growth number the next few quarters? Charles Robbins : Yes. Two good questions, Tim. So on the cloud vertical, I think you're calling out the right thing that the normalization of the orders is going to probably occur over the next few quarters. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to see our trailing fourth quarter rates over the next couple quarters, maybe even dip negative because of such -- so much ordering ahead that we've seen. But we continue to see real strong demand in general from them. We've done a great deal of long-term planning with them. We have some number of orders that aren't even in book -- they don't even show up in bookings yet because they're out past our bookings lead time window. So that's positive. So we continue to see success there. We continue to win franchises, and we feel good about where we are there.  On the software side, what I would say is that the 9K renewals are improving. They're still not material right now. I think next year, we'll see that occur. What we did announce is the -- this past year is that we are going to manage all of the Catalyst portfolio under the Meraki dashboard, the Meraki platform, and that will be delivered to our customers who have the DNA license and the premium license. So we think that, in itself, we've already launched the monitoring capability there and the management. We think we'll even include -- we'll even improve our renewals beyond that. But as we said, we had a record quarter for Cat 9K. So we're real happy with how it's performing. Scott? Richard Herren : Yes. What I'd add to that, Tim, is if you're looking at software growth, bear in mind, the software subscription growth, the subscription subset of our total software grew 11%. And it's now 85% of the total. Obviously, with the total only growing 5%, there was a continued decline in perpetual as part of the software license. It's now -- or software revenue. It's now 15% of our total. So I think we're getting to a point where the subscription base is getting significantly larger than what's in perpetual, and that headwind on perpetual will be less of an impact on us going forward. Operator : Paul Silverstein with Cowen and Company. Paul Silverstein : I appreciate you taking the question. At the risk of asking something you can't or will not respond to, Scott. I was hoping to ask go back to the margin question, two related questions. One, well, just for clarification, the 50 to 75 basis point product margin improvement, I assume that's off of the current quarter. Is that the reference point? Richard Herren : Yes, 50 to 75 off the current quarter, that's right, by the time we get to Q4. Paul Silverstein : Right. And now for the subsequent question, longer term, and I recognize there's a lot of moving pieces, and it's a tough environment to predict. But longer term, can you get back to or even exceed, be almost 67% growth and 34% operating margin from early '21? Those were -- your gross margin was a 15-year high. Your operating margin, you would have to go back to '97, I think, the last time you put up that type of number. Obviously, you're far off those numbers as has everybody else from what they were doing 1.5 years ago, prepandemic. But where do you think you could get back to long term? And related to that, what are your expectations, your plans for growing OpEx? I assume you want to drive some degree of leverage in definitive gross margin. Any thoughts you can share? The OpEx growth this quarter, I think, was 4% or 5%. It strikes me as a little bit high. But any thoughts in terms of what your thoughts are going forward? Richard Herren : Sure. Let me take the gross margin piece of that first. There's a couple of moving parts, as you know, Paul, inside the gross margins. One is the backlog, some of which is still sitting at pre-price-increase levels. We'll get that shipped out as we work our way through that part of the backlog. Obviously, that'll be a tailwind. The increasing component of software built into our revenues will be a tailwind. Will it get back to 65%? I think there's -- for that to happen, we'll have to see either further cost reductions on the input side between freight and logistics, which we are beginning to see. While they're up year-on-year, sequentially, we're beginning to see some signs of easing in freight and logistic costs as well, but we'll have to see that. And we'll have to see a further reduction in component cost and/or a price increase. So I think it's -- without giving you a quantified number, I think there's a number of moving parts inside there. More tailwinds as we look ahead than there are headwinds on that.  On the OpEx side, the part of what you see in this quarter, of course, is that the normalization of our bonus plans, last year, bonus plan obviously didn't pay out so well, as we go into this year, and you normalize that, that's part of the OpEx growth. We did have a slightly bigger than normal annual merit increase cycle. That's driving some of the OpEx growth as well. I think our focus longer term is -- which you've heard me say, it's balanced profitable growth, right? If you look at our guide for the year, 4.5% to 6.5% growth in the top line, 4.5% to 6.5% on the bottom line. Long term, we talked about 5% to 7% top line, 5% to 7% bottom line. I think that's really the way you need to think about it. Operator : George Notter with Jefferies. George Notter : I wanted to ask about the impact of foreign exchange. Obviously, U.S. dollar at 20-year highs. Maybe you can talk about how you're broaching that conversation with customers internationally. Are you seeing any diminishment of demand? What's the picture? Richard Herren : Yes, I'll start with the numbers on that, George. And I'm sure you know this. We sell about 90% of our revenue denominated in USD. So there's not a big translation impact to us for the strength of the dollar. It's not insignificant, but it gets offset by the benefit we get on the OpEx line. So FX to us from a translation standpoint really hasn't had a material impact.  As we look at the -- now you're selling in USD with an elevated exchange rate to the dollar, there's no question that is having a bit of an impact. Certainly, one of the things contributing to what Chuck talked about earlier that we're seeing in Europe, not only are they battling high inflation in their own markets, but that increased cost in local currency to transact has been a bit of a headwind. But we've dealt with this. We've sold in USD through the entire history of the company. Not expecting it to be something that has a lasting impact on us. Operator : Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Amit Daryanani : I guess, maybe the first one, I was hoping you could touch on the service provider market. I think you said orders were down 23%. That seems a bit more severe than the rest of the portfolio. What's happening there in any newly service provider versus web scale would be helpful. Charles Robbins : I couldn't understand the question. Marilyn Mora : Can you repeat the question? Amit Daryanani : Yes, sorry. So I was hoping you could talk a bit about the service provider order decline of 23%, seemed a bit more severe than the rest of the business. And then anything over there between web scale and kind of the traditional service providers would be helpful. Charles Robbins : Yes. Amit, thank you for that. And I think the reality around that one is simply if you go back a year ago, that segment grew 65%. I think that's the fundamental issue. I don't think there's anything else going on. Amit Daryanani : Got it. And I guess maybe if I could just ask you just about the full year guide. I mean, you folks have guided it, right? And you just did 6% growth against a very difficult compare, and I guess the way to your guide, but you aren't really assuming much of an acceleration for the rest of the year despite compares are getting easier. So I guess, Chuck, is that just being conservative, or are you seeing signs in your backlog or your orders that give you a pause on that business. If you could show how easily the compares here, I would imagine the growth rate accelerate a bit for the year. Charles Robbins : No, there's nothing that's giving us pause in that. I mean, we guided up the full year in revenue from what had been a guide of 4% to 6% growth to 4.5% to 6.5%. That effectively rolls forward the outperformance that we had in Q1 into the full year. There's no change in the way we're looking at the second half of the year either plus or minus. But it's a prudent view of what we expect in the next 3 quarters. Operator : Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : I wanted to see if there was some way you could characterize your own lead time. So if you had customers placing orders today from Meraki products or campus switches or data center gear, what are the lead times for getting the product for your customers? And how does that compare to the prior quarter and prior year? Charles Robbins : Yes, I'll make some comments, and then, Scott, if you want to add some color, feel free. The range on the products is very wide right now. We still have a couple product areas that we have component issues that we're doing some work, and I think we've got probably one more quarter before we start improving those. We've got other products like we have certain firewalls that are down to 3-week lead times. We have some of the products we've redesigned that I've talked about before. It went from 40 weeks to 12 weeks and will continue to improve. I think we made improvements in roughly half of the portfolio. Half of the product families improved during the last quarter, and we would expect to continue that progress as we move forward. Simon Leopold : And just as a quick follow-up. As you're showing improvement, do you see that affecting your ability to maintain or take market share where perhaps you were more vulnerable when the lead times were more extended? Charles Robbins : Yes. I think the whole market share discussion is reflected in our backlog. I mean, that's the issue. And as we ship it, you will see us -- I think, you'll see us over the next 12 months gain market share as we have an outsized backlog that we'll be delivering. So I would expect that to have a positive impact. Operator : James Fish with Piper Sandler. James Fish : On the restructuring plan, I know these things are never easy, but -- and we had picked up that the collaboration side was seeing some layoffs, but what product areas are being most hit? How should we think about the reduction of headcount here overall? What's the strategy to change the direction of some of these growth businesses around that have been kind of struggling to growth? And by that, I really mean the collaboration side. And how much are you guys factoring this kind of impact into the top line here on guide? Charles Robbins : Yes. So we're actually speaking to our employees tomorrow about this. So I'd be reluctant to go into a lot of detail here until we're able to talk to them. I would say that what we're doing is rightsizing certain businesses. We're really focused on resources moving into like in the enterprise networking space, accelerating our platform strategy. We'll be making significant investments in security and beefing up our team there and the capacity to continue to innovate there. Those are important areas.  And so if you would understand, I'd prefer to wait and talk to our employees tomorrow about it. But you can just assume that we're going to -- we're not actually -- there's nothing that's a lower priority, but we are rightsizing certain businesses. And since you asked about collab, I'll tell you a little bit about what -- we see incredible strength right now in our Calling business, our Cloud Calling business. We see great strength in our Cloud Contact Center business. And the compares on the meeting side are going to start to make that -- give us the ability for that to be a much more favorable component. So we're -- I actually am optimistic over the next 12 months about our collaboration portfolio. The team has done an amazing job. I truly believe that they built the best platform in the business.  And when you look at our devices and the interoperability that the team has been driving with the Microsoft interoperability, that is a huge, huge thing when you -- from a customer perspective for us to give them that flexibility. So I think they've done a good job, and I feel pretty good about that business as we go forward. We just need to rightsize some of the OpEx. Richard Herren : And James, to be clear, don't think of this as an headcount action that is motivated by cost savings. This really is a rebalancing. As we look across the board, there are areas that we would like to invest in more. Chuck just talked about them. Security, our move to platforms and more cloud-delivered products. But we're also going to maintain our financial discipline as we do that. And so this is about just rebalancing across the board. In a perfect world, you'd have 100% skill match, and you can take the people in the areas or the skills in certain areas and just move them to where we need to invest. And unfortunately, that's -- it's not a perfect world. Charles Robbins : But we do have a -- if you look at the number of jobs that we have opened in the areas that we're trying to invest, it is just slightly lower than the number of people that we believe will be impacted. We're going to be working really hard to help match our employees to those roles to the extent there's a skill match. So we're going to work really hard at that. James Fish : If I could just follow up quickly on that. I appreciate the color there, guys, and understand the sensitivity you guys want to have. In terms of that $600 million hit, though Scott, should we expect that to actually be the net savings as a result? Or is that going to -- the net saving's actually going to be lower because you're kind of repositioning some folks? Richard Herren : Yes. It's really not motivated by cost savings. So the net -- by the time we get to the end of the year, our expectation is we have about the same headcount that we had at the beginning of the year. But there's 2 pieces to this. One is what we've been speaking about just now about the headcount impact. There's a second piece of this that's really about rightsizing our real estate portfolio. And we've got a long tail of small offices distributed around the world that are significantly underutilized and, in fact, unused in some cases. So the second piece of that charge, there will be 2 elements to it. One that's people related. The second piece will be about rightsizing our real estate portfolio. That will generate some savings, not much in fiscal '23. But longer term, that will generate some savings. Operator : Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Samik Chatterjee : Congrats on the strong print. I guess, I just had one. I think if I can go back to the -- Chuck, your comments about seeing hesitation from EMEA customers, a bit more given the macro backdrop there? And you spoke about the opportunities that you see at the same time. Maybe if we can ask you when you start seeing the hesitation from the customers there? How are you seeing them prioritize across your portfolio? Like when it comes to data center versus campus versus security as they're reevaluating their spend or hesitating investments, like how are they prioritizing within your portfolio, and we see areas are getting impacted by that? Charles Robbins : Yes, Samik, it's a good question. And I would say -- the first thing I would say is that Gartner recently came out with a survey of executives in our customer base, and they've -- almost half of them said that their technology investments will be the last thing they cut. So that's just a backdrop for, I think, how important customers view their technology investments these days.  When we look at where customers are investing, many of them are investing to -- they're moving forward with their hybrid work investments, right, and creating the infrastructure that they need to deal with this new world. We see customers continuing. We saw a recent survey that talked about customers who are balancing their private cloud and public cloud workloads. And so the whole rearchitecture of the infrastructure to deal with these new traffic patterns is another area. I mentioned in Europe with the power, with the energy costs, there's a lot of focus.  IoT has just been accelerating over the last 2 to 3 years, and we saw another -- I think we had a record bookings quarter in Q1, I believe. It was really strong, where customers are really looking to connect these systems to actually optimize their power consumption and their efficiency. And again, we see a lot of customers who are moving -- who are doing greenfield real estate projects that are really focused on reducing -- going to low-voltage architectures, which leads them to Power-over-Ethernet, which leads them to rebuilding their infrastructure. And then you've got cybersecurity, and you've got full stack observability. We continue to see 5G build-outs there. There are just lots of -- there's a lot of positive tailwinds, notwithstanding the short-term dynamic environment that we're in. Operator : Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Ahmed Sami Badri : Chuck, I wanted to go back to a comment you made regarding market share and some of that sitting in the backlog. Now if we assumed that there was nothing in the backlog and all the numbers that you generated were publicly reported through your financial statements, would that show that Cisco actually maintained or increased or even lost market share? Charles Robbins : You mean if all our backlog was actually shipped and reported? Ahmed Sami Badri : Correct. Charles Robbins : Yes. I think that will be true. I mean, look, we operate in lots of different markets. So is it true 100% of the markets? That would be difficult for me to say. But I believe that as we ship out the -- particularly our Secure Agile networks, our enterprise and networking products, that's certainly going to help. As we catch up on our data center infrastructure, I think that's going to help.  There's also just reporting dynamics that occur. Some of our competitors report certain routing products into data center switching, and we've reported into routing, which makes it difficult to ascertain. So it's an imperfect science on top of that. But I do believe that as we -- as our backlog unwinds and gets back to normal levels over the next 18, 24 months, then I think that you'll see -- I think you will see that dynamic. Ahmed Sami Badri : Got it. Just to be clear, that is Cisco gain share? I don't know, just to make sure I heard you correctly. Charles Robbins : I think that's right. In certain key areas. I mean, not perhaps across everyone. I'd have to go do the analysis. But in some of the key ones that I know all of you are worried about, the answer is yes. Richard Herren : In the bigger markets. Charles Robbins : In the bigger markets. Ahmed Sami Badri : Got it. And then one question just for Scott. So Scott, maybe you could tell us where in fiscal 1Q of '23 did shipments begin to start accelerating just because we want to kind of understand the trend here going from now through fiscal 4Q and putting into that product gross margin comment into perspective. What I'm really trying to understand is, as shipments start to accelerate, how much will software attach to those shipments just so I can understand the glide path here, what happens in some of the other segments outside of just secure network, agile networks, et cetera, right? I'm just trying to get this kind of like this pull dynamic that may occur from the other segments related to shipments going out the door. Richard Herren : Got it. Yes, we -- so we talked about the overall backlog reduction at about 10% from Q4 to where we ended Q1. That -- a subset of that, of course, is software. That same percent held pretty much true in software. Software continues to be well over $2 billion of our overall product backlog. But it's about -- it's actually about the same reduction sequentially as we saw in overall backlog so right around the 10% rate. I think as you look ahead and try to model out the 50 to 75 bps of improvement that I talked about, I think it's going to be probably a little bit heavier in the second half of the year than it will be in the second quarter. You saw the guide for the second quarter. Marilyn Mora : I'll turn it over to Chuck for some closing remarks. Charles Robbins : Thanks, Marilyn, and thank you all for joining us today. I just want to reiterate it, we feel like we had a very strong quarter, largest quarterly revenue in history. As I said earlier, the orders, the visibility, the easing of supply chain gives us the confidence to raise the year, obviously. We're very focused. We're managing the business for growth. We are going to go through this process of reinvesting into strategic areas. And the people impact is difficult. And I just want our employees who are listening in today to know that this afternoon and tomorrow, we'll be communicating about how we're going to go about this. It's always a difficult decision, but we have a lot of opportunity.  I'm very optimistic about the future. I'm proud of the teams and what they've accomplished and really excited about the visibility and the confidence that we have in the near term. So thanks for joining us, and we look forward to next time. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Chuck. Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal year 2023 second quarter results will be on Wednesday, February 15, 2023, at 1 :30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, you may begin. Marilyn Mora : Welcome everyone to Cisco\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2023 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations and I am joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and we will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be done on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter and full year of fiscal 2023. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically, the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Marilyn. I hope everyone is doing well. With the tremendous results we delivered in the first half of the year, fiscal \u201823 is shaping up to be very strong, fueled by demand for our cloud-driven networking portfolio, our continued business transformation success and an improving supply situation, thanks in large part to our team\u2019s aggressive actions. Before I dive into additional details on the quarter, I wanted to take a moment to say how incredibly proud I am of the team here at Cisco. While the environment we are operating in remains dynamic, Cisco is better positioned today than at any time since I became CEO almost 8 years ago. We have reshaped and transformed the company and our portfolio while remaining highly disciplined both financially and operationally. This gives me great confidence that we will continue to succeed in the long-term. Now I will touch on the quarter in more detail. Our Q2 financial results were strong as we again exceeded the high-end of our guidance ranges. We delivered our second highest quarterly revenue of $13.6 billion, up 7% and record non-GAAP EPS at $0.88. We also delivered solid ARR growth, sequential non-GAAP margin expansion and record non-GAAP net income. In terms of our business model shift, we continue to make great progress with 10% growth in software revenue and with software subscription revenue up 15%. Recurring revenue also now represents 44% of our total revenue. In addition, we have built up nearly $32 billion in remaining performance obligations and our backlog remains robust. Even as we drew down backlog by 6% sequentially, our total backlog still grew year-over-year. These metrics, along with our increasing visibility, led us to raise our full year outlook, which Scott will address in a moment. This quarter, we also achieved record operating cash flow, enabling today\u2019s dividend increase and the buyback of over $1 billion. We continue to deliver on our commitment to drive returns to our shareholders. Let me also provide an update on the supply situation. While components for a few product areas remain highly constrained, we did see an overall improvement. Combined with the aggressive actions our supply chain and engineering teams took to redesign hundreds of our products, we increased product deliveries and saw significant reductions in customer lead times. As our product deliveries increased, channel inventories also declined as our partners were able to complete customer projects. Like I shared last quarter, as supply constraints ease and lead times shorten, we expect orders would normalize from previously elevated levels as customers return to more typical buying patterns. As a result, sequential quarterly order growth is a better indicator than year-over-year growth. And in Q2, despite improving lead times, our quarter-over-quarter order growth was again in line with our historical ranges across most of our geographies and customer markets. With that, let me touch on what we are seeing with customer demand. In our customer markets, we experienced normal double-digit sequential growth in both our enterprise and commercial markets, while public sector performed better than we have seen historically. Within our service provider business, our order rate was below recent sequentials as some customers are absorbing the improved delivery of our products into their production environments. We saw another consecutive quarter of rapid adoption of our 400-gig Cisco 8000 and Silicon One platforms. This reflects the ongoing investments our customers are making in our innovative solutions and AI optimized infrastructure. Within web-scale, while we saw overall slowing due to normalizing product lead times, two of our largest customers grew their orders with us over 40% in the first half of fiscal \u201823. We continue to take share in this space. And over the past few years, we have grown web-scale cloud infrastructure from effectively zero into a multibillion dollar run-rate business. I am incredibly pleased about the overall progress we\u2019ve made as we are continuing to win more and more use cases within their infrastructure. We are also still at the beginning of what we believe to be a massive growth opportunity going forward. While we continue to closely monitor the global macroeconomic conditions, the overall demand environment remains steady and on par with Q1 and our pipeline and win rates remains stable. Looking at the broader landscape, digital transformation and hybrid cloud remain top areas of spend, which is fueling growth across our portfolio. Many customers have told me that while their spend levels maybe slowing in some areas technology remains essential as it is vital to their overall business resilience, competitive differentiation and success. In fact, Gartner and IDC\u2019s most recent surveys make it clear that technology budgets are growing as they forecast IT spend to increase in the mid to high single-digits in 2023. We are also seeing many customers moving ahead with their hybrid work, AI and ML investments while building the modern infrastructure they need to deliver on their objectives. IoT has also been accelerating. We saw record revenue growth in Q2 as customers look to connect their industrial systems in order to optimize power consumption, automation and efficiency. Lastly, cybersecurity and full stack observability remains strategic priorities where we continue to invest and innovate. From a product revenue perspective, we saw strong double-digit growth for Catalyst 9000, enterprise routing, Wireless, Meraki, DUO and ThousandEyes, reflecting the ongoing investments our customers are making to modernize their infrastructure to rapidly digitize and secure their organizations. We are increasing our investments in our cloud management platforms that deliver the simplicity our customers need. You will see us continue to bring AI and ML into those platforms to further simplify how networks are managed. For example, in Q2, we announced several new innovations across our cloud managed networking and security portfolios that offer greater visibility with AI-driven insights, enable secure connectivity, and give our customers the ability to simplify their IT operations. Last week, we introduced a preview our cloud-native full stack observability platform, the first network visibility solution to support open telemetry. This platform brings together our ThousandEyes and AppDynamics capabilities for unmatched data correlation and insights from the user to the application to the network. To simplify network security and policy management, our unified SASE solution, Cisco+ Secure Connect, now supports integration into Cisco SD-WAN fabrics using Viptela technology, as well as our existing Meraki SD-WAN fabric. We also introduced new flexible, more powerful and energy-efficient servers, which not only help lower cost, but also help our customers meet their sustainability goals, an increasingly critical area for most of our customers. To close, I am proud of what we achieved this quarter. We delivered a strong financial performance, innovated across our portfolio and continue to make great progress on our business transformation. In addition, the increased visibility we have from almost $32 billion in RPO, a healthy backlog and pipeline and improving supply give us the confidence to raise our full year outlook. We expect those same factors to continue into fiscal year \u201824, giving us conviction in our ability to deliver on our commitments. The modern, resilient and secure networks we are building serve as the backbone of our customers\u2019 technology strategy. Cisco is well-positioned to benefit from multiyear investment cycles with our market-leading hardware as well as our innovative software and services. Together, these allow our customers to digitize rapidly, secure their environments and achieve their sustainability goals, all while delivering differentiated experiences. Now, I will turn it over to Scott. Scott Herren : Thanks, Chuck. We delivered another strong quarter and exceeded both our top and bottom line expectations driven by our focused execution, continued success of our business transformation and improved availability of supply as the actions our supply chain team have taken over the last several quarters are bearing fruit. Total revenue was $13.6 billion, up 7%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $3.6 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share, also a record, was $0.88. Looking at our Q2 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $10.2 billion, up 9%. Service revenue was $3.4 billion, up 2%. Within product revenue, secure Agile Networks performed very well, up 14%. Switching revenue grew in the double-digits with strength in campus switching driven by our Catalyst 9000 and Meraki offerings. While data center switching declined slightly, we saw strong growth in our Nexus 9000 offerings. Enterprise routing had double-digit growth driven primarily by strength in our Catalyst 8000 Series routers, SD-WAN and IoT routing. Wireless had very strong double-digit growth with strength across the entire portfolio. Internet for the Future was down 1%, driven by declines in optical and Edge. We saw growth in our Cisco 8000 offering and double-digit growth in web-scale. Collaboration was down 10%, driven by declines in meetings and collaboration devices, slightly offset by growth in contact center. End-to-end security was up 7% driven by our unified threat management and zero trust offerings. Optimized application experiences, was up 11%, driven by double-digit growth in our SaaS-based offering ThousandEyes. We made solid progress on our transformation metrics as we shift our business to more recurring revenue-based offerings, driven by higher levels of software and subscriptions. We saw strong performance in our ARR of $23.3 billion, which increased 6% with product ARR growth of 11%. Total software revenue was $4.2 billion, an increase of 10%, with software subscription revenue up 15%. 84% of the software revenue was subscription-based, which is up 4 percentage points, year-over-year. We continue to have $2 billion of software orders in our product backlog. Total subscription revenue was $6 billion, an increase of 9%. Total subscription revenue represented 44% of total revenue. And RPO was $31.8 billion, up 4%. Product RPO increased 7% and service RPO increased 2%, and total short-term RPO grew to $16.9 billion. While total product orders were down 22%, they compared against 34% growth in Q2 fiscal \u201822, which is one of the largest quarters for product orders in our history. We saw year-over-year declines across our geographies and customer markets. Sequentially, total product order growth was in line with our historical growth rates. Within our customer markets, we experienced double-digit sequential growth in both enterprise and commercial and public sector was better than we have seen historically. We continue to have very low order cancellation rates, which remain below pre-pandemic levels. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at the high end of our guidance range at 63.9%, down 160 basis points and up 90 basis points sequentially. Product gross margin was 62.1% down 220 basis points year-over-year and up 110 basis points sequentially. Service gross margin was 69.1%, up 30 basis points. In our product gross margin, the year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by higher component and other costs. This was partially offset by our strong product mix and positive pricing as the benefits of the actions we took in the prior fiscal year flowed through as we shift our backlog. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at the high-end of our guidance range at 32.5%, down 180 basis year-over-year and up 70 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by the higher component and other costs that I just mentioned. Backlog for both our hardware and software products continue to far exceed historical levels. As we navigated a complex supply environment, we were able to drawdown total backlog by 6% sequentially, although it still grew year-over-year. Just a reminder, backlog is not included as part of our $31.8 billion in remaining performance obligations. Combined, our significant product backlog and RPO continued to provide great visibility to our top line. Shifting to the balance sheet, we ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $22.1 billion. We had record operating cash flow for the quarter of $4.7 billion, up 93% year-over-year driven by strong collections and we deferred our Q2 federal tax payments due to the IRS tax relief related to the California floods. We expect to pay these federal taxes by the end of the fiscal year. We returned $2.8 billion to shareholders during the quarter, which was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.3 billion of share repurchases. We also ended the quarter with $13.4 billion in remaining stock repurchase authorization. Today, we announced that we are raising our quarterly dividend by $0.01 to $0.39 per share, which represents our 13th consecutive increase. This reinforces our commitment to returning a minimum of 50% of free cash flow to our shareholders annually and confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. To summarize, we had a great quarter, delivering better-than-expected top and bottom line performance. We continue to make progress on our business model shift to more recurring revenue while making strategic investments in innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities. Turning now to our guidance, our guidance ranges reflect our strong pipeline and significant visibility driven by healthy backlog, ARR, RPO and improving availability of supply as we continue to benefit from the actions our supply chain team have taken over the last several quarters. We expect those same factors will continue into fiscal 2024 giving us greater visibility and confidence in our longer term goals. For fiscal Q3, our guidance is : we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 11% to 13%; we anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5%; our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33% to 34%; and our non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.96 to $0.98. There is also a significant change to our full year fiscal \u201823 revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance driven by these same factors. For fiscal year \u201823, we are raising our expectations for revenue growth to be in the range of 9% to 10.5% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $3.73 to $3.78. In both our Q3 and full year guidance, we are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. I will now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Scott. I am going to turn it over to Chuck just for a few comments before we start the Q&A. Chuck Robbins : Yes. Before we get into Q&A, I just wanted to send our condolences to those impacted by the earthquake in Turkey and Syria. It\u2019s been absolutely devastating to watch as the death toll has climbed and we are working closely with our teams in the region to give them support and help on the ground as much as we can. We just want to let them know that we are all thinking about them and we are here to help. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Chuck. Michelle, let\u2019s go ahead and open up the queue for questions and answers. Operator : Thank you, Marilyn. Ittai Kidron, you may go ahead, with Oppenheimer & Company. Ittai Kidron : Thanks guys and nice quarter, nice guide. I guess the big question is when you think about the outlook that you have for continued supply chain improvement, how long would the order backlog normalization process is going to take in your view? And maybe you can quantify in the quarter itself or perhaps on the guidance \u2013 when you look at the guidance, how much of that is coming from your ability to fulfill more versus the true underlying demand? I am just trying to gauge for how long you can kind of keep this going at above normal growth rates for yourself? Chuck Robbins : Yes, Ittai, thanks for the question. And shockingly enough, that was the first question I expected. So let me just summarize sort of what we are seeing and then I can give you more detail. But number one, let\u2019s start with the fact that our demand is stable and that\u2019s first. Based on the sequentials that we saw, demand remained stable. And in fact, if you look out at our Q3 forecast, which we normally wouldn\u2019t give you, the current forecast in Q3 is also in line with historical ranges of sequentials. So that\u2019s the first piece. The second thing is, as Scott said, while we \u2013 backlog came down 6% sequentially. It was up year-over-year, and we expect that we will end the fiscal year even with the guidance we gave you today with a backlog that\u2019s roughly double what we would normally end the year with. The other thing to take into consideration is the business transformation with 44% of our revenue now recurring really helps a great deal. And we have $23 billion of ARR, which we can actually renew in the next 12 months. So if you go back 8 or 9 years ago, we might have had to take orders for 75% of our revenue in any given quarter. And now we have 44% of our revenue coming from the balance sheet and recurring revenue. So all that said, we actually believe that we will still be able to deliver. We\u2019re confident that we will deliver positive growth in fiscal \u201824, obviously, with pretty significant comps based on the guidance that we gave today. Ittai Kidron : Okay. I guess when I think normal, given your historical ranges before the pandemic, I always think about 4 to 6 is kind of the range plus/minus that you run at. Is it fair to say that from here on anything above is kind of order \u2013 eating into backlog? And while your backlog is double, that can still mean that you can run above normal ranges for at least a couple of years, it sounds like, unless something unusual happens. Am I misinterpreting your comments? Chuck Robbins : Scott, do you want to take that? Scott Herren : No, not at all, Ittai. But what I would say is it\u2019s obviously too early for us to guide fiscal \u201824. What we wanted to give you confidence is we have better visibility than we\u2019ve ever had in the past, both from the backlog and the $17 billion \u2013 almost $17 billion of RPO that\u2019s current, that\u2019s going to turn into revenue in the next 12 months in the ARR. But \u2013 and we\u2019re going to roll in backlog that\u2019s roughly double what it normally would be at the end of the year. So we have good confidence in where we\u2019re headed in fiscal \u201824. I think it\u2019s a bit too early given where we are in the year just at the end of our second quarter for us to be a little more precise on that. Ittai Kidron : Okay. Appreciate. Good luck. Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Thanks. Marilyn Mora : Thank you, Ittai. Next question, please. Operator : Amit Daryanani from Evercore, you may go ahead, sir. Amit Daryanani : Thanks. Congrats on a really good quarter for mine as well. I guess maybe if I think about the secure agile networking segment growing at 14%, that\u2019s really notable. And I don\u2019t think the industry is growing nearly close to that pace. So I\u2019d love to understand, I mean, do you think you\u2019re starting to see some share gains come back to with Cisco, especially the supply chain start to improve? Is that a tailwind that you see and perhaps that continues for the rest of the year? Maybe you could just talk about that and also maybe talk about how campus did within that segment? That would be helpful. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Amit. Let me take the share question because I think I\u2019ve said on several calls that, obviously, market share is reflective of revenue and with our backlog that as we began to ship certain products that we would be a gainer of market share, and we certainly expect that when these numbers are digested and the new reports come out for Q4, that you\u2019ll see that to be the case. One example is, during last quarter, our wireless revenue was up 57% year-over-year. And I suspect that, that\u2019s going to be a share gainer. And the other thing to keep in mind is that market share is inexact. I would tell you that when we ship products into the web scale infrastructure space, as an example, it goes into our routing reports and many of our competitors put it in data center switching. So it\u2019s very difficult in some cases to get complete apples-to-apples, but I do believe that as we continue to ship our backlog that we will be gaining share. Do you want to talk a little bit about the campus switching? Scott Herren : Yes. Sorry, I missed that part of the question. Chuck Robbins : Amit, can you repeat your question about the campus switching, the second part? Amit Daryanani : Yes. No I was just wondering, like within this context of 14% growth that you saw in that segment, how is campus performing for you very specifically? And how is the supply chain kind of alleviated over that view? Scott Herren : Yes. Campus is doing well for us. And the supply chain \u2013 while I don\u2019t want to leave the perception that supply chain just got better. Our supply chain team and our product engineering teams have worked pretty relentlessly over the last several quarters with product redesign, with qualifying alternative components, with working with our suppliers to get to their subcomponents to make sure we could free this up so that the increase in supply that\u2019s leading to some of the share gains that we\u2019re talking about is the result of a lot of hard work by a lot of people inside the company. And I think, frankly, it puts us in a better position than many of our peers in the industry right now from a supply chain standpoint. But \u2013 the longer answer. The short answer is, yes, we\u2019re doing quite well in that space. And as we continue to deliver what we\u2019ve just laid out as our guidance for the second half of this year, I think you\u2019ll continue to see share gain grow for us. Amit Daryanani : Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. And I can just ask you really quick on your back half guidance is obviously fairly impressive. But in April quarter, you\u2019re sort of implying gross margins will be down 130 basis points year-over-year, I think, for the April quarter. Can you just talk about how much of a downtick you think is cyclical, things like the supply chain and logistics and so on versus structural? And what do you think normalized gross margin could look like for the company if supply chain is truly normalized? Thank you. Scott Herren : Yes. The midpoint of the guide for the April quarter is about a 10 basis point improvement from the quarter we just announced. So we do see gross margins improving, and it\u2019s largely driven by \u2013 it\u2019s less driven by cost. We\u2019re seeing some reduction in costs around logistics, in particular, but component costs are kind of staying where they are in most cases. It\u2019s more driven by the fact that as we ship the backlog more and more of what we ship, reflects the price increases that we put in place last year. So I think you\u2019ll see gross margins potentially continue to expand from where they are, maybe as much as 50 basis points in Q4. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Great. Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Paul Silverstein with Cowen, you may go ahead, sir. Paul Silverstein : Thanks. Chuck and Scott, I appreciate that you all addressed in your prepared remarks the visibility demand trend issue. But \u2013 so my apologies, but I\u2019d ask you to revisit, especially in your enterprise business, including government and U.S. federal, I\u2019m sure you and your team are aware of what your competitors have served. I know, Chuck, you just addressed the market share issue. But can you give a bit more color in terms of validity of the demand trends and the visibility that\u2019s translating into. Chuck Robbins : Well, as I said, the \u2013 our enterprise and commercial business, which is reflective of how most of our peers represent enterprise, that was up double digits sequentially, which is in line with our historical. And public sector actually performed better than \u2013 it was above our historical ranges during the quarter. So the other thing I would point out is that our quarter itself from a linearity perspective was quite normal, and we actually had a \u2013 we\u2019re unique in that we had the January month in our Q2. And one of the questions that we had was what\u2019s going to happen to budget as we enter into calendar \u201823. And we clearly \u2013 we actually finished stronger than we started the quarter. So those are just a few data points for you. And I think if you look at what our customers are focused on right now, I mean think about some of their top products. They have got a complete rearchitecture of their applications to be cloud native running in both public and/or private clouds. They are having to rearchitect their infrastructure to actually deal with the changing traffic patterns that multi-cloud brings to them. They are dealing with hybrid work and how do I transform our IT infrastructure for that. They are dealing with cybersecurity threats on a massive scale, and they are also all focused on sustainability, which is leading to our IoT business growing significantly as we connect industrial systems for our customers. So if you think about those big five trends, we\u2019re actually in the middle of those with all of our customers. So we feel good about where we are. And the last thing I\u2019ll say is that I was in Tokyo and Singapore last week and at the same time, A lot of our \u2013 my leadership team were in Amsterdam for Cisco Live Europe, and no one is talking about cutting technology spending right now. Everybody seems very committed to it. I think the underlying power of technology as it relates to all of our organization strategy is just too strong right now. Paul Silverstein : Right. And Scott, back on the margin question. I appreciate you got to walk before you run, but you\u2019re now 3 percentage points roughly below peak on both gross and operating in terms of the initial recovery, any thoughts for how much of the 3 percentage points? Can you visually get back to 67 gross? Can you get back to 35 operating and it\u2019s just a function of time or because of the price increases with respect to semis or other things, that\u2019s just a bridge too far? Scott Herren : Yes. I mean as you talk long-term, there is a number of tailwinds that will come into gross margin, so not necessarily talking about our guide for fiscal \u201823, but longer term, there are several things that are going to be a tailwind there. One is continuing to work our way through the backlog and reflect the price increases. I think we will continue to see leverage and logistics costs, both from a reduction in the freight cost per kilo but also in the mix of how we shift between what has supply airfreight and what will go in the ocean. So I think we will see some leverage there as well. I don\u2019t see a lot of our component providers outside of commodity areas like memory lining up to reduce cost to us, right? So I think it will be the combination of mix that will be beneficial to us and some cost leverage in the non-component areas that will drive that north. Paul Silverstein : So you think you can get back to 67, 35? Scott Herren : Yes. So are you asking me for a 5-year forecast on gross margin, Paul, is that where you\u2019re going? Paul Silverstein : Yes, long-term. Long-term, can you get back to that model? Scott Herren : Long-term, there is definitely leverage to push it back to where it\u2019s been historically, for sure, and if not beyond. Paul Silverstein : Thanks, Scott. Scott Herren : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Paul. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley, you may go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. I\u2019m assuming as you\u2019re having conversations with customers, they are looking for more flexible subscription methods and part of your subscription transition has kind of been evolving kind of the ELA model or kind of the subscription model you guys have had. And I just wanted to get a sense of where you think you are on some of the kind of subscriptionization of some of your products and whether you are seeing a big impact to that right now and then just maybe just some commentary about how you see the M&A environment currently? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Meta, thank you. So we are probably, I\u2019d say, still in the early innings of transitioning the traditional portfolio to subscription models. The team is working hard on that right now. And we will just continue to keep you updated. But I think we\u2019re several quarters away from really having anything to speak about relative to the size of that business, but we\u2019re working hard on being able to deliver that. And the key is to give customers flexibility. That\u2019s what \u2013 over the last 7 years or so, we have disaggregated hardware and software and silicon. We virtualized software to run on x86 appliances. So we want to give our customers whatever kinds of flexibility that they would like. So that\u2019s the first part. On the M&A side, I would say our strategy, as you would expect, has not changed. I think the market dynamics have changed, and I think that the longer valuations remain somewhat muted from their peaks. I think some of the companies are probably coming to more of a real position on what \u2013 how long these valuations may exist and were prior valuations even realistic in the first place. So we continue to stay aware of what\u2019s going on. We continue to scan the marketplace, but our strategy remains the same. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Meta. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James, you may go ahead, sir. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if we could talk a little bit about the trends you\u2019re seeing in data centers. In the prepared remarks, I think you mentioned Campus was good, but data center was weak. And I guess maybe I\u2019m looking for not just the switching part of it, but your UCS business. And what are the broader trends? How much of that is reflective of hyperscale slowing versus the broader market, just trying to unpack that a bit? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Yes, I\u2019ll make a couple of comments, and Scott, I don\u2019t know if you want to give any detail. But I would say that our customers are increasingly balanced around how they are thinking about private cloud versus public cloud. And so we\u2019ve seen continued focus on revitalizing the private data center infrastructure. And I\u2019ll let Scott speak to \u2013 I\u2019m not sure on the infrastructure side or UCS, if you want to share that. But the other thing I would point out, Simon, as I said in my comments earlier about market share, everything that we sell in the infrastructure within web scale flows into our routing market share numbers and our routing business. So it doesn\u2019t actually boost our data center switching the way we report it. So it\u2019s a little bit of an apples-and-oranges issue. I just want to make sure you understood that. Scott Herren : No, that\u2019s a really good point. And on UCS, if that\u2019s the root of your question, Simon, we are seeing nice growth in UCS as well. And at least based on our calculations, we feel like we\u2019re gaining share there as well. Simon Leopold : Thanks. And then just maybe a quick follow-up, I was a little bit surprised that the metric of hardware attached software in backlog is $2 billion, same as it was in the prior quarter. I would have guessed it would have come down with the basically improvement of shipping the hard \u2013 associated hardware. So maybe I don\u2019t understand that value or you could talk a little bit to why that $2 billion didn\u2019t come down with the extra shipments of the related hardware? Thanks. Scott Herren : It\u2019s a great question, Simon. And we actually did see \u2013 if you noticed, our overall software revenue grew 10% this quarter, so back to double-digit growth. And some of that growth is on the back of shipping some of the backlog out, both the hardware and the software that\u2019s had in backlog. So we are seeing the benefit of shipping that out. At the same time, as Chuck said earlier, demand remains steady. And so our overall backlog, while it came down only about 6% sequentially, there is still a significant amount of software stock in that backlog, some of it attached to hardware. Simon Leopold : And software as a total percent of revenue or product revenue, that metric, where is that now? Scott Herren : Yes. Just for software, it\u2019s in the 30% range. Overall, we\u2019re in the 44% range. Simon Leopold : Thank you very much. Marilyn Mora : Alright. Thanks, Simon. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Sami Badri from Credit Suisse, you may go ahead, sir. Sami Badri : Hi, thank you. I had one quick one and a follow-up. The first one is on just the data center switching redesign. You guys made several mentions regarding supply and the team kind of working hard to get redesign through. But does that actually mean the data center switching portfolio is now completed with redesign and that part really did drive the better revenue guidance for the year? So that\u2019s my first question. The other one is we\u2019ve seen several companies report elongated lead times for sales cycles and extra signatures and all these other elements. And I appreciate, Chuck, you did hit on the fact that you aren\u2019t seeing any kind of tech spend get cut. But are you seeing some kind of resistance or slowdown as far as sales cycles impacting the speed at which you guys have historically done business. And I take into account also I appreciate your comment regarding linearity. But I just wanted to kind of ask this question to get it through. Chuck Robbins : Let me take the second one first, and then Scott, you can talk about the data center switching redesign. We absolutely are seeing some elongated sales cycles. What our teams have told me is that, in many cases, there are extra signatures required. We just seem to, in general, be getting them. It just takes a little bit longer. So \u2013 but look, it\u2019s a complex world right now. But if you look back at historical sort of what we would consider a bit of a crisis or a complex world environment, I\u2019ve experienced demand falling off a cliff, and we obviously haven\u2019t seen that in the current situation. Scott, do you want to talk about the redesign? Scott Herren : Just to finish up on that pipeline looks strong, close rates still look good. So we\u2019re not seeing a huge difference there. There is, in some cases, a slight elongation. On the redesign, that\u2019s absolutely contributed to the growth that we\u2019re seeing, particularly in secure agile networks, less so from \u2013 in terms of releasing the next successor product, more being able to design around problematic components that we couldn\u2019t get supply of. And as we work those redesigns to build the product around components, we can get our hands on, that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about when we talk about the redesign. And so there is no question, that\u2019s driven some of the growth that you saw in the quarter we just announced. We will continue to drive the significant growth that we\u2019ve put out for the second half. And to be clear, we will continue to see growth into fiscal \u201824. All the trends we have talked about that are driving the uptick that you see in our guidance in the second half of this year, those trends continue into fiscal \u201824, and we continue to expect nice growth there. I just think it\u2019s a little too early to start to quantify that and give you a guide. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. George Notter from Jefferies, you may go ahead sir. George Notter : Hi guys. Thanks very much. I guess I wanted to ask about your impressions of backlog and product orders relative to three months ago. And I think I have this correct. About three months ago, you guys were talking about if product orders were down 10% for the year, then your product backlog at fiscal year-end would be 2x to 3x higher than the normal kind of $4 billion or $5 billion range. And Chuck, I think you were quick to say that it didn\u2019t feel like a 10% order decline was in the cards for you. So, it feels now like you are going to burn more backlog than you were thinking previously and orders will be a bit worse than previous, am I perceiving that correctly? And what are your thoughts there? Thanks. Scott Herren : Yes. George, I will take that, Chuck, and then you can jump in. I don\u2019t think it is burning down backlog. We clearly are \u2013 the good news is we are able to ship more of the backlog. That\u2019s good news for our customers. They are waiting for these components. They have got projects that they are holding up that they need to get done. It\u2019s good news for our channel in a sense that the channel is sitting on, in some case, partial shipments. They need that last box, so they can go out and implement that and relieve some of the pressure on their own working capital. So, it\u2019s not \u2013 I am responding to the burning down backlog. This is good news, our ability to ship the backlog, and that\u2019s what you see reflected there in the guide down \u2013 or sorry, in the guide up that we have in the second half of the year. We have \u2013 what you see now is a significantly higher revenue projection for the second half of the year than we had before. And some of that clearly is our ability to ship backlog because of the great job our team has done to free up supply. Chuck Robbins : And I would say on the demand side, if I go back 90 days, I would say, in general, I think there was more risk, at least there felt like there was more risk. And when I talk to my customers, there is more uncertainty. And even when you hear \u2013 listen to the news and we talk \u2013 I talk to my colleagues, we were in Davos, it feels like the longer we go without seeing some major shift, then the better our customers are feeling. So obviously, we are not immune to anything, and we will have to continue to monitor it. But after traveling in Asia last week, our team being in Europe, I actually saw customers in New York while I was here this week, and customers are moving forward. George Notter : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much. Marilyn Mora : Thanks George. Next question. Operator : Thank you. David Vogt with UBS, you may go ahead. David Vogt : Great. Thank you, guys and I apologize if you covered it. My line cut out a little bit more. Scott, I am just trying to clarify the order versus the backlog comment. I think if I am not mistaken, your run rate backlog had been sort of roughly $5 billion as you exited fiscal year. So, are you suggesting to us that the backlog comes down by about $3.5 billion over the next several quarters? And if that\u2019s the case, if I just kind of back that out of your guidance, would that imply sort of that the business is effectively flat year-over-year ex the backlog drawdown as we exit \u201823 into \u201824? And then I have a quick follow-up. Scott Herren : Yes. So, let me try and walk through some of the moving parts there, David. It\u2019s a great question. What we said previously is we thought we would end the year with somewhere between 2x and 3x normal backlog. And normal backlog, as we said last quarter, is between $4 billion and $5 billion at the end of the year. What we now see is that it\u2019s still going to be roughly double what that same range. So, there is definitely our ability to ship some out of the backlog, which is again, great news for our customers and our partners. The one piece that\u2019s missing in your equation is, as we ship the backlog, remember, we said there is more than $2 billion of software in there. A lot of that software is ratable. So, as soon as we ship it, it doesn\u2019t all drop into the revenue stream. It ends up dropping into deferred revenue and being recognized over time. So, there is a \u2013 you have to consider not just the reduction in backlog, what\u2019s the uptick in the revenue guide, but also how much of this is going to contribute to growth in deferred revenue. That may be the piece that you are missing. David Vogt : Got it. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up, so as we enter, let\u2019s say, the next fiscal year, I mean given your excellent work on supply chain, and the team has done a phenomenal job, would that imply \u2013 I mean basically, we could be back at normalized backlog within a quarter, maybe two quarters at the worst-case scenario if trends hold consistent where we are today. Is that a reasonable expectation? Scott Herren : Rather than try to say it\u2019s a quarter or it\u2019s two quarters, I do expect it to normalize in fiscal \u201824. David Vogt : Great. Thanks guys. Marilyn Mora : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Tal Liani with Bank of America, you may go ahead sir. Tal Liani : Great. He stole my thunder with the previous question. That was exactly my question. So, I want to \u2013 I want to understand something just a clarification on what you just answered. So, at the minimum, the decline in the backlog was $600 million at the minimum because end of year is going to be $8 million to $10 million. Take 6% of that and the backlog is now higher, so that means that the minimum year backlog declined $600 million. And that means that product growth, we should take out some of the $600 million because some of it goes into deferred revenue. Am I correct with what you just answered? Scott Herren : Yes. Well, you are close. Let me run through it again, Tal, and if it\u2019s still not clear, we can catch in the follow-up. The 6% was the decline in backlog from Q1 to Q2, right. So, we were able to work off about 6% of the backlog that we came into the quarter with. What we have said is, at the time that we gave you that Q2 guide in the full year, the previous full year guide, we expected to end the year with somewhere between 2x and 3x our normal backlog. We are not saying it\u2019s going to be roughly double the normal backlog. Some of that, obviously, will ship out and will be a part of the significant guide up that we have given you in the second half revenue. Some of it, instead of turning into immediate revenue, will go into deferred revenue and be recognized ratably over time. Chuck Robbins : And show up in RPO. Scott Herren : I hope that\u2019s \u2013 yes, it will show up in deferred revenue and RPO. I hope that\u2019s clear, Tal, if not, we can follow-up. Tal Liani : Yes. Very clear. So, my question \u2013 I want to go back to the basics and understand, last quarter, we were all concerned about environment slowing down. We don\u2019t hear you saying environment continues to slow down. We didn\u2019t hear Arista saying it. We didn\u2019t hear you saying that service providers were weak. Can you take us through the big customer account and tell us what is the situation of spending with your enterprise customers, commercial customers, service provider customers? Did the environment further deteriorate from the previous quarter, or did it stabilize? And does it make you think that at least the trends so far, the year would continue to be normal on a sequential basis, or do you expect some more deterioration going forward? Chuck Robbins : Yes, Tal. So, we \u2013 on the enterprise and commercial space, we saw a double-digit sequential growth, which is in line with what we have seen historically. And as I have said, public sector was actually higher than historical ranges and Federal was \u2013 U.S. Federal was extremely strong during the quarter from a demand perspective. On the service provider side, I think you are seeing many of our competitors and peers, some of them anyway, don\u2019t give order data. And so I think for us, those customers are the ones who did the most planning for long-term ordering. So, as lead times begin to come down, we would expect them to change their ordering patterns and they have already got 6 months to 12 months\u2019 worth of consumption lined up in the backlog. So, we will see that normalize over the next few quarters. I will say in the web scale space, there are roughly 35 use cases or franchises within the largest players, and we have actually been designed into 18 of those at this point. And we are very confident that we will continue to get designed in. I got a note today that we had just got noticed about a new design win today. And so we are still very optimistic long-term, we just think it\u2019s a short-term normalization for our service provider space. Tal Liani : Got it. Layoffs and the economic slowdown, my question was whether these factors you see an impact on your business on orders or they stabilized from previous quarter? Chuck Robbins : Well, you mean layoffs in \u2013 like in our customers? Tal Liani : Yes, across the industry? Chuck Robbins : Yes. Well, if you think about what occurred, there was a lot of companies that had a massive surge in employment, and we didn\u2019t. But I think the thing that we are seeing right now is that we have seen the sequential growth be in line and some \u2013 like it was towards the lower end. So, it\u2019s not performing at the highest end, but I think that it\u2019s in range. And if you \u2013 and I also shared that in Q3, our current forecast is also in line sequentially with historical ranges, which we normally don\u2019t give. We just wanted you guys to have that visibility. So look, it\u2019s certainly an uncertain time, and I am not \u2013 I don\u2019t want to paint a picture that we are immune. And I don\u2019t want to paint a picture that every customer is spending everywhere on everything. But we have been able to maintain and continue to see our customers moving forward with projects. And the one thing that was really encouraging for me was to see January as strong as it was, given our \u2013 the uncertainty around \u201823 budgets. Tal Liani : Got it. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Tal. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Tim Long with Barclays, you may go ahead sir. Tim Long : Thank you. Just hoping I can get two in here. One, could you talk a little bit about, obviously, the enterprise campus is still very strong. But I think traditionally, that\u2019s kind of a GDP-ish type of business that has been running above that. And it sounds like your confidence for next year is pretty strong as well. So maybe, Chuck, any insights like what\u2019s kind of different there? Are we starting to decouple from like macro GDP for that campus networking fees? Any thoughts there would be great. And then second, obviously, a lot of excitement out there about AI, ChatGPT, all that stuff. Just curious what you think for your data center and cloud businesses, what kind of impact if there is kind of more of an arms race with big customers around AI, what that would mean for switching and routing business for you guys? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Thanks Tim. So first one, on enterprise campus, I do think that the pandemic was a great educator for our customers about the need to maintain modernized infrastructure because moving into the pandemic, I think it became quite obvious to many of our customers that they had not been updating, and they had \u2013 they were sweating assets a little longer. So, that\u2019s one thing that\u2019s shifted. The second is we are really seeing \u2013 these trends of multi-cloud, the trend of hybrid work and the overall re-architecture of their networks. If you really think about what \u2013 how we built networks for 20 years, we built it on a premise that we have branches and we have a private data center, and all the traffic flows are very understood. Now, I have to upgrade my entire infrastructure to deal with this brand-new world that I live in, supporting hybrid work, supporting hybrid cloud, etcetera. So, I think that\u2019s been driving a lot of this as well as safety in the office, IoT, creating new experiences to get our employees back to work, etcetera. So, that\u2019s what I think has been driving a lot of the enterprise campus stuff. As it relates to your second question around the AI play, I think that look, these AI networks that are being built, whether it\u2019s in web scale or whether we have some of our largest enterprise customers that are building AI networks and training AI algorithms, these are \u2013 like in the web scale space, they are like bigger than the core infrastructure networks that they are running, which was astonishing to me when I learned that. And the network performance required is 3x to 4x what they have historically needed. And so this is a massive opportunity for us and we are in active discussions with lots of customers around it. And so we do think that this shift is going to create a good opportunity for us in the future. Tim Long : Okay. Thank you very much. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Tim. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan, you may go ahead sir. Samik Chatterjee : Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the strong guide. Maybe if I could just quickly hit on two of the product areas mostly security, what sort of benefits are you seeing given your broad portfolio there in terms of customers looking to maybe some level of \u2013 consolidation just given your position as a more broader security portfolio supplier. And what sort of benefit does supply eases, maybe on the firewall side, should we expect revenue growth? And a similar question on Internet for the Future segment seems like a bit more supply constrained than other segments. But what sort of are you \u2013 what are you seeing on the supply side there? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Okay. I will take security and you can take the supply side. So, I think that \u2013 look, all of our customers definitely want to consolidate their security infrastructure. They have got 40, 50 different vendors, and trying to correlate these threats is very difficult and it\u2019s just \u2013 you can\u2019t add enough people. So, our teams right now are heads down working on some new capabilities that we are going to be bringing out over the next 12 months to 18 months, and some of that is focused on exactly that, how do we consolidate and how do we create the ability to correlate threats in real time much more effectively. And so we think that you are probably going to start seeing the benefit of that three quarters or four quarters out. So, the team has got work to do. We have hired a significant amount of outside talent. We have invested heavily in this space. So, while we may see \u2013 we may not see the growth that you want to see in the near-term, but you will see this begin to accelerate in FY \u201824. And I think that we will \u2013 we are playing a long game here and really believe that there is a lot of consolidation that we can drive over the next few years. Scott? Scott Herren : Yes. Internet for the Future, Samik, it is one of the spaces. We have worked so hard and done so much across our entire product portfolio. So, we have made great progress in many cases. I would say Internet for the Future is one of the spaces where we are still \u2013 we have improved lead times there, but we are still not back to more normal lead times in that space. What I would also say though, is we have already picked up orders just in the last several weeks from some of our peers that are also selling into that same space who couldn\u2019t meet demand. And those orders came to us instead. So, while \u2013 it\u2019s a space we continue to work on. And while we are seeing improvement, it\u2019s not where we want it to be, I feel like we are performing pretty well on the supply side and Internet for the Future. Samik Chatterjee : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Alright. That wraps up our Q&A. I am going to turn it over to Chuck for some closing remarks. Chuck Robbins : Well, first off, I just want to thank everybody for spending time with us today and also really thank our teams. They delivered on very strong results. I want to thank the supply chain and our engineering teams for quarter-after-quarter-after-quarter of hard work and redesigns, over 100 product redesigns, aggressive actions to get us to the position we are in today, the entire company for the progress we have made on our business transformation. And I will just leave you with our feeling that our demand has remained stable. The business transformation is contributing significantly, our backlog, all of those give us the visibility and confidence in the future. I think the relevance of our portfolio, given the most pressing needs of our customers, is as high as it\u2019s been in a very long time, and I am super proud of what our teams have accomplished. So, look forward to talking to you in the future and thanks for joining us today. Marilyn Mora : Thanks Chuck. Cisco\u2019s next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal 2023 third quarter results, will be on Wednesday, May 17, 2023 at 1 :30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to Cisco's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Marilyn Mora : Welcome everyone to Cisco's third quarter fiscal 2023 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations and I am joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheet, cash flow statements and other financial information can be found in the Financial Information section of the Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and we will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the fourth quarter and full-year of fiscal 2023. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically, the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that, I will now turn it over to Chuck. Chuck Robbins : Thank you, Marilyn, and hope you all are doing well. This was another strong quarter for us, and I am proud of what our teams have achieved. In Q3, we delivered our strongest ever revenue, non-GAAP income, non-GAAP EPS and operating cash flow. We also continued to successfully execute on our strategy, driving solid growth in ARR to nearly $24 billion and posting double-digit growth in subscription and software revenues. Based on our strong Q3 performance, we are once again raising our fiscal 2023 outlook for revenue and earnings per share, which Scott will cover shortly. As we look ahead to fiscal year 2024, we expect to see modest revenue growth, even with the tough compare of double-digit growth in fiscal year 2023. Now, before I go through our Q3 performance, I'd like to discuss three key areas that will help drive our long-term growth. First, we are pleased with continued success in our movement towards more subscriptions and recurring revenue. In Q3, we delivered 18% growth in software revenues. We also have $32 billion in remaining performance obligations, and we expect to see this momentum accelerate. Second, security continues to be an enormous opportunity for us. As you've heard me say, we've revamped our strategy, put a world-class team in place, and made this a top priority for the company. Over the coming quarters, you will see new innovations in this space, building on our strong Cisco Security Cloud strategy, including at Cisco Live next month. Based on the rapid progress we are making, we are optimistic about our opportunity in this fast-growing market. And third, generative AI and cloud. At Cisco, we already use predictive AI extensively across our portfolio. In addition, our core networking technology is already powering some of the leading AI models run by hyperscalers around the world. We have also moved rapidly to leverage generative AI capabilities in our own products, which you will hear more about in the next few weeks and beyond starting at Cisco Live. Now, let me discuss our quarterly performance. As I mentioned, in Q3, we delivered our highest ever quarterly revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share exceeding the high-end of our guidance range. We saw healthy margins and record non-GAAP net income, which reflect our strong operating discipline. All of this contributed to record operating cash flow in Q3. As we expected, the actions we took to mitigate supply constraints have continued to pay off. Price realization as a result of the actions we put in place last year helped offset inflationary pressures. Our disciplined cost management enabled us to continue to expand gross margins, as well as prioritize our strategic investments to drive long-term growth. As it relates to customer demand, it is being shaped by a few factors that we believe are impacting the entire industry. First, our increase in product shipments is often leading customers and partners to absorb these shipments prior to placing new orders; second, the significant reduction in product lead times reduces the need for extensive advanced ordering by our customers; and third, macroeconomic conditions. With this said, in our discussions with customers such as the ones we had at our most recent global Customer Advisory Board event earlier this month, they continue to invest in key technologies that are core to their overall strategies. As we previously shared, given the unprecedented demand for our technology during the pandemic, we believe sequential order rates are far more informative than year-over-year rates. Just like the prior two quarters, our sequentials in Q3 were in general alignment with historical ranges coming in 1 point below the historical range. In addition, our order cancellation rates also remain well below historical levels, indicating the strength of our backlog and portfolio. In terms of our backlog, we continue to expect that we will end the fiscal year with roughly double our normal product backlog. Now, let me share a bit more detail about some of our newest innovations. Regarding our webscale customers. They are currently consuming and implementing their prior significant technology investments. There remains a huge growth opportunity across all these customers enabled by our portfolio of hardware, software, silicon, and systems. We already see early design wins in AI infrastructure and continue to see other wins and competitive displacements leading to continued share gain in this space. In our networking business, we remain focused on building solutions that drive a higher return on investment and sustainability. In March, we introduced 800-gig capability to our Cisco 8000 platform with the industry's first 28.8 Terabit Line Card powered by Cisco's Silicon One ASICs and Pluggable Optics. This new platform can deliver up to 68% power savings and 83% space savings compared to 400-gig solutions, helping to reduce operational costs and carbon emissions as well as enabling the densification of networks to support use cases such as AI/ML and IoT. This continues to drive positive customer feedback and we are excited about this opportunity. To complement our own innovations, in Q3, we closed the acquisition of Valtix, which is aligned to our security cloud vision for providing protection across multi-cloud environments with a seamless experience. We also announced our intent to acquire two companies that further extend our capabilities in cloud, security and full-stack observability. Before I close, I also want to share once again how incredibly proud I am that for the third year in a row, we were ranked number one in the U.S. on Fortune magazine\u2019s 100 Best Companies to Work For and in 14 other countries around the world, we were also ranked as the number one Great Place to Work, reflecting Cisco's position as a premier destination for top talent worldwide. To summarize, our ability to navigate uncertainty was demonstrated by our record results. Our performance remains solid and reflects the strength of our strategy and the benefits from the investments we've made over the last several years. Our operational discipline and excellence in execution are driving record earnings, cash flow, and shareholder value. As we look towards Q4 and fiscal year 2024, I'd like to share a few observations. As I mentioned earlier, as of now, we see modest revenue growth in fiscal year 2024 on top of our strong performance in fiscal year 2023. You can also expect us to grow earnings per share at a higher rate than revenue in Q4 fiscal year 2023 and full-year fiscal year 2024 reflecting improving gross margins and strong expense management. Lastly, we expect to continue our stock buybacks at the higher levels you've seen over the last two quarters. I'd like to thank our teams for their focus and execution and our customers and partners for the trust they placed in us. As cloud, AI and security continue to scale, Cisco's long-established leadership in networking, and the breadth of our portfolio, give me the confidence in our ability to capture the many opportunities ahead. I'll now turn it over to Scott. Scott Herren : Thanks, Chuck. We delivered a record quarter that exceeded both our top and bottom line expectations driven by focused execution, continued business transformation, and the actions we've taken over the last several quarters to mitigate supply issues. We reported our strongest ever revenue, non-GAAP income, non-GAAP earnings per share and operating cash flow for the quarter. Total revenue was $14.6 billion, up 14% year-on-year. Non-GAAP net income was $4.1 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was a $1, up 15%. Looking at our Q3 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $11.1 billion, up 17%, and service revenue was $3.5 billion, up 3%. Within product revenue, Secure Agile Networks, our largest business was very strong, up 29%. Switching revenue had strong double-digit growth with strength in both campus and data center switching driven by our Catalyst 9000, Meraki and Nexus 9000 offerings. Enterprise routing growth was driven primarily by strength in our Catalyst 8000 Series routers, SD-WAN and IoT routing and wireless also had very strong double-digit growth with strength driven by our Wi-Fi 6 products and Meraki wireless offerings. Internet for the future was up 5% driven by growth in our core routing products, including very strong growth in our Cisco 8000 offering. We also saw double-digit growth in webscale. Collaboration was down 13%, driven by declines in collaboration devices and meetings, offset slightly by growth in calling and contact center. End-to-End security was up 2% driven by our unified threat management and zero trust offerings. An optimized application experiences was up 12%, driven by growth across the portfolio, including double-digit growth in ThousandEyes. We continue to make progress on our transformation metrics as we shift our business to more recurring revenue-based offerings, driven by higher levels of software and subscriptions. We saw solid performance of our ARR of $23.8 billion, which increased 6% with product ARR growth of 10%. Total software revenue was $4.3 billion, an increase of 18% with software subscription revenue up 17%. 82% of software revenues were subscription-based. We continue to have an elevated level of software orders in our product backlog. Total subscription revenue was $6.1 billion, an increase of 11%. RPO was $32.1 billion, up 6% with product RPO increasing 9% and service RPO increasing 4% and total short-term RPO grew to $16.9 billion. Total product orders were down 23%, driven by the three factors Chuck pointed out earlier. The aging of our backlog has improved significantly and we continue to have very low cancellation rates, reflecting the quality of our past orders and critical nature of our product portfolio. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 65.2% exceeding the high-end of our guidance range and down 10 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 64.5%, up 240 basis points sequentially and up 40 basis points year-over-year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by positive pricing and favorable product mix. This is partially offset by higher component and other costs. Services gross margin was 67.3%, down 160 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was at the high-end of our guidance range at 33.9%, down 80 basis points year-over-year and up 140 basis points sequentially. Backlog for both our hardware and software products continues to significantly exceed historical levels. Due to an improving supply situation and our focused execution, we were able to accelerate shipments of our aged backlog to meet customer needs, which resulted in a decline in backlog level sequentially and year-over-year. We continue to expect to exit the year with roughly double our normal product backlog. And just a reminder, backlog is not included as part of our $32 billion in remaining performance obligations. Combined our significant product backlog and RPO continued to provide great visibility to our topline as we approach fiscal year 2024. Shifting to the balance sheet. We ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $23.3 billion. We had record operating cash flow for the quarter of $5.2 billion, up 43% year-over-year, driven primarily by strong collections and the deferral of our Q3 federal tax payment due to the IRS tax relief related to the California floods earlier this year. The federal tax payment deferral had a positive impact of approximately 20 points of growth year-over-year on Q3 operating cash flow. This recent IRS relief postponed our remaining current year federal income tax payment deadlines until Q1 of our fiscal 2024. In line with our disciplined capital allocation strategy and commitment to return capital, we returned $2.9 billion to shareholders during the quarter, which was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.3 billion of share repurchases. We ended the quarter with $12.2 billion in remaining stock purchase authorization. Year-to-date, we've returned a total of $7.7 billion via cash dividends and share purchases. This reinforces our confidence and the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. We continue to invest organically and inorganically on our innovation pipeline. During Q3, we announced and closed the acquisition of Valtix, which further strengthens our security portfolio. This investment is consistent with our strategy of complementing our internal innovation and R&D with targeted strategic M&A. To summarize, we had a strong quarter delivering record topline growth, non-GAAP profitability and cash flow. We continue to make progress on our business model shift to more recurring revenue while making strategic investments and innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities. Turning now to our guidance. For fiscal Q4, our guidance is : we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 14% to 16%. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 64.5% to 65.5%, and our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 34% to 35%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from a $1.05 to $1.07. As Chuck mentioned, we are yet again raising our fiscal year guidance for fiscal 2023, which is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 10% to 10.5% year-on-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $3.80 to $3.82. In both our Q4 and full-year guidance, we are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. Our guidance ranges reflect significant visibility driven by healthy backlog, ARR, RPO, and improving availability of supply. As Chuck mentioned earlier, as of now, we see modest revenue growth in fiscal 2024 on top of our strong performance in fiscal 2023. You can also expect us to deliver earnings per share at a higher growth rate than revenue in Q4 and in fiscal 2024, reflecting improving gross margins and strong expense management. And lastly, we expect to continue our stock buybacks at the higher level you've seen over the last two quarters. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn, so we can move into the Q&A. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Scott. Michelle, let's go ahead and tee up the queue for questions. Operator : Thank you. Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead, sir. Samik Chatterjee : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe if I can start with a clarification on the orders. I think, Chuck, I heard you say orders were sequentially 1 point below seasonality. But if you can clarify whether on a quarter-over-quarter basis, they were up or down, and I'm not sure if you gave a year-over-year. But maybe more broadly, as you think about your guide for next year as well, what are you assuming for orders in that? And I have a follow-up. Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Samik. As I said in the opening comments, there are three factors really that are affecting demand, first of all. As we ship more of our backlog, our customers are digesting what they've ordered. Secondly, as our lead times come down, which our lead times have come down 40% over the last two quarters on a weighted basis, so it really eliminates the need for customers to order significantly in advance as they had been and then obviously, the macro conditions. When I talk about sequentials, as I've said, the year-over-years are just so hard to figure out that we've said the real thing we're looking for relative to whether we're seeing a momentum shift in the business is, are the sequentials in line. And as I've said the last couple of quarters and this quarter as well, the sequentials were operating at or slightly below the low-end of our historical ranges. So I wouldn't say it's robust, but it's still within the range or slightly below. And as we look at Q4, we actually expect our sequentials to be in line with what we've seen historically. So our view based on what we see today is that we can still deliver positive growth in fiscal year 2024, even on top of the good growth year we had this year. I'll make one other point. If you go back to September 2021 when we had our analyst conference, we actually laid out long-term top line growth of 5% to 7%, long-term EPS growth of 5% to 7%. If you move to the end of fiscal 2024 based on what we see today, we will be in that range from a CAGR perspective on a revenue perspective, and we'll be above that range from an EPS perspective during that same time period. Samik Chatterjee : Okay. Got it. And for my follow-up, I think I wanted to sort of touch on that expense control that you talked about and EPS growing faster than revenue. Is that sort of a change of thinking from the Analyst Day in terms of \u2013 I think at the Analyst Day, you were talking about sort of limited operating leverage and growing earnings more in line with revenue. It seems to be that outside of the gross margin, you're thinking about being a bit more disciplined and pulling back on expenses, but maybe confirm if that's sort of how you \u2013 if you are integrating that right. Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Yes. Samik, if you look at the last two years, we've actually grown EPS faster than revenue. And as we look to Q4 and then beyond, it's pretty clear that with the gross margin expansion and with our expense management that we are implementing, we can still fund the investment areas that we need to fund as well as actually deliver higher EPS growth rates than revenue, which is what a lot of our investors have been asking for. And so we believe that's quite feasible for us to do now. Scott, do you have any comments on that? Scott Herren : No. I think you touched on the key points. We will continue to invest in growth. But we also \u2013 as you've seen in the last two years, you've seen us do this, grow the bottom line faster than the top line in fiscal 2022 and at the midpoint of our guide for fiscal 2023. And as we look ahead, it's a time to be prudent, and so we see that happening again in fiscal 2024. Samik Chatterjee : Yes. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may go ahead, sir. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. At the beginning of May, Cisco announced a Capital Business Acceleration Program as a part of Cisco Capital. This is a topic we haven't talked about much on recent calls. I'd just like a little bit better understanding as to what's the strategy, thought process and rationale for implementing that program? Thank you. Scott Herren : Yes. Simon, thanks for the question. That's something that you've seen us do in the past. It's more a reflection of interest rates jumping up to 5%. Our customers needing to get their hands on technology to continue to advance their own strategies and us just putting our balance sheet to work a bit. It's not more complicated than that. Simon Leopold : And no real effect on your financial model, I assume then? Scott Herren : No. Not in terms of profitability or in terms of the long-term impact that's going to have. Simon Leopold : Great. Thank you very much. Chuck Robbins : Thanks. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Simon. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. David Vogt with UBS. You may go ahead, sir. David Vogt : Great. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. Maybe just more qualitative and maybe as a follow-up to Simon's question. Can you kind of give a little bit more color on what you saw, let's say, in March into April and what you're seeing today from a macro perspective? Because it certainly sounds like from our conversations with partners and other industry folks that March was a bit softer than people had anticipated, and it didn't improve in April. Just love to get your perspective there. And then I'll give you my follow-up real quick. So if I kind of take your comment about the three-year plan, it certainly would imply kind of revenue growth next year in kind of the 2%, 3% range and EPS in the 5% range. Is that kind of what you're trying to communicate from a back-of-the-envelope perspective next year given the macro headwinds? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : I'm sorry, David, could you repeat that second part, the numbers you had there? I didn't catch them. David Vogt : Yes. If I just kind of take the back of the envelope math on your 5% to 7% three-year target, that would imply revenue growth next year in the 2% to 3% range and EPS maybe 5% to 6% range. Is that kind of what you're trying to message here? Just so we have a sense for how you're thinking about the macro. Thanks. Chuck Robbins : All right, David. Thanks for the questions. So let me talk about the linearity that we saw in the quarter. It actually was very favorable from our perspective on the orders. While we clearly see that we're operating at the low-end of historical ranges on a sequential basis, we did not see it deteriorate from the beginning of the quarter to the end. In fact, it was \u2013 our linearity was slightly better than it normally is. And April was actually sort of in line with what we've seen, maybe even a titch better than the first two months. So we did not see that particular outcome. And again, what we're looking for is a change in underlying momentum. I'm not suggesting there's strong momentum. I'm just saying we're looking for a change. And the best way to do that is to really understand, do the sequentials continue to play out the way they're supposed to? And as of now, we see they are playing out very consistently and sort of the low-end of the range or slightly below. And then, Scott, do you want to take the FY 2024 number? Scott Herren : Yes, sure. Just on the math you're trying to do, David, I think you're in the right ballpark. What I'd say, obviously, I don't want to get into being too precise on fiscal 2024 yet since it's only our Q3 call. But bear in mind, that's growth on fiscal 2024 on top of at the midpoint of our guide for fiscal 2023, 10.2% growth in fiscal 2023. The last time we had double-digit revenue growth for a full-year was back in 2012 in the bounce back of the \u2013 from the global financial crisis. So it's a very strong year this year, and we see a modest level of growth on top of that. David Vogt : Great. Helpful guys. Thanks a lot. Chuck Robbins : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Great. Thanks, David. Next question. Operator : Thank you. George Notter with Jefferies. You may go ahead, sir. George Notter : Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I guess I wanted to ask about the growth expectation for this year. I'm curious about your view. How much of that growth comes from price? How much comes from backlog consumption? What are the bigger factors driving that growth this year? Thanks. Scott Herren : Yes. I guess where I'd start is the biggest factor driving the growth for this year is the huge amount of demand we've had from our customers that's been sitting in backlog as we've worked our way through some of the supply issues. If you ask what's driving the growth, it's that, it's end-user demand. When you start to peel back to the mechanics of how that got put together, a lot of it is our ability to \u2013 based on a lot of hard work actually from both the engineering team and the supply chain team to free up some of the component supply issues that we've had that's allowed us to work through some of the backlog. We're not finished. There's still supply constraints. We think we end the year. Just like we said last quarter, we end the year with still with roughly double what our normal backlog would be, but we've made great strides on that front. Price has been a positive for us. As we said earlier, there's a \u2013 as we work our way through the backlog, more of the orders that we received prior to those price actions that we took last year have been delivered now. And so we are seeing \u2013 you'll see this when we publish our Q, about one point of benefit from price. George Notter : Okay. Thank you very much. Marilyn Mora : Let's go ahead and move to the next question, Michelle. Operator : Thank you. Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. I was wondering if you could just kind of speak to the trends you're seeing within enterprise commercial service provider. You noted kind of seeing some digestion on the webscale, but just wanted to kind of get a sense if there's any different trends that you're seeing within those customer types. And then maybe just as a follow-up question. Obviously, your customers have been going through cloud optimization efforts and kind of looking towards long-term architectures. Is there any changes kind of you distinguish from customers just on the outcomes or ways in which Cisco can kind of better help customers on that journey? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Yes. Thanks, Meta. So the trends by segment, I think if you think about the three factors that I described, one is customers needing to digest the shipments that we're shipping out. And secondly, as our lead times come down significantly, they don't need to order as far in advance. And if you think about who the customers are that have the most visibility and have done most of the advanced ordering, it's going to be large enterprises and service providers and webscale providers. And so from a segment perspective, I think the predominant issue we're seeing in the service provider space, which, by the way, contributed to 41% of the overall year-over-year decline, came from the SP space, which is less than 20% of our total revenue. So it had an outsized impact on our overall year-over-year decline. I would say in the enterprise, there's large enterprises that are dealing with the same issues and are facing \u2013 and are doing the same thing. They're digesting the equipment, and they're not needing to order as far ahead. We're also seeing the same things that you've heard from others. We're seeing elongated sales cycles. We're seeing more signatures required. But in general, we're getting the signatures, but they are taking a little longer. And then as it relates to the technology trends and what our customers are focused on, the good news for us is that if you think about every customer on the planet is basically has five key priorities that we actually align to. One is they're re-architecting for this multi-cloud world. They're trying to figure out hybrid work. They're rebuilding their entire application strategy and re-architecting their applications. They're rebuilding their cyber footprint because of all this distributed nature of what they're doing now, and they're focused on sustainability. And our technology plays across all of those very important areas, and we're working very hard with all of our customers in all of those spaces. And then the final one, I think, that's on everybody's mind is artificial intelligence or generative AI. And I would say in the webscale space, over the next five years, the market opportunity \u2013 well, the entire market opportunity for AI infrastructure is estimated to be at $8.5 billion by 2027, growing at about 40% CAGR from where it was. As I said in my opening comments, we're already installed as a networking infrastructure for some of these early AI models that the webscalers are running. If you think about where we were at the beginning of the webscale build-out a decade ago, I said many times on these calls that we were not prepared, and we got left out. And I would say this time for this AI infrastructure from a networking perspective, I believe we are better positioned than anybody else, and our teams have done a great job getting us into this position, and we see that as a massive opportunity. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks so much. Marilyn Mora : Great. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead, sir. Sami Badri : All right. Thank you. My question is on any kind of dynamics with the hyperscalers or cloud providers that led to any kind of product pushouts or delays of shipments or any kind of receipts that took longer the delivery. Anything that was shifted? Do you guys see any kind of shifting of deliveries or request to ship deliveries in the quarter? Chuck Robbins : No, we did not see any of that. In fact, we've been fulfilling all the request. There are certain projects that our teams have been working on that they have delayed, but those are around new orders, not around what's in the backlog. I think a lot of that is because there's so much focus now on building out the AI infrastructure for each of them, and so that's really what we see happening, and it's an area that we've had lots of design wins. We continue to get design wins, and it's an area where we believe that we'll continue to gain market share. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you. And then one follow-up on gross margins. You talked about the modest growth in 2024, and you also talked about EPS outpacing that. But maybe we could get an idea on gross margin trajectory. Should \u2013 is there something we should be thinking as far as a glide path or an expansion range? Scott Herren : Yes, Sami, you see the midpoint of the guide we gave on gross margin for Q4. We've seen significant progress on gross margin through the year. I mean the product gross margin grew 240 basis points sequentially. That said, I think we're about to the point where we're lapping some of the benefits of the price increases. So there may be a little more room in gross margin sequentially. But if you look at the average for the year next year, of course, if you remember the first quarter of this year, we had a pretty significant impact in gross margin. So the average for the full-year will definitely go up, right, as we say, if we keep it this same glide path through fiscal 2024. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : All right. Thanks, Sami. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead, sir. Matthew Niknam : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. First, just a follow-up on the fiscal 2024. The modest growth, what sort of macro assumptions are you embedding into that preliminary outlook? And then just secondly, if I could just double click on security. If you can maybe talk about what's driving some of the softness or decelerating growth. I believe it was about 2% growth this past quarter and what you're anticipating in terms of maybe additional backlog release and whether that can maybe help some of those trends looking forward? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : You want to take the first? Scott Herren : Yes. If we start on fiscal 2024. I think there's a few things, Matt, to keep in mind before we start talking about macro. We're rolling into the year with a backlog that's roughly double what would be normal. And that's really just a function of kind of the continuing supply constraints that are definitely improving, and that's why you see some of the strength that we've shown in this quarter and in our guide for next quarter, but they're not done. I do see those normalizing sometime midyear. By the second half of the year, we should be through most of the backlog. The second is the absorption factor. We think that with the lead times normalizing and working through the backlog, the absorption factor also probably gets itself work through to next year by around midyear of next year. So \u2013 but when you roll into the year with $32 billion of RPO, which is where we are today, $17 billion of that being current with almost $24 billion of ARR, which drives a huge renewal opportunity for us next year and with backlog, it takes a lot of pressure off of what needs to happen from a macro standpoint. Chuck Robbins : And then I'd say on the security front, I think I've been \u2013 we've talked about this on several calls, and we've hired new leadership team. The team is doing a phenomenal job. We had a big announcement recently at RSA where we launched an XDR platform that actually is one of the first that actually ingests data from our competitors and our partners across the industry. And at Cisco Live in a couple of weeks, we're going to make the next wave of announcements around some new innovation. And so I think we've acknowledged that we needed to get this \u2013 these new technologies out, and I think that they're coming out with unique differentiation to Cisco. And I think that's over the next \u2013 when you look out sort of the second half of next fiscal year, I think you'll see security really be accelerating into a growth driver for us. Matthew Niknam : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : All right. Thank you. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Michael Ng, you may go ahead from Goldman Sachs. Michael Ng : Hey, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I just have two. First, could you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about inventory levels on the balance sheet going forward? And if you have any information you could share with us around purchase commitments as well? And then I have a quick follow-up. Scott Herren : Sure, Michael. If you look at \u2013 you really have to look at the sum of those two collectively because purchase commitments are there, they're firm commitments that we've made to take on inventory. So the line between what's in purchase commitments and what's actually on our balance sheet is pretty great. When you add those two together and look back over the last three quarters, we've worked down about $3 billion worth of the combination of inventory on hand and the purchase commitment. So I think the team has done a really nice job balancing, ensuring we have supply to continue to work our way through the backlog, and at the same time, minimizing the risk that we have too much inventory. Michael Ng : Great. Excellent. Thanks for that. And then second, it was encouraging to hear about the expectation to return to a normal seasonality in sequential orders starting next quarter. I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more texture around those expectations. Is the absorption of early product shipments that may have impacted the sequentials this quarter going to be largely done by next? Is it just the easier comps? Any thoughts there would be helpful? Thank you very much. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Michael. Well, when I said that Q4, we see normal sequentials from Q3, that just means they're in the range of the historical ranges that we've seen from high to low. So it's not like an anomaly. It's not going to be significantly higher or significantly lower based on what we see today. We think that the digestion issue and the lead time stuff, we're estimating right now that most of that stuff gets washed out by the middle of next fiscal year. So we think to really get back to where you see normalized sort of ordering patterns and normalized backlog, we think that's probably going to be the second half of fiscal 2024. Michael Ng : Thank you very much for the thoughts. Marilyn Mora : All right. Thanks, Michael. I believe we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Amit Daryanani from Evercore. You may go ahead, sir. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. I\u2019m glad I sneaked in here. I guess I have two as well. Maybe first on the hyperscale side. Chuck, you talked about seeing gains on the AI infrastructure side. Can you sort of touch on where are you seeing these wins? Is it sort of data center switching or Silicon One or something else? And then are these sort of net new applications getting deployed are these displacements? Just any color there would be helpful. Chuck Robbins : Yes. So on a specific hyperscaler situation, we've been winning and displacing or becoming a second vendor in existing architectures for the last couple of years. And then we're winning new franchises around. These AI networks, in many cases, are brand new, and we're actually winning some of them as well. And so as you think about AI, I think it's important to understand the underlying technology. And just quickly, today, what's largely used is something called InfiniBand. And we see that our \u2013 the webscalers are \u2013 they have a desire to move to Ethernet and then further to this new technology that we actually have out called Scheduled Fabric. And we support both Ethernet and Scheduled Fabric, and we think we're leading in this space. And it actually increases the \u2013 I'd say, makes these networks run more effectively and more efficiently. And so those are some of the reasons we're winning. But it's just \u2013 it's a very big opportunity over the next five, six, seven years. Amit Daryanani : Got it. And then if I could just maybe go back to this order discussion. I think everyone seems to be surprised on orders being down 22% despite the compares getting easier, and I get your sequential commentary fairly well. But perhaps you can just talk about \u2013 you compared that you get really easy for the next few quarters. So do you feel like the down 22% is the trough and the declines may still be there but they sort of ease up until you get to the back half? Or how do you think about the order trajectory over the next few quarters and maybe the magnitude of it? Chuck Robbins : Yes, it's interesting. Back four, five, six quarters ago, I said we see this huge bookings and revenues running at a much lower level. And I said there will be an inflection point, where revenue will run much higher than bookings. But it's \u2013 so it's playing out exactly as we expected. Now there is the added dynamic of sort of the macro uncertainty that people are certainly concerned about. What we're looking for is to see, again, if there is a significant shift in momentum from one quarter to the next, which is one of the sequential thing we watch. We watched it for 20 years, and it really helps us see what's going on. And I think we're just going to have to \u2013 what we're telling you right now is based on what we see today. And when we look out at FY2024 and the commentary we made about showing positive growth on a high growth year that we're having this year, it's based on, as Scott said, on backlog, on RPO, and it's based on the visibility that our sales teams have right now and what their expectations are for orders over the next 12 months. Scott Herren : Yes. Just to add a little bit of that, Amit, a little bit more to that. When you add up between what will be current RPO that will turn into revenue during fiscal 2024, plus the backlog normalizing, which will be a tailwind, plus the renewal opportunity of what's not in RPO today, but sitting in ARR today, round number is somewhere between 40% and 50% of that revenue for next year is contained in those three lines, right? It's either orders that are in-house and sitting in RPO or sitting in backlog or renewal opportunities that we have a chance to go out and renew this year. So when I said it takes a lot of pressure off of macro, it's a strong position to be in, rolling into next year with that much of it either already in-house or sitting as renewal opportunities for us. Chuck Robbins : That's a really good data point, Scott. And I think if you go back eight or 10 years ago, in any given quarter, we would have to take orders for as much as 75% of our revenue in the quarter. And that's certainly not the case today, so that actually helps us as we try to model these \u2013 model out FY2024. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Super helpful. Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : All right. Great. And Chuck, I'll turn it over to you. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Marilyn. In closing, I want to thank everybody for spending time with us today, first of all. I'm super proud of our results. I think our teams are executing very well. I'm proud of the record results that we had this quarter. I'm also really proud that we're seeing what we also said, which is the market share gains come through that we had talked about. We've been asked on several calls about market share. And in the reports that we expect to be coming out very soon, we have meaningful share gains that, I think, you'll see in campus switching, SD branch routing, wireless LAN, SP routing, some of our absolute biggest markets, which reflect the relevance of our technology to our customers right now. I'm really proud that looking at FY2024. We still see growth on a strong double-digit growth year and also growing earnings per share faster than we are revenue. And our teams are committed to delivering on our commitments, and we look forward to spending time with you 90 days from now. So thanks for being with us. Marilyn Mora : All right. Thanks, Chuck. And to close this out, Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal year 2023 fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 results will be on Wednesday, August 16, 2023 at 1 :30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. This concludes today's call. If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to the Cisco Investor Relations department, and we thank you very much for joining the call.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I would like to turn the call over to Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Marilyn Mora : Welcome everyone to Cisco's fourth quarter fiscal 2023 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations and I am joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheet, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and we will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be done on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the first quarter and full-year of fiscal 2024. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically, the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that, I will now turn it over to Chuck. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal '23 was a milestone year for Cisco. We delivered on our operational and financial goals while accelerating our transformation. We achieved record revenue and earnings per share in both the fourth quarter and the full year. We also generated strong margins, record operating cash flow and strong shareholder value, returning 10.6 billion via share repurchases and increasing cash dividends. In FY '23, we delivered nearly 57 billion in revenue, up 11% year-over-year, the highest revenue growth rate in over a decade. Overall, customer demand also remained solid. In Q4, we achieved over 30% total sequential product order growth. The second highest in 20 years with double-digit increases across all customer markets. As we look to build on this strong performance going forward, we remain focused on the following. First, growing market share in all key areas of our business. Second, driving innovation and extending our leadership by investing in significant new opportunities for growth in AI, cloud and security. Third, delivering long-term sustainable value creation for our stakeholders and fourth, transforming our business model by growing recurring revenue. Consistent with what we said last quarter, we expect to build on our record results delivering modest revenue growth in fiscal year '24, with the bottom line growing faster than the top line demonstrating operating leverage. Our outlook reflects good visibility and predictability, driven by healthy backlog, ARR and RPO. We remain deeply committed to building shareholder value and increasing returns to our investors. We will do this through a long-term commitment to greater operating leverage while increasing our annual share repurchases and growing our dividend. Now, let me share additional detail on the quarter and key growth opportunities ahead for Cisco. First, one of our greatest competitive advantages is our pace of innovation. This quarter, we announced new solutions spanning generative AI, hybrid work, security, full stack observability and sustainability. In addition, we remain focused on delivering a more unified and simpler experience for our customers. As I've stated in the past, we knew that as our backlog cleared, we would see corresponding market share gains. With the release of the calendar Q1 results, we gained over three percentage points of market share year-over-year in our three largest networking markets. Campus switching, wireless LAN and SP routing. We expect further share gains in these areas as market share numbers are released for calendar Q2. Second, the acceleration of AI will fundamentally change our world and create new growth drivers for us. While AI has been an important element in our products for several years, this quarter we announced new market leading AI technologies across our collaboration and security portfolios designed to boost productivity, enhance policy management and simplify tasks. We also launched new AI scale infrastructure innovation to allow our customers to process AI workloads more efficiently. Cisco's ASIC design and scalable fabric for AI position us very well to build out the infrastructure that Hyperscalers and others need to build AI/ML clusters. This is a huge opportunity for Cisco and we are laser focused on leading and winning in this space. As a result of our innovation in this area, we expect Ethernet will lead in connecting AI workloads over the next five years. To accelerate this transition, Cisco became a founding member of the Ultra Ethernet Consortium, an industry wide effort to drive open large scale Ethernet based fabrics for high performance networking. In June, we launched our next generation Silicon One switching ASICs to support large scale GPU clusters for AI and ML workloads. We are seeing early success in Hyperscale Ethernet AI fabric deployments. To-date, we have taken orders for over $0.5 billion for AI Ethernet fabrics. We are also piloting 800 gig capabilities for AI training fabrics. Overall, Cisco is committed to helping our customers navigate this transition in a trusted and responsible way to deliver on the full promise of this technology and we are well positioned to win. Next, security remains a top priority. Our AI driven security cloud platform has comprehensive capabilities across the network endpoint and the cloud, helping to simplify security management while increasing efficacy. Our new technologies like XDR, multi-cloud defense and cloud secure access, a secure service edge solution are seeing rapid early adoption. For example, Goldman Sachs has been one of our early adopters of our multi-cloud defense solution. In addition, we are working with Apple to incorporate Cisco's secure access solution into iOS and macOS. These innovations, combined with our recent acquisitions, show how we are extending our security portfolio with deep telemetry AI and identity threat capabilities. Given our installed base of 300,000 Cisco security customers, we believe we have the opportunity to accelerate revenue growth in security over the next few quarters. To summarize, we had a phenomenal year. Our fiscal year '23 and Q4 results demonstrate the strength of our business today and are a solid foundation for future growth. I also want to be very clear on our commitment to increasing shareholder returns through capital return, innovation and strong execution. Last quarter, we committed to operating leverage in Q4 and fiscal year '24 and our guidance today reflects this. Today, I want to confirm that this will be our long-term strategy beyond fiscal year '24. We will also drive a high degree of consistency into our stock repurchase program and will maintain the quarterly levels in the range that we have over the past few quarters. Finally, I want to take a moment to thank our teams who all played an important role in delivering these record full year results and their deep commitment to our -- to the success of our customers and partners. With our focus on innovation and our commitment to operational excellence, I have tremendous confidence in our ability to capitalize on the many opportunities ahead. I'll now turn it over to Scott. Scott Herren : Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter then cover the full fiscal year followed by our guidance. As Chuck said, we delivered another record quarter driven by focused execution, continued business transformation and the actions we took during the year to mitigate supply issues. We reported our strongest ever revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, earnings per share and operating cash flow in Q4. Total revenue was $15.2 billion, up 16% year-on-year at the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP net income was $4.7 billion, up 36%. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.14, up 37%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Looking at our Q4 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was 11.7 billion, up 20%. Service revenue was 3.6 billion, up 4%. Within product revenue, Secure Agile Networks, our largest product category was very strong, up 33%. Switching revenue had double-digit growth with strength in both campus and data center switching driven by our Catalyst 9000 Nexus 9000 and Meraki offerings. Enterprise routing declined, driven primarily by Access, partially offset by strength in our Catalyst 8000 Series SD-WAN and IoT Routing. Wireless had double-digit growth driven by our Wi-Fi 6 products and Meraki wireless offerings. Internet for the Future was up 3%, driven by growth in our core routing products, including strong growth in our Cisco 8000 offering. We also saw double-digit growth in web scale. Collaboration was down 12%, driven by declines in collaboration devices and meetings partially offset by growth in cloud calling and cloud contact center. End-to-End security was flat with growth in our Zero Trust offerings offset by a decline in our network security offerings and optimized application experiences was up 15%, driven by growth across the portfolio, including double-digit growth in ThousandEyes and AppDynamics. We continue to make progress on the transformation of our business to more recurring revenue based offerings driven by higher levels of software and subscriptions. We saw solid performance in our ARR of 24.3 billion, which increased 5% with product ARR growth of 10%. Total software revenue accelerated to $4.6 billion, an increase of 17% with software subscription revenue up 20%. 85% of our software revenue was subscription based. Total subscription revenue was 6.6 billion, an increase of 13%. And RPO was 34.9 billion, up double-digits at 11%. Both product and service RPO had strong growth with product RPO up 12% and service RPO up 9%. Total short-term RPO grew to 17.9 billion. Total product orders were down 14% year-on-year, but grew sequentially by more than 30%. This was against a strong performance in the year ago quarter, where we delivered the second highest orders in absolute dollars in the history of the company. The aging of our backlog has continued to improve as the supply situation normalizes and as expected, increased customer deliveries reduced our year-end backlog to roughly double historical levels as we enter fiscal '24. Order cancellation rates remain below pre-pandemic levels, which reflects the true demand and criticality of our technologies to our customers. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 65.9%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range and up 260 basis points. Product gross margin was 65.5%, up 420 basis points. The increase was primarily driven by positive pricing and product mix, as we realized the benefits from the actions we took in the prior fiscal year. We also drove productivity improvements with lower freight and logistics component and other costs. Services gross margin was. 67.5%, down 150 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 35.4%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range and up 300 basis points. This improved leverage was driven by both our strong non-GAAP gross margin and ongoing cost management. Shifting to the balance sheet. We ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of 26.1 billion. We had record operating cash flow for the quarter of 6 billion, up 62%, driven primarily by strong top line performance and the deferral of our Q4 federal tax payment. Consistent with our prior commentary, the IRS tax relief related to the California floods postponed our current year federal income tax payment until Q1 of our fiscal '24. Consequently, in Q1 of fiscal '24, our federal income tax related cash outflows will include an incremental 2.8 billion of payments for these prior quarters. This quarter, we returned 2.8 billion to shareholders comprised of 1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and 1.3 billion of share repurchases. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy that we outlined last quarter, we are committed to increasing shareholder returns through a greater operating leverage while increasing our annual share repurchases and growing our dividend. Turning to the full fiscal year, we delivered record results in revenue, net income earnings per share and operating cash flow. Revenue for the year was 57 billion up 11% and non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.89, up 16%, demonstrating again the operating leverage that we've been driving. In terms of our software metrics, total software revenue for the full year was up 12% at 17 billion, with the product portion up 14%. 84% of software revenue was subscription based, which is up two percentage points. Total subscription revenue was 24.6 billion, an increase of 10%. Total non-GAAP gross margin was 64.5%, down ten basis points. On the bottom line, non-GAAP net income was 16 billion, up 13%. We delivered record operating cash flow of 19.9 billion, up 50% compared to fiscal '22, driven primarily by strong results, linearity, collections and the federal tax deferral as noted previously. We returned 10.6 billion in value to our shareholders via cash dividends and stock repurchases. This is comprised of 6.3 billion in quarterly cash dividends and 4.3 billion of share repurchases. We increased our dividend for the 12th consecutive year in fiscal 2023, reinforcing our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline during Q4. We closed the acquisitions of Lightspin Technologies, Smartlook and Armorblox. These investments are consistent with our strategy of complementing our internal innovation and R&D with targeted strategic M&A. To summarize, we had a very strong quarter and fiscal year with record results. We executed well delivering double-digit top line growth, profitability and cash flow. We continue to make progress on our business model shift to more recurring revenue while making strategic investments in innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities. Turning now to our guidance. For fiscal Q1, our guidance is, we expect revenue to be in the range of 14.5 billion to 14.7 billion. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 65% to 66%. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 34% to 35% and non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $1.02 to $1.04. For fiscal year '24, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of 57 billion to 58.2 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $4.01 to $4.08. In both our Q1 and full year guidance we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Scott. Michelle, let's go ahead and queue up for questions. Operator : Thank you. Tim Long with Barclays. You may go ahead. Tim? Tim Long : Hi. Thank you. Yeah, Chuck, maybe we'll start with kind of the order backlog performance. Sounds a lot better than seasonal in Q4. Could you talk a little bit about what you attribute that to and then maybe looking into next year, doesn't look like you're baking a lot of that into either Q1 or the full year. So what's kind of the expectation for kind of the pull through of those orders into what you're going to see in revenues in fiscal '24? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Tim. So I'll provide some color, and Scott, maybe you can talk about the conversion of the orders. Look, first of all, we're obviously dealing in a world that has a lot of dynamics right now, but our teams executed incredibly well. As I've said on prior calls, with our sales organization, when you see transitions in sort of customer buying, if it's getting worse, what we see is that our teams will forecast a quarter and then by the end of the quarter, they would have dropped and/or missed. And then when it's beginning to stabilize and get better, they tend to actually exceed the forecast. And so what we saw in Q4 was they had their opening forecast. They nailed month one, they nailed month two, and they exceeded month three by several hundred million dollars. So it was one of those quarters that they actually over-performed what they thought they would do at the beginning of the quarter, which is a positive sign. But again, it's one quarter. We also had the largest quarter in our history of enterprise software agreements from an orders perspective. So we had a lot of big customers making big commitments, which was a positive thing. If you think about what was going on around the world, I'd say service provider just continued to be weak. Enterprise improved, commercial improved. US enterprise was basically flat. So that was better than we had been experiencing for sure, which is a good sign. Public sector remains steady. And verticals, we saw strength in financial services, transportation and energy. And we saw some good strength in countries like India and Saudi around the world. So it's one quarter, but if you compare it to the prior few quarters where the teams had opening forecast that they generally missed by the time we got to the end of the quarter, this was one where I'd say that it was much more stable as we went through the quarter. Scott, do you want to talk about the order conversion? Scott Herren : Yes. As we think about fiscal '24, we've got pretty good visibility driven by really the business model shift that we've talked about. So a couple of data points that I think you already have, Tim. One is current RPO of $17.9 billion. So total RPO approaching $35 billion, of which $17.9 billion is current, meaning it turns into revenue in the next 12 months. We ended the year as we expected with roughly double our normal backlog levels. But that excess backlog will work down in the first half of fiscal '24 with the majority of that being worked off in Q1, by the way. And we've got $24.3 billion of ARR that we get a chance to renew. Now obviously, some of that will already be captured in RPO, but there's opportunity that's not already captured in RPO as well. So we entered the year with round numbers, 40% of that top line pretty much already in hand between those three categories. So feel good about the way we've -- the way we see the year laying out. Chuck Robbins : Yes. If I could make one more comment, Tim. On the sequentials, we said given that the year-over-years are just sort of difficult to -- they don't really provide a clear view on what's going on. We've been talking about sequentials a fair amount. And I did say in my opening comments that sequentials from Q3 to Q4 were in excess of 30%. To put that in perspective, it's typically 18% to 20%. And from a customer segment perspective, enterprise was well above that, public sector was well above it. Commercial was pretty close to it and service provider was the low one. However, it was still above historical trends on a sequential basis. So just to try to give you as much color as we can. Tim Long : Thank you. Very helpful. Marilyn Mora : Michelle, let's go ahead and move to the next question. Operator : Thank you. Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead, sir. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot for taking my question. Congrats on a nice set of numbers here. I guess, maybe two things I'd love to get your perspective on. Chuck, when you talk about consistency in capital allocation, can you just expand a bit more on what does that mean? Are you going to think about this as a percent of free cash flow that you're going to go for buybacks or some other metric? Can you just talk about what does that mean? And how do you intend to deploy the capital allocation would be helpful. And then perhaps somewhat maybe related to that, I guess, when we think about the fiscal '24 revenue guide that you folks are providing, 7% growth in Q1, I think, 1% for the full year. That sort of would imply back half will decline. So what are you assuming in the back half that gives you that kind of worry that would be helpful? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Let me make some just a couple of comments, and I'm going to hand it to Scott and let him answer probably both of these. On the capital allocation and the leverage comments, what I would say is that we've spent a lot of time talking to our shareholders over the last few months. And it's clearly important to our shareholders that we commit to and we deliver on operating leverage in our P&L, and we've been doing it, but we haven't committed to it for long term. So that's what we're basically doing today is saying that we are going to continue to commit to do -- to provide operating leverage in the P&L as we look to the future. And then on the buybacks, we had also increased -- there are two things we wanted to do was increase the amount as well as drive more consistency and predictability for our shareholders. And so the rate, as I said, that we've been running at like the last three quarters is sort of the target that we would be at on a quarterly basis as we go forward. Scott, do you want to add to that and then talk about the revenue guide? Scott Herren : Yes, will do. And Amit I think you were one of those voices that talked about cap allocation consistency. Chuck Robbins : I think I remember that. Scott Herren : At a higher level and also being consistent and what you've seen over the last three quarters is that share buyback has been very consistent at $1.25 billion -- right around $1.25 billion per quarter. We see that continuing into the future. That's $5 billion a year in share buybacks. The dividend right now runs round number $6.5 billion. So you add those two together, that's $11.5 billion of capital return to shareholders. It doesn't feel like it's in a bad place, but responding to the need to be both elevated and more consistent in share buybacks is what you're hearing. You've seen us do it already. The difference is we're verbalizing it in advance now, I guess. And on your revenue guide question, I think it's easy to get a little confused by the year-on-year growth rates when we've had the supply constraints that we've had over the last few years. I mean the reality is some of the revenue that we ended up posting this year, in fiscal '23, are orders that we took and customers wanted the product back in fiscal '22. We just couldn't get it out. We couldn't get it delivered because of the supply constraints. So the better way to think about this is what's been the compound annual growth rate from when we started building that backlog and the supply constraints set in, which was the end of our fiscal '21 through -- and I'll just pick the midpoint of our guide for fiscal '24. If you do the compound annual growth rate on revenue through that time, it's right around 5%, which is, as you know, in line with what we see as our opportunity longer term. So I think it's a little bit tough to track what's happening. We just rely on year-on-years because the year-on-years have just been so skewed by the supply chain. If you step back from it and look at endpoint to endpoint that growth rate feels pretty good. Amit Daryanani : No, that three-year CAGR is really helpful. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Great. Thanks, Amit. Next question. Operator : Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. Fantastic kind of data points around the traction with the hyperscalers. When it comes to kind of the $0.5 billion of orders you noted or even kind of the 800-gig trials. Is that with Scheduled Fabric? Is that with Silicon One? Just kind of trying to get a sense of what piece of the portfolio that is. And then just on the Security portfolio, clearly, you're rolling out a new -- a lot of new products, changing some of the sales approaches. Just when do you think we could see an inflection in that business? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Yes, Meta, thank you. So on the Ethernet underneath the AI GPU networks, it is Silicon One for sure. And I think for the next 12 months or so, I think we'll be doing trials. I think we'll have some opportunities, but there'll still be a lot of InfiniBand. And that's why we joined as a founding member of this Ultra Ethernet coalition so that we can up guide the standards and really deliver Scheduled Fabric, to your point, in a very effective way. So we think into FY '25 and beyond, this thing will begin to shift to more of an Ethernet-based infrastructure. On the Security front, yes, we've had some early traction. I mentioned Goldman in the multi-cloud defense, which is a great sign of confidence in that solution. If you look at our XDR platform, which, candidly, we just went GA with it right at the end of the quarter. And we already took a seven-figure order from a retailer in Europe. So that was positive. We took one of our largest security orders ever. We took an eight-figure security order from a Fortune 10 company in Q4. So there's some early green shoots, and the teams are executing. The early feedback and early commentary from analysts and customers, et cetera, is positive, but we've got to actually deliver on it. And hopefully, in the second half of this year, we'll see some real positive impact and then '25 for sure. Meta Marshall : Great. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Next question, please. Operator : Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead, sir. Michael Ng : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I just have two. First, it was encouraging to hear about the share gains on campus switching, SP routing and wireless as well as the expectation to continue to grow share. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the sales execution, the product road map there that gives you the most confidence in that continued share growth. And then second, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about your expectations as it relates to the trajectory of orders going forward. It sounds like if the backlog kind of gets back to normal levels in the first quarter, you should just grow along with revenue growth as we think about order growth beyond the first quarter, but just would love your thoughts there. Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Michael. On the share gains in the enterprise networking space, which is what you're asking about, we expect Q2 will be equal to or maybe slightly above the incremental gains that we see when those numbers come out based on some estimates that we have done internally. I would say the thing that is really helping beyond being great products, but we have done a couple of things. Number one, we have begun to deliver on monitoring and then subsequent management of our Catalyst, the traditional Catalyst portfolio with the Meraki dashboard. And that's a real advantage for customers. It allows them to run a hybrid of the two portfolios. It allows them to have visibility from one dashboard to both sets of portfolios. And so that's been really well received. It has been a key driver in significant improvement in our renewal rates on the software side. And while I'm talking about it, I thought I would share one milestone with you. I've been asked for a few years, when do we think the software renewals in the enterprise networking space would be meaningful. And FY'24 is the first year, I think, it will be meaningful. So just to give you a perspective on it. We have we expect this year to renew enterprise networking software at close to $1 billion. So the transition that we've been going through for all these years is going to hopefully begin to start to pay solid benefits for us going forward. But that's what's going on in that portfolio. Scott, you want to talk about orders? Scott Herren : Trajectory of orders, yes. And, Michael, thanks for that question. What I'd say is, if you remember our commentary from the last call, we said there were kind of three things going on inside product orders. One was the lead times were normalizing, going from being fairly lengthy to going back to a normal level, which, of course, if the lead time yesterday was 30 weeks and today it's 10 weeks means you don't have to place another order for 20 weeks. Those are mostly normalized. They will finish being normalized certainly in the first half of fiscal '24. And so that effect will be dampened. The second is backlog. And as we were still sitting on excess backlog, and we still do, but we've obviously been working our way through that and delivering product to customers. As we get their backlog orders in their hands, they can complete that project and then place the order for the next project. And so that's also been a little bit of a headwind to bookings, and then it's whatever is happening in the macro would be the third factor. We think those first two will normalize in the first half of fiscal '24. Lead times will be normalized, certainly by the time we get to the end of the first half and much of the backlog -- the excess backlog will ship out during the first quarter of fiscal '24. So I think we'll have a clearer view, and I expect to see more normal ordering patterns. Of course, we don't guide orders, but I expect to see more normal ordering patterns in the second half of the year. Michael Ng : Okay. That's all very helpful. Thank you, Chuck. Thank you, Scott. Chuck Robbins : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Great. Thank you. Let's go ahead and take the next question. Operator : Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. You may go ahead. Ittai Kidron : Thanks, guys. High energy, I like this. Chuck, maybe you could look at -- talk about the RPO. Very strong performance there, especially when you look at the same metric a year ago. Maybe you can unpack this a little bit in the context of a few metrics, meaning duration of contracts customers are willing to go into now, size of deals that are willing to move into now. I'm just trying to kind of get a little bit into the elements of this significant increase in RPO. Appreciate it. Chuck Robbins : Yes. Thanks, Ittai. I'll give you a little color and then I'll let Scott comment again, too. A lot of this is -- we've made this transition to -- virtually our entire enterprise networking portfolio now is a subscription model. And so that contributes. And Scott can talk about the year-over-year contribution that we've seen. But I mean we have $35 billion in RPO. And I think it's an important thing because when you think about market share and some of the concerns that people have had, you have to remember that we put a reasonable amount of each order in our core networking portfolio on the enterprise side goes into RPO and doesn't get reported as revenue. It's ratable. So it's a headwind to market share. And the other thing that I would point out is that we had a record year at $50 billion -- almost $57 billion at a time where we were building RPO to $35 billion and we have the backlog that we have. So there, we've had a lot of solid customer demand. I'd say in Q4, we certainly saw a fair amount of the enterprise networking. As we ship those products, we saw that software come out of backlog as we've talked about and moved into RPO. We saw a lot of these enterprise agreements that we did with our customers in enterprise contributed to it as well. Those were reasonably large deals. And Scott, I'll let you comment anything -- any more you want to comment on? Scott Herren : Yes. You specifically asked about duration. There's not much change in duration overall, Ittai. So that's not it. Q4 typically is a quarter where we have more large multiyear transactions. We talk about enterprise agreements and whole portfolio agreements. And so you typically will see a little bit of a bump in Q4 driven by that and then a little bit of a -- I'm sorry, an RPO in Q4. And then in Q1, the typically -- the typical pattern would see it come down just slightly as we work our way through those. I think the other thing to just bear in mind, we've got net RPO growth this year of $3.3 billion, of which product had a net growth of $1.7 billion. If you looked at our current RPO when we began the year, it was about $16.8 billion, which means all of that came out of RPO. And yet on top of that -- yes, short-term. On top of that, we added $1.7 billion. So we added quite a bit of current year sales into that RPO balance. Back to Chuck's point, that's revenue that many of our competitors recognize immediately as they ship it. For us, we have the advantage of recognizing it over time, which makes us more predictable, and it gives us greater visibility into where things are headed. Ittai Kidron : Appreciate the color. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : Move to the next question. Operator : Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead sir. Matthew Niknam : Hey, thank you for taking the question. Two-parter, if I could. First, as we think about fiscal '24, so you're forecasting 1% top line growth and about 4% non-GAAP EPS growth with a fairly strong exit rate on gross margin. So is it fair to assume the lift from gross margins may get offset somewhat by some OpEx reinvestment? Just trying to think about the puts and takes there. And then broadly, at the Analyst Day a couple of years ago, I think, Scott, you laid out a 5% to 7% target for both top and bottom line. I'm just wondering if that's evolved at all in light of some of the greater emphasis on operating leverage that you're talking about today. Thanks. Scott Herren : Yes. Matt, on your first question, I think gross margin settling, you saw our guide for Q1 of gross margins in the 65% to 66% range. And I think it settles in there for the full year. So you can do the math with what we've projected on the top line. That drops down to a mid-single-digit OpEx growth number, so in line with expectations certainly given the environment of merit increases. It doesn't provide a lot of incremental investment, but I think that's in sync with what you've seen us do over time. So the long-term model, look, that was opportunity-based. If you look backwards, what you've seen is we have delivered the bottom line growing faster than the top line. I think the only difference that you hear from us now is, as I said, we're articulating it in advance instead of once it's happened. That's really the way to think about that. Matthew Niknam : Great. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : All right. Thanks, Matt. Michelle, let's take the next question. Operator : Jim Fish with Piper Sandler. You may go ahead. James Fish : Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. Maybe just diving in on the go-to-market side. We're hearing you guys are looking to move more of the specialist sales teams out and more towards kind of a cross-sell more portfolio kind of motion. Are you doing a larger sales restructuring right now? And is there anything you can do to better package solutions across these multiple segments, especially on the growth segments that are kind of struggling here, as Meta kind of pointed out earlier, with even security. And lastly, on the capital return side. I know you guys get asked about the technology, but -- and you talked about potential being strategic and all of that. But how do you feel about the push versus pull of either further acquisitions in either of the key growth segments that you outlined, Chuck, versus possibly even spinning off some of those segments like some of the larger companies you're starting to see do? Thanks, guys. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Jim. That was a lot. Let me tell you a little bit of the history on the specialist model. I'll tell you what we're doing in the product portfolio, which allows us to clean up the specialist model a little bit and get them a little more focused. So historically, like -- let's use Security as an example. We've had these different products, and we've sold them all individually. And therefore you need to compete with those individual competitors. So you need subspecialists, you need specialists in every little area of security. And what we've been doing across the portfolio is moving to more of a platform approach. And so it makes it easier to sell. And in certain areas of our portfolio like collaboration and security, we've moved to a suite strategy. So we're now packaging up the Security portfolio in different suites, which allows for us to sort of optimize the security specialist or actually align them more effectively is probably the best way to say it. And so that's the work that's been going on. And I think as we continue to execute on this platform strategy, it certainly simplifies the selling cycle for some of these technologies and I think getting to the suites. We've seen it work in collab. This past quarter, we had very strong order growth in collaboration. We had positive order growth in Security as well. And so for collab to be showing positive order growth is really a byproduct of the suites and leading with calling as the lead part of the suite and then also a big focus on cloud contact center, which grew triple-digits last quarter from an orders perspective. So those are the things that we're trying to do. We're trying to get the portfolio put together in a way that makes it easier and requires fewer subspecialists in the field as we move forward. Scott? Scott Herren : On the cap return question, Jim, I'd just reiterate what I said earlier. With the consistency of buybacks now running right around $1.25 billion per quarter, so $5 billion a year, the dividend consumes another $6.5 billion. That's $11.5 billion of cap return that we're committed to. And I do expect to continue to, as you've seen us do for the last 12 years, make increases in our dividend payment as you look ahead. So that's one lens on it. I would say on the M&A and spin-off part of that, we're constantly evaluating that. We're constantly evaluating what's available in the order marketplace. You saw we closed three, albeit small kind of tech tuck-in, but three acquisitions during the quarter. The team's very active. We're constantly looking at that space as well as the value in our own portfolio. And so there's nothing new to report there, but those are constant things that we look at. James Fish : Helpful color guys. Thanks. Marilyn Mora : All right. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. You may go ahead, sir. Ben Reitzes : Hey, guys, thanks for the question. I wanted to double-click on an earlier question with regard to hyperscalers, the $500 million in AI orders you had a briefing in June. I was wondering, have things picked up in terms of activity there? It seems like maybe it has. And I wanted to see if there's further traction that you could articulate in Silicon One. Like what kind of activity are you seeing there? And how big a business can this be? Chuck Robbins : Yes. Well, Ben, welcome and thank you for the question. We have definitely seen traction in the space. Lots of discussions, lots of architectural discussions, lots of input from those customers on what they'd like to see in the next generation of silicon as an example. And the teams are off building that we just delivered in June. As I said earlier, the next-generation ASIC that actually is built for this, but there's going to be more and more purpose-built silicon over the next couple of years. And the teams are working on that. And those customers are having a great deal of input in how that silicon gets designed. And in some cases, it's unique to each one. And so that's the beauty of us having such an advanced silicon capability. It allows us, if we need to, to actually build unique silicon by customer because these opportunities are so large. In the last call, we talked about the fact that this would probably be 3 to 4 times the opportunity size of the original cloud build-out. And unfortunately for us, as it's been well documented, we missed the original cloud build-out. But I can say with every bit of confidence right now that as we go through this AI transition to Ethernet, we are super well positioned. We have incredible silicon that they have been using in other parts of their portfolio. We won three more use cases last quarter. We now are installed in 21 use cases across the top six of these providers. And we expect that, that momentum will just continue over the next few years. I do think that in the short term, InfiniBand is probably going to still be the preferred in most cases, but they are trialing. And we will, much like we already have, we'll get some opportunities to run Ethernet underneath season. And as we deliver Scheduled Fabric, it will become even more prevalent. Ben Reitzes : Okay. Thanks a lot, Chuck. It's good to be back . Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Ben Scott Herren : Thanks, Ben. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Ben. We'll take the next question. Operator : Tal Liani with Bank of America. You may go ahead. Tal Liani : Yes, hi. I have one kind of big-picture question and one more specific. Maybe I'll start with the specific question. If I look at the 400-gig Ethernet market share, cloud, if I take Arista and White Boxes, it's like over 90% of the market, Cisco doesn't have much of a 400-gig market share by the data. But you are talking about growing market share in 800 gig. Can you talk about the dynamics of 400? And then why was it this way in 400 and how it changes in 800 in your expectations? Second is about the big picture. And I need -- I want to understand kind of the numbers. Product revenues last year were $38 billion. Product revenues this year is $43 billion. So that's $5 billion increase. And the decline in backlog is about $5 billion. Your implied guidance for next year for product revenues is roughly flat plus. So without the support of backlog, how do you get to product revenues? What are the other parts that could go to product revenues and compensate for the fact that backlog is going to be normal by the end of next quarter or next 2 quarters, maybe? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Yes, Tal, thank you for that. And so on the 400 gig to 800 gig, I don't know that I've seen exact reports that you're talking about on the 400 gig. But our teams -- the volume of ports that we're shipping on 400 gig would imply that that's a -- I don't know, we've had a great deal of success and it's been growing quite significantly. So -- but we obviously had -- over the last few years, we've been rebuilding or actually building our presence in this space. So it wouldn't surprise me to see us as a low market share player, but we've certainly won our fair share. On the 800 gig, I think it's just a matter of we're engaged there. We're installed already. We've got trust with these customers. They've seen what we can do. And I think that we're just in the game at the right time as opposed to where we started. And so I think from now on, it just gives us an opportunity to be there from the beginning as opposed to trying to catch up. Scott Herren : And Tal, to your question on the math you're trying to do on product revenue, I think some of this goes back to the answer that I gave Tim earlier. One of the things you have to consider is some of the product revenue we delivered this year was actually demand from the prior year, right? Demand from fiscal '22 that because of the supply constraints, we simply couldn't get out the door. Had that not been the case, you would have seen higher product revenue in fiscal '22 and slightly lower product revenue in fiscal '23. And you would have seen a steady increase then from '22 to '23 and '23 to '24. So the things that are driving that are the things that we've talked about, right? We continue to see good traction and market share gains in our enterprise networking products. We are invested early in the AI game and see a great opportunity there. We're getting early success, although it's -- you're not seeing a lot of it yet in the P&L, but we're seeing some pretty early success with our revamped security strategy and the great work that team has done. And so -- but instead of trying to do it the way you're doing it, the delivery has been lumpy, the demand has been less lumpy is probably the right way to think about it. Tal Liani : Got it. Thank you. Marilyn Mora : All right. Thanks, Tal. Next question. Operator : Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead. Joseph Cardoso : Hi, thanks. This is Joe Cardoso on for Samik. Just one question for me. You mentioned double-digit growth across all your customer verticals from an order perspective but also mentioned service provider continuing to be weak. I was just hoping you could touch on what you're seeing under the hood in service provider. And specifically, if I split it up between telco AI and non-AI cloud, how did those track compared to 90 days ago? And then just quickly, a quick clarification on the $0.5 billion in orders in AI. Any way you can parse it out, like how many customers is reflected in that order number? And then just quickly clarify if that's all hyperscale or if there's any Tier 2 cloud or enterprise customers in that mix. Thanks for the question. Chuck Robbins : Yes. Thank you. So on the service provider side, the first question you asked -- let me write my notes down, hold on a second, so I don't have to ask you for the question again. On SP, I think -- I'd say Q4 for the telco side of it, the communications service provider was probably fairly consistent with what it was the quarter before. It's just relatively weak right now. We see a lot of these customers have -- are digesting a lot of the infrastructure that they bought over the next few months. We think that -- our team believes that orders will stabilize on the telco side of the business in the second half of our fiscal year. On the cloud side, we believe that they'll continue to invest. And they kind of invest in six-month cycles. And we think that in the middle of our fiscal year, we'll see growth in that investment for the first part of 2025. On the $500 million, it is definitely in the Tier 1 hyperscalers. So I'll just leave it at that. On the opportunity that we see, we still see -- we won three use cases last quarter. And I would say those were primarily non-AI. So there's still -- we're still winning new use cases in the core infrastructure. And -- but we're in trials in different discussions with most all of them relative to AI fabric. Joseph Cardoso : Thanks, Chuck. Appreciate the color Chuck Robbins : Thank you. Marilyn Mora : All right. Thank you. Next question. Operator : David Vogt with UBS. You may go ahead. David Vogt : Great. Thanks guys for squeezing me. I'm not going to belabor the point on orders, but I wanted to ask a question about AI order specifically in terms of your ability to ship to customers and where you are in trials. The reason why I ask is we've heard from a lot of companies in the industry that there's some supply chain considerations that are maybe causing commercial deployments and revenue rec may be pushed out to 2025. So I just want to get a sense for that 500 orders that you referenced in your prepared remarks, how does that flow through? And then along with that, in the guidance Scott provided for fiscal '24, how much, if any, is AI-related this year? And if not why? And when -- going back to my first point, when do we start to see it in your P&L? Chuck Robbins : Yes. We do not -- Scott and I are both looking at each other. We don't know of any supply chain issues we have around our AI. It's our standard Ethernet portfolio based on the Silicon One ASIC, and we're delivering it today. So I don't think there's any supply chain issue for us on that front. Scott Herren : We might be at a bit of a better position than some because it is our own ASICs. It is ours. Chuck Robbins : On the FY '24 contribution of AI, I don't have that information on top of my head. Scott Herren : Yes. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you there. Chuck Robbins : Go ahead. Scott Herren : Here's what I'd say, here's the right way to think about it, David. Those orders -- what we see is, within the broader hyperscaler world, which is where a lot of these AI sales are going, they're obviously in digest mode. I think you've heard that from us and all of our peers or what they bought. We do see toward the end of this calendar year, so towards the midyear of our fiscal year, we see them beginning to place orders again for delivery of product that will happen in the second half. So while I don't want to get into parsing the guide down to that level of granularity, I think what you should expect is it to be something that we'd begin to see show up in the P&L late in the second half. Chuck Robbins : Yes. What I was going to add, David, is I think until we evolve some of the -- get some of the Scheduled Fabric technologies built out, they're certainly running -- they're running some of these on traditional Ethernet, which is what we're deploying today. But as we get Scheduled Fabric out and these customers get more comfortable moving from InfiniBand to Ethernet, I think that's when we'll start to see the real impact of AI. And maybe it's late '24, but I would suspect into '25 for sure. David Vogt : Got it. And maybe just a quick follow-up. So Scott, were there orders from AI last quarter in the product order commentary? Are these basically new orders in this most recent fiscal quarter? Is that maybe the right way to think about it? Scott Herren : Yes. Don't think of the $500 million as all coming in, in the last quarter. Those are orders to date that we know are going into AI infrastructure. That's not a Q4-specific comment. Chuck Robbins : And by the way, a portion of that for sure is deployed. It's in and running. Scott Herren : Yes. David Vogt : Got it. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, guys. Marilyn Mora : All right. Thanks, David. We have time for one last question. Operator : Thank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James & Associates. You may go ahead, sir Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about what your assumptions are for your campus-related business, and I'm including both switching and wireless LAN. I assume that's roughly -- almost $15 billion of trailing four-quarter sales, somewhere in that ballpark. And I've seen market research saying that business declines, some saying it's growing. And Chuck, you highlighted that $1 billion renewal. Just trying to get my head around how material that is. What's built into the full year forecast for campus? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : I'll make two comments and, Scott, I'll let you add to it. First of all, as we said, we think that as you see the Q2 calendar year share numbers come out, you'll continue to see us gain share in that space. And so we would expect to continue doing that. The renewal number that I threw out was close to $1 billion. And Scott, I'll just let you comment on how you want to break down or if you want to? Scott Herren : Yes. No, I don't think there's a whole lot else to add. We're encouraged by what we're seeing in campus. It's one of the things that that we've said all along is as the supply -- the backlog begins to be delivered, you'll start to see more and more of those customer decisions that went to us actually show up in the numerator of those market share equation. That's exactly what you're seeing. So I think the concern over the several quarters while we had supply constraints that maybe impacted us more than some of our peers. You should see those unwind as we can now deliver that backlog. The $1 billion of renewal that Chuck -- roughly $1 billion of renewal that Chuck talked about, that is a subset of our fiscal '24 guide. Chuck Robbins : Yes. Marilyn Mora : All right. So we'll go ahead and turn it over to you, Chuck, for some closing remarks. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Marilyn. First of all, I want to thank our teams and just say how proud I am of the work that's gone into the last couple of years to actually deliver the record results that we did. We're incredibly proud of the share gains that we expected to gain and we are. I'm proud of the team and the new innovation that's being delivered in areas like AI and security and across the portfolio in observability and core networking and SP routing, all of these areas, the teams are doing an amazing job. And our portfolio is very relevant to the customer priorities that we see around the world. I've never seen such consistency around the priorities in virtually every customer around the world. And our portfolio lines up nicely against the key things that our customers are trying to achieve. I'm also very proud of the team and Scott and the rest of the finance organization for what they've done. And we're very happy to provide clarity on our commitment to our shareholders with the operating leverage and the buybacks and our dividend as we look to the future. So thanks for joining us today. Marilyn Mora : Thanks, Chuck, I'll go ahead and wrap this up. Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal year 2024 first quarter results, will be on Wednesday, November 15th, 2023 at 1 :30 P.M. Pacific Time, 4:30 P.M. Eastern Time. This concludes today's call. And of course, if you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to Cisco's Investor Relations group.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to Cisco's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Sami Badri, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Sami Badri : Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's first quarter fiscal year '24 quarterly conference call. This is Sami Badri, Cisco's new Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. Having followed Cisco on the sell-side for 10 years, I couldn't be more excited to join the company and look forward to engaging with you all in my new role. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. As a reminder, we have simplified how we report product and service revenue and customer markets. Starting this quarter, we are reporting revenue in the following five categories : networking, security, collaboration, observability, and services. And we are reporting customer markets in the following three categories : enterprise, public sector, and service provider and cloud. Also, as is customary in Q1, we have made certain reclassifications to prior period amounts to conform to the current period's presentation. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the second quarter and full year of fiscal 2024. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on forms 10-K which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Sami, and welcome to Cisco. I hope everyone is doing well, and thanks for joining us today. We delivered a solid start to fiscal 2024, with the strongest first quarter results in Cisco's history in terms of revenue and profitability. Our Q1 revenue was at the upper end of our guided range. EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance, driven by strength in gross margins and expense control, resulting in strong operating leverage. Our disciplined expense management and the tailwinds from our business model transformation resulted in our highest non-GAAP gross margin in over 17 years and record non-GAAP operating margin. We also returned $2.8 billion in Q1 via cash dividends and share repurchases, delivering on our capital return commitments to our shareholders. As we continue to transform our business towards more software and recurring revenue streams, fueled by accelerated innovation, we remain committed to driving operating leverage and shareholder returns. Now turning to the demand environment, after three quarters of exceptionally strong product delivery, our customers are now focused on installing and implementing these unprecedented levels of products. The bottleneck that we previously saw in the supply chain has now shifted downstream to implementation by our customers and partners. Our order lead times and backlog have largely returned to normal levels. As deliveries rose, the channel inventory we track at our distributors also steadily declined during this time. Simply put, customers are now taking time to onboard and deploy these heightened product deliveries. While the macro challenges we have discussed still exist, we believe this implementation phase is the primary reason for the slowdown in new orders. We saw it mostly with our larger enterprise, service provider, and cloud customers, and it was most pronounced in October. Based on our analysis, we believe this phase is temporary and estimate there is an additional one quarter to two quarters worth of shipped orders in customers' hands, still waiting to be deployed. This has near-term consequences for revenue and our outlook for the next couple of quarters, which Scott will discuss shortly. However, it does not change our longer-term confidence. We expect product order growth rates to increase in the second half of the fiscal year. We also remain very confident in the foundational strength of our business and future growth opportunities given the criticality of our technologies. Overall, our win rates are stable, cancellation and return rates remain below pre-pandemic levels, and we have gained market share, all of which are testaments to the strength of our portfolio and how it aligns to our customers' most pressing needs. As we look to enhance our capabilities in higher growth areas, in the first quarter of fiscal '24, we announced our intent to acquire Splunk. The combination of Cisco and Splunk will create an end-to-end data platform to enhance our customers' digital resiliency with our complementary capabilities in AI, security, and observability. The combination of Cisco and Splunk also directly supports our strategic objectives around driving higher levels of growth, software capabilities, and ARR. Together, we will bring trusted innovation leadership and outstanding go-to-market engine and a world-class culture that will help our customers achieve their technology outcomes with innovative products and solutions. Now, let me comment on our quarterly performance. As I previously mentioned, we delivered strong revenues in Q1, which was broad-based across our product portfolio and driven by our customers' investments in generative AI, cloud, security and full stack observability. As expected, we continued to gain market share with the release of the calendar Q2 results, recording another quarter of year-over-year gains in three of our largest networking markets : campus switching, wireless LAN and SP routing. In webscale, we see continued momentum in AI, with three of the top four customers deploying our hyperscale ethernet AI fabric. We also already have line of sight to over $1 billion in orders for AI infrastructure from major cloud providers in fiscal year '25. To help advance AI, we are working with key GPU and storage partners to create solutions including ethernet technologies, GPU-enabled infrastructure, and joint tested and validated reference architectures with a commitment to open networking for AI. Collectively, we believe there is a great opportunity for a broad set of innovations and compute GPU networking software and services to support core and edge AI infrastructure. According to the 650 Group, the AI switching market is forecasted to exceed $10 billion in 2027. Our scalable fabric for AI, coupled with a proven power saving capabilities of Cisco Silicon One put us in a strong position to build-out the infrastructure needed for AI clusters and we are laser-focused on winning in this space. Moving to Security, we continue to execute against our product roadmap and strengthen our unified security platform. Since our Cisco XDR solution became available this summer, we have added recovery to the response process giving security teams the ability to snapshot and restore their business critical data at the first sign of a ransomware attack. With our three new offers around XDR, Cisco Secure Access and Multicloud Defense, we already have over $500 million in the pipeline across over 1,000 customers. We also launched our new Cisco security firewall solution this quarter. We are actively engaged in competitive sales with all these products and expect to see meaningful positive results in the coming quarters. In our Collaboration portfolio, we recently introduced a range of truly game changing AI capabilities, spanning the entire Webex suite as well as new devices for reimagined workspaces at our WebexOne event. Before I turn it over to Scott, let me briefly summarize three key takeaways. First, as we consider where we're at today, the primary issue with demand is that customers are taking time to onboard and deploy heightened product deliveries. While we were not immune to the macro, we believe this is temporary as our customers and partners continue to tell us that our portfolio is stronger than ever and we have continued to see share gains in key markets. Second, we remain confident in our future, with the incremental multi-billion dollar AI infrastructure opportunity, the increasing criticality of security and observability, and what we believe Cisco and Splunk can do together for our customers is truly exciting. Lastly, you can always count on us to take a disciplined approach, regardless of the environment. We remain committed to operating leverage, capital allocation, and expense management. I'll now turn it over to Scott to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook. Scott Herren : Thanks, Chuck. We delivered solid results in Q1, driven by the prior strategic actions we took to mitigate the supply chain constraints. For the quarter, we reported strong revenue growth and a record non-GAAP operating margin. Total revenue was $14.7 billion, up 8% year-over-year, at the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP net income was $4.5 billion, up 28%. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.11, up 29%, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range. Looking at our Q1 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $11.1 billion, up 9%; and service revenue was $3.5 billion, up 4%. Networking, our largest product category, drove the increase with 10% growth. Within networking, the growth was driven by switching, where campus and datacenter were both up double-digits on the strength of our Catalyst 9000 and Nexus 9000 offerings. This was partially offset by a decline in wireless. Security was up 4%, driven by our Zero Trust and threat intelligence, detection and response offerings. Collaboration was up 3% driven by growth in Calling and Contact Center, partially offset by a decline in Meetings. Observability was up 21%, driven by growth across the portfolio, including double-digit growth in ThousandEyes and AppDynamics. We continue to make progress in our transformation to more recurring revenue based offerings. We saw solid performance in our ARR of $24.5 billion, which increased 5% with product ARR growth of 10%. Total software revenue was $4.4 billion, a 13% increase with software subscription revenue also up 13%. 85% of our software revenue was subscription-based. Total subscription revenue increased 10% to $6.5 billion, which represents 44% of Cisco's total revenue, an increase of 1 percentage point over last year. RPO was $34.8 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Product RPO increased 14% and service RPO increased 11%. In total, short-term RPO was up 8% to $17.6 billion. Looking at our product orders by geographic segment, year-over-year, overall product orders declined 20% with the Americas down 19%, EMEA down 13% and APJC down 38%. In our customer markets, Service Provider & Cloud was down 38%, Enterprise was down 26%, and Public Sector was up slightly at 2%. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 67.1%, up 410 basis points year-over-year and 110 basis points above the high-end of our guidance range. Product gross margin was 66.5%, up 550 basis points. The increase was driven primarily by productivity improvements, with lower freight, logistics, and component costs. Favorable mix and positive pricing also contributed to the year-over-year improvement. Services non-GAAP gross margin was 69%, up slightly. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 36.6%, up 480 basis points and exceeding the high-end of our guidance range. This improved leverage was driven by both our strong non-GAAP gross margin and ongoing disciplined cost management. Shifting to the balance sheet, we ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $23.5 billion. We had operating cash flow for the quarter of $2.4 billion, down 40% primarily due to the $2.8 billion tax payment related to prior quarters, which was associated with the IRS tax relief due to the California floods. This quarter we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders, comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.3 billion of share repurchases. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we are committed to increasing shareholder returns through greater operating leverage, maintaining a higher level of annual share repurchases, and growing our dividend. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q1, we announced our intent to acquire Splunk, which we expect to close by the end of the third quarter of calendar year 2024, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, including approval by Splunk shareholders. In Q1, we also closed several acquisitions, all of which are highly complementary to our internal R&D in line with our strategy to strengthen our position in cloud, security, observability and AI with targeted strategic M&A. To summarize, we delivered a solid quarter highlighted by topline growth and increased operating leverage that resulted in stronger than anticipated earnings per share. We continue to make progress in our business model shift to more recurring revenue. We remain focused on disciplined expense management without losing sight of the strategic investments necessary to innovate and capitalize on growth opportunities. Turning to our financial guidance, as Chuck outlined, the bottleneck that we previously saw in the supply chain has now shifted downstream to implementation by our customers and partners. Most of the supply chain constraints are now behind us and both shipment lead times and backlog have largely returned to normal levels. Q1 product orders declined 20% as our largest customers are implementing elevated levels of product shipments from prior quarters as we delivered orders from our historically high backlog levels. As Chuck mentioned, we believe there are one quarter to two quarters worth of shipped orders awaiting implementation by our customers. Our revenue guidance assumes, one quarter to two quarters of lower revenue and then a return to more typical sequential growth rates. Consequently, for Q2, we expect revenue to be in the range of $12.6 billion to $12.8 billion. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 65% to 66%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 31.5% to 32.5%. And non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.82 to $0.84. For fiscal year 2024, our guidance is updated as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $53.8 billion to $55 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $3.87 to $3.93. In both our Q2 and full year guidance, we are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. I'd like to thank our teams for their focus and execution this quarter. We remain confident in the strength of the business and our ability to capitalize on the key growth opportunities ahead. I'll now turn it back to Sami, so we can move into the Q&A. Sami Badri : Thanks, Scott. Michelle, let's go ahead and queue-up for questions. Operator : Thank you. Tal Liani with Bank of America. You may go ahead, sir. Sami Badri : Tal, you there? Tal Liani : Yes. Sorry. I was on mute. Now you can hear me. What is your assumption on the growth seasonality after the next quarter? Are we back in your assumptions to normal seasonality? Or do you expect kind of different seasonality than previous years? Chuck Robbins : Yes, Tal, it's a great question. As I said in -- well, we talked about one quarter to two quarters of basically inventory, but shipped product that's at our customers, it's not yet been installed. I expect the impact to be greatest in Q2 and in Q3. But when you look at the order growth, we do see a return to order growth in the second-half of the year, both sequentially and year-on year as we get there. Tal Liani : So in terms of revenue recognition, you expect 3Q to -- the 2Q to 3Q sequentials, that's -- that was my question. Do you expect 3Q to be weaker than previous seasonality? Or do you expect it to be the same as previous seasonality? Or even sequentially? Chuck Robbins : No, from a revenue standpoint, we don't guide bookings, Tal, but from a revenue standpoint, I do see sequential increase, Q2 to Q3. Tal Liani : Okay. Thank you. Sami Badri : All right. Thank you, Tal. Chuck Robbins : Thank you, Tal. Sami Badri : Michelle, next question. Operator : Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley Investment Research. You may go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks so much. Maybe just a question on, if you see the investment categories kind of changing maybe free, the orders that you've seen, and then when do you see them come back in a couple of quarters. I guess, I'm just trying to get a sense of have much of the orders we've seen over the last year been catch-up investments like campus and data center? And then areas of investment will change as we come back or is this really just inventory digestion and the investment categories and kind of investment prioritization will stay the same with customers? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Yes, Meta, thanks for the question. I think your latter comment is probably the closest to the truth. We don't anticipate a big difference. Although, I think with the improvements that we've seen in our portfolio and security, we should see security accelerate. Obviously, we'll continue to update you on the AI opportunity that's out there. We think that's going to continue to be a driver over the next couple of years. But in general, I think it will look more normal once we get through this. Meta Marshall : Great. Thank you. Sami Badri : Thank you, Meta. Michelle, next question. Operator : Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Chuck, one of the things I think folks will struggle to understand is the conviction you have that this is an implementation pause and not a macro demand-centric weakness. So I'd love to just understand whatever you can talk about it and why you're so convinced this is a one-quarter to two-quarter implementation rather than enterprise demand is just getting weaker. Anything on that front would be helpful? And then, I just want to clarify the spot. You folks had $1 billion in AI orders that's two times the number you gave last time is that correct? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Yes. Amit, thank you. So if you'll be patient with me, I'll give you a few data points and some context around why we think this -- this is a -- an inventory issue that's sitting with our customers. First of all, our customers and our sales organizations have been very clear with us over the last 90-days that this is the issue, particularly our large enterprise and our large -- and our service providers. We talked about that with the service providers prior, but it shifted into the enterprise space in a big way. The other thing is, we had our Partner Summit last week and some of our largest partners unsolicited began their conversations with me by talking about this very issue, which candidly I knew the customers had talked about it and our sales teams had talked about it. I was actually surprised to hear. It's so consistently at that Partner Summit. So, that's sort of the subjective view and then we've done some analysis and there's three things I'd point out. The first is, in certain parts of our portfolio, we actually can -- we can see the timeframe from shipment of a product until the product begins to connect to the cloud, back to the cloud like Meraki/And what we've seen is a one-quarter to two-quarter delay versus what historically you would see when these products get shipped, how long it takes for them to be activated and connect to the Meraki cloud. So that's the first piece. The second is, we had a very strong quarter in federal, U.S. federal, from an orders perspective. And so, we looked into why big customer like the U.S. government, Department of Defense, would not have the same issue. And the reality is, is that they have special clauses in their contracts that give them most favored nation status when we're actually making shipment decisions, and certainly with the Department of Defense, we prioritize them during the supply chain crisis. So they never had a big influx, they had a very steady flow of products across, which explains why their order numbers look fairly normal. The third point I'd say is that we noticed a serious uptick in Q1 in our Transactional Advanced Services, which is loosely translated to be implementation services, where that grew almost 20% and the forecast for Q2 is almost double-digits again. So it's clear that customers are asking us to come help them get this done. And I'll give you one final subjective data point and then I'll talk about the AI stuff. We had one big partner tell us that they will have literally hired 200 people in the last 90-days, solely focused on implementing technology for their customers. So there is just so many things that we've learned over the last 90-days. Clearly, this surprised us. But I think we feel pretty good right now. I'll make a comment about why I don't think it's macro, candidly it might have been easier for me to say it was macro. But as we've discussed prior, we have -- the traditional service provider has been tough and it remains that way. We've talked about elongated sales cycle, they remain. We've talked about, in some cases, the need for extra signatures, which is pretty normal, that's remained. But we didn't see it get materially worse in the quarter. And so all of that -- and I'm sorry for the long answer, but I wanted to be thorough, all of that is really what led us to believe this -- that this is a consumption issue with our customers. So I'm going to pause there, and then I'm going to answer your AI question. What we gave last time was orders to-date. We have taken orders for over $500 million. For infrastructure to support AI networks, AI GPUs inside the cloud players. Then -- and I'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment. The numbers that we gave today is a forward-looking set of numbers. Let's say, in fiscal year \u201825, which is when we said, we believe that the broad ethernet build-out would occur underneath GPUs. We have already seen -- we have line of sight to $1 billion plus of orders that our teams feel pretty good that we're going to get and/or we've been designed in already. So that's just sort of a forward-looking set of orders that we've identified for fiscal \u201825, okay. I will also just cover real quickly, we are now -- we now have our ethernet fabric deployed underneath GPUs in three of the four Hyperscalers, major Hyperscalers in the United States. We also are working very closely with AMD, Intel and NVIDIA, to create solutions including ethernet technology's GPU-enabled infrastructure joint -- jointly tested and validated reference architectures. And I will say even this week, yesterday, Jensen from NVIDIA and four of his -- four, five of his executives came over to see us and we spent 90 minutes together with my executive team. And we believe we have a great opportunity to actually build some integrated solutions between our technology and their technology to actually take to the enterprise. So we're beginning to see the use cases in the enterprise evolve. And we think that partnership with NVIDIA, in that case, with our underlying technology and our strength of go to market, we think will be a winning combination. So we're working on that as well. So there's a lot going on in the AI space. Sami Badri : All right. Thank you, Amit. Michelle, next question. Operator : Thank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may go ahead. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if maybe you'd be willing to unpack the networking segment a little bit in terms of the trends. And really what I'm trying to get at is, understand sort of what's doing better, what's doing worse, and in that I suspect it's datacenter bounced us pretty good whereas maybe campus is a bit weaker and declining. And that hopefully during this transition to the new segmentation, if you could give us a little bit more color within networking? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Hey, Simon, thanks for that. I would say the bigger variance that we're seeing, I mean, right now, obviously the demand signal is little bit tough because of the amount of inventory that's out in the field and that we have normalized lead times at this point. We knew that would happen sometime in the first half. That's now happened. Our lead times are back to where they were pre-pandemic. And our backlog has shipped. The supply chain team has done a terrific job getting product out the door. That's what's kind of moved the bottleneck from our level down to our customers' level. But when you start to unpack within networking, we're not seeing at this point, a huge difference between, for example, datacenter or campus networking. But what we are seeing is a little more field-based inventory on wireless access points. That's been slightly slower than what we've seen. It just because of the amount of product that's been shipped out than what we've seen in the rest of the networking. Simon Leopold : Thank you very much. Sami Badri : All right. Thank you, Simon. Chuck Robbins : Yes. Thanks, Simon. Sami Badri : All right. Michelle, next question. Operator : Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. You may go ahead, sir. Ben Reitzes : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to ask about your share repurchase cadence. Stock obviously could get hit here. We have been talking about $5 billion in buybacks or so for the year. I know some of that stops that dilution. If you guys are confident in the second half pickup, is there any potential that you would be more aggressive in the upcoming quarter? And how are you thinking about share repo this year, given current dynamics with the Splunk deal coming? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Yes, Ben, as we said on the Splunk transaction, it's going to be outside of the transactional costs. It's going to be cash flow positive from the first year forward. So the Splunk transaction is not, in any way, having an effect on our capital return, either through the dividend or through the -- through share buybacks. We expect to continue that higher level and consistent higher level of share buybacks, and to continue to show increases in our dividend. We also will obviously look at the opportunity -- at the chance to be opportunistic on the share buyback. I'm not going to commit to that at this moment, but that is something that we will obviously take a look at. Sami Badri : All right. Thank you, Ben. Ben Reitzes : Thank you. Sami Badri : All right. Michelle, next question. Operator : Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, if I can just clarify one thing first. I think, Chuck, in your prepared remarks, you did say, you saw the more pronounced impact on the orders in the month of October. I think that's what I heard you say. I mean, just curious, are you implying that you did see an improvement in orders in the sort of first couple of weeks of November itself and that's maybe part of your confidence in that? It's a bit more temporary than a longer pause from the customers? And then you did mention large partners really being the ones that are facing this sort of inventory installation problem. What gives you sort of color that SMB, the smaller customers sort of not going to face the similar issue or are you also baking that in, in terms of your sort of next couple of quarters of headwinds that you're thinking about on the revenue side? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Samik. I think my point with October was that if you go back to the end of Q4, we talked about on the last call that we had a fair amount of momentum as we exited the quarter, which is one of the reasons we didn't expect to see this. And we had our normal year-end sales, moving accounts around, moving territories around, and getting sort of the sales start-up process that happens in the first say six weeks of the fiscal year, which we went through. So what we tend to look for is the middle of the quarter. And then into October is when we expect to see, the actual quarter materialize and everything kind of come together, and it just didn't. And that's what -- that was the comment about that it was primarily -- we really -- it was really clear to us in October that -- that this was going to be the situation. Relative to they\u2019re the ones who are having the consumption issue because they have the most inventory. You asked how we -- what confidence we have if it's not SMB, if you look at orders, we look at -- we look at a sub-segmentation within enterprise now, and within service provider, etc., and SMB was fine. And in fact, the smaller the customer we had, the better their order performance for us in the quarter was. So it just follow the trend that the consumption issue was upmarket and small to mid-sized customers didn't feel it. Samik Chatterjee : Okay. Thank you. Sami Badri : All right. Thank you, Samik. Michelle, next question. Operator : David Vogt with UBS. You may go ahead, sir. David Vogt : Great. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. Scott, maybe this is for you. I just want to unpack maybe one of the comments that you made. And I know you don't guide to orders. But I think in your prepared remarks, you said backlog is back at normal levels at the end of the quarter. So, we do assume that the guide for Q2 and the rest of the year doesn't include backlog conversion into revenue? And then, if that's the case, to your comment about orders accelerating in the second half, I know you don't guide specifically to orders, but you did make a comment that revenue is going be up, I think, sequentially in the third quarter year-over-year and in the fourth quarter sequentially and year-over-year. Doesn't that suggest like a pretty steep order acceleration, not just an acceleration, but significant positive order trajectory in the fourth quarter and the third quarter? I know, it's easy comps. But just some more color there would be helpful. Thanks. Scott Herren : Yes. Yes, David, we did say that. I do. We are expecting sequential improvement in the second half of the year in both Q3 and in Q4. And in both -- and again, we don't guide this, but in both orders and revenue as you'd expect. Backlog is normalized at this point. We knew that would happen in the first half. I think supply chain team did a great job getting those orders in the hands of our customers. We would now need them to implement them, but we've got the orders in the hands of our customers. So we do see sequential increases. And as you said, as you noted from a bookings standpoint, our order standpoint, the second half has easier compare points. Obviously, the reverse is true on revenue and the second half revenue will have very difficult compare points than last year. David Vogt : Great. Thank you. Sami Badri : All right. Thank you, David. Michelle, next question. Operator : Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead. Matt Niknam : Hey, guys, thank you for taking the question. Maybe just to dovetail one follow-up to the prior question, I have just another one on margins. Just on the prior one, is the expectation for a second-half improvement in a one-quarter to two-quarter digestion, does that vary at all across the three different customer sets you outlined? And then just on the margins, 36.6% on op income margins this quarter, I think the guide implies a 400 basis point to 500 basis point dip. Is that due to just the sheer revenue decline sequentially? Or are there other cost items we should consider on either the gross margin or OI margin line? Thanks. Scott Herren : Yes. To your second question, it is just based on how the revenues are flowing through the second half of the year. I think gross margins, we've said will settle in somewhere in this 65% to 66% range. I think at this point, it looks like it will be closer to the higher end of that range for the second part of the year. So that's the way I see the year flowing out. Remind me, Matt, what was the first part of your question. Matt Niknam : Just around the expectation for second-half improvement in orders one quarter to two quarters worth of installation, is that broad across the three customer sets? Or does it vary across service provider, enterprise and federal? Scott Herren : Yes, right. I think, we expect -- I certainly would expect service provider to continue to be difficult through the second-half of the year. Within service provider, we've got both telco and cable, which has one set of market dynamics going on. I think that will be -- continue to be a difficult space. On the other side, we have web scale, and we do see the web scale orders while they've got also inventory to work their way through. We do see line of sight to them beginning to increase their orders again in the second half of the year. So, SP is a bit of a mixed bag, but I think it will continue to have probably the greater impact. Matt Niknam : Thank you. Sami Badri : All right. Thank you, Matt. Michelle, next question. Operator : George Notter with Jefferies. You may go ahead. George Notter : Hi. Thanks a lot, guys. Just continuing on, on that last question. If I look around the space, companies have been dealing with excess inventories for really three quarters now. And I guess, I'm just curious why is this now becoming more evident at Cisco versus a few quarters ago? And then also you mentioned that the issue is spreading more to enterprises. We don't typically think about enterprises is inventorying infrastructure. So I guess, the question for you is, has something changed there or is this more distribution channel inventory? Any insight would be great. Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, George. I think that the reason it's become relevant now is because if -- I mean, we really unloaded our backlog in the last six months. I mean -- and it was billions of dollars more than what we would normally ship to customers during that time period. So they -- I think it's just -- and we know that the cloud providers, as an example, had been buying ahead and they had been doing it for sure to your point. And all along, we have very sequenced purchasing cycles with those players. So we kind of know when they are going to start placing their next orders. I think on the enterprise, we're talking about the top 200 customers, right. These are the big customers who actually -- if they're doing a refresh of their infrastructure, they might order 400, 500 switches, as an example. Or they may be doing a branch rollout. And in some cases, to your point, it could be sitting with them or they could have a partner who's doing the staging, and the partner may be backed up with resources to try to get the staging done. So it varies, but it could be a -- either one of those or a combination of both. Scott Herren : And George, just to put some data to that. And you have this data, but I'll repeat it. Our revenue growth, obviously, the quarter we're announcing now, product revenue growth was 9%. But if you go back to Q4, product revenue growth was 20%. And in Q3, it was 17%. So obviously, we get revenue when we can complete a shipment and get it out the door. It gives you a sense of just how much has been pushed out and as Chuck said in the last two or three quarters. George Notter : Alright. Thank you. Sami Badri : Thank you, George. And then Michelle, we have time for one last question. Operator : Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead. Michael Ng : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I just have two. First, on the AI orders, $1 billion. What's the feedback from the hyperscalers on your improving position with these customers relative to a few years ago? Is it selling in a more disaggregated fashion with Silicon One? Is it a desire for silicon diversification? And then the second question just as a follow-up on the order slowdown. Was that more concentrated in the campus with wireless LAN and wired or data center or both, just within enterprise specifically? Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Michael. On the AI question relative to the cloud players, I think that -- look, I think early on, we regained our footing there because we listened and we showed flexibility with our willingness to disaggregate if they wanted to do so. And we're in -- I can't even remember, but numerous use cases across the large web scale players. And I think we added over 10 new use cases last quarter alone, where we had been designed in. And I think it's -- so I think that the disaggregation and the flexibility and us listening to them and understanding what they wanted was the reason that we got back in. And now the feedback is as long as we're performing, I think they like our products, they like the power savings of Silicon One. It's a massive power -- lower -- massively lower power consumption. I think they do like silicon diversity for sure. And then as you look at the AI infrastructure that's currently primarily being supported via InfiniBand, they just want to move to more of a standard broad-based technology like Ethernet that they can actually have multiple sources. And so we think that's what's driving that now. And now it's just about performing and executing and delivering on what we tell them we're going to do. Scott, do you want to take the second? Scott Herren : Yes. Michael, I think I touched on this earlier in the -- as the question came up. I think the way to think about it is, first of all, if you're trying to generalize the trend more broadly across the industry, it may be a little difficult because we've cleared our backlog, I think, significantly faster than others have. But where we saw a differentiation was less between big data center infrastructure and campus networking and more between networking and wireless. We did see -- because we've shipped an enormous amount of wireless access points out. We did see that take a little bit more of an impact just because it's -- our customers are sitting on more inventory on hand of that, that they're looking to get installed. Michael Ng : Great. Thank you, Chuck. Thank you, Scott. Chuck Robbins : Thank you. Sami Badri : All right. Thank you, Michael, and all right. So we'll go ahead and turn it over to you, Chuck, for some closing remarks. Chuck Robbins : Yes. Thank you, Sami, and welcome again. Listen, we're proud of the team for the performance in Q1. Obviously, a very solid quarter with the exception of this demand issue that we talked about. We'll always try to be transparent with you and share with you exactly what we're seeing. We know what's going on. We're on top of it, and we do feel that it's temporary. At the same time, we're very confident in our opportunities long term. We're confident in the AI opportunity. We're very encouraged by our improving position in security, observability. And we're also very encouraged by the opportunities that will come with the Splunk acquisition. I think many of you know that on Monday night, the waiting period for review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act in the U.S. expired, meaning that we've effectively pass the antitrust review period in the United States. We're excited about that. At our Partner Summit last night -- or last week, the feedback on our portfolio right now was probably as good as it's been in a long time. And I also just want to reiterate our commitment to delivering value to you and our shareholders with the operating leverage, capital allocation and obviously managing our expenses in times when we see challenges like we have right now. So thank you for joining us today, and I'll turn it back over to Sami. Sami Badri : Cisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our fiscal year 2024 second quarter results, will be on Wednesday, February 14, 2024 and at 1 :30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons are made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis. The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter and full year of fiscal 2024. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please feel free to see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Sami, and thank you all for joining us today. We delivered a solid Q2 performance with revenue coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Strong operating leverage across our business drove our margins, which exceeded the high end of our expectations and allowed us to deliver better-than-anticipated earnings per share. In Q2, we once again returned a total of $2.8 billion in value through dividends and share repurchases. We also announced today another increase to Cisco's dividend payout rate, reaffirming our ongoing commitment to returning significant value to our shareholders through consistent capital returns. Overall, our Q2 results continue to advance our strategic business transformation around driving higher levels of software subscriptions and annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, both of which showed performance gains in the quarter. Our pending acquisition of Splunk also further supports our transformation strategy by fueling stronger growth, expanding our portfolio of software-based solutions and generating higher levels of ARR with roughly $4 billion in additional ARR expected upon closing and will make us one of the largest software companies in the world. Before turning to our performance in the quarter, I'd like to start by commenting on the demand environment. First, in terms of the macro environment, we are seeing a greater degree of caution and scrutiny of deals given the high level of uncertainty. As we're hearing this from our customers, it's leading us to be more cautious with our forecast and expectations. Second, as we discussed last quarter and subsequently saw in other technology provider results, customers have been taking time since the start of our fiscal 2024 to deploy the elevated levels of products shipped to them in recent quarters, and this is taking longer than our initial expectations. Third, we also continue to see weak demand with our telco and cable service provider customers. This industry has seen significant pressure and they are adjusting deployment phasing, which is weighing on our business outlook. Given these factors, we are adjusting our expenses and investments to reflect the current environment. That said, for the product categories in which we can measure customer inventory absorption through connections to the cloud, we are seeing steady progress. However, based on conversations with customers, we still believe we are 1 to 2 quarters away from full implementation of their inventory, which, as I mentioned, is longer than we expected. We continue to track Meraki activations, which are moving slightly faster in wireless and slightly slower in switching. Using our Meraki business as a proxy for our wider enterprise networking portfolio, we expect the current implementation of shipped products to be broadly complete by the end of fiscal 2024. Looking at our wireless business as an example, we are encouraged by the number of orders of $1 million or more, which increased approximately 50% sequentially in Q2. This indicates that many wireless customers have finished absorbing what we've shipped to them and are preparing for larger deployments in the coming months. Our team is also partnering closely with customers to assist with this heightened focus on deployments of Cisco equipment on hand, contributing to our services revenue increase year-over-year. It's also worth noting that non-hardware-centric revenue in areas such as security and collaboration increased and our observability offerings grew double digits year-over-year. Finally, despite the near-term challenges, our win rates are stable and on a rolling 4-quarter basis, our market share remained steady in three of our four largest markets. Now moving on to our performance in Q2. As I mentioned earlier, our performance in the quarter was broadly in line with or better than our Q2 expectations. Given the trust our customers place in us and the criticality of our technologies to the outcomes our customers are seeking, I am confident about the foundational strength of our portfolio and our future growth opportunities. With our innovation, we deliver and enable our customers to deploy next-generation applications in a highly secure manner. As part of this, we help facilitate their growth through our products and services so that when our customers adopt new technologies, we grow alongside them. We continue to accelerate our innovation across high-growth areas. Last week at Cisco Live EMEA, we announced new capabilities in networking, furthering our vision for the Cisco networking cloud. We also announced several new capabilities across our security, collaboration and observability portfolios leveraging AI throughout. We also continue to capitalize on the multibillion-dollar AI infrastructure opportunity. This quarter, we announced the next phase in our partnership with Nvidia to offer enterprises simplified, cloud-based and on-prem AI infrastructure. This includes both networking hardware and software to support advanced AI workloads. We are clear beneficiaries of AI adoption, and this partnership further demonstrates the central role we play in AI and the overall technology ecosystem. Our combined solution will be sold through our extensive global channel with professional services and support from key partners who are committed to helping businesses deploy their GPU clusters via Ethernet infrastructure. In web scale, we continue to see momentum with three of the top four customers deploying our hyperscale Ethernet AI fabric, leveraging Cisco-validated designs for AI infrastructure. While there is tremendous opportunity ahead, we are still in the early stages of adoption of AI workloads. In security, we continue to execute against our product roadmap to deliver the industry's most comprehensive unified platform with end-to-end solutions. This quarter, we introduced Cisco Identity Intelligence, an analytics layer that pulls data from identity infrastructure and performs behavior-based assessments to help protect against identity-based attacks which are at the forefront of cyber threats today. AI is also becoming more pervasive across the Cisco Security Cloud. For example, our new AI Assistant and Secure Access lets customers create security access policies using natural language prompts, reducing errors and speeding up policy administration by 70%. Our new security solutions like XDR and Secure Access are ramping quickly after being launched this fall with now over 230 Cisco XDR customers. Over the next 6 months, you can expect more meaningful announcements across the portfolio through our accelerated organic innovation and inorganic investments. In addition, we have now extended our AI-powered ThousandEyes into Cisco Secure Access joining past integrations with AppDynamics, Webex, Catalyst and Meraki platforms. ThousandEyes allows our customers to understand the digital experience of users, applications and things through billions of daily measurements of the Internet and public SaaS, as well as thousands of enterprise customers creating best-in-class digital experiences for users. In observability, we introduced the Cisco Digital Experience Monitoring application, providing deep insights into the performance of browser and mobile applications and efficient resolution of session level issues. Our continued generative AI innovations build upon our existing platform capabilities, further enabling operations teams to focus on what matters most, minimizing tool sprawl, improving overall performance and delivering highly secure digital experiences. Going back to the pending Splunk acquisition, the combination of Splunk's complementary capabilities with ours and AI, security and observability will create an end-to-end data platform to enhance our customers' digital resiliency. We are excited that together, we will bring trusted innovation leadership, an outstanding go-to-market engine and a world-class culture that will help our customers achieve their technology outcomes with innovative products and solutions. I would also like to provide a brief update on timing. While the closing of the acquisition of Splunk remains subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, given the positive progress to date on the required regulatory approvals, we now expect to close the transaction late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of calendar year 2024, which is in our fiscal third quarter. Before I turn it over to Scott, let me summarize three key takeaways. First, we have reset our expectations for the second half of the year given the cautious macro environment, our customers absorbing high levels of inventory and ongoing weakness in Service Provider. Second, you can count on us to take a disciplined approach regardless of the environment. We remain committed to operating leverage, capital allocation and expense management. Lastly, our portfolio continues to get stronger and stronger every day. While we have work in front of us and despite the current environment, we remain confident in our long-term strategy. We are relentlessly focused on our commitment to driving long-term value for our shareholders and industry-leading innovation for our customers. I'll now turn it over to Scott to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook. Scott Herren : Thanks, Chuck. Our Q2 results reflect solid execution again with strong margins and increasing operating leverage. For the quarter, total revenue was at the high end of our guidance range at $12.8 billion, down 6% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion, down 3%, and non-GAAP earnings per share was above the high end of our guidance range at $0.87, down 1%. Looking at our Q2 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $9.2 billion, down 9% and service revenue was $3.6 billion, up 4%. Networking, our largest product category was down 12%. We saw declines across switching, wireless and routed optical networking, driven primarily by weakness in the Enterprise and Service Provider & Cloud markets. Security was up 3% with our Zero Trust offering growing double digits. Collaboration was up 3%, driven by growth in collaboration devices and calling, partially offset by a decline in meetings. Observability was up 16%, driven by growth across the portfolio with continued strength in ThousandEyes network services. As Chuck mentioned, ThousandEyes helps monitor and assure digital experience everywhere, on-premise, Internet and the cloud. We continue to make progress on our transformation to more recurring revenue-based offerings. We saw strong performance in our ARR of $24.7 billion, which increased 6% with product ARR growth of 9%. Total software revenue was flat at $4.2 billion, with software subscription revenue up 5%. 88% of our software revenue was subscription-based. Total subscription revenue increased 6% to $6.4 billion, which now represents 50% of Cisco's total revenue, an increase of 6 percentage points over last year. RPO was $35.7 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Product and service RPO both increased 12%. In total short-term RPO was $17.9 billion, up 6%. Q2 product orders declined 12%, a significant improvement from Q1 as customers continue to work down product shipments from prior quarters. Looking at our geographic segments year-over-year. The Americas was down 10%, EMEA down 8% and APJC was down 27%. In our customer markets, Service Provider & Cloud was down 40%, Enterprise was down 6% and Public Sector was down 5%. Backlog at the end of Q2 has now returned to normal levels. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 66.7%, up 280 basis points year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. Product gross margin was 65.2%, up 310 basis points. The improvement was driven primarily by lower freight and component costs and favorable product mix, partially offset by negative impact on pricing. Service gross margin was 70.5%, up 140 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 33%, up 50 basis points and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Strong non-GAAP gross margin and continued cost management drove the leverage. Further, we are realigning our investments and expenses to reflect the current environment to help maximize long-term value for our shareholders. As part of our announced restructuring plan, we expect to impact approximately 5% of our global workforce with estimated pretax charges of approximately $800 million. Shifting to the balance sheet. We ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $25.7 billion. Consistent with our expectations, operating cash flow was $800 million, driven in large part by the timing of federal tax payments and the higher annual payment of the TCJA transition tax. This quarter, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.3 billion of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have returned $5.7 billion in value to shareholders, we plan to continue our share repurchases at the current quarterly level throughout fiscal 2024. Increasing shareholder returns through greater operating leverage, maintaining a higher level of annual share repurchases and growing our dividend is consistent with our capital allocation strategy. Given the confidence we have in our business today, we announced we are raising our dividend by $0.01 to $0.40 per quarter. This dividend increase demonstrates our commitment to returning a minimum of 50% of free cash flow annually to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength of our ongoing cash flows. To summarize, we executed well with continued strong margins and increased operating leverage as we help our customers complete record deployments and implementations. We continue to progress our business model shift to more recurring revenue. We are strategically investing in innovation to capitalize on our growth opportunities and are committed to delivering long-term shareholder value. With regard to our proposed acquisition of Splunk, we continue to work through regulatory approvals and closing conditions. And as Chuck mentioned, we're optimistic that it will close ahead of what we had originally anticipated. We have not included any impact from the Splunk acquisition in our forward-looking guidance. Turning to our guidance. As previously mentioned, we have reset our expectations for the second half of the year to account for the caution around macro uncertainty, the continued absorption by our customers of record levels of product shipments they received from us and the weakness of our Service Provider market. For Q3, our guidance is as follows, we expect revenue to be in the range of $12.1 billion to $12.3 billion. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 66% to 67%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33.5% to 34.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.84 to $0.86. For fiscal year '24, our guidance is as follows, we expect revenue to be in the range of $51.5 billion to $52.5 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.68 to $3.74. In both our Q3 and full year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. Sami, let's now move into the Q&A. Sami Badri : Thank you, Scott. Before we start the Q&A portion of the call, I would like to remind analysts to ask one question and a single follow-up question. Operator, can we move to the first analyst in the queue. Operator : Thank you, sir. Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead, sir. Amit Daryanani : Yes, good afternoon. I'll ask both my questions upfront. Chuck, when I think about the lower revenue guide for the full year by about 500 basis points versus 90 days ago. Can you just touch on how much of that do you think is the digestion getting extended versus the macro versus the telco weakness? And then how do you sort of think about getting back to a positive revenue cadence organically? And then as a follow-up, I'd love to just understand this Nvidia announcement you folks had. There's a bit of a perception that it's more about servers, less about networking. I would love for you to just flush that out, what that means for Cisco? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Amit, thank you very much. So obviously, with the lower guide, we talked about the feeling that there's some macro uncertainty. We talk to our teams in preparation for this, and they obviously submitted their forecast. And what we really saw was what they previously told us 90 days ago relative to the second half versus what they told us a couple of weeks ago had changed materially, which means customers are pushing things out and putting a little more scrutiny on them. So that's the difference that we've seen. As far as trying to break down what percentage comes from each of those - the three, including the digestion issue, as well as the telco and SP piece. I think it's pretty difficult to do, honestly. However, I will say that we think that the consumption of the elevated inventory levels should be - we should be through that by the end of our fiscal year. We think that SP telcos, the SP telco and cable side of it, we're hopeful that in the '25, they will begin investing again. We originally had anticipated that they would begin to invest in the second half of this year, and we no longer believe that to be true. And I think that - so I think the consumption issue and the SP thing or the consumption issue is temporary through the end of the year. The macro thing is one that we're going to have to wait and see and the SP telco probably similarly. And all of these things led us obviously to reset the second half of the year. On the Nvidia partnership, it is definitely Ethernet. I was in the meeting when we first talked about this with Jensen, and he agreed that we would include our Ethernet technology with their GPUs and creating the stack. There will also be servers as well, and there'll be multiple versions of this over time. So - but it will include our Ethernet technology when they're connecting multiple clusters. Sami Badri : Thank you, Amit. Michelle, we have the next analyst. Operator : Thank you. Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. Maybe you've mentioned Service Provider, but I guess just getting a sense of whether you're seeing more weakness on data center or edge or if it comes to kind of the five investment priorities that you had noted that enterprises had a couple of quarters ago, or any one of those areas still getting prioritized significantly versus not getting prioritized significantly? And then just maybe as a second question, how are you seeing enterprises think about AI and think about where the budgets for AI are coming from? Just any commentary would be helpful there. Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Yes. Thanks, Meta. So I would say that what we do see customers investing in is clearly cybersecurity. We see observability as you saw the 16% growth rate. We even saw collaboration positive this quarter, which was a good sign. They're at various phases of still dealing with this hybrid work situation. We had a very strong quarter with our devices, our video device businesses. We see customers investing in their customer experience through technologies like contact center. And so we see a lot of that. We see customers continuing to invest in their application rearchitecture, which leads to both observability opportunities, as well as the rearchitecture of their networks to deal with the traffic flows that we've been talking about for a couple of years. I think the real issue right now is that we shipped so much networking in our core business that that's where the challenge is that they're just trying to get all that implemented right now. As it relates to the enterprise and how they're thinking about AI, what I would tell you is that over the last 90 days, we began to see the - the pipeline for AI use cases in the enterprise began to emerge. And there's a heavy work going on in financial services. I would say it's early in what they're trying to think through, but we are seeing opportunities arise. And I think that there have been some comments, not enough for me to translate this to a massive trend, but there were some comments from some of our field teams that they see customers holding budget back just to be ready to extend it on AI once they get their strategy fully baked. So that's about what I could tell you at this point. Sami Badri : Thank you, Meta. Michelle, can we go to the next analyst. Operator : Yes, David Vogt with UBS. You may go ahead. David Vogt : Great. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. So maybe I just want to step back for a second, Chuck and maybe for Scott also. If I look at your guide for this year, I mean, we're basically back to fiscal '19 revenue levels. So I'm just trying to think about how your longer-term model works in the context of that 5% to 7% guide that you laid out at the investor briefing a number of years ago as a sort of investor - as sort of customer digest product. Obviously, it would suggest that maybe there's some more share loss going on in the core networking portfolio, given some of the other parts of the business has grown. So I just wanted to kind of try to get a sense for how you're thinking about the portfolio today, given we're kind of back to fiscal '19. And then from a profitability standpoint, obviously, you've done a tremendous job, and I would imagine the cost cutting goes along those lines to keep margins higher. But is there an opportunity to use margin and maybe price going forward to take back some of the share if there's a disruption in the market by a potential strategic transaction in the marketplace today? Thanks. Scott Herren : Yes, David, I'll start and then Chuck, you can chime in on share. The way to think about the 5% to 7%, if you go back to when we gave that metric, you remember, it was in 2021, actually pre all of the supply chain volatility that we've seen. And since then, of course, we've seen the supply chain set in, which caused a spike in product orders and then a subsequent big building up of our backlog as we cleared the backlog, we saw a spike in revenue. And so it's been difficult to look at year-on-year compares as all those dynamics were going on. What we're seeing now is as we've cleared the backlog, and we cleared it very quickly, given the strength of our supply chain team, that bottleneck has just moved downstream. So I don't think you can look at this year's revenue and try to somehow compare it to historical because of all the moving parts underneath the covers. What underpinned that 5% to 7% when we gave it to you was that's the aggregated growth of the TAM of the markets that we play in, right? And so at this point, we still see that as the longer term where we're headed. I think looking at year-on-year growth rates, I don't think you're going to see those growth rates begin to normalize until we work through the inventory that's in the field right now, which is one of the biggest headwinds we've got, right? Then we can get back to regular ordering and then you need to lap that, right? You need to go four quarters out to be able to compare it to a more normalized point. So I think that's the way you need to think about that longer term. But there's no change at this point. We'll update the longer-term model after we finish the acquisition of Splunk and can give you better insight into what we look like as a combined company. Chuck Robbins : And David, on the share loss, I think if you look at the - just look at the last published reports that came out after Q... Scott Herren : Q3, calendar... Chuck Robbins : Calendar Q3, the - in our four largest markets, so if you take campus switching, you take wireless and you take SP routing, we actually gained share. So I don't know where the share loss thesis is coming from. When you look at data center switching, you will see it show up as a share loss. But to be - we have to understand that one of our major competitors there reports their web scale sales into data center switching, and we report our web scale sales into SP routing. So those turn into sort of apples and oranges categories. But the others, based on the last reports that were put out, we actually have gained share if you look at a rolling four quarter even over the last 3 years. Sami Badri : Thank you, David. Michelle, next analyst. Operator : Thank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may go ahead, sir. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I've got an easy one and a little bit harder one. I'll start with the easy one and ask the other. It just looks like your order trajectory is getting somewhat better. So the orders this quarter down 12%, not too bad. And I know you don't forecast orders, but maybe if you can talk about when you expect orders could turn positive again, given the comparison and the trend. The other question I wanted to see if you could discuss how you envision the AI clusters in terms of will the web-scale operators choose multiple vendors in a single cluster or will they designate maybe different data centers to different suppliers? Or will they mix and match, how do you see the split playing out, particularly in the hyperscale opportunity? And I really mean this more longer term, '25, '26, not currently when we're dominated by InfiniBand, but when Ethernet starts taking more share. Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Yes. Thanks, Simon. So on the order trajectory, I think what - we clearly don't guide bookings. But what I would tell you is that even as our teams modified their second half outlook, the second half will still be more favorable than the first half. So your assessment of sort of the trajectory, I think, is valid, and I'll leave it at that. On the AI clusters, I think it's a good question because what you'll hear is us and competitors talking about a number of web scale players that are using our technology underneath GPUs, our Ethernet technology and our GPUs. And so I think it's important to remember, they always tend to have a dual vendor strategy. They always want two sources, and so we're both actually - the two of us are actually playing in this space today. And I'd say today, they're completely homogeneous clusters. And I think it's too early to tell whether there will be some benefit over time for them to mix those. My sense is, unless there's something that changes significantly or there's some sort of technology reason for GPUs to be mixed, which I can't speak to at this point. I don't think the underlying network will be mixed. I just don't think there's any benefit for them to do that. Sami Badri : Thank you, Simon. Michele, next question. Operator : Thank you. Tal Liani with Bank of America. You may go ahead. Tal Liani : Hi. I have two questions. The first one is security. The market is great. And we met 2 years ago and 3 years ago when you spoke about new strategy and going to market, but it's still only growing 3%. What is happening there? And what can you do to fix security and benefit from this market growth? And then maybe I'll ask my follow-up. Chuck Robbins : Okay. Thanks, Tal. So I think over the last few quarters, I've been pretty consistent that we thought the second half of this fiscal year, we would start to see an acceleration of security. And I can give you some highlights where we are seeing some of that - some green shoots early. Some of the new innovation like XDR and Secure Access, Multicloud Defense suites are - we're seeing good pipeline build with those technologies. XDR, we now have - we announced that in April last year, we shipped in August. And we have 230 customers, 230-plus customers on the platform today. And the important thing to remember is that it's a big platform play. And we actually typically see that as a 6 to 9-month sales cycle. So to have 230 customers already, I think, is a statement on the value that our customers are seeing. That's going to be a real important integration point with Splunk, by the way. So that we see, we see - we feel good about the pipeline. From a demand perspective, just to give you some insight, the Americas, the demand was almost double digits this past quarter, which is the highest we've seen in a while. So I think we're seeing a lot of good indicators. And if you just watch over the next 6 to 9 months, you're going to see more and more innovation that comes out. And I think you'll begin to believe and see the results around that same time frame. Sami Badri : Thank you, Tal. And we'll get to your other question at some point after the call. Michelle, can we move to the next speaker. Operator : Thank you. Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead, sir. Samik Chatterjee : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Chuck, I'm going to - for my first question, I ask you to go back to sort of the drivers of demand that you're seeing here. We walked away from the call last time, sensing a sense of optimism about a sharp rebound when you see the inventory digestion complete. But I guess what I'm hearing from you today is even as that inventory digestion ends in fiscal '24, you're seeing a bit more of a macro impact on your customer demand? And are your expectations still sort of intact in terms of thinking about a more sharp rebound as you go into fiscal '25, if you can share what you're seeing from customers there. And for my follow-up, the Nvidia partnership, how should we think about the impact of that on your AI order [ph] target of $1 billion ? Or is it really most of that partnership that realizes beyond that sort of target window, target time frame? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Thanks. I would say on the thing that's changed from last quarter is that we do just see a little more caution with our customers. I don't want to over-rotate and say that it's a massive shift, but we definitely saw more caution. We talked with our sales leaders ahead of the call, and they indicated - we asked them point blank, was there more caution or the same caution from the prior quarter, and we heard more, a little bit more. And then we saw the push out of the forecast. So that just tells us that there is a little bit more in the system. So therefore, I think we need a couple of quarters to see it play out before we can declare what's going to happen in fiscal '25. On the Nvidia discussion, a couple of comments. We talked about the $1 billion of orders, which I know someone is going to ask me about at some point. And what I would say is that in the last 90 days, our pipeline of AI opportunities continue to grow. The pipeline is now almost three times that particular number that we gave last time, which were more orders that we see in '25. The total pipeline is now about three times that, roughly three times that. And I would say that virtually none of that is anything associated with the Nvidia partnership yet. It's all independent of that. Sami Badri : Thank you, Samik. Michelle, next question. Operator : Thank you. Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. You may go ahead. Ben Reitzes : Hey, thanks for the question, guys. Hey, Chuck. Hey, Scott. I wanted to ask about the HP, Juniper deal. Are you seeing any uncertainty in the market near term? And how do you think that helps you long term? And if you - Chuck, if you don't mind, just with regard to that last AI comment, your - one of your competitors, obviously, is expecting quite a big pickup next year, next calendar year. Do you feel like that AI $3 billion in pipeline or so kicks in next year, next calendar year? Or what's your timing on that? Thanks so much. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Ben. So I would say on the HP, Juniper deal, the one area where they have meaningful overlap is in wireless. And I don't know if there's any connection to the fact that we had a 50% increase in $1 million-plus wireless deal sequentially. So it's hard to say. But I mean there is a lot of noise in the system or in the industry about what they do there, but I can't say specifically that any customers have talked to me about it, to be honest. So I think we're - I think it's a little early for them to - for the customers to be expressing that concern. They may be asking them directly, but they're not talking to us. On the timing, yes, I think we said fiscal '25, which starts in August of this year. And I think you probably should assume most of that is probably in the second half, I would guess, but we'll see how things play out. I think customers are going to move as fast as they possibly can, but we're still in the early strategy and planning stages right now on most of it. The pipeline stuff are well-defined use cases that are already in place with certain customers, and we're actually just working through the opportunities. Scott Herren : Yeah. But, Ben, our expectation is the majority of that $1 billion in orders will turn into revenue in our fiscal '25, just to be clear. Sami Badri : Thank you, Ben. Michelle, next question. Operator : Thank you. Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead, sir. Matt Niknam : Hey, thanks so much. And I'll keep it to one and one follow-up. So main question, just around inventory digestion. Is that dynamic primarily affecting enterprise and commercial customers? And can you talk a little bit about the visibility you've got towards this actually resolving itself by fiscal year-end? And then a follow-up just on gross margins. You were fairly stable sequentially, and I think the guide implies more of the same. So I'm just wondering, are we now largely past a lot of the supply chain dynamics or headwinds? Or has anything changed on the supply chain front? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Yes. So I'll take the first, and then Scott can take the second. On the inventory digestion issue, I think it's - I would say it's largely an Enterprise and a Service Provider issue and particularly the cloud providers, we think they've got probably in excess of 20-plus weeks of inventory that they're working through right now as they built up when the lead times were so long. We have a lot of our Enterprise products that are tethered to the cloud for management perspectives. And so we see the lag between when we ship it to the customer and when they connected. I gave the Meraki example in my prepared remarks. And so we do have visibility, and we can actually see on some aspects of the portfolio, how the time frame between shipments and connectivity is shrinking, and it's not shrinking as fast as we thought it would, which leads us to believe this is going to extend through the end of '24, so that's where we are. Scott, gross margins? Scott Herren : Yes. What you saw in the quarter is, of course, gross margins continue to show a year-on-year improving trend, roughly flat, as you said, sequentially. There's a couple of dynamics. But to your question on where does this settle in? I think it settles in the range we're in right now in the 66% to 67% range through the end of the year. There's both the things that are happening from a freight and delivery standpoint, freight costs with what's happening in the Red Sea have gone up slightly, and we continue to see a little bit of component pressure, although in the commodity sections, we're seeing some benefit there. The scale of the services ramp up as you - obviously, services revenue trails the product revenue. We had those three really strong quarters of product revenue growth. We're seeing the tail of that now in our services revenue growth. And since a lot of the cost underneath our services are fixed, you get better leverage when that happens. So I think when you add all those together, we should settle in, in the 66% to 67% range. And the majority of, if not all of the supply chain constraints that we felt are behind us at this point. Sami Badri : Thank you, Matt. Michelle, next question. Operator : Thank you. Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead, sir. Michael Ng : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question, Chuck and Scott. I just have two. First, just on the revenue guidance, I think based on the midpoint of it, the implied fiscal 4Q revenue guidance only implies about plus 1% quarter-on-quarter. Given that we're back to a normal backlog, what's preventing that from going back to a more normal level of seasonality? And then as a follow-up to Amit's question earlier on the Nvidia AI deal. I just wanted to clarify. I understand that it's Ethernet, but will it be both Nvidia's, Spectrum-X, as well as Cisco's Ethernet? And how will that be sold together, if that's the correct assumption? Thank you. Scott Herren : Michael, on the midpoint of the revenue guide, the math would lead you to what you just said. I think no one ever wants to have to reset guidance, much less have to do it twice. As Chuck just said, as we look at all the various factors coming in from the field, we see caution. And I think you should expect that there's caution in our guide at this point. Chuck Robbins : On the Nvidia front, I think, look, one of the key benefits that they see is leveraging our enterprise go to market, and our global ecosystem and partner community. And therefore, when these solutions are flowing through our channels and our sales teams and our partners, it will be Cisco Ethernet. Sami Badri : Thank you, Michael. Michelle, next question. Operator : Thank you. George Notter with Jefferies. You may go ahead, sir. George Notter : Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I guess I'm just curious about - are there any mechanisms or activities you guys are using to help accelerate the clearance of inventory from the channel? Any price discounting, any rebating stock rotation, how are you taking an active approach here? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : I'll comment - I'll make one quick comment. I think I said this in my prepared remarks as well. We've deployed a lot of transaction services for some of our larger customers just to help them do that. And I know that our sales teams were talking this week, Scott, maybe you remember or you have some more detail on looking at some partner incentives to help? Scott Herren : Yes. We absolutely are working with the field on that. In a lot of cases, it boils down to a lack of the skilled resources required at both - sometimes at our partner level, sometimes at the customer level to get that done. There's only so much you can do to accelerate it. We have put in place incentives to make that accelerate. To your other point on cancellations or stock rotation, we're seeing those continuing to be well below where they were pre-pandemic. So we're not seeing any of that - any pressure on that front. Sami Badri : Thank you, George. Michelle, next question. Operator : Thank you. Woo Jin Ho with Bloomberg Intelligence. You may go ahead. Woo Jin Ho : Great. Thank you for taking my question. Given that most of the weakness is going to be on the networking side, could you just talk a little bit more about the future software subscription renewal rates. You did a good job this quarter with software subscriptions going up 5%, but given that networking is poised to be down, curious where that's heading going forward. Chuck Robbins : Yes. I think - thanks for the question, Woo Jin. I think the way to think about it is, we put a - as you can imagine, when you built up the level of annualized recurring revenue that we have, we've put a huge amount of focus on both customer success and driving adoption and then turning that adoption into renewals. We've invested fairly heavily in that space over the last couple of years, and we're seeing renewal rates respond accordingly. When you look at where we're more software-heavy outside of networking, but in both security and collab, as you saw, we reported growth - revenue growth in both of those categories. Observability is almost exclusively software, and we posted 16% revenue growth in observability. So we are seeing that actually trend in the right direction. Sami Badri : Thank you. Woo Jin. Michelle, next question. Operator : Thank you. Tim Long with Barclays. You may go ahead, sir. Tim Long : Thank you. Yes, one question, one follow-up. So first, maybe, Chuck, can you talk a little bit, excuse me, about the kind of margin growth trade-off with the headcount reduction, obviously, protect the margin here, but how do you think about that trade-off given the challenging growth we've seen? And then just on a follow-up with all of the AI comments, Chuck, could you just remind us kind of where we are with - from a product standpoint, are you seeing more traction for Silicon One or software or the full system products? If you could just give us a little color on kind of where you're seeing that pipeline growing? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Yes. Thanks, Tim. So on the margin growth trade-off, we're always considering that. And we're very disciplined, though. And we think that gross margins are clearly a reflection of the value that your customers see and your technology and what you deliver. And if you look at a lot of our competitors, and you look at some of the market share, I mean, some of the gross margins that they have, that tells you that they're viewed more as a commodity. And I think that our customers see real value in what we deliver to them. So while we always look at margins versus growth, we also are - we're just disciplined across both. On the AI front, Silicon One is a big play, clearly. We've delivered next-generation silicon into several of the cloud providers right now. We've got the Ethernet running in three of the four big ones, and we'll use the same silicon in the enterprise data center over time. We've got GPUs in our UCS platforms. And so it's evolving, but we have - I tell our teams unlike the original cloud transition that we talked on this call several times about how we were not prepared for the infrastructure play in the cloud world. I think we are absolutely ready and well equipped to succeed in this transition to AI. It will be a tailwind for us as we get into it over time. Sami Badri : Thank you, Tim. Michelle, next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I'll speak to one, just building on that last question. I know over periods of time, you've talked a little bit about how large your webscale business is. Can you just remind us again the presence you have in some of the webscale opportunities, either from a size and maybe ex the AI discussion, what kind of growth rates you're seeing, particularly with those webscale customers right now? Chuck Robbins : So our team measures what their use cases or franchises or however you want to think about it, there are specific areas within the infrastructure that we identify for each of the webscale players. And Scott, keep me honest, I want to say we're designed into '16 or... A -: 21. Chuck Robbins : 21 of those. And so that's how I would think about it. I don't think that right now, if you looked at the growth numbers, they wouldn't be reflective of what's going on because they're just digesting inventory right now. So they're not in a position where they need to order a lot because lead times have normalized so much. So I don't think that's - it's not even relevant. I think understanding those 21 use cases. And as I said earlier, they want dual source, and they want dual source all the way down to the silicon level. In the traditional days with carriers, they wanted two vendors who would provide two different integrated systems. In this case, that may be the case with cloud, but they also look at silicon, they look at components. They're very deep on wanting to make sure that they have resiliency and optionality. Scott Herren : Aaron, the only thing I'd add is - and we said it earlier, there's no question that over time, given the way we're positioned, both from a complete box, a white box and a silicon standpoint, there's no question that AI is a tailwind for us longer term. Sami Badri : Thank you, Aaron. And Michelle, we have time for one last question. Operator : Thank you, sir. James Fish with Piper Sandler. You may go ahead, sir. James Fish : Hey, guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. Scott, based on a couple of comments you made around gross margins. Just wondering, with supply chain starting to go the other way and supply more readily available, could we see the price increases enacted in the past now have to be given back? And any sense to how should we think about the annualized cost savings on these reductions, understanding there are people here and difficulty and what areas you guys expect to kind of reduce down and if some of those reductions are filled elsewhere in terms of like a net basis on headcount? Thanks, guys. Scott Herren : Yes. On the price declines, you got to remember, go back to why we put the price increases in to begin with. And that was really to offset the higher cost that we were seeing from many of our suppliers as everyone was dealing with constraints and supply demand is pretty straightforward. What we haven't seen in the wake of this, some of the commodities, the prices have come down, memory is a good example. But we haven't seen broadly is cost decreases coming in from our providers at this point. And so with that - and you see that reflected in our gross margins, which have returned to a more normal range, but are still sitting in that 66% to 67% range. So I'm not anticipating at this point, price declines pending significant cost declines coming into us. On the cost savings, you can see where we are year-to-date. We've got - if you just look at operating expenses for a minute, year-to-date, operating expenses are modestly up. And after working our way through the restructuring that we discussed today, for the full year, we think they'll be modestly down. So I think that's probably the right way to think about it as you're looking to build your model. Sami Badri : Thank you, Jim. Cisco's next quarterly conference call, which will affect our fiscal year '24 third quarter results will be on Wednesday, May 15, 2024, at 1 :30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to Cisco's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Sami Badri, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Sami Badri : Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's third quarter fiscal year '24 conference call. This is Sami Badri, Cisco's Head of Investor Relations, and I am joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO, and Scott Herren, our CFO. And given our recently closed acquisition of Splunk, we are also joined by Gary Steele, the former CEO of Splunk, which is now a Cisco company. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2024. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Sami, and thank you all for joining us today. We delivered a solid performance in Q3 with organic revenue coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Strong operating leverage across our business drove gross margins to exceed the high end of our expectations, resulting in better-than-anticipated earnings per share performance. We once again delivered good growth in annualized recurring revenue, remaining performance obligations and subscription revenue. We have transformed our business model with revenue from subscriptions now accounting for more than half of our total revenue even before the addition of Splunk. With the success of our transformation, we are well positioned to drive long-term growth powered by innovation across the organization. I want to thank the entire Cisco team as it is through their dedicated efforts that our research and development engine has never been stronger across networking and silicon, observability, security, collaboration, and AI. The strength of our core business continues to produce strong cash flows, reinforcing our ongoing commitment to delivering consistent capital returns. In Q3, we returned $2.9 billion in value to our shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends in the quarter with a total of $8.5 billion in value returned year-to-date. Q3 was significant for us in two important ways. First, I couldn't be more excited about the successful close of our Splunk acquisition, Cisco's largest ever. Our acquisition of Splunk was completed midway through our Q3 on March 18, earlier than initially anticipated. Splunk significantly expands our portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing over $4 billion in annualized recurring revenue and adds to our position as one of the largest software companies in the world. We are thrilled to welcome the Splunk team to Cisco and are very excited about what we can deliver for our customers as we integrate our complementary security and observability capabilities. Our unified platform will revolutionize how customers connect and protect their organizations using data in new ways to enhance their entire digital footprint. Second, we introduced Cisco Hypershield, our most significant new security innovation with a groundbreaking AI-powered approach to highly distributed security, a first-of-its-kind. Combining security and networking in a way only Cisco can, Hypershield is built in the very fabric of the network, bringing the power of hyperscaler security and connectivity to the enterprise. I will talk more about these developments and our innovation momentum in a few moments. But now, I'd like to turn to our performance in Q3 and what we're seeing in terms of customer demand. The breadth of our portfolio, together with our many touch points with partners and customers around the world, provides us with differentiated insight into what's happening in our customer base. Based on activations to the cloud, which we track as well as conversations with our customers and partners, we believe that the products customers have on hand are being steadily deployed in line with the expectations we laid out last quarter, meaning we currently expect customers to complete the installation of the majority of their inventory by the end of our fiscal year in July. At a time where customers are ruthlessly prioritizing their IT investments, we saw product order growth in two of our largest product portfolios, data center switching and campus switching, as well as product order growth in our security and collaboration product categories. Overall, product orders were up 4%, and excluding Splunk, product orders were flat year-on-year. In our customer markets, public sector was strong in EMEA and APJC, but continuing resolution discussions in the U.S. temporarily impacted public sector performance in the Americas. We believe this has since cleared with the subsequent signing of the most recent U.S. Federal Government funding legislation. While our telco and cable customer demand remain muted worldwide, we are encouraged to see early signs of stabilization and improved performance in Webscale in terms of pipeline and orders. Overall, our win rates are stable, and we saw increased strength as we move through the quarter. This reflects our competitive strength and successful execution and gives us confidence in the long term. We also know that the value of our portfolio is greater than ever as evidenced by recent sell-side research IT spending surveys, which show that Cisco is expected to be the only net share gainer within large network budgets over the next 12 months. Now, let's look at our performance in Q3 in more detail. We saw revenue growth in security and double-digit growth in observability year-over-year, excluding Splunk as customers look to enhance their digital resilience with Cisco's technologies. In the past year, we've accelerated our pace of innovation in security and I'm proud of what our teams have achieved. As I mentioned earlier, last month, we introduced Cisco Hypershield, the first truly distributed AI-native cybersecurity solution, which will be built into our networking fabric. This new innovation leverages the recently closed Isovalent acquisition to facilitate deployment in software and the first shipment is scheduled for August this year. This launch furthers our vision for the Cisco Security Cloud, which is expected to deliver the industry's most comprehensive unified platform with end-to-end solutions, making it easier for our customers to protect against the threats of today and tomorrow. Our newest available security solutions, XDR and Secure Access continue to ramp quickly with strong customer feedback. Just last week at RSA, we also announced the integration of Cisco XDR with Splunk Enterprise Security, which will give our customers even more value and insights. The closing of the Splunk acquisition in Q3 will also enable us to begin driving revenue synergies in our security and observability markets. Upon closing the deal, we identified 5,000 existing Cisco customers who have the potential to become meaningful Splunk customers and our sales teams are already making those connections. We also see significant opportunities for revenue synergies by leveraging Cisco's robust partner and customer ecosystem in markets where Splunk had limited or no presence. Earlier this week, Splunk was ranked as the leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for security incident and event management, which is a testament to the strength of the offering and the continued business momentum that Splunk has delivered. We are working on rapid integration, investing in both product integration and go-to-market resources, starting with aligning our Cisco and Splunk sales forces and accelerating channel enablement processes for cross-selling and upselling our combined solutions. We also continue to capitalize on the multi-billion-dollar AI infrastructure opportunity. In Webscale, we continue to see momentum with three of the top-four hyperscalers deploying our Ethernet AI fabric, leveraging Cisco-validated designs for AI infrastructure. In the past two quarters, Cisco has been granted additional design awards based on our 51.2 terabit G200 Silicon One ASIC. We expect these awards to yield orders in fiscal year '25, reinforcing our confidence in our line of sight to $1 billion of AI product orders in fiscal '25. Additionally, for those leading-edge enterprise customers who seek to be the early adopters of AI, our partnership with NVIDIA will offer easy-to-deploy cloud-based and on-prem networking solutions for AI inferencing. We believe we are well-positioned to be the key beneficiary of AI enterprise application proliferation with the breadth of our portfolio and the vast amounts of data we see. Before I turn it over to Scott, I'd like to share one more update. Earlier today, we announced that Jeff Sharritts, our Chief Customer and Partner Officer, is departing Cisco and that Gary Steele, Splunk's former CEO, has been named Cisco's new President of Go-to-Market. Gary is well known for his operational excellence, and in this new role, he will work closely with me to set and execute against our strategic plans and goals for the company. He will continue to lead the Splunk team through the integration process to ensure a seamless integration into Cisco. Gary's operational mindset, combined with his intense focus on simplicity and proven ability to drive growth, position him well in this role and I look forward to working closely with him in this new capacity. I'd also like to take a moment to thank Jeff for all that he's helped Cisco achieve, which is quite a long list of accomplishments in his 24 years here. Moving back to Q3, let me briefly summarize. While our core product portfolio is trending toward normalization as we continue to see customer deployments of shipped equipment progress, we are pleased that our security and observability portfolios have continued to grow and are significantly enhanced by the acquisitions of Splunk and Isovalent. As our customers adopt and deploy AI, they need the infrastructure to power it, the data to develop it and the security to protect it. And we believe only Cisco can deliver and integrate all three. With our unified platform approach, vast global partner ecosystem and ability to support hybrid and multi-cloud environments, we will deliver innovation at an unprecedented pace and scale to organizations around the globe. I'll now turn it over to Scott to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook. Scott Herren : Thanks, Chuck. Our Q3 results reflect solid execution with strong margins and a stabilization of orders. Both including and excluding Splunk, our revenue, gross margin, and non-GAAP earnings per share were at or above the high end of our Q3 guidance range. Total revenue was $12.7 billion, down 13% year-over-year. Splunk contributed $413 million in revenue in the partial quarter post-close. Non-GAAP net income was $3.6 billion, down 14%. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.88, down 12%. The interest cost of financing with Splunk acquisition slightly more than offset the positive operating impact of Splunk. The net effect was a negative impact of $0.1 on non-GAAP earnings per share. Looking at our Q3 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $9 billion, down 19% and service revenue was $3.7 billion, up 6%. Networking, our largest product category, was down 27%. We saw declines across almost all geographic segments due to the continued implementation of inventory by our customers. Bear in mind that our Q3 2023 networking revenues benefited from significant shipments of excess backlog. Security was up 36%, including the benefit received from the Splunk acquisition. Excluding Splunk, security grew 3%, driven by growth in SASE and double-digit growth in our Zero Trust offering. Collaboration was flat, driven by growth in our cloud calling and contact center offerings, offset by declines in meetings and devices. And observability was up 27%, driven by growth in ThousandEyes Network Services and the benefit from the Splunk acquisition. Excluding Splunk, observability grew 14% for the quarter. As Chuck said, we have successfully transformed our business model. ARR ended the quarter at $29.2 billion, which increased 22% due to continued strong performance and contribution from Splunk. These factors also drove our product ARR growth of 44%. Without Splunk, ARR was $25 billion, up 5% and product ARR was up 9%. Total subscription revenue increased 12% to $6.9 billion, which now represents 54% of Cisco's total revenue. Without Splunk, total subscription revenue was up 5%, representing 53% of Cisco's total revenue. Total software revenue was up 5% at $4.5 billion, with software subscription revenue up 17%. Without Splunk, total software revenue was down 4% and software subscription revenue was up 6%. 91% of our total software revenue was subscription-based. Total RPO was $38.8 billion, up 21% due to both strong performance and the Splunk acquisition. Product RPO grew 29%. Total short-term RPO was $20.1 billion, up 19%. Without Splunk, RPO was $35.3 billion, up 10% with product RPO also growing at 10%. Q3 product orders were up 4%. Excluding Splunk, product orders were flat year-over-year. We see customer product implementations progressing in line with our expectations and we expect these deployments to be largely complete by the end of our current fiscal year. Looking at our geographic segments year-over-year, the Americas was up 6%, EMEA was up 4%, and APJC was down 1%. In our customer markets, service provider and cloud was up 10%, the public sector was up 6% and enterprise was up 2%. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 68.3%, up 310 basis points year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. Product gross margin was 66.9%, up 240 basis points, of which Splunk contributed 70 basis points. The remaining improvement was driven primarily by a favorable product mix and lower freight and other costs. Service gross margin was 71.6%, up 430 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 34.2%, up 30 basis points, driven by our continued commitment to disciplined spend management. Operating cash flow was $4 billion, down 24%. Shifting to the balance sheet. We ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $18.8 billion. Uses of cash during the quarter included a net outflow of $27.4 billion related to our acquisition of Splunk and in line with our capital allocation strategy, we returned $2.9 billion in value to our shareholders, including $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.3 billion of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we've returned $8.5 billion in capital to our shareholders. To summarize, we successfully completed the acquisition of Splunk, drove strong non-GAAP margins, and increased our operating leverage in the quarter. Turning to our financial guidance that includes our integration of Splunk. For Q4, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $13.4 billion to $13.6 billion. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 66.5% to 67.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to range from 31.5% to 32.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.84 to $0.86. Our Q4 guidance includes $950 million to $1 billion in revenue from Splunk and non-GAAP EPS of negative $0.03 as the interest impact more than offsets the operating benefit. In Q4, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 18%. For fiscal year '24, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $53.6 billion to $53.8 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.69 to $3.71. We're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 19%. Looking beyond Q4 and into our fiscal 2025, in addition to the top-line benefits from the Splunk acquisition, there are a few points to bear in mind as you build your models. First, we expect revenue growth to be in the low-to mid-single-digit range next year. Second is the interest impact from the acquisition, which we expect to be a headwind of approximately $350 million per quarter, including both the foregone interest from cash off the balance sheet and the additional interest payments on debt. Third, we're working to quickly integrate Splunk into our product offerings, go-to-market engine and expect to invest in OpEx in fiscal '25 to drive those revenue synergies. Given these points, we expect fiscal '25 operating margin to be in line with our Q4 guidance. We'll give more formal guidance as we get to the next earnings call, but I want to make sure you have those three thoughts in mind. And as we've stated, we expect the deal to be non-GAAP earnings per share accretive in fiscal '26 and beyond. Sami, let's now move into the Q&A. A - Sami Badri : Thank you, Scott. Before we start the Q&A portion of the call, I'd like to remind analysts to ask one question and a single follow-up question. Operator, can we move to the first analyst in the queue? Operator : Thank you. Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. I'll ask them both at the same time. Chuck, it's really nice to hear about inventory digestion sort of being done and order growth getting back to flat and growing in some of the verticals. Some of your tech -- some of the tech companies, I guess, have talked about a softer macro-environment that's resulting in some positive spending. So, I'd love to understand kind of away from the inventory digestion that this seems like it's happening, what are you seeing from a macro-environment and if that's actually starting to improve as well for you folks? And then if I could just follow up on a different side, the $1 billion of AI orders that you have -- you know that you see -- that you believe you can get in fiscal '25, can you just talk about is this other wins more coming from the Silicon One side or optical or on the switching solution? Just any clue on kind of where do you expect to get these wins would be helpful. Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Thank you, Amit. Appreciate the questions. So from a macro perspective, what I would say is that ironically, we saw the quarter actually slow -- showed slight improvement as we move through the quarter. So the end of the quarter was actually a little stronger than the beginning. So we -- and look, we obviously believe that our customers now are on track with the inventory digestion that we talked about last quarter, so that's positive. But we saw the Americas excluding Splunk was up 2%, so that was a positive sign and Europe was flat. So that was good. And when you see campus switching and data center switching, both positive. And by the way, data center switching was in the mid-teens growth. So customers are investing in these private data centers and collaboration being positive, security being high-single-digits on the order side, it was, you know, but we didn't see any different behavior from our customers during this quarter than we've seen. They still are ruthlessly prioritizing what projects they spend money on, where they spend their IT dollars, but we didn't see any fundamental shift in the macro. On the second question, on the $1 billion of AI, it is largely driven by the Webscale infrastructure. As I said, we had -- we've got three out of four that are running our AI Ethernet fabric and we also had two or three more design wins during the quarter, I believe, in the back-end networks inside these Webscale players. So, it's predominantly that. However, we are beginning to see enterprise pipeline materialize, as I said last quarter. So that's really what it's made up of. And it is both systems as well as optics across those customers. Sami Badri : Thank you, Amit. Operator, can we move to the next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next caller is Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may go ahead, sir. Simon Leopold : Great. Appreciate you taking the question. I wanted to see if you could give us some metrics or some help trying to extrapolate the 5,000-customer opportunity for Splunk. And just give us a better idea of what that could mean from a dollars perspective, if you're able to penetrate it? And my follow-up is really, I'm trying to seek a little bit more clarification on this $1 billion AI pipeline because there's been a lot of debate in the investment community regarding it. So I want to see if we can get some clarification that when we talk about the context of what's in there, it's explicitly in the back-end that there's not some extrapolation to front-end data center applications. So explicitly back-end and I think, Chuck, you are saying that it is mostly switching in the back-end with some optics and some Silicon One. I really would like to clarify this because we're getting a lot of questions. Thank you. Chuck Robbins : All right. Let me answer the second one first, if you don't mind since I just went on that one. It's a $1 billion of orders that we have line of sight to and next fiscal year is what I had said. And on one of the earlier calls, maybe last call, I think I said our pipeline was roughly three times that we see, but we believe we have good visibility to $1 billion in orders in FY '25. That is primarily back-end, and it is a combination of systems that are based on Silicon One, potentially some standalone Silicon One, but mostly systems and then optics as well. And then there's -- we're beginning to see some enterprise use cases, but it's predominantly back-end in the hyperscaler space. On the 5,000 customers, we basically did an analysis of where we have -- and Cisco has super strong relationships and Splunk doesn't have a presence of 5,000 customers and we've now mapped those to the sales teams. And Gary, you want to make a comment on that because you've been involved in that deeply. Gary Steele : Yes. So we're excited about the fact that basically, we've identified these 5,000 customers where Splunk traditionally has had no footprint. And the goal there is to have the Cisco sellers open the door for the Splunk team. There's also a financial incentive or spiff in place to incent the Cisco sellers to support this activity. And that's really -- that's one aspect of where we see tremendous opportunity. And then second to that, obviously, there's a lot of overlap in our customers where the Cisco team may have higher, more strategic relationships where they can extend our footprint, assist in helping extend our footprint within the existing Splunk base and we're already seeing that activity right out of the gate. So we feel like we're off to a very good start and I'm super encouraged by the level of collaboration we've seen so far. Sami Badri : Thank you, Simon. Operator, can we move to the next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next caller is Tal Liani with Bank of America. You may go ahead, sir. Tal Liani : Hi, guys. I'm going to ask my two questions also together. They're linked. You have great motions in security with lots of new products and you have Splunk introduction to the channel and you have also the AI opportunity for Ethernet. Can you give us a sense of timing, meaning how long -- security grew again only 3%, ex-Splunk and how long does it take to get all the benefits that you're talking about in these three main areas or in general, is it something we're going to see early in '25 or later in '25 or '26, if you can give us just a sense of timing of all these initiatives? The second part is related to it. If I remove Splunk from the numbers and you gave us enough data to completely remove Splunk from '24 and I can take consensus for '25, then your core Cisco, meaning your initial growth expectations for '25 is about 5% because we need to remove also the backlog contribution this year. So, Cisco ex backlog contribution should grow 5%. It's higher than before. So the question is, are you comfortable with Cisco growing 5% next year, give or take? And what is the contribution -- what is the main component of this growth. Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Tal, thanks for the question. So on the -- let's go with the first question and I'll say on the organic Cisco Security front, you're right, revenue was up 3%, but as I said, our demand was as high -- as the highest it's been in probably a couple of years and it was high-single-digits. So we're seeing the traction on these new products. They're just ramping, right? They're new, customers are testing, they're implementing. And by the way, a lot of it is ratable. So you don't -- you take the orders and then, you know, like close to 80% of our security portfolio is ratable. So that actually impacts the time for it to transition into revenue. So that's on the security side. But I think on the security and Splunk side, I'll talk about it a little bit. We've -- and then I'll let Gary comment on some of the integration. But we announced our first integration last week at RSA. Our intent is just to continue pushing innovation out. We'll have more announcements at Cisco Live. So I think that you'll continue to see that happen. I've always said on the security front even before Splunk that we had brought in a new team, we've been building new innovation. The team has built five new products and solutions from the ground up over the last 12 months, as you alluded to, just done a phenomenal job. And I had always said that second half of '24, I expected you would see an improvement and then in '25, you'll see it get to where we really need it to be. And I think that still stands. You want to comment on the Cisco, the integration stuff, Gary? Gary Steele : You bet. So, one of the things I'm super excited about is the progress we've made from an integration standpoint. So last week at RSA, for example, we announced the integration between the Cisco XDR solution and Splunk's Enterprise Security solution. So bring -- bringing high telemetry alerts into Splunk Enterprise Security gives a Splunk customer that much more value in terms of threat detection. And this is just the start of the elements of integration that we can deliver that will ultimately drive growth for the security portfolio broadly, but also Splunk. And as we've described earlier, integration strategy really is a strong ground game, meaning we want to move the ball three yards at a time and we're going to demonstrate to the industry that we can continue to innovate at a rapid pace as a combined business. And we feel like we're on a really good track to do that. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Gary. And then on your AI timing question in '25, my suspicion is that that's going to start low at the beginning of the year, and it will ramp as we get through the year. So I'll be thinking more back-half, but we'll have to see how these pilots go. We'll probably know a little more about -- we'll know more in the next 90 days on that. On your second question, first of all, I appreciate the fact that you recognize that several billion of backlog that we cleared last year because this is the last -- this is a -- '25 will be a year where we're still going to have strange comparisons because we're just still coming out of the tail end of this supply chain situation and this whole digestion issue and the inventories, shipments and everything. So '26 over '25 will be the year where you will really hopefully get back to real apples-to-apples year-over-year comparisons. And while I'm not -- we aren't giving a breakdown today of the FY '25 Cisco or Splunk contribution, we'll obviously have an Analyst Day in June and we'll go into more detail there. And Scott, do you have anything to add to that? Or is that good? Scott Herren : No, I think you said it right and Cal, the fact that you've recognized the backlog work off it, it clearly is a headwind on just the core Cisco when you look at year-on-year growth rate into fiscal '25. Bear in mind too, obviously, Q3 was a tough compare. If you remember that we had those three consecutive quarters of revenue growth in the mid-to-upper teens, Q3 of '23 that we're comparing to now, Q4 and then Q1 of this year. And so in addition to doing the year-on-year growth rates the way you're doing it, you need to think of the backlog impact on the year-on-year growth rates in both this quarter, next quarter, and again a tough compare in Q1 of '25. Sami Badri : Thank you, Tal. Operator, can we move to the next question? Operator : Thank you. David Vogt with UBS. You may go ahead, sir. David Vogt : Great. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. So maybe, Scott, I want to follow up on that line of questioning from Tal. Now I recognize that you have that backlog headwind in '24, but if I just kind of run through what Splunk should be doing versus what they contributed this year, it certainly looks like the backlog headwind is going to cause -- of course, is going to be down next year. I know you said you're going to hold off on giving numbers. Is that the right math? And so basically all of the low-single to mid-single-digit growth comes from Splunk. And then from a gross margin perspective, obviously, Splunk is going to be a much bigger part of the business. Can you maybe walk through, you gave us an operating margin framework, but sort of what do you expect from a gross margin perspective, given the strong gross margin profile of Splunk being a bigger part of the business next year versus this year? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Yes. Thanks, David. You remember Q4 -- Q1 of this current fiscal year of fiscal '24 was really the last quarter where we shipped a lot of, I'll call it excess backlog, right? There's always an ambient level of backlog where we had a lot of excess backlog that built up during the supply constraints. So when you think about the growth rate from '24 to '25, clearly Splunk is a positive on that, obviously adding that to it. But you also have to think of this year, fiscal '24 having a non-repeatable bit of excess backlog that was shipped in the first quarter of this year. Remember first quarter this year, we grew in the mid-teens on revenue. So if you net that out and that's the math that Tal was doing to say the core business is actually growing in those mid-single digits in fiscal '25. And where we can walk through, I know there's a lot of moving parts there. David, we can walk through that if you want. On the gross margins, I think the way to think about that, we had some benefit in the quarter. Splunk itself is a benefit, of course. We had some benefits in the quarter on product mix and some cost savings that I don't think are repeatable longer-term. So I talked about the guide for Q4 being gross margins in the 66.5% to 67.5% range for Q4. I think that's the right range as you think about fiscal '25 as well. Sami Badri : Thank you, David. Operator, can we move to the next question? Operator : Thank you. Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. Maybe first question, Chuck, if you could just kind of update where your kind of conversations with customers are around AI, either in kind of desire to invest on-premise or invest in kind of Cisco Security products for preparedness or just impact to budgets? And then maybe second question for Scott. Just as we think about kind of the OpEx investment that you guys noted for Splunk, you know, how should we think of that versus kind of original targets to have Splunk be kind of accretive one year post close? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Meta. I would say the conversations, I think the webscalers is pretty well understood. So I'll talk about the enterprise. And I think most enterprises, there are some that are certainly running pilots that are doing some work today and we actually have had some -- we had a handful of wins in the enterprise space for infrastructure that was supporting AI build-outs, I'd say they're still very, very, very early. We had our Global Customer Advisory Board last week in Canada and I think we had about 60 customers there and they're all still trying to figure out exactly what their use cases are and how the architecture is going to play out. So I would say it's still super early on the enterprise side. Gary Steele : And then-- Chuck Robbins : Sorry, did you want to add something, Gary? Go ahead and start. Gary Steele : And in terms of the way to think about the OpEx comment that I made, you know, we talked, Meta, when we announced the acquisition of Splunk that this is much more driven by revenue synergies than cost synergies. There's no question there will be cost synergies as we work our way through this, but we will spend fiscal '25 -- from this point through fiscal '25, ensuring that we get both the product integration right, the organizational integration right, we have to do channel enablement, we have to train their sales team on Cisco, train the Cisco sales team on Splunk. There's investment that goes along with that integration and fiscal '25 is the year we'll do that. We said in the first year post-acquisition that we would be accretive in cash flow, and we will, that we'll be accretive in gross margin from Splunk and we will and that we'll be accretive in earnings per share in the second year. So that's -- think of that as fiscal '26. I know this closed a little bit early and I think there's this perception that it closed six months early. So those times ought to be accelerated. We thought the acquisition would close around the end of our fourth quarter. It closed around the middle of our third quarter. So round numbers, it was a little more than a quarter early. So I think the way to think about that is EPS accretive in fiscal '26, but still being cash-flow and gross margin-accretive in fiscal '25 as we invest in the integration. Sami Badri : Thank you, Meta. Operator, next question. Operator : Thank you. James Fish with Piper Sandler. You may go ahead. James Fish : Hi, guys. Did want to double-click on Meta's question here because it's a serious ramp on the OpEx side to get really earnings going down again in '25, if my math is right, somewhere around $3.50 a share. Can you elaborate a little bit further as to why it's going to go -- be that much? Do we -- should we be expecting revenue synergies starting in fiscal '25 with that initial kind of low- to mid-single-digit growth rate or is that just going to take too much time, another year or so to really get? And just not to layer on the question here, but is some of the OpEx ramp due to the conversion of stock-based comp of Splunk to cash comp because historically, Splunk and Cisco have had two totally different philosophies on compensation? Chuck Robbins : Yes. Thanks, Jim. On the OpEx ramp, I mean, it's -- I know we haven't -- the Spunk team didn't put out guidance for this fiscal year, but you can look at where their OpEx was headed and layer that into the OpEx that we had. There is some growth year-on-year, there's some investment. It's not -- it's not a substantial ramp-up though in the investment on integration. It's more a question of just pulling the Splunk team together with ours. As I said, there will be some cost synergies that are likely to come more in the second half of the year, but this wasn't a deal that was motivated by cost synergies. It was much more motivated by revenue synergies. I think you will -- what you said, I think is spot on. We will see those revenue synergies begin to ramp in the second part of fiscal '25 as these are not short sales cycles as we get our team ramped up on how to sell Splunk as we get the Splunk team ramped up on how to sell Cisco and as we get our channel fully enabled to sell that. So yes, you're going to see those revenue synergies, but you'll need to think about them more in the second half of the year. Gary Steele : Yes. And I think the revenue synergies that we're focused on really are driven around the 5,000 accounts that we talked about earlier. The sales cycles on those are six to nine months. And so you're not going to see that immediately, but that work is happening. And we're also seeing tremendous collaboration across the organization where sales teams are working together to more broadly penetrate accounts. I think you start to see that in the first half, but it's going to layer in, you're going to see more momentum as we get to the middle part of the year. Sami Badri : Thank you, Jim. Operator, next question. Operator : Thank you. Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead, sir. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have a couple as well if I may. I know you're talking today about the deployments with your customers, enterprise customers being higher than what you're shipping to and that implies you'll take a step-up in terms of revenue and that inventory digestion ends. I was just curious in sort of the order trends. You had mentioned you'll be back to a normal seasonality of orders, maybe more in fiscal '25, but how close are you seeing sort of order trends return on a sequential or quarterly basis to more normalized sort of seasonal trends? Is that pointing you in any direction in terms of whether that gap between deployment and your orders are starting to sort of compress? And for the second one, just on the quick follow-up on the AI order of $1 billion sort of target here. Just trying to understand if you feel like you need one or two more big wins in terms of customers or the land and expand with the existing ones should be good enough to get you to that $1 billion target that you have? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Scott, you want to take the sequential one? Scott Herren : Yes. Well, on the enterprise deployments, we are seeing that progress, Samik. And one of the things that's been encouraging, and we've given you some of the data on this is where we see it moving more quickly. We talked about WiFi and how our wireless business is growing, where the -- if the enterprise deployments of all the product that was pushed out has progressed more quickly, we're seeing demand return. Normal seasonality, if you're talking about year-on-year growth rates is a lot tougher, right? You've got to get to a point where you actually have a normal quarter and which we're headed toward now once we get through this inventory consumption at the end of this quarter and then you have to lap it by a year. To get to a year-on-year compare, that's an apples-to-apples compare. So think of the normal seasonality in terms of year-on-year growth rates beginning much more in fiscal '26. From a sequential standpoint, you'll see that start to happen in the second half of fiscal '25. Samik Chatterjee : Yes. Scott Herren : And then on the AI, the $1 billion -- the $1 billion that we talked about, those are actually identified opportunities that our teams have a high degree of confidence. This is not like -- we didn't set a $1 billion target and tell people to go find deals. There are deals behind $1 billion and there are actual wins that we either have already won or we have a high degree of confidence that we will win. There's certainly execution that has to occur between now and whenever we get it -- when we get them done. We have to get through the pilots. There's a lot of testing that has to take place. There's power consumption testing that goes on. So a lot of that's going on. But based on what we know, this is what our teams believe today. So this is not some aspiration that we have to go find. This is -- these are opportunities that have been identified that our teams feel good about. Sami Badri : Thank you, Samik. Operator, next question. Operator : Thank you. Matt Nicknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead, sir. Matt Nicknam : Hi, guys. Thanks so much. One question, one small follow-up, and I think this has been the theme most of the call. On the main question, actually for Scott, you've got leverage now that sits just under one turn, but the business now has a greater mix of recurring revenue, more visibility that that naturally lends itself to. So I'm just wondering how you think about optimal leverage for the business and uses of excess cash from here. And then just on the follow-up, as we think about low-to mid-singles growth next year, well aware of the backlog and the tougher comp that that creates in fiscal 1Q of next year. Just as we unpack the networking assumptions, are you assuming normal demand and purchasing cadence returns next year once inventories have been digested? Or is there any incremental caution that's embedded there from a macro perspective? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Scott, you want to take the first one? Scott Herren : Yes, I'll talk about cash first, Matt. And yes, we moved obviously with the acquisition of Splunk, and this beta is out there. We raised about $13.5 billion of term debt that's out there, and we actually funded a lot of it with some cash off the balance sheet, but also with commercial paper with the expectation that as rates come down, obviously, commercial paper is a more real-time reflection of those lower rates. So it's a way of saving money on that. Moved to a net-debt position for the first time and certainly in my career, probably in the first time in the -- here at Cisco, probably the first time in the last two decades here at Cisco. The use of cash though, like we talked about Splunk being cash-flow accretive in its very first year, which is highly unusual for a transaction of this size, it will be. And so our capital allocation process is not going to change. And just to reiterate what it is, first and foremost, it's support growth, right behind that. If that's one, 1A is, of course, continuing to support the dividend and you see we've continued to grow the dividend on a year-on-year basis. Return cash to shareholders through share buybacks. That's been at a steady $1.25 billion per quarter for the last now several quarters. We'll continue to do that. And to the extent that we've met those three and there still is excess cash, we'll determine whether it makes sense to take that cash and delever or if it makes more sense to return that to shareholders at that time. Chuck Robbins : And Matt, on the demand normalization, based on what we see today, I think we would expect starting in Q1 and beyond, we should see that normalize. Obviously, with the caveat that there are a lot of hot spots around the world, there are a lot of potential risks out there that are happening. We've got elections all over the world and the most important one perhaps in the United States. So we're certainly going to have to see how all of this plays out. But so far, based on what we see, I think that's a decent assumption for FY '25. Sami Badri : Thank you, Matt. Operator, next question. Operator : Thank you. George Notter with Jefferies. You may go ahead, sir. George Notter : Hi, there. Thanks very much. I guess I wanted to ask about gross margin impacts from the inventory digestion. As we look around the space, we've seen companies use tools like stock rotation or rebates to try to push inventory through the channel. Sometimes that can certainly have an impact on margins. Are you guys seeing any of that in the gross margin results right now? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : No, we're not, George. There's very little inventory that -- in the channel that is something that we continue to own. In other words, when we ship it to the channel, it's sold at that point. There's very little stocking that happens inside our channel. So we're not seeing that benefit. What we are seeing is, of course, we've put in place the price increases to help offset the higher cost that we saw coming through the supply chain constraints and we've lapped those. But there's actually a little bit, you'll see when our Q comes out a little bit of pricing headwind back to the normal what it had been kind of pre-pandemic, but big benefits, of course, with the product mix of Splunk coming in and some one-off things that we benefited from during the quarter. Sami Badri : Thank you, George. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. You may go ahead, sir. Ittai Kidron : Thanks. I had a question for Gary. I guess, off the press, Palo Alto just announced its acquisition of the SIM business from IBM. Exabeam this morning announced the merger with LogRhythm. So it seems like the market you're operating in is moving at a very fast pace at consolidation. Maybe you can talk about the competitive landscape for your business and why should we not assume that pricing pressures are going to significantly rise in this environment as everybody is trying to fight for footprint? Gary Steele : Yes. No, great question. There obviously is a lot of activity in this particular market. One of the things that we feel very good about and Chuck referenced in his prepared remarks earlier is our position in Gartner's Magic Quadrant where we stood out as the leader in the SIM market. We -- so we have a very strong established market position, and our pace of innovation has fundamentally changed over the last couple of years. We've continued to deliver very interesting innovative capability that we think is very high value. So for example, last week at RSA, we announced what we call Splunk Asset and Risk Intelligence. This is a critical capability to help organizations do self-discovery of assets across their environment and then understand the risks associated with those things. Coupled with that, we're now getting the broad benefit of the Cisco Security product line where we can bring in interesting capabilities like the integration with the XDR solution that we also announced. So, we feel like while, yes, it is competitive, we feel like we're incredibly well positioned to continue to drive very important innovation. And we've also taken a very different approach than our competitors and we think broadly about how do you bring together on a single platform the security capabilities that customers want broadly all the way through observability and it's very difficult across the industry to see anybody taking the position that we have and driving value. With respect to pricing, we don't have any fundamental change in our pricing strategy. We're very much focused on driving very good adoption across our customer base and ensuring that they feel like they're getting value every day. And the capabilities that we're offering are hard to match in the industry. So we're not -- we're not shifting gears from a pricing point of view. Sami Badri : Thank you, Ittai. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. You may go ahead, sir. Ben Reitzes : Yes, hi. Thanks for the question. I -- in the spirit of the two, I wanted to ask, if we take, let's say, $1 billion to $2 billion of the hit from inventory in 2025 and from the prior question, I just want to make sure that I heard it right that you -- do you underwrite that the real industry growth is about -- or the real networking growth is in that mid-single-digit range that was mentioned in a prior question. And then if that's the case, I guess this is the second one, then does it mean at your Analyst Day, we'll hear more about how 2026 could be a higher single-digit growth business for Cisco overall? I mean, you're mixing towards Splunk and software and therefore, the math would -- therefore have you guys on a normalized basis after, you know, after the organic growth is very muted in 2025, accelerating by several hundred basis points to the higher single-digits in 2026, if that's true. Be happy to repeat any of this, but hopefully, you were able to follow that. Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Yes. I got it, Ben. And you're asking me now for fiscal '26 guide at the same time. Is that the right takeaway? Just you're thinking about it right. The underlying business, the core business of Cisco net out the benefits of the Splunk acquisition when you look at fiscal '25, but also when you take '24, net out the impact of the excess backlog that we shipped early in fiscal '24, mostly in Q1, a small amount in Q2 as well, and you get to that mid-single-digit growth of the core business that we've had. So, I think you're thinking about that right. We will talk more -- I'm not going to do it on this call, but we will talk more about fiscal '26 and beyond at our Investor Day in June in Vegas. So hopefully, I'll see you there. Sami Badri : Thank you, Ben. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Atif Malik with Citi. You may go ahead, sir. Atif Malik : Hi, thank you for taking my questions. The first one is for Gary. Gary, Splunk has been using AI/ML for the last year and a half with natural language assistant SPL and also event detection and response. Can you big-picture talk about how Cisco data will improve your AI capabilities? Gary Steele : You bet. And so if you look at the history with Splunk, we were very early driving capabilities with machine learning. We launched the MLTK package in 2017 and we've had a quarter of a billion -- excuse me, quarter of a million users on that. So there's been broad adoption. We then extended that when we brought Gen AI into the picture, delivering an SPL assistant, SPL being our proprietary search language, being able to use English to be able to do that. We're also bringing AI directly into the workflows. So think about SOAR as an example and how you can bring AI into the picture to drive better outcomes from a remediation point of view. So, we've been investing across the product line. You're going to hear and see more announcements from us over at Cisco Live as well as at our user conference, which follows Cisco Live. And the benefit that we're getting -- bringing it into Cisco is Cisco has made -- independently been making a whole set of investments. We get to leverage those assets in addition to the richness of data that we get. So where we benefit from Cisco is the broad rich datasets that exist across networking where you -- so think lateral movement, how can we leverage that data to do a better job from a detection point of view? And frankly, the data and insights that we have as a combined entity, I think are second to none in terms of the competitive environment. So we just basically accelerate our AI efforts as part of Cisco and the outcomes we can deliver to be really important. Sami Badri : Thank you, Atif. Michelle, can we move to the last question? Operator : Thank you. Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead, sir. Michael Ng : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just have two as well. First, I think that the guidance this year implies 34% EBIT margins. You commented that fiscal '25 can look like the guide for fiscal 4Q. I mean I think it's about $1 billion of OpEx investments. I was just wondering if you could kind of qualitatively talk about where most of those OpEx investments will lie? And then secondly, last quarter, you characterized the fiscal '24 guidance as conservative, I believe. How would you characterize your initial financial outlook for fiscal '25? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Okay. Michael, thanks for the question. The year-on-year, again, the -- I think what you're struggling with on the fiscal '25 look is expectations if you just added -- straight added where the run rate of Cisco spend to what your expectations are the run rate of the Splunk spend. And I'd say a couple of things to bear in mind. There are some one-time benefits that we had this year in our OpEx for the Core Cisco pre-Splunk acquisition, up frankly in our variable comp plans, which, you know, it has been a tough year and we've come up short of our plan. And so there's some savings in variable comp for this year and fiscal '24, obviously, I don't plan on repeating those in fiscal '25. So there are some -- and then obviously will do a merit increase as well. So there's some small increase that is just kind of the reset of the comp plans and ongoing merit. There is some investment as well in the integration, but it's not even approaching the number that with the quick math that you just did. So that's kind of the way to think about that piece. Now if you look at the guide for next year, kind of how would I say -- what I'd say about the guide for next year is I feel with a lot of the tailwinds that we're seeing right now, so let's just go back. Consumption of all the inventory that we shipped to customers that they were working very hard to get implemented is going in line with our expectation. We think we work our way through that headwind mostly by the end of this quarter, our fourth fiscal quarter. That's a tailwind for next year. Obviously, the AI opportunity that we've talked about and being more second half, but for the full-year -- second half of fiscal '25, but for the full-year, that's a tailwind as we look ahead. Security business is doing what we said it was going to do, right? It's -- we've launched new products there even before the acquisition of Splunk and those products are getting good traction. So that's a tailwind as we look at next year as well. So I think all-in-all, I feel like it's kind of a down-the-middle view of fiscal '25 at this point. It's not a formal guide. I just wanted to give you a sense of what that looked like and we'll do -- we'll give you a better feel for what the longer-term looks like at our Investor Day in June, and then we'll give you a more fulsome guidance when we get to our Q4 call in August. Sami Badri : Thank you, Michael. I now want to hand it over back to Chuck for some closing remarks. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Sami, and thanks to all of you for spending time with us today. I guess I'd say I'm pleased that we're getting to the tail end of this supply chain situation that we've been navigating for the last several years, on track to get this consumption issue behind us as we enter FY '25. I feel good about the overall demand environment we saw in Q4, which supports the fact that our customers are getting this digestion done. As we look to the future, we obviously are optimistic about AI, both from an infrastructure perspective, a data perspective as well as a cybersecurity perspective. Security in general, we believe will continue to improve. And obviously, we're super excited about the Splunk integration and we're committed to deliver for both our customers and for you. I also just want to quickly thank Jeff Sharritts for everything he's done at Cisco and also they were very excited to have Gary taking on the new role here and thank you all for being with us today.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to Cisco's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I would like to introduce Sami Badri, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Sami Badri : This is Sami Badri, Cisco's Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, Chair and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full-GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis. The matters will be -- the matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we'll be providing for the first quarter and full-year fiscal 2025. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Sami, and thank you all for joining us today. We had a strong close to fiscal '24, delivering $13.6 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter, coming in above the high end of our guidance range and $53.8 billion in revenue for the year, coupled with growth in annualized recurring revenue, remaining performance obligations and subscription revenue. We also generated excellent margins boosted by Splunk. Our gross margin of 67.5% was the highest for Cisco in 20 years. We saw steady demand as we closed the year with total product order growth of 14% and growth of 6% excluding Splunk, indicating that the period of inventory digestion by our customers is now largely behind us as we expected. We've also been investing to accelerate critical innovation in key areas with Hypershield and hyperfabric for AI being two outstanding examples. With Splunk now part of Cisco, we believe we have an unmatched capability to unlock the full power of the network with market leading security and observability solutions to deliver even greater value for our customers. We have hit the ground running since we brought the Splunk and Cisco teams together, integrating powerful new customer solutions and beginning to realize early synergies. We know that our biggest competitive differentiator is the power of our full portfolio. This is why earlier today, we announced that we will be bringing our networking, security and collaboration teams together as one organization with Jeetu Patel stepping into an expanded role as Chief Product Officer to lead this group effective immediately. As we complete the full integration of Splunk into Cisco, the Splunk product line will also integrate into this new organization at the right time, bringing our entire product portfolio together as one team. With this new organization, our products will come together in a more integrated way than ever before, positioning us to deliver incredibly powerful outcomes for our customers. Looking ahead, we remain laser focused on growth and consistent execution as we invest to win in AI, cloud and cyber security. To focus on these key priority areas, today, we announced a restructuring plan to allow us to both invest in key growth opportunities as well as drive more efficiency in our business. Now let me share some details on our fourth quarter. We delivered solid performance in Q4 with revenue coming above the high end of our guidance range. Strong operating leverage across our business once again drove non-GAAP margins above the high end of our expectations, resulting in earnings per share also coming in above the high end of our guidance range. We continue to focus on growth in our recurring revenue streams, annualized recurring revenue, remaining performance obligations and subscription revenue all showed solid growth and subscriptions made up 56% of our revenue in the quarter. We also continued to deliver on our commitment to consistent capital returns. In Q4, we returned $3.6 billion in value to our shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends, bringing the total to $12.1 billion in value returned in fiscal '24 or 119% of free cash flow. In terms of customer demand, as I mentioned earlier, we saw steady demand in Q4. This resulted in double-digit product order growth across all geographies and strength in all customer markets despite persistent macro uncertainty. Public sector demand was particularly strong worldwide, driven by federal spending in the U.S. and strength in APJC. Enterprise demand returned to strength in the quarter with solid performance in the Americas and EMEA and even stronger results in APJC. We signed several $100 million plus transactions in the quarter with global enterprises, who are leveraging the breadth of our technology platforms to modernize and automate their network operations and deploy next-generation machine learning and AI applications. I'd like to highlight one of the largest deals we signed in the quarter with a leading global logistics company to advance their efforts in creating the world's most flexible, efficient and intelligent logistics network. Cisco's technology platforms across switching, routing, security and observability will enable our customer to automate network operations with cutting edge innovations like AI-powered robotics and unmatched supply chain visibility. We also signed our first cross portfolio agreement that includes Splunk with a major automotive company in this quarter. AI is transforming every aspect of our customers' IT environments. They need to modernize their infrastructure, harness the full power of AI and data and improve their cybersecurity posture, all while building agility and resiliency across their entire digital footprint. Our customers continue to put their trust in Cisco and we are very well-positioned to be their strategic partner for this era. In-service provider, while our telco and cable customer demand remain muted overall amid continued industry wide pressure, we saw strength in EMEA, driven by investment in AI operations and autonomous networks by service providers to help them monetize their B2B offerings. We are also encouraged to see signs of stabilization and improved performance in webscale in terms of pipeline and demand with double-digit order growth. To provide some incremental color, let me share some data on demand through the lens of our products. Excluding Splunk, security product orders grew double-digits. Collaboration product orders grew double-digits. In our networking portfolio, data center switching also saw double-digit product order growth and enterprise routing, campus switching and wireless orders were also strong with wireless orders greater than $1 million, up more than 20% year-over-year as customers look to enhance their office environments. Across the breadth of our portfolio and global customer base, our product order results demonstrate strengthening demand as our customers focused on their next top priority technology investments. While customers continue to ruthlessly prioritize their investments, our product order results demonstrate that our customers continue to look to Cisco as they focus on their most important technology initiatives. Now turning to look at our product categories in more detail. We saw revenue growth in security and double-digit growth in observability year-over-year, excluding Splunk as customers look to enhance their digital resilience with Cisco's technologies. We've had extremely positive feedback from customers with early access to Hypershield, the first truly distributed AI-native cybersecurity solution built into the fabric of the network. Hypershield furthers our vision for the Cisco Security Cloud, which is expected to deliver the industry's most comprehensive, unified platform with end-to-end solutions, making it easier for our customers to protect against evolving threats and we look forward to making it available this fall. Our new security solutions, XDR and Secure Access are continuing to gain strong traction. We added over 230 new XDR customers in Q4. Early in the quarter, we announced the integration of Cisco XDR with Splunk Enterprise Security. And at the Black Hat Cybersecurity Conference earlier this month, we announced the availability of Talos Incident response for Splunk customers, enabling access to the full suite of proactive and emergency services to help prepare for, respond to and recover from a breach. We also continue to capitalize on the multi-billion dollar AI infrastructure opportunity. We have now crossed $1 billion in AI orders with web scale customers to date with three of the top four hyperscalers deploying our Ethernet AI fabric, leveraging Cisco validated designs for AI infrastructure. We expect an additional $1 billion of AI product orders in fiscal year '25. As I shared at our Investor Day in June, this momentum is being fueled by multiple use cases in production with the hyperscalers, several of which are in AI. In addition, we have multiple design wins with roughly two-third of these in AI. Over and above the web scale AI opportunity, we believe we are well-positioned to be the key beneficiary of AI application proliferation in the enterprise. Our hyperfabric AI cluster solution created with NVIDIA helps our enterprise customers build infrastructure to run generative AI models and inference applications. The on-premise solution will guide users from design to validated deployment to monitoring and assurance when it becomes available later this fiscal year. We are also enhancing our own productivity by using AI in our services and customer experience organization. We have a robust AI and automation framework that touches at least 50% of our service requests. In addition, we are incorporating AI assistance into our products so that our customer and partners have efficient options to access support. Before I hand it over to Scott, I want to take a moment to thank our teams for all their hard work to close out the year and their relentless focus on our customers. In closing, while we're pleased with our performance in a dynamic environment, we know we have to drive strong execution to be successful in the growing markets we serve. We believe this will result in strong growth and profitability as we enter fiscal 2025. I'll now turn it over to Scott to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook. Scott Herren : Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, then cover the full-fiscal year, followed by our guidance. Our Q4 results reflect solid execution with strong margins and strength in orders as customer buying patterns begin to return to normal. For the quarter, total revenue was above the high-end of our guidance range at $13.6 billion, down 10% year-over-year comparing against our strongest quarter ever in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23. Float contributed approximately $960 million in revenue for the quarter, in line with our expectations. Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share was above the high-end of our guidance range at $0.87. The interest impact from financing the Splunk acquisition more than offset the positive operating impact of Splunk. The net effect was a negative impact of $0.04 on non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter. Looking at our Q4 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $9.9 billion, down 15% as we move through the final quarter of customer inventory issues and services revenue was $3.8 billion, up 6%. Networking, our largest product category was down 28% when compared to our Q4 '23 networking revenues, which benefited from near-record shipments of excess backlog. Security was up 81%, including the benefit from Splunk. Excluding Splunk, security grew 6%, driven by competitive wins and growth in SASE and double-digit growth in network security. Collaboration was flat, driven by growth in our cloud calling and CPaaS offerings, offset by declines in meetings and devices. Observability was up 41%, driven by growth in our observability suite, our Splunk observability offering and 1000 hours Network services. Excluding Splunk, observability grew 12% for the quarter. Looking at our recurring metrics, ARR ended the quarter at $29.6 billion, which increased 22% due to continued strong performance and contribution from Splunk. These factors also drove our product ARR growth of 43%. Without Splunk, ARR was $25.3 billion, up 4% and product ARR was up 9%. Total subscription revenue increased 17% to $7.7 billion, which now represents 56% of Cisco's total revenue. Without Splunk, total subscription revenue was up 2%, representing 53% of Cisco's total revenue. Total software revenue was up 15% at $5.3 billion, with software subscription revenue up 25%. 92% of our total software revenue was subscription-based. Without Splunk, software revenue was down 5% due to declines in perpetual license software as we move to more subscription-based software arrangements. Software subscription revenue was up 2%. Total RPO was $41.0 billion, up 18% due to both strong organic performance and the addition of Splunk. Product RPO grew 27%. Total short-term RPO was up 17%. Without Splunk, RPO was $37.5 billion, up 8% with product RPO also grew at 8%. As Chuck said, Q4 product orders were up 14% year-over-year. Excluding Splunk, product orders were up 6% year-over-year, indicating the period of inventory digestion by our customers is now largely behind us. Looking at our product orders across our geographic segments year-over-year, Americas was up 15%, EMEA was up 12% and APJC was up 16%. In our customer markets, public sector was up 20%, enterprise was up 13% and service provider cloud was up 5%. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 67.9%, up 200 basis points year-over-year and exceeding the high-end of our guidance range. Product gross margin was 67.0%, up 150 basis points, largely driven by Splunk and favorable product mix, offset by price. Services gross margin was 70.3%, up 280 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at the high-end of our guidance range at 32.5%. Shifting to the balance sheet We ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $17.9 billion. Operating cash flow was $3.7 billion. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we returned $3.6 billion to shareholders comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $2.0 billion of share repurchases. We took advantage of market conditions to increase our share repurchases during the quarter. Turning to the full-fiscal year. We delivered strong margins and increased our operating leverage. Revenue at $53.8 billion made fiscal '24 Cisco's second strongest year on record as compared to the all-time high revenues of $57 billion in fiscal '23, which benefited from significant shipments of heightened backlog. Splunk contributed approximately $1.4 billion in revenue after the close of the acquisition in March of this year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.73, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range, down 4% year-over-year. Splunk was $0.04 dilutive to full-year earnings, including the impact of financing costs. In terms of our recurring metrics, total software revenue for the full-year was up 9% at $18.4 billion, with the product portion also up 9%. Software subscription revenue was up 15%. 89% of total software revenue was subscription-based. Without Splunk, total software revenue was up 1%. Total subscription revenue was $27.4 billion, an increase of 11%. Without Splunk, total subscription revenue was up 6%. As Chuck mentioned, total non-GAAP gross margin was 67.5%, up 300 basis points and the highest in 20 years. On the bottom line, non-GAAP net income was $15.2 billion. Operating cash flow was $10.9 billion. As a reminder, cash flow was impacted by the timing of large tax payments in fiscal '24 compared to fiscal '23. In the year, we returned $12.1 billion in value to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases. It was comprised of $6.4 billion in quarterly cash dividends and $5.8 billion of share repurchases. We increased our dividend for the 13th consecutive year in fiscal '24, reinforcing our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. To summarize, we executed well in Q4 and the fiscal year. We exited the year with order levels improving as customers largely completed the implementation of record Cisco product shipments. Further, as Chuck mentioned, we are realigning our expenses to better capture the opportunities ahead. As part of our announced restructuring plan, we expect to impact approximately 7% of our global workforce with total estimated pre-tax charges of up to $1 billion. Turning to our financial guidance. For fiscal Q1, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $13.65 billion to $13.85 billion. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 67% to 68%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 32% to 33%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.86 to $0.88. And in Q1, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 19%. For fiscal year '25, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $55 billion to $56.2 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $3.52 to $3.58. And we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 19%. Sami, let's now move into the Q&A. Sami Badri : Thank you, Scott. Before we start the Q&A portion of the call, I would like to remind analysts to ask one question and a single follow-up question. Operator, can we move to the first analyst in the queue? Operator : Thank you. Our first caller is Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks so much. Chuck, I just wanted to maybe start with you in terms of what you're seeing in terms of budget prioritization from customers. Clearly, they're coming out of a digestion period, but just any sense of how they're balancing different enterprise or initiatives, particularly trying to balance AI initiatives? And then maybe second, just for Scott, is the full-risk embedded in the fiscal '25 guidance, just any clarification? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Meta. Yes, I would say if you look across the portfolio, just if I go around the world a little bit on the demand side, from a geographic perspective, it was very balanced at Americas and Europe up 6%, Asia up 8%. This is -- these all these numbers are excluding Splunk that I'm going to talk about real quickly. The segments enterprise was plus 3%, cloud and SP was plus 2% and then public sector was plus 15%. And so we saw a pretty balanced strength there. But across the technology portfolio, it was incredibly balanced. So we saw double-digit growth, as we said in security, double-digit growth in collaboration. And then in the networking space, I think it's important to point out the switching business and the enterprise -- the enterprise switching and the enterprise routing businesses were both up high-single-digits and the wireless business was up double-digits. And again, I think Scott had in his remarks that the number of $1 million transactions in wireless alone was up 20% year-over-year. So we saw super balanced demand across the portfolio. The one thing I would say that we heard for the first time this quarter that we haven't heard before is that customers -- enterprise customers are now actually upgrading their infrastructure in preparation for AI. And in some cases, they're taking some of the dollars that they've set aside for AI to actually spend it on modernizing their infrastructure in order to get ready for that. And you saw that with some of the examples we gave in these platform sales, the large logistics company that we have that actually bought the cross-portfolio solution, the whole platform, Cisco platforms and they're looking to enable AI-powered robotics, AI-powered supply chain visibility, et cetera. So we think we're beginning to see customers actually prepare for AI applications, even though in many cases, they may not know the full range of what they will be deploying, but they know they need to be ready. So that's kind of what we saw. Scott Herren : And Meta, I want to make sure I got your second question right. Did you say it's the full-risk embedded in fiscal '25 guidance? Meta Marshall : Just the layoffs that were announced, just whether that is fully embedded, the savings from the 7% cut are embedded in the fiscal '25 guidance. Scott Herren : Yes, it is. And it's a good place to kind of explain a little bit more detail what that -- what that action is about. It's not about cost saving. So the answer is yes. It's embedded in the guide, but it's much more about finding efficiencies across the company so that we can pivot more resources, much like we did last year into the fastest growth areas within the company, which are pivoting more into AI, pivoting more into cloud and pivoting more into cyber security. So think of it more as reallocating versus being in pursuit of cost savings. But yes, it's all built into the guide. Chuck Robbins : Yes, Meta, I would just add on that one that there -- we actually are shifting hundreds of millions of dollars into AI, into AI networking for cloud, into AI infrastructure, silicon and cyber. So it's a -- it's a meaningful shift, but we feel like the market is moving so quickly we have to do that. Sami Badri : Thank you, Meta. Operator, next question. Operator : Thank you. Tal Liani with BofA Securities. You may go ahead, sir. Tal Liani : Hi, guys. The last question a little bit stole my thunder somewhat, but I want to ask it anyway. On one hand, there is always a correlation between business cycles and restructuring. And here you see a company that is improving on all fronts with orders growing and still you are announcing a major 7% restructuring. Is there anything in the environment that makes you more cautious? Is there anything that drives the timing of this restructuring ahead of what is expected to be a good year? So I'm wondering what can we learn from your view on the environment given the timing of restructuring? And\u2026 Chuck Robbins : Let me -- I'm sorry. Go ahead. Tal Liani : Okay. I'll just ask my second question together. It's a quick one. On security, great performance finally improving. Was there any implication of what we've seen with CrowdStrike? Have you seen any change in purchasing behavior or any different dynamics among customers because of what happened with CrowdStrike? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Thanks , Tal. Let me just make a comment on the restructuring and Scott, you can talk a little bit about it, and then I'll take the security question back. So on the restructuring, the answer to that is no, there's nothing else out there. We had tremendous demand across the portfolio. It was very broad based and it was very consistent. It really is about ensuring in a rapidly moving markets that we serve that we're able to shift resources into the most important areas. So that's really it. Scott, anything to add? Scott Herren : Just -- Tal, this is just a continuation of what you've seen us do. And we talked at Investor Day about having already pivoted on the R&D front, little more than 50% of our R&D spend into those three areas, into AI, cloud and cyber security. Obviously, networking continues to be incredibly important to us and we'll continue to support that space as well. But it's looking for efficiencies as we -- as we look across the company really in every way so that we can take those resources and allocate them into the fastest growing spaces. I think it's -- think of it as more of just the financial discipline that you've always seen from us. I mean, if you just look at the year we just closed, obviously, it was a challenging year on the top line for revenue and yet we reported the highest operating margin in the history of the company. So this is just more of the financial discipline that I think you've noticed for. Chuck Robbins : And then on the security question, yes, Tal, if you think back to -- go back about a year, what I had said, I felt like what happened is that we would start seeing improvement in the second half of fiscal '24. We were high-single-digits in Q3, we were double-digits in Q4, and I said we should see the real momentum kick in '25. And I think that's what we're feeling the beginning of that. As it relates specifically to CrowdStrike, it's hard for me to say, I will tell you that we added 230 more XDR customers, we're pushing 600 customers on that platform, which is a -- it's a pretty significant decision when customers make that decision. So that's encouraging. And candidly, the secure access product that is the cloud edge security solution is actually ramping even faster than XDR did. So the teams have done a great job with this innovation. We have 2,200 customers now that are using our AI assistant in security. And so that's very encouraging as well. So we're really optimistic about what the teams have been doing in this space. Sami Badri : Thank you, Tal. Michelle, we'll go to the next question. Operator : Thank you. Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead, sir. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking my question. And before I ask the question, congratulations to Jeetu on the expanded role as well. Maybe just starting off with the AI orders, Chuck, I think you mentioned you already cumulatively crossed $1 billion and are on track for the $1 billion next year. Maybe if you can give us some sense on what's the current sort of run rate that you're hitting relative to the $1 billion target you have for next year? And as you sort of get more visibility in terms of some of these deployments, how are you thinking about the orders, timing of the orders translating into revenue? And I have a follow-up. Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Samik, could you ask a follow-up now, please? Samik Chatterjee : Okay. On the follow-up, I was just really going to more ask about what's embedded in terms of the guide relative to the Splunk growth versus the core business? And if we are sort of calculating it right, it looks like Splunk's growth was about 5% in the quarter, looks a bit more subdued than sort of the double-digit growth I think everyone was expecting. So any guide -- any sort of thoughts on why it was a bit more subdued if I'm doing the math right and how to think about sort of what's embedded in the guide for fiscal '25? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Yes. So on the AI orders, we did talk about the fact that we crossed $1 billion to date in the web scale space, which is solid. And at Investor Day, we talked about the number of design wins we've had, which are wins where we have received the go ahead from these customers that they're going to go with us assuming we execute and deliver on the design as they have spected. And so we're only 2.5 weeks into the year, so it's hard to say right now how those are going to flow throughout the balance of the year. But I will say that one of the absolute largest players in this space actually told us last week that they are releasing orders in one of those design wins. So one of those design wins will start to generate orders in the near future. So I think things are playing out as we expected. And candidly, it's just up to us to execute and deliver on what they've asked us to deliver. Scott Herren : Yes. And Samik, on Splunk, as we said in the opening commentary, it's progressing right in line with our expectations that the focus of that transaction was much more about driving revenue. Of course, it's a long sales cycle. We've already seen, as Chuck mentioned, double-digit number of deals that have closed with our two sales forces selling together. So the momentum in the field is good, Splunk. The better metric for Splunk, we talked about revenue because that obviously shows up in the P&L. The better metric for them is ARR and their ARR is continuing to grow in double-digits, which is right where it was the last time they reported as a public company. So continuing to see good momentum and beginning to see the green shoots of the sales force is really selling together. We've also done a fair number of product integrations. And I think Chuck talked about several of those in his piece of the script. And so what's going to happen over time is it's going to be harder and harder to say what is with these integrated product sets, what is Splunk revenue and what is Cisco revenue. I will tell you, we've built in the full impact of where we expect the combined company to be. But I think defining longer-term, how much of that is allocated to historical Splunk and how much that's allocated to historical Cisco is going to get tougher and tougher. So what I'd tell you is it's built -- it's performing well. We're already seeing good signs of the sales forces selling together and it's built into the guide. Chuck Robbins : Yes, I think that's really important, Scott, because we said that Splunk typically has a six to nine months sales cycle. And we closed I think over 10 of these cross-sell deals that were worked between the Cisco sales force and the Splunk sales force last quarter, which was promising and we also, as I said in my comments, we did the first cross-portfolio agreement that would have traditionally been a Cisco offer to one of our largest customers in the U.S. and we actually transacted it with Splunk included in that. So we're beginning to see what we would have expected at this point and maybe even a little ahead of what I would have expected at this point. Sami Badri : Thank you, Samik. Michelle, we can move to the next question. Operator : Thank you. George Notter with Jefferies. You may go ahead, sir. George Notter : Hi, thanks very much, guys. I wanted to ask about putting the organization together, networking, security, collaboration. Can you talk a bit about what's driving that integration? I assume you're going to talk about the need for products to be integrated, especially as we leverage AI, leverage big data sets. But can you walk through kind of the precise motivations driving it? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Yes, George, thank you. You nailed it. Actually, you could answer for me. I think the -- if you look at what our biggest competitive differentiation is in the marketplace, it's really when we do deep cross integration across the portfolio and we're delivering on a platform strategy for our customers. And I felt like with the pace at which the AI revolution is moving and what our enterprise customers need from us. And candidly as security and networking continue to become more tightly intertwined, I just felt like it was important for us to have a single leader. And if you look at what Jeetu has accomplished in his four years here when he took on the collaboration business originally, I think everybody remembers what the portfolio was like then versus what it's doing now with double-digit growth this quarter. And obviously in the security portfolio, he's done exactly as we had expected. And I think we have a great networking team and I think his focus on execution, innovation and sense of urgency, I think is going to be really welcome there. And so we look forward to seeing what that -- what the teams accomplished and the innovation that they'll deliver in the future. George Notter : Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Thank you. Sami Badri : Thank you, George. Michelle, can we move to the next question? Operator : Thank you. Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. You may go ahead, sir. Amit Daryanani : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe to start with, Chuck, your commentary around customer demand patterns kind of getting back to normal, the orders showing positive growth all sound really good. Maybe you could just contrast that and help us frame that versus your guidance for overall revenues being up 3% inclusive of Splunk. There's obviously a fear that Cisco is losing share. Maybe you can just talk about how to think about your revenue growth, what headwinds you have for maybe backlog normalization that should be factored into this 3%, 3.5% revenue guide? That would be really helpful to sort of understand. And then perhaps just as a follow-up, Scott, can you just quantify what sort of cost savings are you expecting from this reduction program? I realize none of this will flow to the bottom-line. It sounds like you want to invest it back in the business. But just to frame it up, what sort of savings on a gross level maybe you expect from these cost reduction initiatives? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Yes, Amit, on the first one, we've talked about this in the past. The headwind that we have for fiscal '25, we talked about this back at the -- on the Q3 call and again at our Investor Day, we still have a tough compare in Q1, as you know. Q1 of fiscal '24, the year that just ended, we had significant amount of product shipments from excess backlog. Round number is $4 billion of shipment, we included in those Q1 numbers. And obviously, you can only ship that backlog once. So we don't get to ship that again in Q1 of this year. That not only creates a dislocation in what the growth rates are for Q1, but it impacts the entire year as well. So one of the things that we talked about on the last call was if you looked at our growth rate of the core business and said X backlog and X Splunk, you can do the pencil math and see what is that growth rate. And it's in that same range that we gave you for the long-term growth rate. So that's what's kind of underneath the positive news that we're seeing around demand returning to normal patterns, but then the headwind that creates to revenue growth for the year in the guide. On the cost reductions from the actions that we're taking, it really is a case, much like it was last year of us finding those efficiencies across the company and really reallocating. So think of it as much more of a reallocation process than it is a cost savings process. That's -- this is the same financial discipline you've seen from us for the last couple of years. And as I said in answering the question earlier that the kind of the hallmark of that is when you look at a year, which was a tough year in terms of revenue production and with the discipline that we have, we still delivered the highest operating margin we have in the company -- in the history of the company. So think of it that way. We need to pivot more resources into the fastest growth areas of our business and we're doing it by finding efficiencies and then reallocating those costs. Sami Badri : Thank you, Amit. Michelle, we come up to the next question. Operator : Thank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may go ahead, sir. Simon Leopold : Great. Thank you for taking the question. I'm -- I'm interested in maybe unpacking a little bit of the $1 billion of incremental AI orders you talked about for fiscal '25. And what I'm sort of trying to understand is, are you looking at this as sort of more of the same, meaning very similar in the customer mix and product mix of the first $1 billion or are we expecting the beginning of maybe enterprise adoption for inferencing or what's the nature of that incremental $1 billion? And then my follow-up is quick and probably one that might be a little bit trickier to answer. But what are you budgeting for fiscal '25 OpEx? I think we're all trying to get to that one way or another. Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Simon. So I'll take the AI one. I would say that it doesn't have a meaningful amount of enterprise built into it. It's -- we are beginning to see the enterprise pipeline build a bit, but it's mostly predominantly the same thing that we've talked about in the past, which is a web scale infrastructure space. So if the enterprise picks up materially somewhere along the way, then that number could be higher. The other thing I'd point out is, I also believe over time, it's going to be -- it's going to get more and more difficult to really identify orders that are AI related because as I said earlier, we're beginning to see enterprise that are enterprises now that are updating their infrastructure as a result of AI. So does that count as an AI order or not? But anyway, we're going to -- we're going to stay pretty pure to how we measured them so far as we -- as we continue to update you on these numbers, but I think that's how it's going to play out over the course of the year. Scott Herren : And Simon, on your second question, obviously, for the full-year, we don't guide at that level. We guide -- we've given you revenue, we've given you what -- what to expect on EPS. But for Q1, we also gave you the ranges for gross margin and op margin. And you know there's in below the op margin line in OI&E, we've talked about the interest impact of the money that we spent to acquire Splunk. And I think you understand what that looks like. So what I'd give you as an additional modeling point is when you look through the year, we talked about the Q1 guide being gross margin in the 67% to 68% range and op margins being in the 32% to 33% range, it stays pretty well in that range for the full-year as well. Sami Badri : Thank you, Simon. Simon Leopold : Thank you. Sami Badri : We will move to the next question. Operator : Thank you. Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead. Matt Niknam : Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. On the point around the platform approach, maybe, Chuck, if you can speak to where the platform approach is resonating more across your different customer sets within enterprise, SP and public sector? And how much of these purchasing decisions, primarily around bundle -- buying networking and security adjacent to one another. How much of this is actually being done in unison today and where do you think that goes over time? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Matthew. I think that, look, these are happening primarily in the large enterprise and in the large public sector customers. That's where we see it. In the quarter, we had large enterprise and large public sector customers that actually executed on these nine figure deals. So it's happening across a broad array of customers in different industries. And I would say that when it comes to security and networking, you're seeing it particularly in the -- at the cloud edge. As you know, when you see SD-WAN and the cloud security coming together. But we're also beginning to see it and we're going to actually drive it in the data center with Hypershield where you have security embedded deeply in the network. And I think that one of the -- one of the key benefits of the organizational change that we made is that you're going to see more and more innovation that is going to actually come from us where the security and the network are more tightly connected in the future. Scott Herren : And Matt, what I'd add to the second part of your question kind of how much of the large deals and where does that go? Just a quick data point for you. We talked about product order growth ex-Splunk being at 6%. If you netted out these large -- we call them whole portfolio agreements. If you netted those out of both years, actually the product order bookings growth goes up modestly. Think of it as being in the same range. So while it was a good quarter for that, it always is in Q4, it's not the outsized driver of our growth. We're seeing growth really across the board. Sami Badri : Thank you, Matthew. Michelle, we can move to the next question. Operator : Thank you. Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. You may go ahead. Ittai Kidron : Thanks, guys. A couple of questions for me. First, Doug, in your prepared remarks, you had in the slides 4 examples of $100 million platform deals, multiple platforms, I guess, within each single customer. Maybe can you talk about where these -- all of these customers were naturally big Cisco customers before these renewals and deals. So I guess the question is, where is the incremental value, in what product areas do you see yourself really gaining more from a footprint when you're coming with these platform deals? And the second question relates to the cloud order growth, only two points, if I'm getting that right, not all that impressive this quarter. Maybe you can unpack that a little bit more. Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Yes, thanks Ittai. You're right. Most of these large platform deals are existing customers for sure. In some cases, these are the first -- this is the first time we've done one and in some cases, it's a renewal of one we did three, five years ago. So it varies. And I would say in all the customers, I'd say the big thing is probably an expansion for us now is the -- is the real recognition that the security portfolio is much more robust and the innovation that's been driven in that platform, I think is one of the advantages that the customers are really seeing through these platform deals that we're seeing. But also, again, I think when you get into the use cases, it's really important to understand that some of them are actually doing these now in preparation for these AI workloads like the AI-powered robotics example that we gave earlier. On the cloud order growth, that 2% was a combination of service provider and traditional service provider and cloud, the hyperscalers. And so if you look at the hyperscalers, we saw very significant growth in the second half of the year and in Q4. We said double-digits. I would just say it was meaningful and it was really refreshing to see. And as Scott said earlier, we feel like this digestion period is behind us now as we -- as we had hoped and thought it would be by the end of Q4. And so we hope to see normal buying behavior in the hyperscalers over the coming quarters. Ittai Kidron : Thank you. Sami Badri : Thank you Ittai. Thank you, Ittai. Michelle, next question. Operator : Jim Fish with Piper Sandler. You may go ahead. Jim Fish : Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions here. You guys are reducing 7% of the workforce, but based on your comments, Scott, it sounds as though that is kind of the gross number. So is there a way to think about sort of that net number by year end and how many employees are actually affected? And as a follow-up, obviously, Gary has been now in his role for a bit longer and you guys are starting a new fiscal year here. So how are you guys thinking about changes to the sales efforts or compensation structures with this kind of ongoing restructuring and meanwhile is kind of push more towards a platform sale? Thanks, guys. Scott Herren : Yes, Jim, I'll start. I think the -- again, think of that as the reduction that we're doing as much more of a reallocation versus a headcount savings. In some cases, the efficiencies that we're going to get will be from by moving into lower cost locations. So it's not as easy to do the math to say like, hey, if you were 90,000 heads before and 7%, I expect you to be at whatever the math works out to. Some of that is not going to be just a one-for-one headcount change, it's going to be savings that come by putting more work into lower cost locations. So it's -- I don't think the math is going to help you as you try to build out your model. Chuck Robbins : Yes, I think from Gary's perspective, he's not on the call with us today, but I think he's focused on -- we're putting in cross-sell incentives for the -- for Splunk on the Cisco sales force. We're going to be -- we're going to incent the security sellers inside Cisco. We're looking at the Splunk sales force over time being able to sell the security portfolio from Cisco. But he's focused on simplicity. He's focused on more frontline quota carrying reps. He's focused on investing in more capacity in the enterprise space where these platform deals are more prevalent, more systems engineering and a real doubling down on the focus on core networking and infrastructure. So I think you're going to see a real -- a real renewed effort to get the team's focus not only on some of the software assets and security, but really doubling down on core networking. Sami Badric : Thank you, Jim. Michelle, we can move to the next question. Operator : Thank you. Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. You may go ahead. Ben Reitzes : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask you, Chuck, a little bit more about the getting ready for AI, the uptick in orders where you see folks getting ready. Did you mean like some of the wireless orders where they're anticipating using apps or did you mean that they're anticipating doing training on top of some LLMs? I just wanted a little more if you had any insight as to what they're really using it for and which area of your portfolio that you're really seeing it in? And if you're getting a sense like for what they're really prepping for? And then -- oh, sorry. And then my follow-up is -- my follow-up is just with regard to NVIDIA. So a follow-up there is, with regard to your orders, it sounds like enterprise is small with regard to the AI orders, but wondering if you're seeing any interest in the NVIDIA partnership yet? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Ben. So on the enterprise AI, what I would say is some customers like these platform deals that we talked about, they're buying the entire portfolio to refresh their infrastructure to actually because they have applications that they've already identified like the ones we were referencing earlier. In other cases, they are updating their data center infrastructure and their core network infrastructure to be ready for smaller training models on their own private data and or inference. It just varies across the board. And I think to be honest with you, a lot of customers are -- would tell you that we're not really sure exactly what the applications are going to look like, but I know one thing for sure is it I need to have a modern and up-to-date infrastructure to be prepared for that. So I'm just going to go in and see where do I -- where do I need to make those investments. In some cases, I may need to update my switching infrastructure. In some cases, it may be new wireless. We saw data center switching in double-digits as well. So I think it -- I think it was fairly broad based. And then I'd say on the NVIDIA partnership, it's too early. We're not even in early field trials yet with that solution. So I don't think there's a lot to share yet. Sami Badri : Thank you, Ben. Michelle, we can move to the next question. Operator : Thank you. Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. You may go ahead, sir. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. Sticking on the AI theme, I'm just -- as we think about this $1 billion of orders, I think last quarter you talked about line of sight into the $1 billion going into fiscal '25. I'm curious if you can unpack that a little bit in terms of, are these back end network deployment, competing against Arista, internal switching offerings from the cloud guys? And is it switching? Is it Silicon One, full switch? Is any kind of granularity you can give between within that $1 billion orders? And then I'll say my second question. As we think about the split contribution in the fiscal '25. If we annualize the fourth quarter contribution, to me, it's going to lead me to think that core Cisco is kind of flattish kind of embedded in your guidance for the full-year. Is that fair? And if so, how are you thinking about the networking growth for the full-year guide? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Yes. So on the $1 billion, I would say it is primarily back end and it is a combination of both Ethernet and optics. We have a very robust optics business and it is competing with the players that you would suspect that we would compete with. In some cases, it's a system from us. In some cases, it's a -- perhaps it's a white box solution. But one of the big advantages we have is that we can actually sell them silicon, we can sell them, we can help them build white boxes or we can sell them integrated systems and it's a combination of all those things as well as optics. And then on the second one, you want to take? Scott Herren : Yes, well, Aaron, and this is back to what I was touching on earlier that if you remember, Q1 of fiscal '24, the compare point for our current quarter, also had a pretty significant amount of excess backlog clearance in it. We talked about it at Investor Day that it was in the $3.5 billion to $4 billion range of clearance that happened in Q1 a year ago. Obviously, that won't repeat in Q1 of this year. So while we're seeing a nice normalization of demand across the board, we've got that year-on-year headwind compare of not being able to have the significant backlog clearance again in Q1 of this year. You can add that to your math and you'll get a different outcome on what's happening in the core. Chuck Robbins : Yes. Thanks, Aaron. Sami Badri : Thank you, Aaron. Michelle, we can move to the next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is Atif Malik with Citi. You may go ahead. Adrian Colby : Hi, it's Adrian Colby for Atif. With regards to the inventory levels normalizing and a bit to the prior question, how should we think about the quarterly trends in the business? Are we sort of back to a scenario with regular sort of prior seasonal dynamics or as the business mix has evolved, are things changing? And also as we think about fiscal year '25, how should we think about the January dynamic with Splunk? It looks like historically that was a pretty strong quarter for Splunk. Chuck Robbins : I'll answer the first and then Scott, you can take the second. The -- we believe that we are finally back to normal ordering patterns. And we were talking about it as we're getting ready for this call and it's literally been four years that we've been going through this and with -- between COVID and then the supply chain shock and then having to deal with this digestion challenge at the end. So we're quite happy to be here. But we feel like we are back to normal ordering patterns. So it should be -- should be like it was prior to the pandemic. Scott? Scott Herren : Yes. And on the January dynamic on Splunk, like most enterprise software companies, not only do they get back end loaded into what was previously their fourth quarter, the January quarter that you talked about, but they also get very back end loaded within that quarter to the very end of it, right? And you see that with almost all enterprise software companies. The one bit of normalization that we've had to do is we brought Splunk in, our fiscal quarters don't actually end on the last day of the month. They end on the last Saturday of the month of that quarter. And so there's typically a tail of two or three days that would be the normal end of the Splunk quarter that doesn't fall into the end of our quarter. So it will be a muted impact on our second -- that January quarter is our second quarter. It will have a muted impact because we'll lose two or three days, which are two or three big days out of our Q2. Some of that will bleed over into Q3 for us. Sami Badri : Thank you, Adrian. Operator -- Michelle, we can move to the next question. Operator : Thank you. Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. You may go ahead. Karl Ackerman : Yes, thank you. You indicated that inventory digestion for hyperscale and enterprise networking is largely behind you. Though, Scott, I think you noted in your -- in general that price was somewhat of a headwind to product revenue in the quarter. Could you speak to the rate of change in the improving order visibility since the beginning of this year? In other words, as visibility improved from three months to say six to nine months? And then second, do you anticipate the pricing environment stabilizing or improving from here as you look to your fiscal '25 revenue outlook? Thank you. Scott Herren : I would say on the -- on the ability to look out and see the demand side, notwithstanding some unforeseen shock, I think the teams are back to their normal visibility. I think that -- I'm trying to even remember what it was. It's been so long ago since we had it. But I think the -- they clearly have much greater visibility over the next 90-day period. That's -- we've seen that the last couple of quarters. And obviously with this final Q4 where we think that the issue is behind us. I think going-forward, you'll see it. And I think we'll continue to see greater visibility into the outer quarters relative to where we were over the last couple of years. Chuck Robbins : Yes. And on price stability, Karl, if you go -- you got to go back away as Chuck just said. But if you go back to where we were before the supply chain issues and then of course, the price increases that we had to put in place because our cost went up significantly. And then it took a while, as you remember, for those price increases to turn into orders, those orders to work-through the backlog and get shipped out. We've now sort of lapped the point where we've gotten to price stability. So expect to see price impact back where it's always been historically. It's typically -- every deal we do is a competitive deal, all right. And so there's always some price competition around that, but expect it to be in the range that it was historically somewhere in that -- anywhere from 0.5% to 1.5% per quarter. Sami Badri : Thank you, Karl. I now want to hand it over back to Chuck for some closing remarks. Chuck Robbins : Thanks. I want to thank all of you for joining again today. We appreciate you being with us. I want to thank our teams, our customers and our partners for helping us with a strong finish to the challenging year. As we stated, we think the inventory digestion is complete and we're now returning to a more normalized demand environment. I'm encouraged by the broad based demand that we saw in the quarter across the -- and the continued progress we're making with our customers around AI and particularly cyber security as well as core networking and beginning to see that it is actually getting a lift from AI in the enterprise space. We're very pleased with the progress we've made with Splunk with the early traction and some of the wins. You can count on us for continued financial discipline as you always have seen. And you can always also count on us to continue to invest in the future as we're doing in AI infrastructure, networking, silicon and cyber to drive future growth and future profitability. So thank you for being with us and we look forward to seeing you all soon. Sami Badri : Thank you all for joining us. Cisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our fiscal year 2025 first quarter results will be on Wednesday, November 13th, 2024 at 1 :30 p.m., Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m., Eastern Time.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to Cisco's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Results Conference Call. At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Sami Badri, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Sami Badri : Good afternoon, everyone. This is Sami Badri, Cisco's Head of Investor Relations, joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO, and Scott Herren, our CFO. Cisco's earnings press release and supplemental information, including GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are available on our Investor Relations website. Following this call, we will also make the recorded webcast and slides available on the website. Throughout today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons will be made on a year-over-year basis. Please note that our discussions today will include forward-looking statements, including our guidance for the second quarter and fiscal year 2025. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties detailed in our SEC filings, particularly our most recent 10-K report, which identifies important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call further for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless that is done through an explicit public disclosure. Now, I'll turn it over to Chuck. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Sami. And thank you all for joining us today. Cisco delivered a strong start to fiscal '25, delivering $13.8 billion in revenue for the first quarter, coming in at the high end of our guidance range. This was supported by solid growth in annualized recurring revenue, remaining performance obligations, and subscription revenue, which now accounts for 57% of our total revenue. The strength of our recurring revenue streams is helping to fuel our profitability. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.91 exceeded the high end of our guidance range, driven by the highest non-GAAP gross margin we have seen in more than 20 years, which was further enhanced by Splunk. The combination of Cisco and Splunk and our team's great execution are both driving our strong operating leverage. The strength of our operating performance and free cash flow in Q1 fueled a return of $3.6 billion in value to our shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends, delivering on our commitment to consistent capital returns. Building on the growing demand we saw at the end of fiscal year '24, product orders grew 20% year-over-year in Q1 and were up 9% organically. This is an acceleration of the 14% product order growth we saw just three months ago and is a clear sign of normalizing demand for Cisco's innovation. Now, let me share some details on our first quarter, starting with the demand environment. Enterprise product orders were up 33%, driven by particularly strong performance in the Americas and EMEA across a broad range of customers. We saw continued strong momentum in service provider and cloud, with product orders up 28%, driven by triple-digit growth in webscale. In Q1, our webscale customers placed AI infrastructure orders in excess of $300 million. Our AI pipeline continues to be strong. We have earned more design wins and remain confident that we will exceed our target of $1 billion of AI orders this fiscal year from webscale customers. After a very strong Q4 last quarter, public sector orders were up 2% year-over-year in Q1. Federal spending in the U.S. was lower year-over-year due to continuing resolutions discussions, the impact of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, and the diversion of funds within U.S. federal. It's important to note that we believe the deals we are working on with U.S. federal customers are simply delayed, not lost. In both EMEA and APJC, year-over-year public sector order growth was strong. Now, let me share some data on demand through the lens of our products to provide some incremental color. Our networking portfolio saw double-digit product order growth overall, driven by switching, wireless, and internet infrastructure. Looking at data center switching in particular, we have seen three consecutive quarters of double-digit order growth and an acceleration from Q4 into Q1. This shows our competitive strength in this key market and the power of our Nexus brand in the build out of private cloud infrastructure by our customers. We expect this momentum to continue as customers are showing significant interest in our 400 gig and 800 gig switches based on Silicon One. Security orders more than doubled year-over-year, driven by the advanced threat intelligence capabilities of Splunk. Excluding Splunk, growth in security product orders was driven by our renewed security strategy and new product pipeline, which continues to be well received by customers and analysts. We continue to see momentum around our new security products like XDR, Secure Access and Multicloud Defense with now over 1,000 customers deploying these products thus far. In Q1, we had a marquee win for over 75,000 cloud security seats with a multinational IT services and consultancy company. The customer largely replaced an SSE competitor with our solution and moved from planning to implementation in 120 days, highlighting how fast our teams can implement our solutions at scale. We also booked our first seven-figure Hypershield deal in Q1. Collaboration product orders grew double-digits again driven by demand for devices and our Cloud Webex Suite. Finally, in observability, orders were up high-single-digits, driven by our network assurance solution, ThousandEyes and Splunk Observability. I'd also like to highlight some of the progress we've made integrating Splunk. We now have a dozen updated data integrations between Cisco and Splunk across our security and networking portfolio, including Secure Firewall, Catalyst Center, SD-WAN and ICE. We continue our joint selling motions between Cisco and Splunk, including a Cisco Secure Network Analytics and XDR alongside Splunk's SIEM, offering enhanced capabilities to the security operations center. We also continue to build our market-leading Observability solutions to accelerate Full-Stack Observability for the enterprise. Overall, our Q1 results highlight continued strong demand for Cisco technologies, driven by the need for modern, resilient networks as AI begins to scale. Findings from our new global AI partner study show that IT partners around the world are anticipating a transformative wave of AI technology demand driven by infrastructure, cybersecurity, and customer experience, which they expect to fuel the majority of their revenue over the next four to five years. With the breadth of our portfolio, we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on this AI technology demand as customers are investing in their critical infrastructure to prepare for AI. In fact, there are three distinct but connected pillars to the AI networking opportunity for Cisco, which we have outlined on a slide as part of our quarterly materials. First, AI training infrastructure for webscale customers : AI networks demand scalable, programmable, low-power switches with advanced load balancing and observability. These characteristics in our products are driving hyperscalers to deploy the Cisco 8000 with Cisco's Silicon One G200 for maximum power efficiency in their back-end AI training networks. As further proof, we also won a new Super Spine AI networking use case with one of our webscale customers this quarter. Second, AI network connectivity : This quarter, we booked further platform sales with global enterprise customers who are leveraging our technology platforms to modernize and automate their network operations to prepare for large scale connectivity to AI applications. Our technology platforms across switching, routing, security, and observability will help enable our customers by leveraging cutting-edge innovations like AI-powered robotics and unmatched supply chain visibility. Third, AI network inference and enterprise clouds : Most of the CIOs and technology leaders we talk to say that their organizations are planning full GenAI adoption within the next two years, yet only 13% of organizations say their infrastructure is ready for AI today, according to the Cisco AI Readiness Index. To help our customers prepare, we have announced two new additions to our data center infrastructure portfolio, a new Nvidia-based AI server and AI PODs, including Nvidia's AI Enterprise cloud-native software platform and managed through Cisco Intersight to simplify and de-risk AI infrastructure deployment. Our new AI server is expected to begin shipping next month. And our AI PODs are orderable this month. In addition, HyperFabric, our fabric as a service solution, which is expected to be available in early calendar 2025, further simplifies infrastructure deployment and management while providing real-time visibility into network performance. With these solutions, we are bringing the power of open hyperscale AI networking to the enterprise. We also continue to fuse AI capabilities into our products. Hypershield, our first truly distributed AI-native cybersecurity solution built into the fabric of the network, shows how we are delivering secure networking, making it easier for our customers to protect against evolving threats. Splunk's Asset and Risk Intelligence solution is another example of how we are providing insights to help customers understand their security maturity and demonstrate compliance with evolving regulations. In our collaboration portfolio, we recently introduced the Webex AI Agent, AI Agent Studio, and Cisco AI Assistant features for Webex Contact Center. These solutions use advanced conversational intelligence and automation to improve overall customer satisfaction. We have seen strong initial interest from customers and we'll continue to strengthen our collaboration products, increasing AI capabilities. We are also enhancing our own productivity by using AI in our services and customer experience organization. Over 60% of our Technical Assistance Center support cases are now touched by AI-enabled automation backed by our expertise for faster resolutions, which is leading to higher customer satisfaction scores. In addition, our internal AI assistant for TAC works alongside our engineers to improve quality and speed time to resolution, while allowing our people to work on more complex and creative problem solving. To summarize, as we look at what's occurring with AI, there are three key things happening. First, there is significant investment in back-end AI networks with hyperscalers focused on training. Second, as enterprises look to adopt and deploy AI, they need to modernize and secure their infrastructure to prepare for pervasive deployment of AI applications. Finally, the combination of mature back-end models with enterprise AI application deployment will lead to increased capacity requirements on both private and public front-end cloud networks. Cisco is already playing a major role across all three of these significant opportunities and are uniquely positioned to win with the breadth of our product portfolio and our trusted customer relationships. I will now turn it over to Scott to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook. Scott Herren : Thanks, Chuck. We executed well in Q1 with strong order momentum, margins, and operating cash flow. For the quarter, total revenue was at the high end of our guidance range at $13.8 billion, down 6% year-over-year. As a reminder, Q1 of fiscal '24 was the last quarter of significantly elevated backlog shipments. Non-GAAP net income was $3.7 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share were above the high end of our guidance range at $0.91. Looking at our Q1 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $10.1 billion, down 9%, and service revenue was $3.7 billion, up 6%. Networking was down 23%, primarily driven by the elevated level of shipment we saw a year ago. As Chuck said, we saw strong order growth across our networking products as customers have worked down inventory and deployed the networking products we shipped them last year. Security was up 100%, primarily driven by growth in our threat intelligence, detection, and response offerings, which includes the offerings from Splunk, network security and SASE. Excluding Splunk, security grew 2%, and our security portfolio was particularly impacted by the delays in spending in U.S. fed. Collaboration was down 3%, driven by declines in our on-prem Webex Suite and collaboration devices, partially offset by growth in our contact center and CPaaS offerings. Observability was up 36%, driven primarily by Observability Suite and growth in Network Assurance offerings. Excluding Splunk, Observability grew 1% for the quarter. Looking at our recurring metrics, ARR ended the quarter at $29.9 billion, which increased 22%, with product ARR growth of 42%. Total subscription revenue increased 21% to $7.8 billion, representing 57% of Cisco's total revenue. Total software revenue was up 24% at $5.5 billion with software subscription revenue up 35%. Total RPO was $40 billion, up 15% year-over-year. Product RPO grew 24% and total short-term RPO was up 15% to $20.3 billion. Q1 product orders were up 20% year-over-year. Excluding Splunk, product orders were up 9% year-over-year. Looking at our product orders across our geographic segments, the Americas was up 17%, EMEA was up 26%, and APJC was up 25%. In our customer markets, enterprise was up 33%, service provider and cloud was up 28%, and public sector was up 2%. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 69.3%, up 220 basis points year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range and reaching the highest level in more than 20 years. Product gross margin was 68.9%, up 240 basis points, driven by Splunk, favorable product mix, productivity improvements and the one-time benefit of duty drawback, partially offset by price. Services gross margin was 70.3%, up 130 basis points. We continued our focus on profitability and financial discipline with non-GAAP operating margin above the high end of our guidance range at 34.1%. On the bottom-line, Q1 non-GAAP net income was $3.7 billion, and earnings per share were $0.91. Shifting to the balance sheet. We ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $18.7 billion. Operating cash flow was $3.7 billion, up 54%. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $3.6 billion to shareholders during the quarter comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $2 billion of share repurchases. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q1, we closed two software acquisitions : DeepFactor, to accelerate innovation in the Cisco Security Cloud and augment our Secure Access offerings, and Robust Intelligence, which brings enhanced protection for AI models throughout their life cycle from development to production. Additionally, we announced our intent to acquire Deeper Insights AI to expand our Customer Experience team's technology footprint and engineering talent, accelerating innovation and momentum of Cisco's CX AI capabilities and services. These investments are highly complementary to our internal R&D, in line with our strategy to strengthen our position in security and AI with targeted strategic M&A. To summarize, we started the fiscal year with a solid quarter, highlighted by strong order growth, margins and non-GAAP EPS. We remain focused on making strategic investments and accelerating innovation across our business to best capitalize on the significant growth opportunities we see ahead, all underpinned by disciplined expense management. It's this powerful combination that continues to fuel our strong cash flow generation, as well as our ability to return significant value to shareholders. Turning to our financial guidance. For fiscal quarter Q2, our guidance is as follows : we expect revenue to be in the range of $13.75 billion to $13.95 billion; we anticipate non-GAAP gross margins to be in the range of 68% to 69%; non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33.5% to 34.5%; non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.89 to $0.91. For fiscal year '25, our guidance is : we expect revenue to be in the range of $55.3 billion to $56.3 billion; non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.60 to $3.66. In both our Q2 and full year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 19%. Sami, let's now move into the Q&A. Sami Badri : Thank you, Scott. Before we start the Q&A portion of the call, I would like to remind analysts to ask one question and a single follow-up question. Operator, can we move to the first question in the analyst queue? Operator : Thank you. Tal Liani, you may go ahead from Bank of America. Tal Liani : Hello. I'll ask both my questions together. What is -- so, cloud orders, cloud and service providers grew 22% ex-Splunk. Last quarter, it was only 2%. So, what is driving this massive growth in orders? And can you elaborate on the areas where you participate in cloud, more specifics of switching, routing, optical, et cetera, where you have strength and the extent, meaning is it all cloud providers, cloud titans, or are you focused -- like we have other vendors, are you focused on certain cloud providers and not others? And my follow-up question is on margins. Very strong gross margin, very strong operating margin this quarter. Talk about the drivers and sustainability of these margins? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Okay. Thank you, Tal. Thanks for being with us, and thanks for the question. So, I'll take the first one, which is service provider and specifically cloud orders. So, if we step back and look at our service provider business, we were pleased. I think, first and foremost, starting with cable, it continues to be under pressure, but it's also the smallest portion of the business and is less impactful as it gets smaller. On the telco side, we actually saw some probably low-single-digit growth in telco, which was positive to see. We saw some real -- some activity occurring in both Europe and in APJC, which was encouraging as well. And then, we moved to cloud or the webscale customers. That's where we had order growth in excess of 100%. And what I would tell you is that four of the six largest players were all each in excess of 100%. So, it was not concentration in one customer, it was actually four different customers all above triple-digit growth for us. When we look at areas where we participate, you mentioned routing, switching optical, et cetera, and we participate in all of those. I did call out that we took orders in Q1 for AI and webscale in excess of $300 million, putting us well on track for the $1 billion and to exceed the $1 billion for the year. We participate -- I'll start with AI. We participate -- when we talk about AI, it's primarily -- it's systems underpinning GPUs in back-end networks. I talked about a Super Spine win, which would be systems that are actually interconnecting clusters in the back-end. And then, we also provide both systems and optics that are providing that same connectivity as well as the connectivity required from the back-end to the front-end. So, we have a number of design wins in this space. We feel good about the progress we're making. And I would just say that this is one of the big benefits of our strategy, which is to basically sell to our customers in the way that they would like to consume the technology, whether it's by our silicon, by our systems. And I think having our own silicon is proving to be a real competitive advantage for us. So, we're pleased with that. At the same time, I would say that the AI infrastructure represented just less than half of the total business we took from the webscale customers. So, we still saw strength in the traditional cloud side as well, and we're pleased with the performance that we showed there. Scott, do you want to take the margin call? Scott Herren : Yeah. Tal, the margins were very strong. Of course, we had non-GAAP total gross margins of 69.3%, as Chuck said earlier, highest that we've had in 20 years. The product non-GAAP gross margin is 68.9%, up 240 basis points. So, a handful of things driving that. Obviously, the year-on-year increase includes the addition of Splunk, which is favorable at the gross margin line, of course. We had other favorable product mix built into that. A nice job continues to be done by the team on what I'll call productivity enhancements. So, continuing to drive cost out of the cost of goods sold line. The supply chain team has done a really nice job on that front. That is sustainable. We did have a one-time benefit in Q1 in the cost of goods sold line for a project that's been on flight for several years around duty drawback. So, these are components that we imported that incurred a tariff. They were built into final product and then subsequently exported. When that happens, of course, you get the ability to get a return on that. We've been working to get a return of the tariff that you paid at the point of import. We've been working on this project for some time. During the quarter, those filings were accepted. And so, we got a one-time benefit that's fairly substantial in Q1. Having said that, on the back of the great work the team has done, as I look at the next three quarters of the year and you see this in our Q2 guide, I would expect to see gross margins continue to settle into this range of 68% to 69% for the full year. And that of course, will be a tailwind to op margin as well. Sami Badri : Thank you, Tal. Michelle, we can go to the next question. Operator : Thank you. Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead, sir. Matt Niknam : Hey, guys, thanks so much for taking the question. So, my question is mainly around macro. Just wondering maybe, Chuck, if you can speak to how the macro backdrop has evolved over the last three months? And then, maybe to double-click on that as a quick follow-up, as it relates to the election, just wondering if there's any hesitation, any impact in terms of buying behavior across different verticals, given some of the uncertainty around U.S. elections intra-quarter? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Matt. So, on the macro front, I think, first and foremost, I would say that Scott mentioned the U.S. federal challenges, and that will tie into your second question. So, I'll cover a little bit of that there. I think the U.S. federal business was impacted by the continuing resolution pressure and then also the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which expires at the end of this calendar year. Both of those put pressure on federal. I think we've heard that from some of our peers in their earnings announcements. If you normalize out or if you actually look at our product orders without Splunk, so the organic product order growth and you just remove the U.S. federal year-over-year, the rest of the world was up in the mid-to-high teens. So, what that tells you is that we saw very balanced strength around the world. Geographically, we saw good strength in Europe, good strength in Asia. Without U.S. fed, we saw good strength in the United States. We saw really strong recovery in enterprise. We're pleased with that. I discussed already the service provider performance that we had during the quarter. And so, I think the only real vertical I would call out is the U.S. federal issue that I just explained. I don't think there's anything else that we've seen relative to the elections at this point. Scott Herren : No. And the thing to think about, Matt, about the delays that we're seeing in U.S. fed is they are delays. This is not deals that were lost through that. It's pressure that's being put on by the continuing -- the funding of continuing resolution in the Fiscal Responsibility Act. So, we do see some of those coming back as we get past the continuing resolutions. It looks like the Republicans will carry both Houses of Congress and the White House. And so, I would expect to get a budget in place relatively quickly. So, I do think we'll see. Those aren't lost transactions. And just to emphasize a point that Chuck just said, total product order growth organically and excluding the impact of U.S. fed is up mid-to-high teens. So, I think in line with what you would have expected. Chuck Robbins : Lots of strength everywhere else. Scott Herren : Yeah. Sami Badri : All right. Thank you, Matt. Michelle, we can go to the next question. Operator : Thank you. Michael Ng from Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead, sir. Michael Ng : Hi, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I wanted to ask about security. It was encouraging to hear about the first seven-figure Hypershield deal in the quarter. Could you just talk a little bit more about that, the nature of that deal? I think it was only recently made available. So, it feels like it's early days, but maybe you can talk about the reception to that? And then secondly, I think you had mentioned security orders had doubled year-over-year, including Splunk. Could you just give us the organic number as well? And if you could speak qualitatively to the trends, that would be helpful. Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Yeah. Thanks, Michael. So, on your first question around Hypershield, this was a very large financial institution that was part of the early adopter planning and that's what we're seeing. This is a very high-impact solution that actually is very effective in some of the most, I'd say, advanced data centers in the world. So, we see very large customers that have been deploying it. So, we're going to see, I think, a little -- a gradual uptick in customers adopting it. And we have a bit of a white glove program right now that we're using to help these customers get up and running. So, we're really pleased to see that because when a large bank makes a commitment like that, that tells you the technology is real. And in many cases, they will lead the rest of the enterprise and actually deploy in these new security technologies. So, that's a good sign. On the security orders, we had a bit of the same issue that we had with U.S. federal on the overall product order growth. U.S. federal is our largest -- well, it contains our largest customer in the world and probably our largest security customer in the world. And so, our security orders were up in the mid -- low- to mid-single digits without Splunk, the organic ones. And then -- but without U.S. federal, it tracked with the product data we gave you a few minutes ago. So, organic security orders, if you normalize out the federal year-over-year impact with the continuing resolution and the federal -- the Fiscal Responsibility Act, they were up in the mid to high-teens as well. We crossed 1,000 customers that have deployed these new technologies that we rolled out over the last 12 to 15 months. So, we're pleased with the adoption that continues to occur there. And I think if you look -- if you listen to the analyst or follow the industry, I think there's a broad-based belief that our innovation pipeline and the technologies that we've been bringing to bear are going to be highly impactful our customers. And I would say there's more to come, so stay tuned. Sami Badri : Thank you, Mike. Michelle, we can move to the next question. Operator : Thank you. David Vogt with UBS. You may go ahead. David Vogt : Great. Thanks guys for taking my question. First, if I may, you mentioned -- I think, Chuck, you mentioned half of your webscale orders were AI with the other half sort of more traditional front-end. Is that sort of what drove the enterprise order growth or is there some campus recovery in that number from a product perspective? And then, I'll just give you the second one for Scott. On gross margin, appreciate the color on sort of some of the impacts in the quarter. But from a Splunk perspective, was there anything else in the numbers? Like, we're trying to think through kind of the contribution from Splunk subscription versus term licenses and how should we think about that as we move through the balance of fiscal '25? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : So, thanks, David. If I interpret your first question right, I think what you're asking is, was the non-AI portion of the cloud spend responsible for the enterprise growth that we saw. And so, I'm going to try to answer this. So, when we talk about the enterprise segment, we don't include any technology sold to the webscale customers regardless of what it is. So, the enterprise segment is simply enterprise customers buying whatever they buy from us. So, that growth that we saw in enterprise was purely them. And I would also say that the majority of all of the webscale purchases from us were in the Internet infrastructure space. There was a smattering on the non-AI side that would be attributed to sort of classic enterprise technologies, but it was very small in the context of what they procured from us. Most of it was Internet infrastructure systems, optical routing, switching, et cetera. Scott, the second one? Scott Herren : Yeah. On the gross margin, this is what I was touching on earlier, David, we did have favorable product mix in there and Splunk was a part of that, that drove the margins. There was a one-time benefit in Q1 that I just touched on around duty drawback. So, projects we've had in place for some time, getting a refund of basically import duty that we had paid, tariffs that we had paid on components that we imported, built into product and then turned around and exported, and you're allowed to get those back. It's taken a while to get that -- all that paperwork pulled together, documented and then get it approved and actually get the refund. That happened in Q1. So, we had a one-time benefit. That's a catch up from a couple of years of those. That's not repeatable throughout the rest of the year. There is a small tail of that, a little bit in Q2 and a little bit more in Q3 and Q4. The team has also done a really nice job continuing to drive cost out across the board. That's another thing that's driving our view now of gross margins kind of maintaining in the 68% to 69% range through the end of the year. So, think of Splunk being a benefit, that's not new news. I think what drove the outperformance in the quarter was much more about the one-time impact of the duty drawback project. Sami Badri : Thank you, David. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst. Operator : Thank you. Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead, sir. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. If I can ask both my questions at the same time? Chuck, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, the data center switching portfolio had the third consecutive quarter of strong order growth. Just wondering how you're interpreting that in terms of enterprises are already starting to get ready for their AI deployments, or do you still believe that's largely in front of you. Just what is that sort of order momentum indicating to you? And then the second one just on AI orders, you're sounding sort of better in relation to exceeding the $1 billion target, but is that -- is there necessarily an implication there in terms of revenue realization in the year? Is revenue realization maybe even a bit higher than you thought initially in terms of timing? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Thank you. So, on the data center switching side, I think what it shows is that, clearly, our customers continue to be balanced between which workloads they move to the public cloud and which they move -- they build into the private infrastructure. We do see customers that are in -- that are generally modernizing their infrastructure. We talked about this last quarter. We see enterprise customers who are -- even when they're unsure about what AI applications they may deploy six, nine, 12 months from now, they do know that they need modern infrastructure to be prepared to do so, and we're seeing them forward invest to get ready for it. But this has been the same pattern we've seen for a few quarters now. And so, I think it's, to some extent, in preparation for it, but the last part of your first question, I would say that the majority of this build out is still way ahead of us on the enterprise side. On the second question relative to AI orders and the fact that I think we're on track to exceed the $1 billion, the one comment I'd make on the orders, and I'll let Scott speak to the revenue implications. I think that these customers, it's a very dynamic market, and they have a lot of rapidly changing requirements. And so, as we see these opportunities arise and we get designed in. So, when we get the design wins as we talk about, then, ultimately, they become bookings and then ultimately they become revenue. In many cases, a design win means that they have confidence that we can actually design a piece of silicon that they're looking for, we put it into a system, we deliver the system. And so, the timing varies depending on what we want from them. And so that's why you're going to see this stuff show up in our guidance and you're going to see it show up as we continue to execute. And you've heard me talk about the need to continue to execute on several calls in a row in this space, but I feel really good about the job the team is doing right now. So that will lead to the answer to the revenue question, Scott, that you... Scott Herren : Yeah. And on the revenue question, as Chuck said, this is a bit dynamic in terms of shipments. Obviously, we don't get revenue until we ship the product out the door and there's a number of factors that goes into that, some of -- most of which are not within our control. We do see though this driving revenue consistent with what we've said in the past, Samik, driving revenue for us more in the second half of the year. The majority of the revenue that we get from that will be in the second half. Sami Badri : Thank you, Samik. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst. Operator : Thank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may go ahead. Simon Leopold : Great. Thanks for taking the question. First one is, I'd love to get maybe an update or double-click on the partnership you announced with Nvidia very early in [Technical Difficulty] I'd like to sort of get a sense of how that's progressing in terms of traction and where that fits into the pipeline. I did catch that you mentioned you've got an AI server. Just sort of wondering if that's an outcome of that alignment. And my follow-up is pretty straightforward is you've earlier talked about the Splunk opportunities of new potential customers being introduced to Splunk. If you could update us on the progress there and sort of your line of sight to closing some of those deals? Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Yeah, thanks, Simon. So, on the Nvidia partnership, I think we're still really early on bringing these solutions to market. So, if you think back a couple of quarters back, we announced Hyperfabric, which is a fabric as a service solution to bring sort of that public cloud simplicity to AI workloads in the enterprise and that will be shipping in the first portion of calendar 2025. But we did announce this quarter two new platforms. We announced our AI compute platform that is -- the first phase of that is based on Nvidia GPUs. And we announced AI PODs, which are also based on Nvidia GPUs. Over time, you'll see us support other GPUs as the market demands. But that partnership is still going fine. It's still early. And I think 2025 is when we'll start to see enterprise real deployment of some of these technologies. On the second one, the Splunk customers update, I would say we continue to see good progress. If you really think about where we are with Splunk, we have -- I think we closed the acquisition in March. We're in November, so that's about eight months. And if you ask Gary, he would tell you their average sales cycle is nine months. So, we haven't even gotten -- and we didn't start this initiative until probably into the second quarter that they were a part of us. So, I think it's still super early. What I would tell you is that we've -- the criteria that we use to identify these customers was based on certain attributes of the customer that would lead them to be a viable Splunk candidate. And we've added about 1,500 more customers to that list. But the other thing that I think is really a positive sign is we have hundreds of Cisco partners now that have been trained on Splunk that are building out Splunk practices, in some cases, have actually gone out and made strategic acquisitions of Splunk Partners to accelerate and bring them into their business. So, on that front, we're super positive about how that's progressing as well. Scott Herren : Yeah. The only thing I'd add to that is from just overall perspective on Splunk integration, it's progressing in line with our expectations on the topline and in the ARR in particular and actually ahead of our expectations on profitability at this point. So, Splunk overall is tracking quite well for us. Sami Badri : Thank you, Simon. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst. Operator : James Fish with Piper Sandler. You may go ahead, sir. James Fish : Hey, guys. Scott, for you, just circling back on RPO, what was RPO and product RPO growth at Splunk? And then, Chuck, for you, how are you guys thinking about not just enterprise refresh potential, but also the campus refresh opportunity with Wi-Fi 7 availability that you guys I think even announced this week? And will that Wi-Fi 7 encourage any campus switch refresh as well? Thanks, guys. Chuck Robbins : Go ahead. Scott Herren : Yeah, Jim, on the RPO, we don't actually -- we're not going to continue to break out with and without Splunk. And that's partly because of what I just said. This integration is going well. We've launched several products now that are joint products of both Cisco and Splunk. From an organizational standpoint, we've brought in all of the G&A functions and are quickly adopting or integrating across the product lines. So, it's getting harder and harder to say what's Splunk and what's not Splunk. That line is just getting blurry and blurry each quarter. So, I don't plan on breaking that out. I would tell you, of course, without Splunk, it still is a positive growth rate that's in sync with where we've been historically, but I really want to get a way of trying to draw that line for you. Chuck Robbins : Yeah, Jim, on the campus refresh, I think, look, our overall enterprise networking business was very strong during the quarter. So, we are continuing to see that refresh. You mentioned Wi-Fi 7, that we did announce the high-end versions during the quarter. This is a big -- it's a big first step for us because it's one of the first platforms that we've had that you can deploy and run under an on-prem management system or a cloud management system with the same license and use the same hardware. So, that's been something we've been working on for a while is hardware portability between both on-prem and cloud. But we see that -- we see customers continue -- because if you think about the AI deployment and you think about starting first in the back-end of AI, which we've seen, and then as you see these pervasive deployment of AI applications in the enterprise, that's going to have dual impact. Number one, it's going to create that front-end network pull that we talk about because the enterprises are going to be connecting back to the cloud to take advantage of their models. And then, it's also going to continue to pull the refresh in the enterprise side because they're going to need their networks modernized to be able to run edge based versions of AI, et cetera. So, we think the refresh opportunity is real for some period of time and in large part will be driven by this AI wave. Sami Badri : All right. Thank you, Jim. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst. Operator : Thank you. Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. Maybe circling back to Michael's question, where you answer that kind of organic security growth would have been in kind of the mid-to-high teens if you stripped out kind of U.S. federal. Just wanted to get a sense of kind of what was driving some of that strength? Is that data center modernization, or just what products are kind of driving some of that upside? And then just second question, just on data center modernization as a tailwind, just where are you kind of seeing kind of prioritization the most kind of within the data center? Is it kind of around security or updating switching? Just kind of any commentary around kind of categories you're seeing that data center modernization take place in? Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Meta. I think when you look at the security performance, if you just put U.S. fed to the side, I think we're seeing the impact of these new products between XDR, Secure Access, Multicloud Defense. We've seen over 1,000 customers now deploy those new technologies that we didn't have in our portfolio 18 months ago. We see Hypershield with very positive early feedback. And that's not a big contributor to the order side yet, but I think it will be and it creates a mindshare pull from our customers because it's so innovative that, sometimes, it leads them to look at the rest of the portfolio again. We also have completed a refresh of the low-end firewall in the most recent quarter. We've had the high -- the high-end was refreshed in 2024, in the early part. The mid-range was refreshed in the latter part of '24. So, I mean there's a lot that has been going on that I think is contributing to that energy in security. But in general, I think the market, the analysts, the customers all believe that where we are today versus where we were three, four years ago in security is just fundamentally different. On the data center side, the data center modernization that I've been talking about was largely around switching infrastructure, but I think the Hypershield momentum that we're feeling, at least from a mindshare perspective with customers would suggest that security is a massive opportunity in that space. As we've talked about, if you start with a fundamental assumption that the bad actors are in your infrastructure, then the thing you need to do is stop the east-west traffic in the data center and that's one of the key roles that Hypershield plays. So, I think that's a big focus area for our customers as well. But most of what we've seen happening when we talk about data center modernization and the momentum that we've seen there is fundamentally been around switching. Sami Badri : Thanks, Meta. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst. Operator : Thank you. Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. You may go ahead. Ben Reitzes : Hey, thanks a lot. It's great to be chatting with you. Hey, Chuck, I asked this last quarter, and I was wondering if you had any update. I understand that customers are getting ready for AI and feel they need to have the latest and greatest year for it. Are you getting a sense of what they're engaging you for? Is it they feel like there's going to be more inferencing? Is there specific applications that they're citing? I think investors would love to know what you potentially are hitching a ride to there on that comment. And then, I had a follow-up question for you and Scott is just, these performances where the orders move around ex-Splunk given the excess backlog can be a little confusing for investors, but you said one thing at your Analyst Day where you're going to grow 4% to 6%. And I know that's next year and beyond. But is there anything happening near-term that makes you feel better about that long-term target where you're a mid-single-digit grower? Anything that happened that making you feel better or worse regarding it, that'd be great to hear. Thanks. Chuck Robbins : Hey, Ben, thanks. So, on the first question relative to AI in the enterprise in particular, I think we're all seeing customers focus on customer experience. That's one of the big early applications that virtually every enterprise that we engage with is looking at, including Cisco and everybody else. So, everybody is focused on that. Then, the second, I think, is largely they are building different applications that are contributing to automation and efficiency like we've talked about with robotics or supply chain management. We also see a lot of AI activity around deeper engagement with the customer. So, customer experience on the support side, but then upselling, cross-selling customers, we see a lot of focus on that on understanding purchasing trends. And in those cases, what we see customers doing and this is leading to my belief about what's happening in the AI shift right now is customers are needing to leverage the value provided by the foundational models, but they also need to be able to train their custom data and then the inferencing applications are actually making calls into both of those datasets, obviously. And we think that's going to lead to the front-end network buildout that we've talked about a lot in addition to the back-end. It also is leading some customers to buildout some of this data center modernization in their private clouds, and it's leading them to think about modernizing their overall infrastructure for edge-based versions of that over time. So that's generally what we're seeing. I'll make a quick comment on the second one, then I'll hand it to Scott. I would say that as we continue to see more and more success and more progress relative to the webscale customers and their acceptance of the AI solutions that we're delivering and our team is delivering and us achieving the numbers that we put out there and exceeding those numbers, then that contributes to my confidence in the next few years. Scott? Scott Herren : No, I think you said it right, Chuck. The way I think about that is, it is hard right now, Ben, to compare the year-on-year product order growth rates because of what happened last year with all the inventory digestion that needed to go on. So, one thing you can do right now is start to look at what the sequential -- the ex-Splunk sequential product order growth rates look like and get a better sense of the demand that we're seeing coming back into that marketplace. And as we lap these more normal -- demand is normalizing as we lap these more normal demand quarters, you'll begin to see something that fits into the pattern that is going to be easier to discern what's happening overall from demand standpoint. I would say the investments that we're making in AI, the investments that we're making across the networking portfolio with some of the platform work that we're doing in Wi-Fi 7 that we just launched yesterday is a combined platform product, same product that can be run with either platform in the back-end to control it. Those investments are paying off. And so, I feel good about what we put out. Obviously, when we put those numbers out. We wanted to be a little bit conservative with them to ensure that as we got to '26 and '27, we not only hit those, but had a chance to overachieve on that. And right now, I'd say the investments that we're making in that space to drive growth are paying off. Sami Badri : Thank you, Ben. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst. Operator : Thank you. Amit Daryanani from Evercore. You may go ahead, sir. Amit Daryanani : Yeah, thanks for taking my question. I guess, I'll ask a question and follow-up at the same time. Scott, networking revenues were down 23% this quarter. Just talk about how did that stack up against your expectations? And now that backlog has normalized, should we expect this business to grow sequentially for the rest of fiscal '25? Would be really helpful understand how that grows for the rest of the year. And then, Chuck, over the next three years, are you more excited about Hyperscale or Hypershield, which one is the bigger opportunity that you're [seizing] (ph)? Thank you. Scott Herren : Yeah. I got to say, Amit, I'll start on the first one, but there was some background noise as you were asking the question, I'm not sure I got the entire question, but it started with networking revenue being down 23%. Of course, remember, that's comparing to Q1 in '24 where we had a very substantial shipment of excess backlog. Basically backlog that had built up during the supply constraints that we cleared very quickly. Q1 of '24 was the third of three consecutive quarters with very heavy backlog shipment into it. If you net that out, and I think we did some of that math for you on the last call, gives you a better sense of what's happening in network demand. It's trending in line with our expectations. I'd say AI has been a bright spot for us. The bookings that we're seeing inside AI haven't yet turned into revenue, but we certainly are seeing good momentum from that standpoint. DC switching, as Chuck just pointed out, has continued to be strong for us. So, feeling good overall relative to our expectations about what we're seeing in networking. And if I missed the second part of your question, we will circle back to you afterward and get to it. Chuck Robbins : Yeah. And then, your second question relative to, am I more excited, I think you said about Hypershield or Hyperfabric. I know there are both hyper-words. So, those are probably the two you mentioned. I am equally excited. I think from a security perspective and a strategic security perspective, our large enterprise customers are incredibly optimistic about what Hypershield means for them, but from an AI application deployment perspective, our customers are very excited about what Hyperfabric will mean to them. So, if you think about two of the most important objectives our customers have, which is east-west data center security, and secondly, how do I simplify the deployment of AI applications. These are two very core technologies to both those things that we think will be important to our customers for the next few years. Sami Badri : All right, Amit, thank you. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst. Operator : Thank you. George Notter with Jefferies. You may go ahead, sir. George Notter : Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I just wanted to get some more detail on the gross margin improvement. Any chance you can break out that duty drawdown impact in the quarter? I'd be curious as to what that is. And then obviously, you also saw quite a sequential improvement in gross margin. Obviously, Splunk was in -- obviously, the quarter and last quarter as well. So, I think product mix was probably a pretty big factor here. I'm wondering if there was a big difference in terms of the mix of UCS servers or other product lines that kind of drove the day there. Any details would be great. Thanks. Scott Herren : Sure. I talked about gross margin improvement during Q1, in particular, having a one-time benefit from the duty drawback because it's a couple of years of duty that we've been working through this process of not just getting the filings together, but getting it all approved and getting the cash back. I would say that was a substantial contributor to the benefit we saw in Q1, somewhere between probably 0.5 point and 1 point of improvement just driven by that. There will be a tail of those now that we've got that process in place. It will be significantly less as we look at Q2, Q3 and Q4. On the product mix front, we definitely got a benefit from Splunk coming in, not surprisingly. As you know, they had gross margins -- product gross margins in the 80% range. That's been a tailwind to us overall. There's also favorable product mix across some other product lines inside there and that will continue. The team has also done a really nice job driving cost out, as I said earlier, I give credit to our supply chain and our product teams on continuing to drive cost out of that cost infrastructure. So full year, I see that those gross margins settling into the range that we guided in Q2 into that 68% to 69% range. I would point out that pricing is back to the normalized trend that we had seen pre-pandemic, which is somewhere between 1 point and 2 points of headwind exactly as we saw kind of pre-pandemic. So, no change from a pricing standpoint. Sami Badri : Thank you, George. Michelle, can we move to the next analyst? Operator : Thank you. Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. You may go ahead. Aaron Rakers : Yeah, thanks for taking the questions. I'll keep two right together here. So, on this AI opportunity and as we kind of focus on the backlog converting into revenue, I'm curious of how you see the AI back-end possibly leading into front-end opportunities. Have you seen that at all with any of these hyperscale customers? Any kind of color on that front would be great. And then kind of sticking to the AI networking theme, I'm curious as we move forward, how you would characterize the competitive positioning of Nvidia in the Ethernet back-end network side. Thank you. Chuck Robbins : Thanks, Aaron. So, on the back-end to front-end topic, which has been pretty popular lately, the way I think about it is that there's meaningful investment today going into the back-end training models as we all know. And then, I think that the enterprise is actually looking at two different things that are going on there. Number one, they're updating their infrastructure to prepare for AI, and then they're preparing for pervasive deployment of AI applications. And I think that what that will do in my opinion is that will then subsequently drive a lot of the front-end capacity need because those customers will be leveraging both the back-end and the front-end capacity of the cloud infrastructure to actually deliver their own AI apps. And so, I think we're continuing to see investment in the front-end. Customers continue to make those decisions where they want to run workloads in the cloud. They haven't stopped moving workloads to the cloud. So, we still see that happening. And -- but I do think that enterprise AI pervasive deployment will be the most meaningful driver of the increased capacity demand on the front-end networks. When you look at the competitive positioning of Nvidia, I think, look, we live in a world where we have great customers, great partners that we also compete with. There are several examples that are out there. Nvidia, we have partnered with meaningfully. I talked about it earlier with the products that we built that includes their technology, not only GPUs, but in some cases, their software layer. But obviously, with Spectrum-X, there are areas where we're going to compete. And I think that, look, we got 40 years of building a highly-featured ethernet and a lot of experience with our customers using it. We're seeing the success in the back-end networks. I think the other thing that many of our largest customers also want is vendor diversity. And so, I think all of those things combined with our own silicon and our ability to bring our own intellectual property up and down the entire stack puts us in a pretty good position competitively. Sami Badri : Thank you, Aaron. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst. Operator : Thank you. Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. You may go ahead. Karl Ackerman : Yes, thank you. I have two as well, if I may. Scott, I want to focus first on the January quarter outlook, which implies that OpEx is down about $90 million. I think mostly -- most of the roughly 10% workforce realignment this calendar year has been completed. And so, I was hoping you could address which areas of your business do you believe you need to accelerate investment to drive growth into '25 and '26 versus having some excess cost savings passed on profitability. And I have a follow-up. Chuck Robbins : Good. Do you want to go ahead and ask your follow-up now, Karl? Karl Ackerman : Sure. Yeah. In terms of follow-up, just you spoke about four cloud hyperscalers growing orders triple-digits, which is quite amazing and great. But I guess, are these product orders all four top of rack switches, or is the growth in AI networking hardware primarily driven by one hyperscaler today, which now appears to be across silicon and switches? Thank you. Scott Herren : Yeah, I'll start with the OpEx, and then Chuck, let you talk about the cloud partners that are growing triple-digits. On the OpEx, there is growth. Of course, you got to remember, Q2 of this year will compare to Q2 of last year when we did not have Splunk as part of the company. We closed Splunk in the middle of our Q3. So, a lot of what you see driving the year-on-year growth rate in OpEx is simply the addition of Splunk. We talked about when we did the restructuring that it was not necessarily about driving cost savings. There are some cost savings coming out of it, but that was not the motivating factor. It was more about finding efficiencies across the company and turning around and reinvesting those in the fastest growing parts of our business, namely AI and security, and you see some of the great results coming out of that. So, think about those as the two areas we're investing, but the year-on-year growth rate and OpEx being driven mostly by the addition of Splunk. Chuck Robbins : And then, on your second question, Karl, I think we are pleased that four out of the six largest were all in excess of 100% growth year-over-year. And I would say that it was not just one customer on the AI infrastructure front, it was pretty balanced across all of them. So, we'll continue to keep plugging away, but it was pretty balanced, and we're pretty happy with the distributed nature of the business in that segment. Sami Badri : All right. Thank you, Karl. I'm going to hand it over to Chuck for some closing remarks. Chuck Robbins : Yeah, I just want to thank everybody again for joining us. And I want to particularly thank the Cisco teams for the innovation that our teams are delivering as well as the strong execution that we've seen in the first quarter of this year really got us off to a strong start. I think that as we talk about this whole AI transformation that's happening, I think, again, there are three big areas that we're focused on. Number one is the infrastructure required in the back-end networks to help our customers continue to build these training models. I think the second is, we look at the enterprise space. And again, we see upgrades and refresh opportunities for customers who are preparing for AI, and then we see the ability to work with them in their data centers with this simplistic deployment of AI applications that we're going to enable. And then, the final area is continuing to work with the cloud providers and the enterprise customers on private data center and the front-end requirements that we see happening in the cloud side to support this AI transition as well. We think that the breadth of our portfolio gives us a great opportunity. We also think that our continued momentum in security, notwithstanding what happened in U.S. federal this quarter, gives us a high degree of confidence. And we look forward to talking to all of you again next quarter. Thank you.
